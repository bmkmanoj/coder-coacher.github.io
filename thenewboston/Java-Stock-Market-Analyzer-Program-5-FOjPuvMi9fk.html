welcome to your fifth lesson and how to
build a Java stock market analyzer
program and in the last tutorial we
converted that CSV file to an array but
sometimes we just want to visually see
the array to confirm that we actually
created it so let's go ahead and make a
little method and this isn't going to be
a method that we're going to be using in
the actual final program this is just a
method to print out a multi-dimensional
array to make sure we didn't mess it up
anyways if it prints out something weird
then we know that we have to go back and
correct it but I'm pretty much just
gonna be making a method to print out
the array that we just made just so we
can look at it visually and make sure we
didn't mess up anything so let's go
ahead and a little comment above the
method print out items array because
that array was named items not print art
items are ready come on huh you can do
better than that
so now let's go ahead and what do we
wanted to do let's make this public void
because it's not going to return
anything you're just gonna print out a
bunch of crap print public void print
array because of Princeton or right in
that way I know what it does good and
now let's go ahead in in essence we're
gonna be building two for loops one of
the for loops is gonna loop through the
rows and one of them is gonna loop
through the columns that way we loop
through the entire entire
multi-dimensional array so we first need
to build a for loop to loop through the
rows so I'm gonna name my rows X set it
equal to 0 and put X is less than items
which is our array name dot length and
this is a cool thing that you can do you
can put dot length at the end of any
array to automatically get the length of
that array so that way it automatically
knows when to stop and of course we want
to increment that by 1 each time so we
get every row so this pretty much loops
through 20 times so now let's just go
ahead and have a little system out print
F
let's just give us a little prompt to
put like percent s space and X so this
is pretty much gonna go through 0
through 19 which is 20 times just uh you
know just a nice little visual actually
might want to add a minus sign right
there too so you know this is gonna be a
nice-looking method right here so now
that we loop through the rows we want to
loop through the columns in essence
we're looping through this right now and
now we want to loop through vertically
so now let's just go ahead and do that
for int y equals 0 Y is columns by the
way in how much should we want to go you
can put 7 or excuse me 6 in here but
let's go Y is less than items of X dot
length and what this pretty much means
is if I spell it right well let me
finish this y plus plus this is pretty
much gonna get the length of each row
and it's going to loop through every
element in that row so first we loop
through the rows and then we figure out
how long that row is and loop through
every element in that rope so this is
you know this is a pretty awesome
program right here so now let's go ahead
and print out the element we get so
system.out.print F and let's go ahead
and how do we print out the element well
first we need to format it and this is C
style printf if you're if you're curious
from the C language I think this was a
first adopted items X Y and let's go
ahead and put system out
print line to print so and make sure
that this is outside your for loop your
column loop but inside your row loop so
every any time you get to the end of a
row you're gonna print a new line and
again what we need to do in our main
method first we need to convert it to
array we can't just call print array
when we don't even have an array yet so
we need to call convert to array and
that changes your CSV file to array now
you can put pause that method called
print right there we are right there and
now we can go ahead and print that array
so if you run this BAM look at this we
get this entire array print it out for
us 0 to 19 so 0 to 19 that's 20 rows and
if you see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 what this
pretty much did is made this well look
at this 0 1 2 3 or 5 619 and then it
gave us seven things print out and let
me walk through my method again tell you
guys why this did it there we go printer
a what this pretty much did is loop
through all of your rows and
automatically got that 20 using items
length a new Java knows how long each
array is using this a length method
that's built-in and then it said all
right at the beginning of each row print
out that row number so that's why it
printed this 0 1 2 3 at the beginning of
each row and after that what we did is
loop through the row itself loop through
one entire row in set and pretty much
printed out the column or that piece of
data
so pretty much printed out 0 0 0 1 0 2 0
3 and then on next one it print out 1 0
1 1 1 2 1 3 and it did that for the
entire array so when we loop through the
arrays when we loop through the rows it
change the value of x when you remove
through the
it's changed a value of Hawaii so that's
why we were able to print out this
entire array and again once it got to
the end right here I just printed a new
line and that's why I moved to the new
line down here so just study this and
pretty much if you just look at it for
about five seconds without me talking
you can figure out that this is a cool
way to print through or excuse me to
print a multi-dimensional array and
using this items that lengths and items
of Excel link which pretty much means
the row length and how many columns are
in it depending this pretty much lets
you loop through any multi-dimensional
array so that's why I didn't use like 20
and 7 or 19 and 6 whatever it would be
so that's it for this tutorial
um actually I'm gonna be building one
more method real quick so let's go ahead
and do that let's just go ahead and
build one more method to return the
array so public string this means it's
going to return an array and I'm just
name and get array and this is pretty
much this since a return items so now
whenever we call this method we get the
array of items in this is just for
return array items this is just so we
don't have pretty much so we can pass
this array into another method easily
without having to pass this entire array
right here so I almost forgot to do that
but this pretty much gets the array
pretty much returns items in whenever
you're returning a string array this is
what you put instead of like int or
float or something like that so don't
forget to add these two methods right
here and in our next program um I don't
even know where we're going to be doing
probably analyzing this data in the
array but trust me it's going to be
awesome and I know you guys are learning
a ton already so we're gonna be getting
of the good stuff soon so for now I just
want to thank you guys for watching
thank you guys for supporting my channel
and uh I'll see you next tutorial hope
you guys learned little something oh by
