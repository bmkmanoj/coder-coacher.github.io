game that I didn't notice before but you
can just spam the attack button and pop
I was automatically win which is kind of
funny but we don't have to worry about
that for now okay so now that we've done
that let's just go ahead ahead and add
one more thing so come over here to form
one DB and we'll open the designer for
it
and let's add a button so we will just
come over here to our tool box and we'll
add a button and we'll just drag it and
make it the entire length of our form
okay so now I need to go to the
properties and we need this set the text
to let's set it to hide log to begin
with so let's go ahead and hide the log
and for the name will do button hide and
show so let's double click on to hide
log so let's go ahead and create a
boolean so we'll come up here and we'll
type private log shown as boolean
we'll set it equal to true to begin with
okay so we're just use an if statement
so if log shown then what do we want to
do so if it's equal to shown and they
click it we're just going to go ahead
and set button hide and show dot text is
gonna be equal to show log so if it's
shown and they click it it'll be saying
hide and then it'll change it to show
log after hides so what we need to do is
type new log dot hide
Oshin
so now I need to do is we need to create
an else so else
so if vlog shown is equal to false then
we'll type new log
dot show and then button hide and show
dot text is going to be equal to hide
log so let's go ahead and run this
hopefully we won't get errors so you can
see here that our log has been loaded
and since we changed the size of form 1
we get a little air here and this is
actually hidden behind there because we
increased the length of this but we'll
just go ahead and ignore that for now if
we click hide log it hides the log and
it changes the text to show log we can
show the log and looks like we looks
like we need to change the log shown so
after we do that we need to stop
debugging so after we set the text to
show log what we need to do is change
the boolean so long shown equals not log
shown so this way we don't have to know
what log shown is equal to we can just
set it to the opposite of what it
already is so if it's true since it's
true right here it'll be set equal to
false so and then we'll just type log
shown equals not logged so okay
so we'll come back to form or VB design
and you can see that the size of our
form is 356
so let's come back into form of EB and
perform one move instead of 328 we'll do
356
and then when the form loads will do 356
ok so now hopefully we won't have any
errors let's go ahead and run this you
can see that the logger is attached to
the game and we can move it around now
let's go ahead and hide the log you see
that the log disappears and then it will
click show logged the log shows back up
and it gives us the option to hide it
and you can see that the text changes
each time we do this so we can hide and
show the log so then let's go ahead and
cheat some and make pop I win and you
see that Popeye has one pop I got it a
whole bunch of tacks and the dragon only
got one in so we'll go ahead and go
ahead and type in this code if you
already have it and once you've done
that move on to the next tutorial and I
believe the next tutorial will be the
last for the game</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
