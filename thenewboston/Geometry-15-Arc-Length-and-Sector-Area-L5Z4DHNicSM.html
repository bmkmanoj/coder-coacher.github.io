sectors and arcs and we find the length
of an arc using this formula at length
of the arc is equal to a over 180 PI R
so where a is the measure of the arc and
if you remember a central angle an arc
length is the same measure as its
central angle so the length of this is
equal to the measure of this central
angle right here
so what we're finding is refining the
circumference of a portion of an arc so
pretend we have a big pizza when we find
what the arc length is we're finding the
length of a piece of the crust of a
piece of pizza we're just finding the
outside part later when we find when we
talk about area of a sector we're gonna
be talking about finding the whole area
of that slice of pizza so let's do some
examples with length of an arc before we
get into sector length okay so find the
arc length so if you remember our
formula length is equal to a which is
the measure of this angle well it's the
measure of this arc which is also equal
to the measure of this angle so 180 over
180 PI times our radius well if you
remember this is our diameter and D is
equal to 2 times R so if you divide 14
by 2 you get R is equal to 7 so PI times
7 and that cancels to 1 so you get 7 pi
is the length of this arc
now if you look that's the same thing as
us finding one half of the circumference
of a circle so if we were to find the
circumference we would do 2 PI R but
since we're doing it only have half a
circle it would be 1/2 PI R I'm sorry it
wouldn't be 1/2 you divide 2 by 2 and
you'd get 1 and if you were to plug it
in that way you would also get 7 pi so
we have another example for this one
we're finding the length of this arc so
using our knowledge of circles we know
that a full circle equals 160 degrees so
if we want to find what the length of
this arc is we're just gonna minus 45
and we get 315 so now we do L is equal
to 315 over 180 times pi times our
radius so this is where I'm gonna use
the help of a calculator to make sure I
get pretty exact answers so I'm gonna do
315 divided by 180 times 6 pi and if you
put that in the calculator you get
approximately 32 point nine eight seven
but if you wanted to give it a more
exact answer you could do 315 divided by
180 times six and then write it as L is
equal to ten point five PI that's more
exact so now we're going to talk about
sector area so it's exos when we find
sector area we're finding the area of
this region so to do that we have area
equals a which once again is just the
measure of the
is angle or this arc over 360 PI R
squared because if you remember high R
squared is the formula for area and when
we only want part of the area of a
circle we put this out front to tell us
how much of it we're gonna get so a is
the measure of the arc and if you
remember a central angle has a measure
of a so let's do some examples now find
sector area so we're finding the area of
this whole circle so there's 360 degrees
in a circle so 360 over 360 times PI R
squared that cancels to 1 and you just
get 25 pi for your answer which is the
same thing is if we've just used the
plain old area formula which is PI R
squared we'd still get 5 squared times
pi which is 25 pi because that's what
we're doing we're finding a portion of
the area so like I said pretend this was
a pizza and you had this slice right
here
when we find arc length we find the
length of this crust right here
when we find sector area we find the
area of the pizza of the piece of pizza
like how much pizza is that out of the
whole circle okay so we have one more
problem that we're gonna do so we're
finding it of this arc so a is equal to
200 over 360 radius squared times pi so
I'm gonna type this into the calculator
200 divided by 360 times 12 squared so I
get
a is equal to 80 pi and I'm gonna leave
it like that because that's more exact
so oh but we forgot to use unit so this
would be inches squared because whenever
we find the area it's inches its units
squared and this is centimeters squared
so that's all we're doing with sector
area and arc length today but make sure
you come back and watch the next lesson
where we're going to talk about how to
find the lengths of certain kinds of
segments like tangents and secant of a
circle so make sure you come and check
that out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
