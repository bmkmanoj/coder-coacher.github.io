video I'm going to show you how to work
with check boxes and our starting point
is just a blank button so what we'll say
is we're going to make an application
where we are opening a sub shop and/or
actually did you know that some people
call subs like hoagies um you know from
Subway some people call them hoagies and
uh what a I heard people call them
something else really weird I can't
think you're very right now if you know
leave me a comment and uh but yeah we're
going to open up a hoagie or a sub shop
and we're going to have a bunch of
different options what do you want on
yourself turkey ham lettuce tomato so
what we're going to do is we're going to
have some check boxes these is going to
check all the stuff that they want and
then they're going to hit like click me
or order let me change that to order now
not in order now order now all right so
that's our starting point let's go ahead
and make some check boxes alright so it
comes from the class check box so make
sure that you have this imported and
I'll just call the first one box one
actually I only have two options but it
the technique is the same whether you
have one option or one hundred so set
this equal to a new check box and you
can set well 99% of time you also want
to include a label and this is the text
that appears to the right of the check
box and you always want to have this so
the user actually knows what the heck
they're trying to check the reason that
you might not have this is I know maybe
you're making your own custom like grid
layout and you're going to have the
labels on you know like on the left hand
side or whatever but anyways that is how
you make a check box so let me just copy
this and I'll make another one right
under it named uh this one can be for
tuna so again these subs are pretty
boring you can get either bacon or tune
on your sub and you can also have both
if you want but anyway since we're using
a vertical layout then these are going
pier right under each other so whenever
I add them to the screen I'm going to
add box 1 then box 2 and then the button
so again this is what we got going on so
far have two check boxes bacon tuna so
the user can select whatever they want
and hit order now and then it will
eventually submit their order now
another thing I want to point out is
this you see how by default
nothing was checked if you want to have
one of these boxes checked by default
maybe you all are like selling pizzas
and you always want to have cheese
checked by default then what you can do
is this you can say something like box 2
which would be tuna you can say set
selected true and this is just going to
go ahead and check it by default again
the user can still uncheck it if they
want but whenever your app launches is
you're going to have a low check box by
default all right so they check whatever
they want on their sub and they hit
order now and nothing happens so how do
we you know actually check what check
boxes are checked what options are you
know on what toppings disease or want on
there so well what we need to do is
under this button actually let me change
this to Lucky's subs say Bucky's meat
subs that could be the name of your
restaurant just meat what does someone
called a sub restaurant and you're like
what would you like on your something
they just like do you guys have any meat
uh yeah
okay I'll just have a meat so please
that's stupid what am I talking about
oh it's it's a burial all right meat so
meats up do I come up with this stuff
all right so button what do we want to
occur whenever the user clicks this
button well let's just go ahead and make
a method called handle options now
inside here we're going to toss in box 1
in box 2 and in the method we'll just
say arm whatever options they selected
weird
print out on the screen so private void
we don't really need to return anything
since we're just printing out in the
terminal and it was called handle
options we had a comment handle checkbox
options alright so again it takes two
parameters depending on how many check
boxes you have checkbox I'll just keep
the same names box one check box box two
so we're passing in both of those check
boxes in here and for the message that
we're going to print out on the screen I
just call it string message all right
got my semicolon all right so how do we
check if a check box is selected or not
it is incredibly simple all we do is we
get a reference to whatever check box we
want to check and we call the method is
selected now this is going to return
true if it's checked and it's going to
return false if it's not checked so now
we can say if it is selected we'll just
add something to the message so the
first one was bacon and would you say oh
no which is right bacon and we'll just
feel like users order right here so we
know what's going on
and which will pop a new line on that
art so now we can just do the same thing
with checkbox too and we'll say if box
two is selected then add-on tuna to that
message as well all right - now system
outs massage all right
so now of course whenever you run this
what's going to happen whenever we click
order now both of these checkboxes are
going to get passed in and whenever the
user does have something selected for
example let me just order a tuna sub
it's going to say users order order tuna
now they can of course check both of
them your users order bacon tuna and if
I clean this up a little bit just add
some new lines and make it look a little
bit prettier all right so as expected
they can order tuna bacon and tuna just
bacon and they can actually place the
order for nothing since we didn't check
for that but you guys can figure out how
to do that really easily so anyways that
is how you create checkboxes how to give
them default values whether they're
checked or not checked and also how to
extract whatever options they check from
them so yeah simple as that thing guys
for watching if you want any of this
then I'll stick it on my github page for
you guys and well see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
