blending mode tutorial in Photoshop cs6
now what we're gonna do in this part of
the tutorial is go through the lighting
group of our blending modes which is the
lighting screen color dodge linear dodge
and layer color and I'll tell you about
each one of the blending modes and if we
have time I'll get another set of to
talk or another set of blending modes
and I'll do that in this tutorial also
so the light in blending mode which is
the first one here is pretty much the
opposite of the darken blending mode so
what's gonna happen is that the really
dark dark stuff is not going to show up
in the top layer but the really bright
stuff is so if I turn off the top layer
role all right if I turn off the bottom
liner real quick and I change the
blending mode real quick back to normal
we remember that the left side of the
gradient is black and we're gonna
suspect that the black is going to just
disappear when I put it on line and that
the white the pure white here is going
to shine right through and then the
really bright parts of the green and
really bright parts of the yellow that
are brighter than the picture below it
are also going to come through so let me
put this back on light in and what and
then you can see that that is true so
we've got the black part of the gradient
is completely gone in the white part is
showing and this is going to be constant
throughout the lighting group so in the
Lincoln blending mode the the layers the
pixels of the layer replaced with the
lighter
whichever is a lighter so as I said
before pretty much the brightest brights
which is the brightest white is always
going to show through when you have
lighting on now let's come over to the
next blending mode which is screen and
here it is now screen is like lighten
but it's brighter and it removes more of
the dark pixels something about screen
is that it also has some smoother
transitions between the colors so it
kind of works like the multiply blending
mode which I talked about in the
previous tutorial and the fact that it
multiplies the light pixels together to
create to bring out like the most light
pixels in the wood the two layers
combined so hopefully hopefully that
made sense the next one we're gonna go
to is color dodge now color dodge is
brighter than the screen blending mode
and it's a contrasting color and it
results in like saturated mid-tones and
blown out highlights so that's what the
color dodge is for now let's go to
linear dodge add now linear dodge add is
pretty sweet sometime it's brighter than
color dodge but less saturated and
intense so this also kind of gives me
this vintage kind of look if you use the
right colors if you don't like to use
white in it but you use the colors it
kind of gives out like a washed out kind
of look that is kind of classic in some
of those washed out vintage pictures the
next one that we're gonna go over is the
last part and that is called lighter
color lighter color lightens the
composite channel instead of the
separate red green and blue channels so
if you find out a use for that this
one's kind of funny though it looks like
he's got a mask on a booger at his nose
and one booger in his mouth it's kind of
weird but I don't know that's fun
looking but that's a lighter color for
us so that's it for the lighten blending
modes and we're pretty much at five
minutes already so I'll just end this
tutorial and then we can go on to the
next set of blending modes down here in
the next tutorial so thanks for watching
this one and subscribe if you want to
see more tutorials in Photoshop it helps
us out a lot thanks a lot have a good
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
