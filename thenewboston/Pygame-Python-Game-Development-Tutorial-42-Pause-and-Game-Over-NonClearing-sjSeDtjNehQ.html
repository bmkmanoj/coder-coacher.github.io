42nd Pegeen tutorial video in this video
what we're going to be doing is we're
going to make a pause screen that
doesn't necessarily clean the screens
before it so you can see where your
snake is during the pause and then as
well as doing that we're also going to
modify the GAMEOVER screen and probably
the game over screen modification is
more important than the pause screen
modification because when you pause the
game sometimes people pause the game to
like let their mind catch up or
something so in some games you want to
want to allow them to pause and like see
where everything is maybe but at least
for game over a lot of people aren't
necessarily totally for sure memorizing
every time they get a point so they
might not have looked at their score
recently or something they get a game
over and they're not really sure like
what their score even was what happened
maybe being that and so on so we're
going to show here how we could write
some logic to handle these situations so
first of all the first thing we're going
to edit is the pause screen so in theory
all we would need to change is we could
just get rid of game display dot fill
white right we could just comment that
out so let's see what happens when we do
that though so welcome press e to play
we're playing we get an apple and we hit
P for pause and it may be really
difficult to see it on my screen but
maybe on yours you'll be able to see it
but these text looks a little funky like
well like the first time through it
looks okay but then it starts to like I
don't know get all grainy or something
and the reason why that's happening is
it's literally just like pasting the
same message over and over however many
frames per second pause was how many was
it it's five frames a second so five of
these messages to the screen are getting
pasted and that's not necessarily what
we intend so what we will do instead is
we can just do the following so before
we get to wow ha
well we called the pause for a specific
reason right we they pressed P so
instead what we could do is we could
just take this all right here and then
do control X to cut it and then come
above the while loop and basically
underneath pause equals true hit paste
and then let's highlight all the way up
to message two screens this is indented
a little bad hold ctrl and opening
brackets to shift it over and that
should be it now what's going to happen
is it will just put this message up to
the screen one time and then it will
just one the event loop only like
basically the listener for an event if
that's all that's going to run so it's
not going to keep throwing up graphics
so let's run that again real quick just
to see what I mean see you to play will
grab an apple P to pause and now you see
how our text is still smooth so again my
screen you might not have been able to
notice it but I think probably if you
did it on yours you saw that it's just
the lines weren't as smooth as just kept
pasting up over and over and over all
the information so anyway that's how we
can fix the pause screen but we still
have a problem of game over it clears
everything so now let's modify the game
over functionality to still show us the
score and the Apple and what happened to
our snake so close out of this we'll hit
OK and now we want to find game over so
we're just going to send the game loop
at least and then so this is wow game
over equals true and then it runs all of
this stuff right and basically what we
would want to do is instead of wild game
over equals true we could first ask a
question uh if game over equals true and
then we could say well we can get rid of
the game display dot fill white and then
we could take this stuff right here
again cut and this time we shouldn't
have to modify anything I don't think
but paste it there and that's really it
so it's quickly just going to run this
this this if statement here and since it
will ring true one time it's just
run it one time and we'll display this
now the problem might well it'll then
just enter this while loop and that
should be totally fun let's go ahead and
run that and make sure that that's not
still pacing but that should cover it so
see to play we'll go ahead and grab an
apple and then boom we're off the screen
and so we see that we can still see our
Apple now and we can still see the score
and all that and it's not like repeating
itself let's go ahead press C that
worked out cool let's do that cue to
quit this time okay so appears that
everything is it's working now and at
this point I think that you know we've
had a few points where we've you know
had a working snake game we've been kind
of happy at this point I'm really not
sure what else we would possibly add to
our little slither game here so I think
now what would be best is to start a new
game and this time make it a slightly
more complex game so snake is pretty
basic we just have some simple commands
for the user to put in and that's about
it there's only one little element here
it's very easy to create event handling
because there's not too much going on
here so what I'd like to do is kind of
step it up a little bit and make a more
intermediate game so snake is a very
basic game so now I'd like to make a
slightly more intermediate game to
continue working on our PI game skills
so with that that's what we're going to
be doing in the next few videos so stay
tuned for that hopefully you guys
enjoyed hopefully you're proud of your
snakey game and stay tuned as the next
video thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
