seats tutorial and in this story I'm
going to be going over a special kind of
loop called a do-while loop now a
do-while loop is different from a while
loop for a couple reasons
first of all because a while loop what
it does is pretty much it has a test
condition and it tests that condition
and as long as it's true it's going to
execute that code but what a do while
loop does is it does a bit of code first
and then it tests that condition and if
the condition is true then it keeps
doing the code but it's false it doesn't
do it at all so in essence it does the
code at least once before doing the rest
of it so let's go ahead and start by
declaring a venom variable encounter
equals one just our basic counter
variable that we've come to known so
well and um the syntax for your do loop
is do that's all you need to put to
begin with and then inside your own body
you need to execute what code you want
to execute so we want to print the code
we're going to execute first is just
print the variable counter so again let
me just type that percent the counter
and after this we want to increment the
counter by one by using our handy little
counter plus plus now after you write to
do sorry it's my whooping cough come
back after your right to do then right
after it this is when you write the
while loop in in your while loop just
like before you need the test condition
so while counter is less than ten so I'm
like before this is going to execute the
code before I even test so if this is
true it's going to go to the test and
then if the test is true it's going to
do it again so let me show you guys how
this works real quick excuse and pile in
a run
and what did I do wrong oops
I spoke counter on Co UN ter execute
compiled under run come on come on
and look this one two three four five
six seven eight nine and if you're
saying all right this is pretty much the
same thing is a while loop well um
you're right in your kind of run in this
case it does the exact same thing but I
want to show you guys the main
difference between a do-while loop say
the counter is 12 which is armed greater
than 10 so if we had just a while loop
of this test condition it wouldn't run
at all but since we have a do-while loop
it's going to do this at least once and
then it's going to check for the the
test right here and it says all right
this test is false so I'm not doing this
anymore
so let's go ahead compile and run this
right here and hopefully I didn't mess
anything else up and as you can see all
it has is the basic 12 on the screen so
it said all right we have a variable of
12 we're going to run this code print
the counter on the screen and we're
going to keep doing this as long as the
counter is the less than 10 but hold on
12 is greater than 10 so all right I did
it once now I'm done again with a while
loop it would wouldn't do it at all and
since the test condition will be false
in a while loop it would just never do
the code so this is a syntax for a do
loop and it's how you execute a piece of
code one time or at least one time
before testing it at all so as you can
see in this tutorial you can't really
see how useful it is but in the things
we're going to be making in my tutorials
in the future it's very very useful so
you need to know the syntax of this and
again I'm going to copy all this code
right here and put it on my website the
new Boston comm so make sure to check
out my website if you want to go get it
