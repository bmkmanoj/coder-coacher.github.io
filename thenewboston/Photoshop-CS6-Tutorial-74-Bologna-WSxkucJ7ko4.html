Blackford here with another Photoshop
cs6 tutorial and in this tutorial we're
going to learn how to use blending modes
and opacity with our adjustment in
layers we're gonna combine the use to
create some stunning results and you can
use those also to more finely tune and
tweak your adjustment layers so all you
need for this tutorial is just to have
an image and to have an adjustment layer
you can use one or three or seventy-five
it's up to you it doesn't matter
I wouldn't recommend 75 because that
might get a little hairy anyways let's
get on with it
so you can use blending modes with your
adjustment layer and the blending modes
are here under this drop down menu it'll
start out saying normal and or you can
click on it and add some of these
blending modes now if you don't know
what the blending modes do I suggest you
watch my tutorial series which is a it's
a four part tutorial series because
there are so many blending modes about
the blending modes and I explain all of
it and it's right here tutorial 56 is a
part one and I go through every single
blending mode and tell you what they do
and show you what they do on top of a
picture alright so check that out if you
don't know what the blending modes do or
just uh experiment if you want to but I
would highly suggest knowing what the
blending modes do so you can become more
efficient with using Photoshop so some
of the best blending modes to use with
adjustment layers and keep in mind that
these blending modes don't work with
every single kind of adjustment layer
but they do help is multiply screen hard
mix difference and exclusion are some of
the like the most dramatic results so
let's go ahead and change this to one of
those so I have the adjustment layer
selected and I'm gonna change the
blending mode of the adjustment layer
and I'm just gonna go to multiply and
you can see what that does and
multiplied it looks like it might have
made this image a little too dark so
what I'm gonna do is come over here to
my opacity I'll just bring that down a
little and you can see it'll lays off
the effect a little bit so here is the
image with the blending mode multiply
opacity at 55% and here's what the
blending mode and the adjustment layer
basically completely off so that's all I
had to do for that pretty cool now you
can do this with your other layers too
so let me turn on this layer here and
then I'll add something like let's check
out what wants like these darkening ones
let's track out darken and see what that
does and you can see it just like I
guess it made it a little warmer because
that's what my photo filter here is
doing so if I double click on the icon I
have a warming filter and it's orange
and that just made this a little darker
so let's try something else overlay made
it really dark and a contrast detail
looks like so let's back off it a little
bit and see if we can get anything that
we like I mean maybe that blending mode
doesn't work very well with this image
now if I go to something like exclusion
or difference here probably gonna look
weird because it's not used correctly
but this is what happens she gets a nice
blue teeth and I mean obviously
exclusion does not work well with this
filled with the adjustment layer that I
have picked so anyways that's how you
use the blending modes and opacity with
your layers to create some nice results
now I would use this kind of stuff if I
don't really want to go into here and
start tweaking everything and all that
stuff again if I want to just have a
quick reference here I don't have to go
into any new menus I can just change my
blending mode or my opacity and be done
with it
so it's quick and fast so and that's
what I'm all about getting stuff done
quickly and fast and making sure that
you do do it right so um if you get
employed by someone and you're quick and
you're fast and you get your stuff done
correctly you're gonna be ahead to the
pack you're gonna be ahead of the people
that only know how to do it like slow
ways so and I always found that really
helpful and it helps you stand out at
your job so another reason to use it
maybe you're on a deadline and you and a
client is once his project due in like
an hour and if you're fumbling around
doing everything slowly at the slow way
and everything like that you might not
make the deadline so just remember how
to do things like this and remember that
Photoshop always has fast or always has
different ways to do things at least two
ways for pretty much everything so I'd
like to thank you guys for watching this
tutorial it's been pretty awesome and in
the next tutorial that I'll be teaching
we're gonna go over using masks with
your adjustment and layers and that's
these white little boxes here you can
create masks with those and that's what
these holds so I look forward to seeing
you guys at that tutorial hopefully it's
pretty cool you guys like it and I'll
see you then have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
