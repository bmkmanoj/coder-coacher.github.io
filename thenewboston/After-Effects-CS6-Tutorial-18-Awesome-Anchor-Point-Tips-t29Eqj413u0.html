the middle of the circle which it
probably isn't right now you go to view
and show rulers now you come up here to
the ruler and you can see it turns into
a double arrow my cursor is a double
arrow drag down and put the put the
arrow guide I mean the ruler guide right
in the middle and you can zoom in with
your middle mouse button or the zoom key
to get more finite tuning we move the
left side over put that right in the
middle well I'm going to zoom out to get
it right in the middle there okay and I
was kind of close and then I can zoom in
and move it right to the center there
now if I go back to my
my comp there you can see you click on
the circle here my anchor point is now
in the center now if I try rotating it
it's going to rotate around the center
and normally you don't want your circle
rotating around but maybe I want my
circle to rotate around maybe another
circle
so let me duplicate this edit edit
duplicate and I have another circle here
let's make it a little smaller and I'll
make it a different color just make it
pink hot pink never dope
so I'm going to put this circle in the
middle let's turn this chainsaw off real
quick this circle in the middle and then
we have this circle here now you know
maybe I want to rotate this circle
around this green circle this pink
circle around the green circle kind of
like a moon around the earth so I would
move turn on my rulers I would bring
these down to match the center using the
anchor point as a guide because I
already know it's in the center this one
needs to move up a little and we're good
there so let's grab the Pan behind tool
move this to the center here and if you
move the anchor point it'll go right
along these guys and it snaps right into
where both of the guides are now let's
rotate this and you can see it rotates
around so that's a good way to make
something maybe orbit or rotate around
something else
so I might as well show you how you can
use an anchor point for scaling I'm
going to turn off this small circle
there let's get rid of these guides
click on this circle and say you want
this circle to grow from the middle or
from from the corner of the composition
and move our anchor point to the corner
select the Pan behind tool with Y put it
down here in the corner let's get it
right in there
close enough and now if I scale from
that it'll eat up from the corner so
this could be a way to make like a
transition or something like that scale
down zero and then it goes down to the
corner and it's gone so those are the
ways to use your anchor point if you're
trying to scale something and it looks
weird when it's scaling or you're trying
to rotate and you're trying to maybe
rotate a wheel and it's wobbly make sure
you adjust the anchor point into the
middle or to wherever else you need it
thank you for watching this tutorial I
still feel the effects of the stacker -
it's only been like what 15 minutes or
so and looks let's go ahead and I'll
make another tutorial right after this
and we'll see how long I can last hope
you guys have a good one see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
