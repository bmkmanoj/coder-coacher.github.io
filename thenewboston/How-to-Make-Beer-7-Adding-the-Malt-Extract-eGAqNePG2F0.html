are gonna come something called grains
now whenever they come with grains you
need to put them in a bag and do
something called steeping the grains
which basically involves putting them in
a bag and dipping them up and down in
your water until all the crap gets out
however this kit does it is a very
simple kit it comes with malt extract
instead and actually some kids come with
malt extract and grains some kids
actually have really weird ingredients
but anyways I just want to mention that
if you guys have a kit that involves
steeping the grains then I'm not gonna
be steeping any grains in this tutorial
because I don't need to for this recipe
I'm gonna be going over you know more in
depth about steeping grains later but
for now let me show you guys how to
prepare the malt extract now your malt
extract has the consistency of syrup
it's very thick and it's very hard to
pour and eventually we're gonna be
pouring this into the water that's
boiling but for right now what we want
to do is we want to prepare it so it
pours a little bit faster so in order to
do this just go ahead and make a warm
water bath now you can just go ahead and
plug your sink and fill it up with warm
water but I don't have the plugs for
this so what I'm gonna do is I'm just
gonna take a pot that's bigger and fill
this up with warm water and then I can
just go ahead and set my mo extract in
here and where it warms up is just a
little bit smoother thinner and easier
to pour
so now just go ahead and set that in the
water and even when you pour it now
after it's been sitting in this warm
water bath it's still going to be kind
of thick because it is syrup you can't
change the consistency that much but it
is gonna be a lot easier to pour so now
just go ahead and let that sit and now
we just have to wait for the water to
boil all right so now our water is
boiling what we want to do now is turn
off the heat you can either move it to a
different burner or just turn your heat
off and you're gonna want to pour the
extract in slowly and it's helpful if
you have two people then one can pour
and one can stir and you want to make
sure to stir because if you just pour it
in and let it sit for a little bit it
can sink to the bottom and it can also
burn once it sits on the bottom because
the bottom of this is really hot so
again like I said you want to have one
person stirring once your extract is
fully dissolved in the water you're
going to want to go ahead and bring it
up to a boil again now once you add
extract to the water the solution is now
called a wart it's kind of like the
early stages of beer without a lot of
taste indefinitely without any alcohol
in it yet so from now on whenever I say
warts wo RT this is what I'm talking
about now as soon as this starts boiling
we want to go ahead and set a timer so
from the point starts boiling again we
want to boil this entire solution for
sixty minutes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
