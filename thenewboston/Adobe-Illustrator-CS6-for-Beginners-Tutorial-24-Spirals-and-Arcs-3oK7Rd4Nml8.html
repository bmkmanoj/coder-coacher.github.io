awesome Illustrator cs6 tutorial today
we're going to learn how to create arcs
and we're going to learn how to create
spirals the Arkin spiral tools make it
easy to create unique and interesting
shapes and you can manipulate these to
create different shapes basic are based
upon what you need to and you can use
other tools to help Milne if you like
these as well and I'll show you that so
an arc which is over here where the line
segment tool will be there's the arc
tool and you can see there's a spiral
tool so let's click on the arc tool and
an art consists of an X and a Y access
length so on the x-axis and on the
y-axis so X is left to right and Y is up
and down and the the arc can be either
opened or closed and it has a slope and
all this stuff I'll go over and most of
them are and the options are in the tool
options so first off let's just draw a
freehand at arc so you're gonna click
and this is going to be your starting
point and then you're gonna move your
line and you can see that the second
point is where your mouse is on the
second part and you can go up or down or
whatever so that's how the arc works
then you can't manipulate it with the
tool right now but we can fix it up
later on if we want to move the points
around so just go ahead and click and if
you if you're clicking and you hold down
shift it's going to create a
proportional arc here and you can see
that that's snapping around to whatever
I'm moving around to alright now if we
click just like with all the other shape
kind of tools if we click we've get our
arc segment tool options we can adjust
the length on the x-axis and then our
length on the y-axis and when they're
the same that's going to be poor
personal and if I want them to be
disproportionate then I'll just alter
one of these accesses so we'll just go
with a hundred for each of these and
then we've got open or closed now these
lines here are open so let's go ahead
with a close so we can see what it looks
like and our base along now I'll go
through both of these so you can see
what they mean so they won't be it won't
be too bad and then we've got our slope
do we want a convex slope or do we want
to come cave slope so let's start out
with convex and we'll go around 50 and
we'll hit okay and now you can see that
our arc has been closed off by lines
here and we've got like something that
is resembling a slice of a pie or a pie
chart so let's go ahead and make
something else and let's do bass along
y-axis and we'll hit okay so you can see
the difference so the only thing we
changed this time with space along
y-axis and you can see how it's been
flipped and now the bass is along the
y-axis now let's go ahead and do another
one over here we'll go back to the
x-axis and we're gonna change the slope
to concave and we'll go negative 50 and
you can see the difference okay
and you can see now that the arc is
actually actually inside which is
concave instead of going out so that's
the difference there and you can see how
you can make cool different things like
this could be like a little hang glider
that you're trying to make let's go
ahead and check out one more thing I
wanted to show you so I'm gonna select a
fill color up here so we can fill our
object and if we click on fill arc let's
go ahead and make this concave again so
we get more fill area and hit OK you can
you know that the inside has been filled
up and that means you had to select a
fill color from this button here the
right right next to it is the stroke and
that's how you add some color into there
well it's one way that you can add color
alright so the next thing let's work on
is spirals the spirals are right in the
same section as the arc tool we'll go to
the spiral tool and you can go ahead and
click and drag and create yourself a
spiral that's cool and if you hold shift
and click and drag you'll get like a
proportionate spiral as you can see it
snaps around to where you want it to be
alright the cool part is when we start
clicking on the spiral and when we click
and then we can start editing the spiral
so let's go ahead and click and we've
got a radius we've got a decay we've got
segments and style now the radius is
gonna be how wide it is from the center
the decay is how much of how long it
goes until it doesn't really become a
spiral anymore or the amount pretty much
well the actual definition is the amount
each whined it decreases and then our
segments are how many points are in
there so if you look at this one over
here on the right you can see all the
different points that are in it and
there's ten points altogether so we'll
go ahead and mess with these so I'm just
going to hit OK for now and this is what
the default spiral looks like we'll go
ahead and then this time we're gonna
decrease the decay and we'll make it 50
I'll hit OK and now you can see what's
going on here we got one two three four
five six seven only seven points in
there now let's go to the next thing
we'll put our decay back up to eighty
and we'll this time we'll decrease the
segments to something like five in it
okay and you can see there's less of a
spiral going on so that's what happens
when you decrease the segments now I'll
go ahead and decrease the decay and
segments and this is what we get
since there was not much different since
there's only five segments or seven
segments in here while we did this one
that's how much there's gonna be in when
we made this one so there's not going to
be much of a difference there is a
little bit you get a little extra
curving going on here but if you
increase it that if you decrease the
decay too much you're going to start
losing points and that was one of the
points I wanted to bring up and now we
just got which way you want the spiral
to go if I just click this you can see
that our spiral is now upside down
instead of what we had before so now you
can see if you start combining these
spirals maybe you can make some cool
look in objects there we go and you can
just start messing around with things
and making making some cool-looking
ornate objects with spirals and that's
pretty much I guess I wanted to show you
about the spirals yeah I can't think of
anything more that I wanted to go over
and if you wanted to learn about more
about the options up here be sure to
check out the line-segment tutorial
where I go over that over these a little
bit more they're not hard to figure out
you can probably figure them out on your
own but go ahead if you need to check
them out so thanks a lot for watching

future projects that you're going to be
working on in Illustrator and have a
good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
