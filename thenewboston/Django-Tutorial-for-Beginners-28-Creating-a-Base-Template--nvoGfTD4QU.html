navigation bar at the top of our webpage
looking good and guys before we continue
I know what you are thinking already all
right
so pretty much every single webpage that
we make for this website is going to
have this navigation bar so what I'm
going to do for every single template
that I make I'm going to have to go and
then copy this and let me just go ahead
and copy that right there and then oh
let's put it another page all right so
now if I go to this one then this has
the navigation bar too
all right you know both of them are
looking good and crap now we got to do
another template copy this code plop it
in copy this code pop it in well then
our teacher our boss comes to us in is
like hey Bucky you need another button
on here how hurry so I'm going to have
to go in every single template and add a
button one by one no no guys whenever we
set it up this way we're breaking the
number one rule of software design that
rule is never repeat yourself if ever
you're making a website or a piece of
software and you find yourself having
the same code or doing the same thing
over and over and over again then you're
doing something wrong so instead of
having the same code in every single
template let's go ahead and think about
this the way we want to set up our site
is we're basically going to have it
where every basic structure is identical
in other words we have the same
background we have the navigation bar
this never changes no matter what page
you're on
and the basic styling as well so
wouldn't it be awesome if we could kind
of make a generic blueprint to say okay
we're going to have this generic
blueprint and then this is the only
section that we need to change and that
way if we just have it in one location
we just have to you know add another
button or maybe change the background
color of this and updates on every
single page that would be fantastic
so let's go ahead and set it up that way
so instead of having this on every
single template what we're going to do
is we're going to right click here and
we're going to make a new
HTML file called base HTML so this is
basically going to be our generic
blueprint and it's already set up for us
and again this is just a regular HTML
file so what parts do we want the same
on every page well this this of course
it needs a heading the title I'm going
to have viber
and of course we need these on every
single page so again in base the HTML
just go ahead and plop in whatever
you're going to need on every single
page for your website all right so we
need all of those includes on every
single page now what else well we know
that every single page is also going to
have this same navigation bar at the top
so I'm going to go ahead and copy this
so you can go ahead and cut it and it's
going to go right inside the body
so let me plop it right in there all
right so there we go and let me make
sure it's deleted from everywhere all
right so this is the basic structure of
every single page so we have all of our
imports or includes and then we have our
navigation bar but we also need a way to
include other stuff in the body right
under the navigation bar so how do we
define that in our base template well
what we do is we actually make kind of a
variable and you can name it anything
you want but it's called a block so what
you write is block in other words after
this we're going to include a block of
code what it is well it might change but
that's basically what we're going to do
and I'm just going to name this body but
again you can name this block anything
you want and then you just need to write
end block and block so what we're saying
right here is later on we're going to
include a block of code and this is
where it starts and this is where and so
basically just plop it right in there
and you guys are going to see why it has
a starting and ending spot later on
that is how you do it so now let's
actually go ahead in one of our views in
use this template so the first thing we
need to do is actually include or say
hey Django we are using this template
and this is what we're going to want to
appear in that block section so how do
we do that well in order to include a
template it's called extends so we are
going to include music slash bass HTML
so in other words what we did is we just
pretty much took all of this and plopped
it right in there now another piece of
the puzzle we need to fill in is now
it's asking okay so you said that
something was going here and block body
um what do you want me to put right
there well all you have to do is this
whatever chunk of code which is
essentially all this that we want to put
right here we just surround it with the
same exact tags so this is alright so
just maybe if I invent it it'll be a
little bit easier alright copy this and
boom roasted so all we're doing is we're
replacing this with this pretty cool way
and if we want to do it with our details
page and let me indent that later intent
that and copy this because I'm lazy and
I don't feel like typing it alright so
there you go and check it out refresh
and we should see no differences but let
me go ahead and change something real
quick just so I can prove to you guys
that it did work if I change the logo to
Bucky look what happens refresh it and
on our main index page this change the
Bucky and now when we go to a new page
this changed to Bucky as well so it's a
lot easier whenever you have to update
your overall theme or template just to
do it in one location using a base theme
we change it back to viber and another
thing I want to point out is this so you
see on our home page we have the title
viber right here and then when we go to
this the title is also viber now it's
not really good to have the same title
on every single page so let's go ahead
and fix that in our base and crab see
what we did is we included this title as
part of the base theme so crap I guess
we're going to have the same title on
every page
well again any time you want to change
part of this base theme then what you
can do is you can include these blocks
so let me just go ahead and make a new
block around this title and I'll just
name it title and surround it with n
block all right now let's say that we
wanted to change the title on this
details page again just right after here
I'll write a like song details or either
song or it's actually album details so
there you go so now check it out if we
go back to our home page the title is
viber and now if we go to another page
we can override that title by writing
whatever we want so if you don't write
anything then it's just going to keep
whatever is in the block by default so
let's say for the index page we actually
did want it to say viber for the title
then that's fine but on the details page
we're like alright actually overwrite
that so including these blocks is
actually optional if you want to
overwrite the base template but now we
have a much better cleaner layout and
again any time you want pieces that you
want to include or overwrite just go
ahead and throw blocks in there and
there's a lot more to cover concerning
templates but for right now I think that
we're doing our a so thanks for watching
don't forget to subscribe I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
