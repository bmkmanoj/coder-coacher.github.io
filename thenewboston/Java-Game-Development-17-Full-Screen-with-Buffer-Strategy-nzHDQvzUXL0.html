17th tutorial in Java game development
and in this story we're going to be
making a frame making it fullscreen but
we're going to be doing a little teeny
bit different than last time because
this time we're going to be needing to
create a buffer strategy and if you
forgot from like tutorial 14 or
something this is a thing that takes
away flickering so this is a pretty
important so let's go ahead and make a
little comment right now and say make
frame full-screen because in essence
that's all this going to do so public
void and just name it set full screen
look good and of course it's going to
take display mode diem as a parameter
and now let's build the body of this
baby both the body this baby how like
how they just rolled off my tongue so
let's go ahead and make a J frame F
equal new jframe and let's go ahead and
set that frame undecorated and set it to
true and this means it doesn't have
title bars or scroll bars or nothing
like that and what else do we want to do
and set ignore repaint true and F set
resizable false so they can't resize it
and let's see oh another thing we need
to do is pretty important in order to
make it full serene get access to the
video card set full screen window and as
primer parameter is take so what do you
want to set full screen well that frame
would just made so set the frame full
screen and what this does right here is
take that frame which is pretty much
just like a low window on your computer
and it makes it full screen on your
entire monitor pretty awesome huh now
let's go ahead and write a simple if
statement to check like last time
if display mode excuse me display mode
not equal to null
and video card dot is display change is
supported pretty much if you can wear
that look Hector that come from there we
go
if display change is supported this
pretty much means can you change your
display mode what do you want to do we
want to try to take that video card and
set display mode equal to DM I already
filled it in for us and if you can't do
that then we just need to catch an error
exception e X looks good
so now outside your if block one last
thing you want to do for this method is
you need to create that buffered
strategy and I told you what it was and
it sounded pretty confusing how to do
all this but now what you can do is take
that arm frame that we made and create
buffer strategy and the number of
buffers is two and with two buffers if
you remember we can do the page flipping
one so instead of just having one buffer
to drop screen and copy it on our window
we can have two pretty much separate
pieces of panels to draw off screen and
then we can just draw one point to it
and that's what shows up on our screen
then when the other one is already have
that one show up at our screen and the
step of writing all that code but what
buffer want to show up on our screen the
only thing we need to do is throw in a
couple methods and this is one of them
so this creates your buffer strategy and
it when to it means there are two
different buffers to show up well not to
show up two different buffers outside
your monitor that we're going to be
using and well that's it for this method
really so now aside from this method
what we need to do is we need to get
graphics to display and in essence later
on in another class we're going to take
that graphics object which is G and
we're going to set it equal to something
but what we're going to set it equal to
is kind of dependent on where we're
going to be writing now so let's go
ahead and May
we will set graphics object equal to
this and by this I don't mean the
keyword this I mean whatever this method
returns that's where we're going to be
setting that graphics object equal to so
public graphics 2d need that deed to be
capitalized since it's going to return a
graphics 2d object since we need to set
it equal to it and just name it get the
graphics easy enough
I like the hiccups or something it's
annoying so get graphics BAM so let's go
ahead and get that window W window
equals VC get full screen window and
what this does is if I type that
correctly it stores your entire thing
that's on your full screen into the
object or variable W how awesome so now
we can do things like test things on W
so if W is not equal to null so if
actually you have something you're
looking at what do we want to do we need
to get buffer let make sure type this
right buffer strategy type that right
yep s and set it equal to W get buffer
strategy and what this does is now that
we have that window and we know it's not
equal or excuse me we know it has some
kind of information in it we set this
object buffer strategy equal to the get
buffer strategy in that and this will
make sense when I explain it later on
but in essence what we want to do is now
that we have that s set to something we
can return that object so return and of
course if this isn't graphics to the
object already we want to convert it to
one graphics 2d s
get draw graphics so now once we return
this and hopefully return this instead
of let's just go ahead and make else
return null in case things go wrong so
now what we're going to do is have that
G and we're going to set it equal to
graphics to D so now that G is going to
be graphics 2d object so now we can call
graphics 2d methods on it in of course s
get draw graphics so that's pretty much
all is all it's doing for right now and
let's see what other methods we have to
make update and we're actually going to
be doing an update method which pretty
much uploads updates the display and
next tutorial but for right now um what
did we go over set full screen to change
both should change our window to full
screen and we also made our return gate
graphics so we can have something set
our graphics object equal to so for now
thank you guys for watching and I'll
explain this later
once our whole entire program is built
it'll make perfect sense you but for now
it's probably confusing we just need to
get these method built and out of the
way so thank you guys for watching
in the next tutorial we're going to be
building an update and some other cool
neat little methods so thank you don't
forget subscribe it I'll see you next
