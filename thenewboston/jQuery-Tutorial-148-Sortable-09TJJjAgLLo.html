guess this is just an aesthetic choice
but it makes it perhaps look a bit
better when you've when you're actually
dragging something and something is
applied to the drag so when we're
dragging something we know which item
we're dragging okay so that's it for the
options for now what we're going to do
now is create another list and actually
connect this list with it so let's go
ahead and copy this unordered list and
come down and paste it just in here and
I'm just going to call this places
instead of names and I'm going to type
the names of a few places okay so now
that we've got this list let's just go
ahead and look at that in our browser
you can see that we've got a list here
and we're not unable to sort it
obviously because we haven't allowed it
to be sorted however this list is still
available to be sorted now what we can
actually do is inside the selector we
can use a comma to actually specify
another list we want to be sortable so
in this case it's places so when we
refresh we can actually sort this list
here as well sorry
places that was a spelling mistake so
now we can actually sort this list as
well as this one however you'll notice
that we can't actually drag this down
into this list because it doesn't
connect with it so if for some reason
you wanted to connect two different
lists for example lists of options that
have been generated from the database or
any other lists and you wanted to
actually allow them to interact with
each other for example you might have
two different lists and like this and
you might want to associate particular
elements with the other list you can use
the connect with option in here now the
connect with option takes as many
different elements as you like and we
specify these elements like so so for
example if we wanted as we've selected
names and places we can't really say
that we want to connect this just with
names because
connecting their names with names and
places with names so places will be
connected with names but names won't be
connected with places so you can see
that we'll have this problem we can't
drag this into here but we can drag this
into here so now what we want to do is
just go ahead and select places as well
and that allows us to interchange items
from each list so we can move things
around and essentially what I've done
here is just switch the contents of the
list around so that's how we use connect
with okay so the last thing we're going
to take a look at is the events I'm only
going to just demonstrate one event and
that is update the reason for this is
that update is probably the most useful
event in terms of if you wanted to
perhaps store a list in order that it's
been moved around in in a database for
example a database table there are quite
a few events for this sortable
interaction however I'm just going to
take a look at update how we implement
update how we can display data from this
and then we're going to go ahead and end
the tutorial but then afterwards go
ahead to the jQuery documentation and
you'll find a list of other events that
might apply to you so I'm going to come
and separate this and just down here I'm
going to go ahead and use and set the
update event and this is going to be
equal to a function now inside this
function is what's going to happen when
the event has taken place so I'm going
to say sorted now update will actually
only update is the event that
essentially happens when we move
something then we let go and then when
the when the element is updated so when
the list has been updated so if we
refresh the page you can see that as I
move this just below here as soon as
that's sorted we get this alert box
sorted now this is the reason I'm
looking into the update option update
event and showing you this only for the
simple fact that if you wanted to sort a
list and then store the list
the order that it's been stored in this
will be the event you would use there
are other events such as when the
dragging dragging of each element starts
etc but we're not going to be taking a
look at them just yet okay so now that
we've got this update function working
we're not going to alert but what we're
going to do is we're going to grab the
contents of the div that spell these
lists that's just been updated and we're
going to display it just down here in a
div so inside index dot PHP I'm just
going to come down here and I'm going to
create a div here and I'm going to call
this sort status so now inside you ijs
we're going to grab the contents of the
list that we've just sorted into for
example if I was to move that to there
this list has now been updated so we can
we can display the contents of this list
if I was to move this here then we can
display the contents of this list so we
can update each list accordingly so
let's go ahead and undo this so I'm
going to take content is equal to and
I'm going to select this dot text now
this dot text is going to take the
current text that's inside of here minus
the tags or the HTML elements themselves
so now what we can do is go ahead and
apply this to the sort status div so
store status text
content so now what we're going to do is
we're going to just go ahead and drag
something you can see that now we've got
Billy Alex and Ashley which is the order
that this particular list is in and then
again if I was to move that up there it
would be the same it would update it if
I was to move an item down here we would
then have Billy London and Sheffield so
we're essentially just returning the
list in its text format depending on
which list we've commonly dragged into
so this is a particularly brief overview
of the sortable interaction in jQuery
however it's not mainly used in terms of
actually sorting lists it's more like
menu options for example if we had these
li elements instead and didn't have an
unordered list these might be divs for
for example and menu options down a page
or foreign categories it could be
absolutely anything and you could use
this sort status this sort sortable
interaction to actually sort particular
lists you could also then in here once
the update has been complete update a
database with the order that the user
has placed these lists in I'm not going
to be covering in this tutorial because
I've just taken a basic look at some of
the options and one of the events
available to sortable however if you do
need any more information the jQuery
library has everything you might need so
if you are wondering how you might do a
particular particular thing with this
you can go ahead and look that up but
for now this is just a basic overview of
sortable list interaction in jQuery</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
