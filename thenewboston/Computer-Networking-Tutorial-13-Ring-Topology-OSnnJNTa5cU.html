computer networking tutorial and before
I start this tutorial I want you know
some personal advice a couple of nights
ago my friends came over and a couple of
them left a paint can like an old used
paint can in my front lawn so then we
you know kind of been going back and
forth then whenever he's sleeping I
leave crap in his lawn
I left a bowling pin in his lawn and
then he left the statue of Jesus on my
porch when I was gone so I need
something really good to put in his lawn
you know either tonight or tomorrow
night so if anyone has any good random
ideas of you know just crap funny crap I
can put in his lawn go ahead and let me
know in the comment section below and
I'll go ahead and make a vlog about it
on my other channel but anyways
enough about that it's been a minute and
I didn't even teach you guys about
computer networking in this tutorial I
want to go over the ring layout or ring
topology now this is a little bit
different than the bus system that we
learned about earlier because first of
all let me just go ahead and draw this
first say that you have a network and it
has a PC we'll just say this is a usual
LAN and you also have a Mac so let me go
ahead and draw a little Mac we'll say
it's a MacBook so here's the keyboard
right there and what else can we put in
this sweet Network uh we'll just say
it's a regular you know Windows 7 laptop
so laptop and let's go ahead and add
some you know networking gear let's just
go ahead and add a server alright so
these are some common devices that you
would have you know in a typical home
network so now let me go ahead and
what's a good color for Ethernet would
just say like this color green now what
the heck is a ring topology and how is
it differ than a bus topology well you
can remember it because all these
devices are connected to one main ring
so say that this is Ethernet and this is
your main ring and this is of course all
ethernet cord right here and obviously
if you were to put it in your house it
wouldn't be in the shape
a perfect circle but the entire layout
if you step back and look at the you
know diagram it would look like it's all
connected all your devices are connected
to a basic ring system so first of all
we notice that there are no terminators
why is that well it doesn't have a
logical beginning in the end of a ring
just like a circle so you don't need
anywhere to terminate it so that's why
it's beneficial or better than a bus
topology um another thing is that well
if we look at how data is logically
logically transmitted say that this
laptop or say that this Mac right here
wants to access this server over here so
what it would do is it would send out
requests basically send out data and
this data would go around the ring in
one direction internet hit each node at
a time so at first say ok laptop do you
have the file that I'm looking for in
the laptops going to be like dude I'm
not a server so he's gone like ok ok
here we go
this server right here server do you
have the information that I want and the
server's going back yeah buddy I do and
then it's going to keep going because
you know this is an electrical signal
and it goes everywhere so it's even
going to ask the PC even though it
already got the information from the
server that's you know part of the thing
that you need to understand about a ring
topology it hits node by node and even
if it reached the destination that it
wanted to reach it continues along until
it returns to the source node now again
as you can see it doesn't really reach
an endpoint it just flows in one main
direction and eventually it gets what it
wants and it always comes back to the
source node so that's overall how this
ring topology works now even though this
is typically the way it works the way
they are actually built is there are let
me just go ahead and draw this real
quick you actually have two rings one
I'm going to try that a little better
number one right here and another one
basically right beside it
and whenever we have this say we have
four devices one here one here one here
and one here
the way that these are typically built
is you can go ahead and set up two rings
where the data flows in this direction
on one of the Rings and in the opposite
direction on another ring so we call
both of these you know topologies ring
topologies even though this one is you
know a very simplistic ring Network and
this one right here is a more common one
where they have two rings in the data
can flow in opposite direction and it's
also better because if the ring breaks
in this network we'll say we'll call
this the double ring network if one of
these rings breaks or the Ethernet
breaks on it then your network is still
going to work so that is this is
actually in fact called the ring
topology as well but I'm just going to
call it a double ring to differentiate
it from my single ring but basically
overall in the ring topology it's better
than a bus topology because it can hire
handle volumes of data better than a bus
but the negative part about it is it's
usually let me get a good color here
it's usually a lot more expensive than a
bus topology so if you were choosing
between you know a bus and a ring for
your home network if you're not worried
about money then I would go ahead and go
with a ring topology or if you are
worried about money then you can go with
a bus topology but if you have a lot of
volume then I would definitely recommend
getting a ring until you see my next
videos because in my next couple videos
I'm going to be showing you guys the
most common type of topology and this is
probably the one that you have in your
home right now but for now now we know
between you know the differences between
a ring and also a bus basically a bus
very simplistic has terminators a ring
is usually built with two rings so data
can flow in either direction handler
style
higher volume is better but is usually
more expensive and by the way don't
forget to give me an idea of something
that I can put in my neighbors lawn so
thank eyes for watching don't forget
subscribe and I'll see you guys
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
