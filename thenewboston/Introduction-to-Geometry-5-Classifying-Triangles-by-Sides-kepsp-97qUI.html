about classifying triangles by sides so
the first type of triangle you can have
is called an equilateral triangle and it
has three congruent sides and if you
remember congruent just means they have
equal measures so we mark by congruent
sides by putting little tick marks on
each side so these tick marks to show
that all three sides are congruent
because you can't you can't just go off
what they look like like you can't just
say they look equal so it's an
equilateral triangle you have to
actually measure them or be told that
the sides are equal so the next kind of
triangle we have is an isosceles
triangle and it has it's a triangle that
has at least two congruent sides so for
this particular triangle this side and
this side are equal and this side is
just a different length and the last
kind of triangle you can have is a
scalene triangle and it is a triangle
with no congruent sides so we mark this
by putting a tick mark and then two tick
marks and then three tick marks because
none of the sides are equal so now we're
gonna do an example using the rules we
just learned okay so we have these three
triangles and we're told that a B which
is this big side right here is equal to
seven the length of BC
is equal to five and the length of CD is
equal to six and they've already marked
on here which sides are congruent so
using this information we're going to
fill in their lengths of the rest of the
sides so since we know that BC is five
and it's congruent with segment II D and
D are congruent and we know that because
each is marked with one tick mark we can
say that the length of AD is also equal
to five so we're going to fill that in
now we're told that CD is equal to six
and we know that CD and B D and B E
right here are all congruent because
each is marked with two tick marks and
since we know that CD is six we know
that BD also has to be six and B e has
to be six so we can mark those on here
and we know that the length of a B this
long one is seven and since a B is
congruent to this whole segment ad
we know that ad also has C equals seven
so now that we know how to classify
triangles by sides make sure you watch
our next video where we're gonna talk
about classing classifying triangles by
angles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
