16th Python tutorial in this story I'm
going to teaching guys a sort method
it's the last method we're going to
learn for now and also about something
called tuples which is like a list but
even worse so um the first thing I guess
we're going to need to do is create a
list I'm just going to name my new and
create any values in any amount that
aren't in order so 22 7 98 1 go ahead
and press Enter and now we have a list
called new now to use the sort function
you need to type in the name or the
object and type in sort and then type in
any are actually empty parameters and
what this is going to do is give you a
sorted list now it doesn't return it to
you just source it for you you actually
have to call it to return it like that
so again any time you want to use the
sort function you press just like any
other method keep calling methods
functions you put the object name the
method name and empty parameters and
that will sort your list for you and
again you it isn't just a list you can
sort you can also sort what do they call
strings so go ahead and press sorted for
this it's a little different and then in
here you can type in the name of a
string let's type in something like easy
house and as you can see it now while
actually easy house is almost in
alphabetical order e a Wow
that's a kind of impressive actually but
anyways back to the point before I was
mesmerised
as you can see capitals first and then
the lower cases are all sorted out and
this is using the sorted function to
sort a string now enough with the
methods because I taught you guys like
800 methods by now now I want to move on
to something even more boring than
methods and that's something called
tuples now a tuple is the exact same
thing as a list but the only difference
is it can't be changed so in order to
make a tuple all you have to do is
separate some values with
Camas so something like this and bam you
have a double in an alternative way of
writing a couple is to surround it with
of what are these parentheses so you can
have a double called Bucky and I don't
have a list called Bucky already I hope
and you can have it equal to some values
and just like that and bam
now get the Bucky couple and again you
can't modify or add elements or delete
elements from a tuple it's not like a
list you had you pretty much the only
thing is good for is pretty much calling
back your values so now that we made a
thing called Bucky thirty to thirty to
forty three fifty four the only thing we
can really do with this is get our
values back like Bucky to that would
still be be able to be called forty
three zero one two three so unlike a
list where you can change um or add
elements or delete them or do all kinds
of neat stuff of them the only thing at
Uppal is really useful for is to call
your values back so it kind of sucks but
I just had to teach you guys because
it's a thing in Python so I thought you
guys should know even though I'd rather
not so again any time we use sequences
which will we will be using a lot we're
going to be using lists but I just had
to tell you guys so there's a tuple in
pay attention your sort methods will be
probably using those shortly but uh I
guess that's all the methods I'm going
to be covering right now so thank you
guys for watching make sure to subscribe
and make sure to check out my next
tutorial it's going to be quite useful
so again thank you and I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
