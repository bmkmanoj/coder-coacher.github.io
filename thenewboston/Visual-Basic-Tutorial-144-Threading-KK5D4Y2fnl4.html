slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and this is this tutorial we're going to
be talking about threads now every
application you make runs on what's
called a thread now sometimes you have
to make more than one thread to run
certain parts of your application so if
you remember from using multiple forms
as objects if you open up your main form
and that's loaded and then you click a
button and it opens up a second form if
you close out of your main main form
it's going to end the thread that the
application is on and the entire thing
is going to close all of your windows
are going to close now what you can do
is you can put each one of those windows
on a different thread and that will make
it so that the application will not
close if you close the main form that is
on the thread the main thread for your
application now you don't have to create
the thread yourself it's already made on
one thread when you create an
application but you can add on more if
you want so let's go ahead and make a
project and do a little demo application
to show what threads can do
so let's go ahead and select a windows
forms application and we will call it
threads okay so now that our app has
loaded let's go ahead and resize the
form some and add some controls
so we'll come over here to our tool box
and we will add a button and we will set
the name of the button to or we'll set
the text to start new thread and we will
set the name to button thread
okay so let's double click on this to
open the event handler for it I will get
rid of form one load because we don't
need that so we'll just zoom in some
here okay so let's go ahead and create a
thread up here so we'll start off by
declaring it private so we'll have
private my thread as system dot
threading dot thread now you can also
import system dot threading so that you
don't have to type this out every single
time you want to create a new thread so
now let's go down here and we will
create we will say my thread equals new
thread and or new system threading dot
thread and we need an address so we'll
just type address of it says creates a
delicate delicate procedure instance
that references the specified procedure
so basically we're going to do is going
to tell it what to run on that thread so
let's go ahead and create that
so we'll do private sub show message and
we will do message box stop show I am on
thread
and then we'll just do my thread and now
we need to do is we need to sleep that
thread because if we didn't or no we
don't because it's showing a message box
the thread will automatically be
destroyed once we click okay so we're
going to do a dress of show message okay
so we created the thread we set it equal
to a new thread with the address of the
sub show message so now what we can do
is we can come down here and we can type
my thread dot start and what this will
do is it will start our thread and as
soon as we click OK it won't have
anything else to do so that thread will
close so let's go ahead and start
debugging
okay so here is our forum one right here
so let's go ahead and click start new
thread and you can see that it says I'm
on thread my thread now I'll just show
you in the task manager here
looks like it wasn't showing up in the
task manager but what this does is when
we start the new thread it opens up a
new thread right here and if we close
out of that you can see that this
message box is now running on a new
thread and it will continue running
without the need for form 1 to be open
so we'll just go ahead and click OK and
close out of that
so threads are kind of a hard concept to
grasp so go ahead
create some thread threads like this
just do them with an address of a sub or
a function and later on we'll be getting
into more advanced types of threading
but for now I'll just practice this and
then once you got that down go ahead and
move on to the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
