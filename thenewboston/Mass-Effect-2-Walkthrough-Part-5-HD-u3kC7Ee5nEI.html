rerouting power
test subject has been
come on so here we're almost if it
Miranda but you were
dead what the hell are you doing my job
Wilson betrayed us all you should have
taken him a lot see what he knew too
risky I've put too much time and effort
bringing you back to life to let you get
killed now you really think Wilson's
capable of that not anymore I had a
feeling Wilson was just looking for a
chance to shoot me in the back good
instincts some people are far too
trusting to ever see that coming come on
let's grab this shuttle and get out of
here my boss wants to speak to you you
mean the Illusive man I know you work
for Cerberus uh Jacob I should have
known your conscience would get the
better of you lying to the commander
isn't the way to get him to join our
cause well since we're getting
everything out in the open is there
anything else you want to ask before we
go commander I've had enough of this
station to last a lifetime 02 in your
case come on
before you meet with the elusive men we
need to ask a few questions to evaluate
your condition what we have to do this
now we should have done weeks of testing
to confirm the success of project
Lazarus a few questions during the
shuttle ride will have to suffice ok
records show you grew up on earth tough
environment no parents you enlisted in
what a metal fighting batarians during
the skillion blitz do you remember that
a lot of life depended on me holding
that position I did what I had to
however you want to put it it was Dan
impressive I had friends who were there
satisfied Miranda almost let's try
something more recent ver Maya will you
destroyed sarens cloning facility you
had to leave one of your squad behind to
die in the blast lieutenant kaidan
alenko was killed in action it was your
call why did you leave him behind being
in command means that sometimes give
orders knowing that your people are
going to die that can't affect your
decisions kayden gave his life for the
rest of the team without him I couldn't
have stopped sarin he died a hero I
understand commander and I wasn't
judging your decision everybody at
service knows that cloning facility had
to be destroyed there are other tests we
really should run come on Miranda enough
with the quizzes the memories are there
and I can vouch for shepherds combat
skills personally I suppose you're right
we'll have to hope the Illusive man
except
littlefield test is evidence enough</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
