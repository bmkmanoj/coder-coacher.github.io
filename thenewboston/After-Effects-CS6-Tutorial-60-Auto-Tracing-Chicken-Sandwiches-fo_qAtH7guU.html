hate it when you when you're watching a
tutorial and they only take the easy way
out then you go to try it in real life
and it doesn't work so let's go to our
auto trace here and I'll set the
settings back to what they were
and I'll just and I'll go through it
with you so if we start on the Alpha
here with our preview it's going to just
do the whole entire thing because the
alpha of this picture is the whole
entire whole entire picture so we can
come down to luminance real quick and
you see that it gets a decent amount
it's probably going to catch all the
mayonnaise and everything like that and
all the bright parts of the lettuce so
let's try on one of the color channels
here we'll see which one's better and I
saw that blue was the moat the best out
of all them so what you want to do is
mess with this threshold here and just
go up incrementally don't hit Enter
because then I'll hit okay so just go
into incremental yup and I found that
this 70% was a pretty decent way to get
around it so we have the whole thing
outlined here and we can hit okay now
we're going to come in and delete
everything that's in the middle that we
don't want you can just click on point
hit delete and then hit delete again and
I'll delete the whole thing
just try to do this real quick nope just
deleted everything
one more over here now this is probably
a little faster than trying to mask out
the whole entire thing on your own but
as you can see it's probably not perfect
but it's quick all right here we go now
if we come down to our masks and there
is an extra mask that's the one that's
around the outside I can delete that one
set this to add and now you have your
McChicken here cut out see how it looks
I mean it's got a little bit around the
edges and then you can apply the mat
choker to it but there you go that's
it's already cut out cut out pretty much
for you very handy tool and you can
let's put on the mat choker real quick
mat mat choker to be zoomed in when I do
this so I can see what the heck's going
on and actually the default settings are
pretty decent
back it off a little and see what
happens right about there
you don't want to cut in too much
there you go you have your McChicken
something else that I like to do
sometimes with the Matt choker is you
can put a little halo around around your
image so if I add a lot of geometric
softness and a lot of gray level
softness you get like a little halo
around the edge of your image and it
looks like it's glowing and it gives it
more of like an ah kind of effect like
like it's heavenly I guess so a lot of
times companies will do that and it
makes it look like it's like a heavenly
sandwich I guess so I would say that's
that's it for Auto trace I showed you
how to use on easy objects hard objects
and medium so use that next time your
next time you got a mask stuff out to
get it done really quick it's a good to
know how to mask regularly in case this
doesn't work I mean a lot of times
you're going to get something and it's
not going to work really well so be sure
you know how to mask properly first and
then master the Auto trace so I'll see
you guys in the next tutorial I think
this is a really awesome tool you guys
should use it see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
