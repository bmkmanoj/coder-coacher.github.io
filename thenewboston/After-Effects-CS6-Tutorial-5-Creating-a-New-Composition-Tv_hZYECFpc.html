After Effects cs6 video tutorial this is
buddy Blackford on the New Boston and
today we're going to go over
compositions how to make a composition
and talked a little bit about
composition composition settings so it's
going to be awesome we have to when you
start out learning a program you have to
learn like the basics and sometimes
they're not all that awesome but to
really use a program you don't want to
start in the middle and then you don't
know how to figure out how to do the
basic things
I mean I'm learning saying this from
experience I started out trying to make
awesome things at first realize didn't
really know how to use the program and
couldn't really follow what was going on
so it's great to start out and learn
from the beginning not just jump in you
wouldn't want to jump into a video game
in the middle of the video game so it's
just an example known no more lecture
whatever so we'll start off by I'll show
you how to create a new composition the
go up here to composition and a
composition is basically like a big
group that's going to contain your
footage your layers and everything you
are able to apply effects to
compositions you and you can apply
effects to the composition elements like
the layers and the solids and stuff like
that so you can go to composition new
composition the hotkey is ctrl N and
this will pop up you have the basic tab
here and then you have the advanced tab
I almost never use the advanced tab I
actually haven't ever used it so but
we'll cover that the advanced tab at
another point time in case you ever need
to right now most of the time everybody
is going to want you to use either
this HDTV preset or another HDV HDTV
like a 720p but I always stick with HDTV
1080p cuz you can always cut the
resolution in have to get 720p you
anytime you try to up the resolution
it's going to look blurry and crappy so
anytime you start at the top you can
always cut down and it'll still look
fine trying to go up is bad there's also
a couple resolutions or presets that are
getting a little bit outdated the NTSC
which is about 480 and that's that's
basically like your old tube TVs used to
have NTSC or maybe your local news
channel or like that the video quality
on it isn't that good
that's probably NTSC it's not HD there's
also um actually the NTSC is used in the
Americas mostly and I think like Brazil
doesn't use it maybe they're changing
into it I don't live in Brazil but I do
have a friend that lives in Brazil and
he's pretty good at what he does NTSC
stands for national television system
committee just a fun fact you'll never
know never ask you that and you don't
even really need to know it it's just
some throw out there pal is what they
used to use in mainly like Europe and
Asia and Africa it's a 5 6 di and as
that's basically fading out also so
basically I would stick with HDTV maybe
later on you if you ever work at like a
film studio where like say you're going
to work on like Avengers or something
like the Avengers 2 they might be in it
might be in 2k like I said they they
actually like to shoot their video in
high resolution because they can always
downgrade it later so preset 1080 29.97
actually will go with 24 because most
HDTV is 24 now and then always use the
work that's also less frames that you
need to work with so stick with HDTV
1082 4 for now keep this at square
pixels it C gives you the sixteen point
nine aspect ratio which is what you
always really want and anytime you need
don't want to use a preset you can also
a manual to manually type in these so
someone has a wacky like nine eighty
five or something like that if someone
has like a wacky custom maybe you need
to make like a banner on the side of a
website and it's got different
dimensions on it a different resolution
you can add in your own custom but there
is a web banner but I mean they're not
always going to be the same so let's go
back to this preset here's where the
framerate you'll you want to keep frame
rates either at 24 or 29.97 in the US a
full resolution that's that's what you
want to start out with a few half is
just going to bring it in half or
whatever you don't really don't want to
do that I always start with about 30
seconds you can always change this later
but just to have something on the table
that's not like way too much if you put
in like 30 minutes your timeline is
going to be really huge and you're gonna
have to go through everything and zoom
in and everything like that so I just
keep it small unless I like know what's
going on I always like to keep the
background color black but I mean you
can do whatever it feels better on your
eyes so you always want to name it so
I'll name this one new Boston
ambitious fellow right and that creates
your this is your comp that's kind of
like your canvas you can let's drag this
to our comms folder we'll open it up
just so we can look say you created your
composition and you did something wrong
you didn't you put in the wrong name
well you can change the name on there if
you put in the wrong resolution and go
to composition composition settings and
you can fix it so that's easy enough
okay and let's throw something on there
I've got this image again you can just
take it and drag it over and it puts it
within the composition so I mean you
would want something to fill the
background so we'll just throw something
in there as a background because when
you render this out it's just going to
be all black just throw this in there
for now put this picture on top in the
layers and you can see that the
composition holds these different
effects so let's throw an effect in
there we'll throw a blur it's the
easiest one to throw in there where's
the fast blur put on Bucky here move
this back to where it's supposed to be
and what's blurr him yep this is just
messing around so use this panel on the
top are the slider on the top here you
can give back to your project panel so
there's that I'm going to take the blurr
off because it's knowing me so we'll go
to back to the effect I just wanted to
show you how to get the put effects on
things within a composition you can also
bring up the composition itself and put
different effects on that a few throw
the composition within another
composition so that stuff will become
more clear once we do more projects just
keep that in the back your mind another
way to make a composition and this is my
favorite way if I know that I'm going to
be working on video footage I'll have
the video already made from the camera
and you can take it and bring it in over
top on this button right here down here
and it will create your composition with
the same aspect ratio and same
resolution that you have on the video so
this is a video I made a while ago and
basically just something we made for the
company I used to work for and that
those are the two ways you can make your
composition in the next tutorial we'll
be talking a little bit more about the
composition panel and what these buttons
down here mean and anything else that I
could take up all right well thanks for
watching this one have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
