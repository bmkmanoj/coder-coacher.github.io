saturday 2010 three days until the
release of the most anticipated computer
game of the entire year starcraft 2 so
this morning I woke up and I was
thinking two things i was thinking i am
super excited for starcraft 2 to come
out I have been waiting for this game
for so long you guys have no idea so
wouldn't it be great if one of my
subscribers can feel the same excitement
I feeling and I also thought you know
what it is super hot in my apartment and
that was because my air conditioning was
broken it's actually 93 in my apartment
right here so if you hear fan in the
background just ignore it many ways back
to the video so then I got to thinking
you know I haven't had a giveaway in a
while so giving away starcraft 2 seems
like a pretty darn good idea so I got
some pants on because I don't wear any
pants when I sleep but anyways I got
some pants on and i drove down to
bestbuy and i picked up yup a copy of
starcraft 2 to give away to one of my
subscribers so I went there I was
standing in line already to check out
and I go you know what you know what
would be even cooler than giving away a
copy of starcraft 2 well I can think of
one thing and uh let's see yeah that's
giving away 5 copies of starcraft 2 so I
went back and I actually picked up five
copies see if I can get them all in pre
order mom so yes my friends that is
exactly what I'm doing how do I look I
am giving away 5 copies of starcraft 2
starting on Monday the 26th and I'm
giving away one each day until friday
the 30th so one on Monday one on Tuesday
Wednesday Thursday and Friday server
saying all right how do I you know win
one of these copies because I
want one well there are two rules they
need to follow in order to win one of
these copies first you need to be a

someone you met who you think deserves a
copy of starcraft 2 you know maybe
something bad happened to him recently
maybe they help people out all the time
maybe they're just a genuinely nice
person and I'm going to read all these
stories and i'm going to pick whoever i
think is the most deserving person and
whoever would appreciate this the most
and i'm going to give them a copy of
starcraft 2 so you can either win this
for summer notes um again go to my
youtube messaging however you message me
and send me a message of someone you
know who you know is a really good
person is really deserving of this and
