video and in this tutorial we're finally
going to be talking about the heart and
soul of excel I'm talking about formulas
and functions now the formulas and
functions ability and spreadsheets is
pretty much the reason that any
spreadsheet program including so is
popular at all it's the reason that
people buy this software so what it is
is basically the ability to perform any
calculations really quick and really
easily so of course whenever we're
making calculations you need to open up
a file with some kind of numerical data
in it I'm using new visitors Bucky's
room but you can really use any one you
want
you actually for this tutorial you can
probably just use you know whatever
numbers pop into your head but like I
said if you want to follow along then
open up this project file so before we
get into you know making some complex
formulas and crunching a bunch of
numbers I'll show you guys how to set up
a really basic formula so a formula is
pretty much just an equation so just
like you would do in math or type into a
calculator whenever you make an equation
it needs to be equal to something so
every single formula starts with an
equal sign now after this some of the
most basic things that you can do is
just perform basic mathematical
operations like you would type into a
calculator so you can put something like
12 plus 65 to add two numbers and of
course the data that displays in the
cell isn't this text itself it's the
result of that equation pretty cool
however if we were just to do this it's
not that impressive because we have
calculators lying around our desks and
we also have a calculator built right
into our computer's operating system so
it's kind of a waste of time not very
useful
now the power of working with
spreadsheets is the ability to reference
other cells so instead of just having an
equation like 74 minus 23 what we can do
is we can have an equation to set the
cell
d3 equal to another cell such as this so
set your equal sign right there and then
click another cell and check it out
now d3 is equal to the value of B 3
pretty sweet however I know what you're
thinking that is it really useful ever
because I mean we already know how to
cut copy and paste so really we could
just do this with the calculator and we
can do this with you know copying
pasting so let's go ahead and actually
let me delete all this and I'll show you
guys the one last thing that is pretty
much the foundation of how you're going
to work with spreadsheets from now on
whenever you're working with spreadsheet
what you do is you don't treat it like
calculator and you don't just treat it
like cut copy and pasting you actually
combine both of those techniques so say
that actually make a actual example here
so right now this is the visitors to my
website and say that I was projecting
that in one year that projection the
projections of visitors is going to be
whatever this is plus a hundred thousand
so what I could do is actually go in an
empty cell such as C to set it equal to
the value of this which is one five one
four four four plus 100,000 so there you
go so now the new value of the cell is
equal to the reference of another cell
which is b2 plus 100,000 so that's
pretty cool and another cool feature I
want to talk about real quick is anytime
you say okay you know what this number
was actually off I might have copied it
wrong in the first place so I'm actually
going to change this to one I don't know
51 for 62 and hit enter look at what
happens to this new cell that we had the
formula in it automatically corrects
itself because you're not on this
equation right here it isn't sent to
absolute value it's set to a reference
of another cell so whenever the value
and this cell changes the entire value
of the resulting equation changes as
well pretty sweet
now before we talk about that anymore
I'll just talk to you guys about the
basic operators and some rules that we
have to follow whenever making formulas
now the first one is I'll show you guys
the different things that you can do
obviously you saw before we can just add
two numbers 54 plus 32 we can also
subtract like 54 minus 32 simple enough
now multiplying and dividing is a little
bit um not as intuitive anytime you want
to multiply numbers in Excel use the
asterisks so this would be 6 multiplied
by 8 and of course the asterisk is above
the 8 on your keyboard so of course that
is the product of that is 48 now
whenever you want to divide you put
equals something like I don't know
9 divided by 2 now the sign for division
is the forward slash so again not that
intuitive well I know you get used to it
after a while and the last thing I want
to talk to you guys about is definitely
not the first thing to pop into your
head anytime you want to use exponents
like 5 to the power of 3 use 5 and it's
actually the caret it's above the 6 on
your keyboard carry it 3 so what this
means is 5 to the power of 3 and we're
going to end up with 125 so 525 125
there you go so again that's how you add
subtract multiply multiply multiple pies
I wish I had multiple pies multiply
divide and use your exponent symbol with
a little caret so we already learned a
bunch of stuff we already learned that
you can make formulas perform simple
mathematical equations reference other
cells and also tie those ideas together
to use the references of other cells
inside our equations
so we already have our brain packed full
of a bunch of sweet info so in the next
Sorrell trust me there's a lot of other
stuff to cover but I'm going to make it
real easy for you guys and you guys are
going to be a pro working with formulas
and functions in no time so thank guys
for watching don't forget subscribe and
I will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
