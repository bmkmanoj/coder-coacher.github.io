message now remember we also have a
color parameter which is basically the
color of the text and one of the most
important things the ID because you know
we know how to organize in our head but
computers and databases they need ID to
keep things in order so now that we have
all of those parameters from the user we
can go ahead and do a simple check to
test whether this is a valid message now
what do I mean by that it's very very
incredibly simple so here's how you do
that and of course whenever you're
making this for your real website you
may want to test this a little more in
detail but for right now we're just
going to test and make sure that
everything is not equal to blank now for
example you may want to you know make
sure that they don't use any SQL
injection or cross-site scripting
especially for this but for right now
this is a very simple check you know for
example if they try to send a message
and they didn't write anything in the
text box or the input area then we're
going to you know give them air or it's
not going to send so if name is not
equal to anything um let's see let's
make words of my little hand side and
all right if name is actually we can do
or that probably be better or the
message of course you need something in
your message or the color let's just go
ahead and copy this again or the color
forgot what I freakin copied already all
right so we're basically saying as long
as you have something for your name as
long as you wrote something in the
message and as long as you have some
sort of color then we're going to say
that it's a vet one second oh my god
this is so embarrassing coughing right
in the middle of my friggin tutorial
Wow I'm going to have to edit that part
out but anyways the reason that we don't
check if ID is equal to something
because the user doesn't manually set
the ID the ID gets auto incremented
depending on you know the ID gets set by
the database by the computer so we don't
need the user to you know manually put
an IV in so now that they have a valid
message what do we want to do well let's
go ahead and first of all we know that
we're going to use a function or method
from here the chat class so we'll grab
our object which is called chat and in
order to use you know crap from your
class you make that little arrow now
since this is the mode to send new
messages then let's go ahead and look
for a method that would resemble sending
a message delete message no posts new
message bingo that's what we want so
post the message wow that gotta stop
smoking that weed before my freakin
tutorials post new message and we can
just go ahead and copy this because we
can take all those parameters and see
what we need to write in so the first
parameter is the username so we can just
go ahead and throw the name in there now
the second parameter that it needs is
the message itself so we can go ahead
and boom look at that the message and
the third one is the color so now what
we're doing one last time whenever we're
using the mode send and retrieve new
messages which pretty much means um send
a new message to the other users what
this means is the users type their
message into the chat room so we're
going to get the name of the user the
message itself the color and the ID
which will set later on and we will want
to make sure that it's a valid message
for example they didn't leave the
message blank or anything and if it's a
valid message then we can go ahead and
use this post new message to insert the
message into the database and remember
later on we're going to be talking about
different modes but essentially once the
message is inserted into the database
then it updates on everyone else's
screen therefore creating the most
brilliant symphony of computer
programming which I call a chat room so
anyways thank you guys for watching and
by the way arm we are not done with
these modes yet so stick around for the
next tutorial in reminder please go to
Bucky's room calm and all of the source
code is there check over it make sure I
don't have any stupid bugs and also if
you want to ask questions um you know
talk with other users pretty much just
joined Bucky's room calm because it's a
pretty awesome site and we can talk
about all the code together so anyways
thanks for watching and I'll see you
there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
