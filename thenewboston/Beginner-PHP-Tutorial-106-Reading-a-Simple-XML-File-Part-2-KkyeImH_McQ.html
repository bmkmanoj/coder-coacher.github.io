and this is a PHP video tutorial for the
new Boston now in this tutorial I'm
going to be slightly advancing on the
last part of looking at simple XML and
this time we're going to deal with what
happens if we have child elements inside
of our XML document so at the moment our
XML document looks like this we have
currently four producers
however what happens if we want to add
some further information about these
producers and I don't mean further
information about credentials like their
name or their age let's just delete
these too so we can keep an eye on
what's going on here
so inside each producer I want to
specify a show that they've both
produced so for example here I'm going
to say show and I'm going to end show
now I'm going to provide some details
about the show so show name and a show
and let's say show date show date and
then let's give a date so let's say 12th
December 2010 for example okay so now
let's copy and paste this and put in
another show so show name another show
let's change this to the fourth of July
2009 okay so now alex has produced two
shows with these credit n chosen here so
we've got show name and show date but
we've also maintained specific
information about our producer so we're
coming into sort of a database like
structure where we've got the name in
the age of our producer then we've got
two different shows that they've
produced so not only are we accessing
each producer but we're now accessing
data about
show that they've produced let's just
add one for Billy so we can use that as
an example so inside here we want let's
just line these up show name better show
and let's change the date 2007 and keep
it a July and we'll just change this to
the
25th for example okay so now let's go
back to our index dot PHP page so we've
already established that we've got four
reach as a language construct which is
looping through each producer as a
producer now what we can do is we can
echo out these producers names by using
this structure so we've established that
we can do that we can put a line break
so let's go ahead go back to our page
and refresh and you can see that we've
got Alex and then a line break and Billy
so we've produced the names of our of
our producers now what we could even do
is incorporate the age so let's um let's
create some brackets here and then
inside the brackets I want to put their
age so producer age okay so what this is
doing is it's giving us the producer
name the name tag inside each producer
so we've got we've got Alex and age and
then we've got so we've got Alex than 21
and billion 16 so that should gather the
data for each one and then we can do a
line break afterwards so let's refresh
and see if that's worked okay yes so
we've now got the age in brackets
let's put just a space in there to make
sure that's neat so now underneath what
happens if I want to list each show now
you might think that we could just say
echo producer
let's go back to where accent our
documents see what we've got then we
could say show and then we could say
show name well
absolutely let's refresh and you can see
a show under Alex however what this has
done is its outline break so we can see
we're doing properly however we're only
showing one show for one show for Alex
on one show for Billy now Billy does
have one show that's correct
however alex has two shows we've got a
show let's go back I've got a show in
another show and Billy has just got his
one show better show so what do we do in
this case well all we need to do is we
need to create another for each
statement inside hip here but this time
what we do is we say for each producer
and then we say for each producer show
know what's it called yet for each
producer
show as show now what we can do is we've
taken each producer's show and we're now
able to access elements inside this or
our tags inside of this so now let's
echo out show remember we're using the
variable that we created here and then
we can say show name for example and
then we can say put a space on and or so
on and then we can say show show date so
we're accessing this specific
information that's relative in our loop
to each producer so let's refresh and
see what data we get back we'll just
create a line break there first of all
let's refresh now what you can see
that's happened is we've because we've
looped again for each show we've now
accessed another another tear or another
how can I explain another dimension of
our XML structure so now what we've done
is we've been able to return specific
data on every show that this specific
producer has produced and therefore
Billy always only has one and because
that sum is only produced one show so
now with this example you can do another
for each loop if you wanted and then
another one inside that to access each
element of this depending on the
structure so remember with XML the
structure is always going to say the
same but the data is going to vary so
for example if we were to copy and paste
this show here and then change this to
another show too for example on the
fifth of July you can now see that our
page will update and put more data in it
so the structures remain the same and as
long as we adhere to the structure and
exactly the same tag names then our data
is going to be updated
even if we're using multi-level data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
