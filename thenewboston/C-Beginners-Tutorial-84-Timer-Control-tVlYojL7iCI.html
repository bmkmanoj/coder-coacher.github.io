tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm showing
you how to use the timer control so all
you're going to need for this tutorial
is button and a timer so just go over
your toolbox and drag a timer over to
your forum and when you drop the timer
you will see that the timer will appear
on this little bar down here that's
because you cannot see the timer control
the only property that we're going to be
looking at inside of the timer class is
the interval property and the interval
property will basically just tell you in
milliseconds how much time the timer
will wait in between each tick so we put
a thousand here the timer would wait a
thousand seconds and then tick then it
would just repeat that process over and
over and like I said this is in
milliseconds so 1000 milliseconds is
equal to one second so 100 milliseconds
is equal to one tenth of a second but
we're going to keep it at 1,000 so it'll
be one second
in order to start our timer we're just a
few the start method so just go ahead
right here and double click on your
button
so we're just going to do timer 1 dot
start we just start and when the time I
want it when the timer is started it
will wait out the interval so it will
wait one second and then it will tip it
won't tick and then wait the interval it
will wait out the integral and then tick
so if we wanted a message box to be
displayed on after one millisecond we
would have it on be displayed after one
tick so thankfully the tick in an event
so we can just go ahead and forgot our
timer here and just create a new event
handler for the tick event so now the
tick event is raised it will call this
method right here and we're going to
have a message box show saying hello
hello and we should get a message box
now after one second because it will
wait out the interval which is one
second and then it will tick and then
causing food to do this code right here
so we should get our message box yep
after one second but as you can see it
continues to do that message box or do
this code because we never told the
timer control to stop kicking so we're
going to have it stop kicking right
after it ticks once they do timer 1 dot
stop stop method 2 stop the time with me
kicking so now what it will do is it
will start it will wait out the 1 second
interval then it will stop the timer so
it won't take any more and then the
message box will be displayed so this
time you should only get one message box
after one second yep
one message box another thing that we
could do is we could have it do
something every time it ticks so for
example we can make it add a number to a
text box every one second so now we're
going to do on this tick of end we're
going to have Xbox 1 dot X plus equals
and then let us have it equal plus equal
now we're going to actually create a new
integer up here just call it int I'll
study 0 and every time the timer ticks
we will have it add 1 to I so we'll just
increment it by 1 and then we'll print
it out into the textbox we'll just do i
dot 2 strength so now the timer will
continuously tick and every one second
we should get an increasingly larger
number inside of this text box so start
out with 1 and we should get 2 and as
you can see it's waiting one second in
between each time that writes out a
number into this text box and each time
it will increase the number by one you
know let's go on forever here since you
never told it to stop so that's pretty
much it for this tutorial on using the
timer control so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
