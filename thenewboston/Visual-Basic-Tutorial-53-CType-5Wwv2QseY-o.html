slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
taking a look at converting variables or
data types so in this tutorial I'm going
to be teaching you how to do it with
c-type now there are many other ways to
do it and we may be covering them in the
next couple of tutorials so we'll go
ahead and create a little demo
application for this we'll go ahead and
select a new project windows forms
application and we will just call it C
type and we'll go ahead and click OK now
let's come over here and we will add a
button and a text box or several buttons
so now we'll add a text box okay here's
one so we'll just go ahead and set the
text box name to text raw variable and
we'll set button 1 to convert to double
not the name button convert double and
we'll go ahead and set the text to
double we will set this one to integer
and we'll set the text value to button
convert int and we'll go ahead and set
the name of this one to button convert
boo lien and we will come down here and
set the text value to boo lien okay so
now I'll go ahead and create an event
for each one of these buttons by double
clicking on them okay so button convert
to double we're just going to go ahead
and create a variable so dim raw
variable as string is equal to text raw
variable text now this is going to text
while variable text is going to always
be a string because text text boxes
handle string and then we'll declare
final double as double and now what
we're going to do is where you're going
to set final double equal to and now
we're going to convert the raw variable
to a double solders type C type and this
takes two arguments
now the first AAB the first argument is
the variable that we want to convert or
the data that we want to convert we can
use variables or we can use numbers or
strings so we can go ahead and type raw
variable and now for our second argument
we have objects as type now this is the
data type that we want to convert it to
so we'll just go ahead and convert it to
a double and we will just type message
box show final double now let's do this
again for converting to integer so we'll
go ahead and create take this raw
variable and we'll go ahead and paste it
down here now we'll create another
variable so final int as integer and now
we're going to do is convert raw
variable to an int so final int equals C
type now the first argument is going to
be our data type or our data that we
want to convert so that's going to be
raw variable and what do we want to
convert that to we want to convert it to
an integer and we'll go ahead and show
that in a message box
now we will do this one more time and
convert it to a baleen so we're going to
go ahead and take our raw variable right
here paste it right there and we'll
declare final bool
as bullying and now we're going to type
final bool equals C type raw variable
and then we want to convert that to a
bullying so let's go ahead and run our
program so you can see here's our form
right here and if we type a number in
let's say 10 and convert that to a
double it's going to give us the value
10 now it doesn't look like any changes
have been made but it is in fact a
double value now let's go ahead and type
in a different number such as 23 and if
we convert that to an integer it's going
to give us the value 23 now it looks the
same but instead of being a string
datatype it is an integer now for
bullying we're going to have to type
either true or false so if we go ahead
and type true and click baleen let's try
false looks like we've got a problem
here we didn't show it in the message
box so let's go ahead and add message
box show final pool and we'll go ahead
and run this once more so we'll type
true in here and convert it to a baleen
and you can see that it gives us true
with the capital T because when you're
using boolean's it's either capital T
true or capital F false so if I type
false right here and click boolean it
gives us a capital F false so go ahead
and you see type practice that you can
convert variables to other data types or
you can instead of using raw variable
right here you could use the text true
converting that to a bully and so go
ahead and just play around with that and
once you know how to do that you're not
going to forget it move on to the next
tutorial and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
