praise basically want to create into a
stream so actually I'm going to put a
space down there so now what we need to
do is queue string just go ahead and
name this line equals text stream dot
read all and ok looks good so what this
line does is it reads the entire stream
which is basically our entire file and
it stores it in a variable called a line
right there so after this we'll just go
ahead and write my file close and why do
we need this because you need to close
all files when you're done working with
them pretty much as housekeeping for c++
so pretty much this is all of our very
basic um like our very basic stuff that
we have to do with the file so now all
that's taken care of and stored in
variables we actually need to display it
on the screen so in order to display on
the screen remember that UI object that
we talked about earlier represents the
entire user interface and this was
actually set up for us by Q so what we
need to do is we're working with the
user interface what part of the user
interface well we want to work with the
text edit widget now what do we want to
do to the text edit widget we want to go
ahead and set plain text and what this
basically does is um first of all it
takes a string which is line and
remember the string right here is pretty
much our entire file because we read the
entire file and so what this line
basically does is takes our entire file
and it displays it in plain text in that
text edit area which is this area right
here so now let me get back to where I
was working with and after this we need
to do a couple more things so even
though we have that text display now the
point of finding something is so you
know the user can see where it is in the
text file so in order to let the user
know where the word is that they're
looking for we're just going to move the
cursor over the word and it's going to
highlight the word so let's go ahead and
store the cursor and very
variable and it's called queue text
cursor right like that and I'll just
name this text cursor I guess text
cursor set this equal to what part of
the user interface UI text edit and it's
called text cursor now this text cursor
function is a built-in function it's
already in queue so we don't have to
code this ourself basically it returns
the cursor of your mouse and it stores
in the variable text cursor like we
defined right there so now the only
thing else I want to do is I want to
take that cursor in I want to move it
into position because we're going to
need imposition later on so go ahead
text and I'm going to sneeze in about
two seconds move position and cue text
start going to make me type the whole
thing okay start and then cue move
anchor and one so I know you this is
running off the screen but let me go
ahead and shift this down now explain
you guys what it means alright so
basically what we're doing right here is
we're taking the text cursor and moving
it one position these were I mean excuse
me these parameters right here don't
really worry about them for now they're
just you know parameters that you need
because cute says you need them but
that's it now I can go ahead and run
that off the screen so now actually our
entire get txt file function is complete
so one more time before I let you guys
go what this does is it basically says
what file do we want to work with go
ahead and open that file so we can use
it what do you want to do with it well
we actually want to convert it to a
stream so we can store everything in a
queue string variable called line so now
pretty much our entire text is stored in
this variable called line so we can go
ahead and close the file now once it's
closed we can go ahead and display that
text on the screen in the text edit area
and what this does right here is it
pretty much just moves our cursor into
place so then whenever the user searches
for their next term they can go ahead
and you know the cursor moves and they
can see where the words are that they're
looking for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
