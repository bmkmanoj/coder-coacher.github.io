think it's like the thirteenth tutorial
and in this video I'm gonna show you
guys how to style this home button right
here
now these notification icons are
different than this home button right
here because this is more like a regular
button except that you use an image
instead of text so I'm going to show you
guys how to do this for a single button
and then once you learn this you can use
it for you know however many buttons you
want so the first thing we wanted to do
is say footer menu and I'm gonna make a
class called home button now this right
here what I'm gonna style is this entire
section and isn't this little home icon
or the image itself it's the entire
button square section so the first thing
I want to do is set padding now the
padding of this you want to set it
similar to your text but it's really
dependent on how big your icon is or
that little house or whatever you use
for your home icon - 5 pixels 8 pixels 0
pixels and 14 pixels pretty much
whatever fits um you know make sure you
get the height of your footer and then
whatever fits to pad your image nicely
do that now for the border you're gonna
set it to none and the background set
this equal to none so right now we
pretty much padded our image in there
nicely but if in case you didn't notice
we didn't even have the image itself
applied to the footer yet so let's go
ahead and learn how to do that now we
pretty much just made a section so what
we can do is actually copy this so right
now we made an area where the button
would go and that button is actually
going to be a link to the home page so a
now whenever we make this in the HTML
file you know how you typically make a
link like this a a and then you put crap
in here and that's the text that
displays well we actually are not going
to have any of that text however
whenever we um show this we want the
image to show so how do we do that
well whenever you want to do that all
you need to do is you need to set the
background of the link to a URL now the
URL you can go ahead hold on ear itching
there we go if you just want to play
around you can actually use a full URL
like HTTP and get an image from the
internet but if you have one on your
local computer just go ahead and put um
you know a path to that so image home
ping is the name of my image right here
and you also want to put it in the top
left no-repeat now something like your
background this entire thing you may
have tiles to repeat for this you do not
and actually make sure to get rid of
that semicolon so that is how you use an
image on your button right there and the
reason that you want to put this in the
top left is because you already padded
exactly where you want your button to go
so instead of positioning this inside
the button just pad your bun to fit your
image and then whenever you want to move
it around just change the padding it's
very simple now the next thing we wanted
to do is we want to set the width and
the height for the link so the width and
again this also depends on your image
pixels and the height 30 pixels now we
want to do this because browsers aren't
really used to using images as links so
what you want to do is you want to give
it the specific height in width so
actually width and height in this case
so it knows what the heck is going on in
it doesn't mess everything up this is
like insurance to ensure that your image
displays properly now the next thing we
want to do is we want to set on hover
what's going to happen whenever you
hover over this section well what we
want to do
let me just steal some crap from here
and this is pretty much just
housekeeping and also some other cool
stuff so whenever we hover over this
image area the first thing we want to do
is make sure the backgrounds none now
I'm gonna put this in here
even though um you know I'm just I don't
want to change background:none and then
make it dynamically change the
background none it has no effect I'm
putting this in here in case any of you
guys want to you know make the
background a little bit darker this is
where you change you're right here now
I'm going to tell you guys this the
reason that I don't like to make the
background darker is because when you
see you don't click on the area itself
you need to click on the image in order
to go you know to the home page or
whatever so that's why on the buttons I
like to make that area darker because it
has some effect it makes a pop-up menu
appear but on this one
you just can't hover over um you know
the button you need to actually go and
click the link so I just think it makes
it's just a little annoying thing a
little subtle thing that makes your
webpage a little bit better for the user
better user experience that's what it's
all about now what I would like to do is
make this image glow on hover so there
are a couple ways that we can do this I
already have another image and I'm going
to show you guys two different ways
where you can make the image glow so
first of all this gets changed to
whenever you hover over the link which
is basically the image itself what you
want to do is you can change it from
home to home too and I have two image
files this home right here is like gray
like cccccc and this is pure white so
whenever you hover over it like this and
that makes it appear like it's glowing
can you guys see that you can also do
this you can also set the opacity to 50%
by default and whenever you hover over
it change the opacity of your image
to 100% and that has another cool effect
it makes your bun and kind of
transparent and then when you hover over
it comes like full opaque so those are
two different ways but if you're just
beginning it's probably easier just to
have a gray image and then in Photoshop
or whatever paint it white and then
whenever you hover over it it looks like
it's glowing but anyways that is how you
style the home button and in the next
video we're gonna be getting into all of
these drop menus so this one this one
right here that one and we have you know
a lot of information to cover but trust
me it's worth it this is one of the
coolest footers of all time but anyways
thank you guys for watching don't forget
subscribe
congradulations that you now know how to
style a home button and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
