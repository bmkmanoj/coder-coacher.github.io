exact same since you know hopefully
you're copying me in copying this code
just like I am you may have a different
display for example if you're using
Google Chrome Google Chrome ignores
State one so this is never going to
display if you're using Google Chrome
for other people maybe they're using
Internet Explorer Firefox they're going
to see this so don't think just because
you don't see some of these status
messages that you coded something wrong
or if you're looking on maybe I didn't
close that semicolon maybe that's why
it's not displaying it's not your fault
it's just that whoever made the browser
for whatever reason some browsers ignore
some states so you know I just want to
mention that Google Chrome for example
we aren't going to see the status one
now now that I gave you guys that little
warning I just don't want you guys to
freak out now what we can do is we can
do this for status two three and four
and I want to talk to you guys about
what those mean as well so go ahead and
just put this in else if statement and
of course instead of one we want to test
for two now that one sounds like tuna
you know I don't even know I said that
that was stupid and so too of course we
want to change status to all right so
what does status to mean if you're
communicating with the server and you're
on already state two what this means is
the server received the request so I'll
just write request received
so basically we're always we we're not
just connecting to the server just like
hey server I'm a PC okay see you later
we actually want the server to do
something in the Ajax now typically it's
to you know run a PHP script or generate
an XML file that's our request so if
we're on ready state two that means okay
hey client I'm the server and I received
your request you're good to go
so now after that we can move on to
three so else if
three then what does status through me
and hold on let me just go ahead and
alright so if you are on ready state
three or the stage of your communication
is it three what this means is the
server is processing your request so
basically whatever you asked it to do
it's currently performing that task and
these can be things like I said generate
an XML file so during the you know
portion while the basically while the
server is generating the XML file it's
going to go ahead and be it ready state
three so it's not done with it yet but
it's basically like I said processing
your request now the last thing I want
to do is put this else ifs amen for for
now we're going to make for a little bit
different we aren't just going to you
know make text because ready state four
basically means that your request is
finished and the response whatever you
ask for it's ready now we just don't
want to go ahead and make text like this
because this can mean a couple different
things it means that your response is
ready but it doesn't mean that the
response went okay for example when you
communicate with a server and you get a
404 message you know maybe your webpage
doesn't exist you know those four or
four messages that you get sometimes
well even though your conversation went
okay and you were able to connect with
that server there was a problem so you
know it was able to communicate with you
all right but whatever you asked it to
do it didn't perform it so that's why we
need a separate if statement so even
though we're ready to State for in this
basically means that the communication
between your computer and the server
computer went okay it doesn't mean that
the basically that the conversation was
successful basically so in order to test
this what you need to do is you need to
text s XML sorry HTTP status in the
status of a successful response is equal
to 200
now let me add one more equals now again
you can also have things like 404 and
this would mean that you know the page
didn't exist or page not found but
instead of you know writing 404 and all
the things that can go wrong in separate
else statements we really need only to
do if-else so basically if this happens
right here then it means that everything
was successful it means everything was
okay else it means that you know
basically something went wrong we don't
need to test all the different errors
individually else something went wrong
so what do we want to do if something
went wrong well we just want to alert
the user that maybe the page wasn't
found or something
and you do this by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
