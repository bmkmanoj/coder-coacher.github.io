game development tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm gonna be going over
something called a unit vector
now I drew this little diagram because I
thought it was easier to show you guys
what's going on instead of just talking
about it since it can be kind of
confusing so I'll review what we did so
far the first thing we did is we build a
coordinate X and that's this we build it
at 2025 the next thing we did is make a
point at Y which was at 40 55 the next
thing we did in this initialization
function is created a vector or found
out what the difference was between x
and y so we subtracted X from Y and we
got 20 30 and this is because 40 minus
20 equals 20 that's the change in X and
55 minus 25 is 30 that's the change in Y
so the vector from X to Y equals 20
30 so that's how we got that so that's
all this initialization function does is
give us a vector and next we needed to
calculate the distance so we know from
pythagoras that this is side a this is
side B in in order to solve for side C
we just used a squared plus B squared
equals C squared so we took a square
root of B squared it and we got the
square root of that and that gave us our
36 so this is the vector and this is the
distance 36 is the distance but now what
I'm going to be teaching you guys is is
something called a unit vector what a
unit vector is if it it pretty much says
all right if instead of 36 if that
distance wasn't 36 but it was 1 and
that's where the named unit comes from
poses because it's only 1 then what
would this vector B so what we're gonna
be doing in this tutorial is taking that
36 changing the distance into a 1 and
finding the vector from that it's not
gonna be 20 30 anymore it's gonna be a
lot smaller so let's go ahead and do
that right now
in order to do that let me position this
we first need a new function and I'm
gonna name mine a unit so put def unit
self and now what we need to calculate
this let me show you guys how to
calculate this in order to calculate the
vector what you do is take the side of a
and put it over the distance and in
order to calculate the Y unit vector
take the Y side and put it over a
distance so 20 over 36 and 30 36 so
let's go ahead and do that the first
thing we need is a variable for the
distance so write distance equals and
this is equal to self distance since we
already found that out unless toriel no
need to do it again you just can't write
36 because and when you're making
programs these coordinates might be
different and we want this to work all
the time so that's why you need to do
that so in order to get the a unit or
the side how am I going to say this in
our new vector unit we're building we're
going to need a new variable for both
the sides so let's go ahead and make a
new variable a unit which is going to be
the new a side and we'll set this equal
to remember I told you guys the formula
is that side a over distance so now we
have we divided a by distance and it
gave us that new variable a unit so now
we have to do that for B so B unit
that's my street name self B which is
that side B over distance which is the
hypotenuse of that triangle and now all
we need to do is return something
because every function needs to return
something or else it's useless unless it
prints on the note that's another story
for another day so return self a unit
and self
be unit make sure I spill all right
looks good so now that we returned it
all we need to do is print it out so
let's go over here and print thing unit
and this should work hopefully those
crossed fingers and let's go ahead and
save this and look at this here's what
we printed out so far the first thing we
printed out was our vector the next
thing we print out was our distance
which was 36 points something I'll still
lazy to include that and the new vector
hypothetically if the distance was one
it would be this this would be the
change in X and this would be the change
in Y so again one last time what we did
is we pretty much took that side a and
we divided it by the distance or the
hypotenuse and this gave us a reduced
version if that was one what would the
new side equal and we did that same for
B we took 30 divided it by 36 and that
gave us our answer of 0.8 so again
that's your quick tutorial umm the
easiest way you can learn this is just
follow along and type it all in yourself
and after you type it in I'll promise
you're understand a lot better what does
so for now that's your quick tutorial on
unit vectors again these are going to be
extremely useful
you cannot program 3d graphics if you
don't know what unit vectors are and
again in these next couple tutorials
well probably in like a few tutorials
from now we're gonna be developing 3d
graphics for our game and if you don't
know what unit vectors are you're not
going to be able to add that 3d
dimension so this is very important so
again thank you for watching
learn your vectors to these tutorials
and soon enough we'll be making some
sweet 3d graphics so don't forget
subscribe and I'll see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
