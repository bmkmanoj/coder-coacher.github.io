sixty second c-sharp tutorial that I'm
making for the New Boston and in this
tutorial we're going to continue working
in our hangman project and we're
basically going to be handling when the
user submits a letter so let's just go
ahead and double click on the submit
letter button so the first thing that
we're gonna want to do is get the
character that to either submitted so
they say character groups character
letter equals Xbox ones text which is
this text box right here
so text box one text got two character
array since we're trying to get a
character out of it and since this
returns a character array we can just
poke brackets after it and put it 0 and
that sense is only going to be one
element inside of this character array
because the maximum length of this text
box is 1
so it'll basically just get the
character that the user submitted next
we're going to want to check to see if
the user actually did submit a letter
because if they didn't want to tell them
that no you can't do that you're just
gonna so we're going to say if character
dot is letter and this will just return
a bool indicating whether the character
actually is a letter and then we're
going to want to test this letter right
up here the character that we got from
the text box and if it's not sort of
going to put a exclamation point at the
beginning of this so if it's not a
letter then we're going to have a
message box show saying you have to
submit a letter so we're going to just
say come on star show here you and
letters and we're going to want to make
the title the type of that message box
error then the buttons for the message
box will be buttons will be only okay
and and then or the icon of the message
box we want to make an error as it's an
error and then we're just going to have
it returned so that it never will get to
the code if the user actually did submit
a letter and let's just go ahead and
test this out and make sure
all right so if we try to submit like
anything that's not a letter like a
number nope you can only submit letters
and you see you've got that icon right
there and we have air at the top of the
message box all right so now we're going
to want to check to see if the letter
that the user submitted is actually in
the word so we're going to say if word
got contained and remember we created
word up here so that we can use it in
other spots such as down here so we're
going to say if this word contains this
letter right here then we're going to
have it do stuff all right so if the
word contains a letter we're going to
actually go through every word and sir
every letter inside of the word and if
the letter inside of the word is the
letter that the user submitted then
we're going to change the corresponding
labels text to that letter and you'll
understand that more once we actually
like coat it and type it out all right
so now we're going to want to create a
character array of all the characters
that are actually in that word so I'm
going to take care of clear a letters
equals the word to character all right
so now we're going to want to go through
each letter in the character right or
inside of this word and we're just going
to check to see if that character is the
one with user submitted so int I equals
0
well I is less than the letters Lang
letters clang and what it's going to
increment I by one alright so now we're
going to check to see if that letter
actually is the letter that user
submitted they're going to say if
letters I equals letter aka the letter
that these are submitted then we're
going to change the corresponding labels
text to that letter so labels which is
our label list hi dot text equals that
letters text so letter dot to string all
right so that's sort of confusing but
basically what we will do right here
character array of all the letters in
the word that we generated then we're
going to go on and go through each and
every letter inside of that word and if
that letter is equal to the letter that
the user submitted then we're going to
want to go up to our label and change
that labels text to whatever letter that
we were submitted all right so let's say
the word that we generated randomly was
Apple so Apple right here and then the
user guesses P well it's going to go
through every letter inside of this word
so a a is not P P is P P yes it is so
then we're going to change the
corresponding labels text to P so if
there were for August to be five labels
then we're going to want to change label
twos text to P and then we're going to
want to go on to the next letter is that
one P yes it is so we're going to change
label threes text to P as well and then
as you can see L is not P and E of not P
either so we're going to leave those the
way they are all right so now let's go
ahead and touch or test this out and see
if it works so let's just do bug here
yep we've got a nice long word 13
letters long good guess hey let's see if
it's in there yep a is in there so it
changed the labels text to a is B in
there no let's try s yep s is in there
all right so that's pretty much it for
this tutorial so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
