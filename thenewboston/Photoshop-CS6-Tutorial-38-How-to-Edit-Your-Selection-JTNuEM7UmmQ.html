awesome Photoshop cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackbird and today
we're going to be going over how to work
with your selections the ones your
selections that you already have because
there's some tools within Photoshop that
can help you fix your selection and do
other things with it so most of your
selection options are going to be up
here in your select area right here so
we've got select all which selects every
pixel in the image so if I select all
right now it's just going to select the
entire image and then if I try to move
it it's going to just move the entire
image so I'm going to move backwards so
I can have my selection I already have
so right now I just have this lifeguard
station that's out on the beach selected
and I have a certain area of it selected
and I didn't bother with the legs or
anything like that too much time too
lazy so up here again we have a select
all which is control a we have DES elect
which is controlled D and you use that
to get these selection lines off your
Photoshop document we have reselect so
if you deselect and it's gone you can go
back to a reflect and now it's back on
but you can also you can also hit undo
or something like that if you need to
reselect so just this is just another
way to do that
we've got inverse here which selects
everything opposite of what you have
selected so right now I have the
lifeguard station selected and if I hit
inverse it'll select everything else you
can tell that it's inverse because it
has this dotted line around the outside
and if I hit delete now it'll only save
this so that's a way that you don't have
to drag this on to a new document if you
didn't want to even use the background
or anything like that you could just
select inverse and then delete to get
what you need so I'm going to go
undo this and undo the inverse selection
so the let's go up to the top here to
select we've got all layers and it lets
you select on all the layers that are
down here in your layer panel down here
in the bottom right and by doing that
you can pretty much like let me select
it right now you can pretty much delete
things for every layer that we got going
on here so let me I got to unlock this
one select all layers now we got all the
layer selected so if I delete this out
now so just selecting all my layers for
me alright so yeah I guess that just
selects all your layers in the layer
panel and if I try to move these let me
see if I can do it yeah it doesn't move
your selection actually it just selects
the layers and then if you go to
deselect layers it gets rid of them and
then we can find the layers we would
like that way we can type it in and I
can just type in layer and that way if
you have a ton of layers you get
searched by the layer name pretty handy
and that fine layers is new in cs6 so
remember that so you can turn that on
and quickly right here turn on and off
and then we also have different things
we can add so if you're looking for a
certain defect that's on a bunch of
things and you want to modify every
effect or mode or whatever you got it
that's a very handy feature that was
much needed
now we've got go back up to here we've
got color range and it creates a
selection from your color range which I
went over in a previous tutorial what it
does is you select a a certain color and
then
everything that is that color gets
selected the next one we have is a
refine edge and this one says refine
mask pretty much the same thing creates
a pretty much creates the selection from
complex image which is sort of like this
refine edge it's all blocked out because
we already did it so we don't have to
worry about that the next one we have
here is modify and modify has a few
things in it so it pretty much lets you
basically can modify the border by
expanding or contracting it so we'll
just click our one will go to expand and
then ask you by how many pixels you want
to expand your selection so if you're
cutting out your selection and it has
too much background information in it
somehow you can you can go in and make
the selection smaller you can contract
it down and these things remember the
last selection that you used so so just
remember that it'll pop up so don't just
go click happy because it remembers that
you did it by three last time instead of
one so just remember that let's go down
here to we've got grow and we've got
similar click on a layer so we got grow
here which expands out a increase your
selection by adding pixels to it and
then we got similar and this one adds a
non-contiguous pixels so if I click on
that let me zoom in Oriya
select your similar will clip that and
my selection is now gone it's not what I
wanted to happen it undo similar so what
happened when I selected similar is that
it's selected everything so if I go back
again and select similar you can see
that all around the outside everything
is selected there's so many different
colors in here that just selected them
all
so step backwards and if we select grow
let me select my layer select and then I
hit grow let me zoom in for you again
you'll be able to see that looks like it
grew out to the whole thing again so to
grow in the similar don't work too well
on this picture but I used it in one of
my other selection tutorials and the
grow just expanded it by a few pixels
and helped it go over on the outside of
the of the edge so I think when I what's
going on here is that I already have the
I already have the selection on the edge
already so now it's going to just like
grow to like out into the background so
that's what's going on now we are able
to transform our selection so if I go to
select transform selection it puts a
bounding box around it and then I can
move it around if I want like that
press Enter to stop selecting let's go
up to select again and we've got edit in
quick mask mode and this is this is
quick mask mode and it gives you your
selection in this so let's back up
lower safe selection so we've got our I
mean we can load previously save the
channel mass collections and stuff like
that so that's a for the Select menu now
sometimes a sometimes when you're
working in Photoshop things don't work
exactly like you think they might that's
one of the cool things about working you
need to like solve different problems so
if you're working and you use a grower
to grow out your selection a little bit
to get it to the outside and as it
selects the entire picture which is then
what I wanted it to do I'm going to have
to do something like go in and refine
the edges through the refine edge button
here and mess with it that way
so that way I mean there's different
ways to do things in photoshop and
that's what I'm kind of trying to teach
you now is the different ways to do
things so you don't get stuck so thanks
for watching this one we'll see you in
the next tutorial and thanks for
watching
