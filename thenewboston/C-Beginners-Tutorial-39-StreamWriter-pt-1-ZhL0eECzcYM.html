tutorial that I'm making for them in
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to use the
streamwriter class so all you're going
to need for this tutorial is two buttons
and a text box and this right button
right here is disabled on startup and
I'll show you why later also you're
going to need to be using the system dot
IO namespace because these streamwriter
class is inside of this system dot IO
namespace just like the streamreader
class and right here we have a private
string path and that will be set equal
to the Open File dialogues file name or
the path to the file that the open file
dialog opens so then we can use this
path later to create an instance of a
stream writer and also it enables button
2 or this right button right here only
when the user opens a file so now when
you click the right button we're going
to want to create a new instance of a
stream writer sort of new streams writer
SW for stream writer or you can name it
anything you like then some equal to a
new stream the writer then do file dot
open right because we are going to be
writing this time not reading and then
inside of here would still up with a
path and we already created a string for
that we're just going to use this path
straight all right so now once we have
our stream writer created you can do SW
right and basically this will just write
into our text file so we're just going
to do we're just going to have a write
the contents of text box belong so this
time this way we can write text inside
of text box 1 and it will just write
that into our text file and then we're
still on disposed of this stream writer
so that we don't get any errors like
being used by another process or
something like that so now when we debug
you can see this bright button is
disabled and it will only be enabled
when we open apply it like if you don't
open a file it's not enabled so now we
open our text
file and now our button is enabled we
can write something to our file I'm just
going to have a rewrite my name is Adam
so I can click right and that will just
write it into the text file now if you
go back into notepad right here open up
that text file we should see my name is
Adam yep my name is Adam we can write
something else here as well if you
wanted to write hello
but right reopen the file and we see
hello
well it did write hello however instead
of just deleting everything over there
and then writing hello which throat
hello over what was already there and
there's a reason why it did open right
instead of create if we do dot create
then what it will do is it says creates
or overwrite specified file with a
specified buffer size file options and
file security and basically what that
means is it will delete everything that
is there and then it will write instead
of just writing so now when we write
here we should only see what we write in
this text box and nothing else nothing
else previously there so if we just
write Adam this time look right open up
our file in notepad should see Adam yep
all we see is Adam there's nothing else
there we were to write something larger
like I am Adam three groups reopen that
if we just get I am Adam so now there's
another method here besides just write
we can do dot write line and what this
will do is it will create a new line so
we can just once have it write the
contents of text box one and then we'll
just have it write another line Tsang
this is this is the second line so now
only debug and write showed this right
Adam so now when we open our file and
tighter and notepad right here
there should be two lines it should be a
line that says Adam because either wrote
or typed in text box 1 then we should
get another line saying this is the
second line now go ahead open it up get
Adam and this is second line now if we
were to do the write method here again
it would still create another line and
that is because following this line it
puts a special character that will
create another line no matter what is
typed after it so we were to type just I
don't add them here man then it would be
on another line right hello at the top
good right now we should have three
lines this time yep we have hello this
is the second line Adam but if we were
to do write again then the key
difference here between the right line
and right is right line will only will
only be the one that will create a new
line after it but right doesn't do that
so we do write again then this will
still be on the same line of adam so if
we were to write space and that's my
class name here then we should get adam
space my last name and that should all
be on the same line
but right we'll just right pull out at
the top again right we open it up and
again we should see only three lines
here but following this we should see a
space and then my last name I do open
yeah don't say yeah and there we go see
hello this is the second line atom space
my last name and again that's because
after this win because of the straight
line method it'll create another line
after it no matter what you type so
that's it for the thirty-ninth c-sharp
tutorial and in the next tutorial we're
going to be looking at writing bytes so
see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
