ninety-eight c-sharp tutorial that I'm
making for the new Boston and in this
tutorial organ continue working on our
reader class and like I said in the
previous tutorial we're going to be
reading strings so the first method that
we're going to create is this method
that will read a string at the current
position so let me say public public
string read string and then we're just
gonna have the user pass through the
length of the string that they want us
to read so just going to say length all
right and we're gonna be using you read
characters method inside of the binary
reader class to read the character
they're really string so they'll say BR
read characters and then the length of
the string would be the amount of
characters that we want to read so just
gonna say well link right there and
you're probably wondering why we're not
using the read string method and that's
because the read string method inside
the binary reader class doesn't allow
you to specify the length of the string
that you want to read it just assumes
where the string is and I prefer to do
it this way alright and census returns a
character array of all the characters
that it read
we just need to convert that into a
string so it's gonna say a new string
and then just pass this character right
that this read characters method returns
through the constructor of this string
struck and basically it'll just convert
that character array into a string and
now we're just gonna return the string
we created and now whenever we go to
call this read string method what it
will do is it will just read the
character that the user wants us to read
so if we use your pass through or they
wanted us to read a four character long
string it would just read four
characters and then convert that
character array into a string and then
return it alright and the next Makela
that we're going to be creating is a
method that will read a unicode string
and I haven't really talked much about a
unicode string and I'm not even sure if
I have but basically what a unicode
string is is it's a string where each
character is represented by n 16 or a
two-button integer so for example if we
were to create a Unicode string that
read Adam through this do a
a ham and a regular string would just
look like like that how you'd normally
type it just Adam so and you can see the
key difference here is each character
takes up two bytes so this a is two
bytes long this D is two bytes long so
you're probably wondering why this is
even useful why they ever store
characters this way or strings this way
when it would take out more space
well that's because not all characters
can be represented by one byte for
example a lot of characters in different
languages such as like chimp such as and
like Chinese or Japanese or Korean or
something like that a lot of the
characters inside of their language you
have to represent with two bytes so if
you're trying to write in like Korean or
something inside of one of your programs
that you wanted to store that string you
would have to store it in Unicode string
and there are two different types of
Unicode strings began the in Unicode
string and there's little onion Unicode
string and a big-endian Unicode string
basically means that the N 16 was
represented in big endian so as you can
see right here this is a big-endian
Unicode string so since a is represented
by 41 we just read this in 16 right here
and it's 41 so same is just a regular
standard but if we were to make this a
little endian unicode string it would
look like this it would be a D then a
then M
so what it would do is they would go
4100 instead of 0 0 41 so this is big
endian and this is little ano all right
so now we need to actually read those
strings so it's gonna create a new
method called public string read Unicode
string and then we're just gonna have
the user provide the length of the
Unicode string that they want us to read
so we're just going to stay in there
like all right and basically what we're
just going to do is read the bytes of
the string so the user wanted us to read
this is during Adam right here they
would enter
eight bytes long right here and we would
just read one two three four eight bytes
all right and then we just need to
convert that into a big ending Unicode
string since this is a big-endian
unicode string right there so we're
gonna determine what string to read
based on what by order of the user has
defined so we're going to say if byte
order equals by order dot big-endian
then we're just going to read the bytes
and convert it into a big-endian unicode
string so we're just going to say BR
read byte by byte and then the length
which would be the length that the user
passes through and now we need to
convert this into a big-endian unicode
string sense this will only occur if the
user's byte order is big endian and to
do that we're gonna have to use the
encoding class so I'm going to stay in
coding dot big-endian unicode and then
we're just gonna want to get this string
from bytes so we're just gonna use the
get string method to convert it into a
big-endian unicode string and then we're
just gonna want to return this since
this get string method returns a string
so we're just gonna say return all right
and then we're just going to want to
have it return a little endian unicode
string if the users byte order is little
onion so to say else return encoding
coding
unicode and you don't have to say little
endian unicode it's just unicode so
unicode dot get string and then those
bytes VRE bytes the length of the string
that the user passes screw alright so
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
