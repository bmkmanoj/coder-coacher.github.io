tutorial in this story I'm going to be
going over some called nested-if
statements and also else if statements
so I gave you guys a quick heads-up on
whether if an else statement was in a
couple of tutorials ago but I'm going to
give you a refresher or a quick in case
for God and then I'm going to be getting
into some more stuff that we're going to
be needing later so go ahead and make an
integer you can have it whatever you
want
I'm going to name mine age and set it
equal to something like actually set
equal to 60 next let me remind you guys
what if statement does what if statement
does is it tests a condition and if that
condition is true so age is less than 50
it does a certain thing so let's say if
age was less than 50 which is not why I
had to print out on the screen let's
make sure I got this type to right for a
go any farther um if it ages less than
50 then you're pretty young so you are
young so it allows you to make a
decision if a condition is true and we
also went over the else and what this
does is a gives us a alternative unless
that condition is false so let's copy
that because we're lazy and it's put you
are old let's so go ahead and see what
this does right here it outputs on the
screen you are old so what this did
real quick I'm not going to get an in
detail because the told you later it
looked at this variable called age and
tested if it was less than 50 if it was
it was going to print this you are young
but it wasn't so printing this and again
this is how you can give java a way of
making many choices oryx or just one
choice in this condition but what I
wanted to talk to you guys about in this
story is not the simple if-else
statement it's something called a nested
if-else statement or a nested if
statement and what it is is this instead
of just having one action if it's true
or one action if it's false say if it
was false you wanted it to perform
another
decision well actually what you can do
is take this entire if-else statement
and plug it in one of these things right
here
so say the age is 60 right here if the
age is less than 50 then it's going to
do this well the age wasn't less than 50
so it's going to do whatever is in the
else statement so let's go ahead and
make another decision in it all right we
already know that the age is greater
than 50 so let's go ahead all right if
in that case age is greater than 75 oh
what do we want to do we'll just print
out you are really old so if age is
greater than 75 we want to print out you
are really old else in that case age
must be greater than 50 but less than 75
what are we going to print out we'll
pronounce something nice firm don't
worry you aren't really that old with
much typos because that's what they
wanted so let's go ahead and run this
and when we do it says you are old don't
worry you aren't really that old and let
me show you guys what happened right
here this entire thing is your main
if-else this is what's going to happen
if it's less than 50 and this is what's
going to happen if it's greater than 50
now if it's greater than 50 what did it
which it is the first thing it's going
to do is print out this statement you
are old and then it's going to say all
right what else do I do if it's greater
than 50 oh I got a whole other decision
I got to make so aside from this entire
decision I got to make another decision
is my age greater than 75 no at 60 well
then I'll go to this one don't worry you
aren't really that old so again that's
how you can embed an entire if-else
statement inside another if-else
statement and you could have just as
easily put this in the first one by
I decided to put this in else because
that's where our decision led so that's
your quick tutorial on how to make if or
excuse me what this is called is
actually nesting when you have one
if-else statement inside another one
it's called nesting if statements or
nesting if-else statements so that's
your quick tutorial on how to do that in
the next store I'm going to show you
guys how to use something called elsif
so make sure to subscribe them looking
forward to it and I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
