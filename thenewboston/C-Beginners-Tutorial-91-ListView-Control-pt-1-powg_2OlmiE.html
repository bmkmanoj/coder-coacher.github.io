c-sharp tutorial that I'm making for the
new Boston and in this tutorial I'm
going to be showing you how you need
ListView control so all you're going to
need for this tutorial is basically all
this what I ever hear this stuff text
box for the full name age the email
address and that body so you can add
this person into a ListView and then
we're going to need a list view control
so just go over the toolbox and drag a
ListView over I'm going to resize it
accordingly so it's this lot nicer
alright so basically what a ListView
does is it basically allows you to sort
data what we're going to be using it for
today is we're going to be making a
table so the first step in doing that is
clicking this little triangle right here
and then going down to edit columns so
we're going to have three columns we're
going to have one for the person's name
so they're going to call the name of
this or just set the text fit to hold
name the next one will say aide and
final one will be email address I'm okay
and right away you cannot see them and
that's because the view is on large icon
you're going to want to change that
detail so we'll now be able to see a
table you can just resize these columns
by like clicking right here on the
little divider and dragging and make a
full name about that age is probably
good and also the email address the rest
of it um first thing that you're
probably going to want to do is go down
here and set gridlines to true so that
you'll be able to see gridlines in your
list view I just think that makes it
look a lot nicer
you can also set four row select to true
and if you don't have this on when you
select an item in the list view it will
only highlight the text in the first
column and not the rest of them but if
you sent this the true a highlight
across the entire row and I think that
looks a lot nicer and also you're
probably going to want to select or set
multiplying or multi select to false so
you cannot select multiple items now
we're actually going to get into adding
items to list view so we're just gonna
go ahead and double click on this add
person button right here alright so the
first step is creating a new ListView
item so type out this view item I'll
call it L VI for ListView item set it
equal to a new list you item and what
we're going to pass through the
constructor right here is basically what
we want the text to be of in this first
column and we're going to want that text
to be whatever the full name of the user
puts in this text box so do text box 1
text right here
alright and then we're going to do lb I
dot sub items dot add basically we'll do
these for all of the other columns so if
we want age that's the next column in
line so we're going to do the age do
this text box right here or just text
box to text box to text and then we're
going to do sub items again for the
email since the email is the last yes
you do have to do these in order so the
one that we pass through the constructor
right here will be for the first column
and all the rest the sub item ones will
go in order of these so since the next
one is age this one will be for age and
the next sub item that we add will be
for the email address so it's going to
do lvi stuff items add now we're going
to add you text box three dot X because
that's where the user will input the
email address basically right here we've
just created a new ListView item we
haven't actually added it to the list
view so in order to add it to the list
view we're going to list view one items
then we're going to use the add method
to add this new item created to the list
and also once we're all done here we're
going to set all these text boxes text
equal to an empty string so just going
to view text box
one text
nothing check box to check people's
nothing and text box 3.5 all right so
now I'm going to be bug here we type in
a client's name I'll just type in Adam
Smith I guess for last name the age
Elvis iead and the email address so now
let me click Add person you should see
it up here in here and should clear all
these text boxes yep
jump down here is now displayed in the
table you can add another one you want
to add another one is to like John Doe
who is 24 and email addresses
jeido add and yeah it adds that person
as well so that's pretty much it for
this tutorial
in the next tutorial we're going to get
into more things in the list view so see
you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
