tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial we're going
to begin our third project and we're
going to be making hangman program or a
hangman game and while the concept
behind it is rather simple it's going to
take us a lot of tutorials to do this
I'm not exactly sure how many maybe like
5 or 6 I'm hoping but we'll see and the
reason it's going to be so hard is we're
going to be drawing everything are going
to be drawing the hangman and well for
the letters and stuff we're going to
actually be creating the labels with
code we're not going to be like adding
labels so in this tutorial all we're
going to be doing really is creating the
user interface so it's not going to be
really any coding so the first thing
that you're going to want to do is just
get a group box and just move it towards
the left of your form and this is going
to be where our hangman is so you could
change the text of this to say hangman
but I'm just going to delete all the
text because I think that looks better
but it doesn't really matter this is
your program and we're going to have two
more drew boxes so you can just copy and
paste this one and then just resize it
and inside of here is where the word
will be displayed or where you can like
where like the under scores will be
displayed for your word and we'll also
have a label in here telling you how
long the word is and then in the final
group box is where we're going to have
the guessing so this is where you can
type in a character to check to see if
it's inside of the word and you can also
guess the entire word alright so inside
of this panel like I said if a hangman
is actually going to be and we're going
to be drawing the hangman so we're going
to need a surface to draw on so I'm just
going to get a panel and just drag it on
in there and then resize it so that it's
like approximately just in there and
then you can click this little triangle
here and select dock and parent
container and that will basically just
fill the entire group box with a panel
and with these dotted lines around it
that just means that the panel will be
invisible so I'm going to be bugged we
won't be able to see them if you want
you can make a panel so
it has a border style like fix is single
so the black line around it but I'm just
going to make it none so you can't see
it alright so like I said inside of this
fruit boxes where you'll be able to
choose a character or an entire word
guess the entire word so you're just
going to want to have a button for
submit letter submit letter and then
you're going to want to have another
button or submit word and submit all
right and I'm actually going to make
this a little bit higher up here and
same with this so we're going to use
button to be on the same line all right
so submit letter and then submit all
right so I'm going to have a textbox for
where you can enter the letter so just
drag a text box over from your toolbox
to your forum and I'm going to make this
textbox small because you're only going
to be able to enter one letter in here
and I'm the first I think actually the
second tutorial we want to bet if you
hold alt you can like move the control
or resize it um you can make very minor
changes to it so I just did that to make
this smaller like that alright and I'm
just going to move this button right up
against it there and then for this
textbox we're going to make the maximum
length only one so you can only type one
letter in there and right next to this
subnet word button you're going to have
a text box where you can submit the
entire word just going to say text box
right after that and I guess that's
actually a perfect line alright and the
maximum length for this we're going to
leave alone we're actually going to
change it with code when a word is
selected all right and the we only have
really a few more things to do we're
just going to want to add another label
here inside of this group box and this
is just going to say how long the word
is a-comin letters long it is just going
to say word length now let's put a colon
after it and we'll add it that later
your code and then I'm just holding
alright now too
like slightly so it looks better alright
and the final thing that we're going to
do is change the text of the form so it
doesn't say form one so to select your
form and change the text of it since
we're making a hangman game just going
to say hangman right here and then just
put a dash and then put your name after
it so I'm just going to put that them
but you don't have to do that and a
couple more things here we're just going
to make it so you can't resize the form
because if you're to debug right now and
resize it that just looks stupid making
it like that big or being able to
maximize it so we're going to make it so
you can't do either of those so we're
just going to go down to maximize box
just change that to false and change the
form border style to fixed 3b or anyone
use the word fix dialog or anything so
nice fixed angles better alright so
that's it for this tutorial on creating
the user interface for our hangman game
in the next tutorial we're going to get
into drawing the hangman so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
