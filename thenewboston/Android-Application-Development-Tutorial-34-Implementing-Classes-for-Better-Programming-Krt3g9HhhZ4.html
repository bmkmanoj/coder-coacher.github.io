android tutorial for the new boss in
again with me travis what we're going to
do in this tutorial is i'm going to
introduce you guys to what implementing
means and just for a minute imagine an
application that we set up and it has a
ton of buttons and they're all going to
be set clickable so we're going to use
this on click method as you can see
we're setting our set onclicklistener
and then basically just so we can use
this on click method and you know if we
had like 20 buttons this would be kind
of tedious and boring to set it up this
way and as well as it adds a ton of code
to to our class so basically we can
clean this up by just having one on
click listener on click method I'm kind
of defining what we want to do with in
there so what we're going to do is we're
going to scroll up to the top of our
class and it says extends activity and
again when we extend an act or a class
we can use some of the methods but what
we can also do is we can implement a
class so we're going to say implement
and you do that by saying implements and
then you say the class that we're going
to implement and again we're going to
implement the view onclicklistener class
so we can basically use the method from
that class so again we're just going to
save you dot onclicklistener there we go
and basically it's giving us an error
because any time we implement something
we have to use all the methods from that
class again when we extend something we
have we can use the methods from that
class but when we implement we have to
so that's why it's giving us an error so
if we hover over a class name it says
add unimplemented methods we're just
going to click that and then if we
scroll down to our bottom again just
kind of like when we set up a method in
the last tutorial it's going to create a
new method for us right below that
method and it's called on click
basically that's the same method is
right here so what we're going to do is
we're going to set up a switch in case
to determine which button has been
pressed so again this is just kind of a
review on the switching case but this is
also going to kind of introduce you guys
to passing and data I know we did this
with our ListView but when when this on
click method is cold it gives us which
view was pressed and again like a
buttons of you a text views of you all
that stuff's of you so what we can say
is V because they label this view that's
the data that they're giving us for
example we could also say label view
because that's kind of just like a
variable and then we can reference that
variable within these brackets so we're
going to say view and hit dot we're
going to say get ID and that's going to
give us ID that we set up in the XML of
whatever view was pressed and that's
what we're going to look for a switch
encase and then we're just going to hit
up set up a bracket and we're going to
set up two cases because we have two
buttons so we're going to say if the
case is our dot ID dot button results
which was our you know our command
button for the most part we're going to
do whatever is right here we're going to
hit break and if it was the case that
oops the case of our dot ID dot toggle
button password we're going to do
whatever is in here again we've set up a
break to break the switch and I'll leave
this on for one second now all we're
going to do is transfer our code that we
set up within our on click methods up
above so we have this is our check
command so we're just going to copy
whatever we put in within this on click
method which is basically that string
and all the other good stuff just copy
that and we're going to paste it below
and I grabbed one X bracket so you want
to do it right here copy this and again
this is for our results so we're going
to say V right there and then we're just
going to kind of delete it out of delete
it out of this onclicklistener
in those part and now it's going to pass
in some information and if it's the ID
of basically our check command ID it's
going to do basically that on click
method that we just set up there then
we're also going to do that with this on
click method as well so we're just going
to copy that
or cut that and paste it for if our
toggle button is pressed and then we're
just going to kind of clean up some of
this code and instead of doing a new
view we're going to just say because
it's again it's looking for a
onclicklistener so we can use our on
click method so now what we can do is we
can type this for the context of our
class this so it's going to look for a
through our class and say hey we're
looking for a view onclicklistener
and it's going to be like oh we
implemented that and we can use the on
click method so now this button is going
to refer to this on click method that we
set up and we got that because we
implemented implemented it and I'm just
going to give us some data for the which
view was pressed and if is the check
command ID it's going to do basically
what we set up in our onclicklistener
before so again all we have to do is
just type this as well and look how much
cleaner our on create method is
basically it's only three lines of code
and then it refers to our either our on
click method or our bacon and eggs
method so that's kind of how Java
programming works for the most part you
guys can implement methods and that way
it kind of cleans up the code and we're
just going to check and make sure this
works as always because it's good to
check and check frequently for the most
part so hopefully you guys understood
that tutorial for the most part again
it's just about implementing for the
most
and when we implement we have to use all
the methods from that class so this
class only has one one method which is
called on click so again we're just
going to make sure it works by typing
WTF and it looks like it's good so
thanks again for watching guys we're
going to be kind of implementing some
more stuff as we go but we're going to
create a new application in the next
tutorial so thanks again and have a good
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
