Android tutorial for the new boss in
we're still going to be working with our
Google Maps activity what we're going to
do in this tutorials we're gonna relate
to where we touch on the screen and
create a geo point out of that location
so what we're going to do is we're going
to set up a couple ends up here called
X&amp;amp;Y alright so basically this is going
to be our X position and a y position on
our overlay when we touch the screen and
now we're going to create a geo point
out of those locations but first we have
to relate these points to our touch
method so let's go down to our touch II
class that extends the overlay and when
we hit the motion event down that's when
we're going to set up our variables and
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna
say X is equal to and then just our
event which we called e get X and that's
going to return a float but we'll get to
that in a second also Y is going to be e
dot get Y and both those are returning
floats and again this is an integer so
we're just gonna cast in as an integer
where we're gonna be like hey you're
gonna make this work don't tell anybody
and we're cool so there we go we have
our both X&amp;amp;Y base Afar based off our
touch event now what we're gonna do is
create a geo point based off of this X&amp;amp;Y
location because again this is just kind
of where it is and now we need to relate
that to the longitude and latitude which
the geo point you know which we use to
build the geo point so how we do that is
we're gonna create a geo point we're
gonna call this touched point something
like that we're gonna set this equal to
our map view then we're gonna say dot
get projections or get projection and
basically what's doing is it's relating
our touch event of our overlay to our
actual map activity or actual map
according to how far it zoomed in how
we're like scaling and all that stuff so
we're actually getting the projection of
our map and then what we're gonna say is
from pixels because again we're working
with the pixels and this is going to be
our
and this is gonna be and this is going
to be your why so now we have a geo
point that's related to our touch where
we touch on our screen a pretty simple
concept again we're all we're doing with
this projection is relating our map to
our actual touch on our overlay so now
what we can do is we can set up
something called a geo coder and we're
gonna do that within this get address
button because we're gonna basically
display the address so we're gonna set
up a geo coder and also we might want to
set this touch point before we actually
get into the geo coder down here we need
to set this touch point up so or this
geo point I should say her whole class
can use it so I'm just going to copy
that and then a delete the type there
and paste it above as well so now we can
use our geo or touch touch point with in
some of these other methods and now
we're going to set up something called a
geo coder that's gonna allow us to kind
of access the address and all that good
stuff so we're gonna say geo coder and
we're just gonna call it geo code coder
or something like that we're gonna set
this equal to new geo coder and within
the parameters we're gonna say get base
context that's gonna return the context
of the base class and then we're gonna
say locale dot get default and we have
to import both locale and our geo coder
which I've already done and now we've
set up our geo coder and what we can do
now is within a try bracket we can try
and access that dress and all that good
stuff so we're gonna say is try and then
within the try brackets and that's
probably all we have time for in this
tutorial but again just to quickly talk
over some stuff this geo coder what
that's going to allow us to do is
basically refer to some map data and
give us some more information about you
know specifically our location like what
street we're on what what the address is
so that's what we need
Kota for and the next tutorial will kind
of setup it what we're gonna do within
this try bracket will a so also add a
catch clause and get everything going
but again that's what the geo coder is
and we also set up basically a geo point
according to the map how far we're
scaled in and where we touched on the
map so that's pretty much it for this
port this tutorial and I'll catch you
guys in the next one
have a good one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
