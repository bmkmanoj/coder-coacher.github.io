org and this is another video tutorial
for the new Boston now in this video I'm
going to be talking about concatenation
within PHP now if you've ever come
across the word concatenation you'll
understand what it means or if you
program before you might understand how
to concatenate different variables
together on how to print out things and
then concatenate variables in so you can
view them in a sentence if you like now
in PHP it's really really simple let's
start out by creating just a few
variables so the first thing I'm going
to do is create a variable called day
and this is going to be equal to the day
of the week so today it is Thursday and
I'm going to create another variable
called let's say date and this is just
going to be simply equal to the day in
numerical value so it's the 31st today
now down here if I wanted to say echo
out the day and then the date so
eventually I want it to say there so
let's just echo it out so we know what
we're doing Thursday I could say the
date is Thursday 31 just just to make
things simple we could eventually faff
around with St but that would use if
statements which is later on so the date
is Thursday the 31st this is what we
want our program to display we could in
fact incorporate the year in as well so
I'm going to say year equals I'm going
to say 2011 now the reason I'm doing
this is for example if it was the year
2000 in actual fact it would work so
yeah okay we'll keep this as in to the
data so the year equals 2011 so we've
got a variable called day we've got a
variable called date and we've got a
variable called year so we'll eventually
we want this program to display the date
is Thursday the 31st 2011 but we want it
to use these variables rather than a
predefined set of text that we've
written out so the way we do this is we
can either you
our double quotation marks which is
going to make life a lot easier for us
orga new singles now I'm going to use
singles at first because it's a lot
better for you to learn with single
quotation marks and then you can go
ahead and be lazy and use the doubles if
you like so with a single quotation
marks I'm going to start typing the date
is
okay so I've left a space here on
purpose now after the last single
quotation mark but before the line
Terminator we want to add a full stop so
it's just a single dot on this line then
what we need to do is just simply
address the variable that we want to
echo so this is still all included on
the echo line if we put the day here
it's still going to echo out day even
though haven't sort of preper echo in
front of it so concatenation just
basically means we're joining something
on to the string that we already echoing
so the date is day then we want a space
so I'm going to concatenate on and a
piece of string data with just a space
inside and then concatenate on as well
with another dot date and then I'm going
to concatenate on another space so we're
using the full stop and then the space
here with the with the sir single
quotation marks and then eventually
we're going to do yeah now obviously we
don't need to concatenate anything else
onto the end of that because that is the
end of our line so now we can just
preview let's have a look in our browser
refresh and you can see that it says the
date is Thursday 31st 2011 now what
helps to make a change here so I could
say it's Friday the 32nd 2011 I know
that's an unrealistic value we'll go for
30 then to see don't go confuse so you
could say it's Wednesday okay so it's
Wednesday the 30th 2011 let's refresh
and you can see that's updated itself
again the same with the year and this
can be changed as well and it will just
simply update the output so this is the
harder but faster way to sort of echo
variables within
string data as well obviously we can
also echo things onto the end of this
example we might do a strong tag and
then we might put a strong hug just
before here so the way this is going to
work is we're echoing out normal text a
bit of HTML just before we declare this
in within the concatenation and we have
a space we have the date we have a space
we have the year and then we end with
ending the HTML so let's refresh and you
can see that that's time bold so this is
a better way to do things but now let's
take for the easy way so let's echo the
date
in fact we're using double quotation
marks now you're going to see how easy
it is to do it this way the date is day
date year and that's it we don't need to
concatenate because we're using
variables within a string now you might
think that this will output dollar sign
year in actual fact if we had single
quotation marks you can see what happens
you can see that it's literally
outputted the dollar sign day the dollar
sign date the dollar sign year when in
actual fact we want it to reference this
very these various 3 variables here so
all we do is change these to double
quotation marks and you'll see that that
magically updates itself and puts the
variables in there for you so it's it's
totally personal preference like I've
explained before single quotation marks
are faster concatenation gets you used
to looking at complex code and
understanding what's outputted where so
I'd always recommend using the single
quotation marks and the concatenation
for each variable so that's basically
concatenated with in PHP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
