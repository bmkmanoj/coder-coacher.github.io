write files easy stuff the only other
thing I want to talk to you guys about
with sequential access files is how to
append aka add crap to the end of them
now of course W is for writing RS for
reading a is for appending this is
actually going to be really easy and
what I did is I deleted all the crap in
my other text file I want to make
something new here
so let me think of something cheese
cheese everywhere even in my underwear
putting hammock
alright so pretty sweet let me go ahead
and save that and this is my beautiful
poem a beautiful piece of art however
I'm looking at it right now
anyone can just claim this as their own
and I don't get any credit so obviously
as an author creator of this I want to
say this is my file add my name to the
end however I don't want to do it in
this notepad editor because I'm too cool
for that
so I'm going to add it with C
programming so of course we already are
in a append mode and what this basically
does is it takes your file pointer and
moves it to the end of your file so
basically where my cursor is blinking
right now that's where my file pointer
is going to be now I want to add my
credits on a new line so I'm going to
have to kick this to a new line whenever
I'm adding it in my program so just take
note of that now to print stuff out F
print F which pretty much means file
print to it and it takes two parameters
the first one is file pointer and the
second one is what text you want to
print well remember my file pointer is
on line three at the end of it and I
want to kick it on to new line and then
I'm just going to put this is actually
called a high cool not a haiku spell
haiku a little bit differently at the
end add L to end it's my own I don't
know style of poem because I'm awesome
by Bucky Roberts
and of course we already closed it from
the last tutorial so now make sure that
that original one is saved and now write
this build and run and check it out now
when we open this back up it add that
line to the end of this file so this is
what we had before this is where the
pointer was kicked to a new line and
append so again if you're working with
something like when would this be handy
like stock information and you
downloaded like three years worth
information before and you just want to
update it with information from today
well you don't want to have to download
it again and write it to a new file you
just want to grab it from today right
one more line and you know that's an
example one of the many of when
appending would be useful
so let's actually close out of this and
the next thing I want to talk to you
guys about is a random access file
actually I'm going to be doing that in
the next video because I don't know I
just feel like it so thank you guys for
watching
and well I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
