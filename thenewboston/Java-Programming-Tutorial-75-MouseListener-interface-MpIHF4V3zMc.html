75th Java toriel and in this tutorial
we're going to be going over how to
handle those Mouse events so in the
first story we pretty much we built a
window so let's go ahead and go outside
our constructor right here and we want
to make a new class and let's go ahead
and make make it private class and you
got to name it whatever you name it up
here so I named mine handler class and
then what we want to do is implement
from two other classes so implements
Mouse listener and it also implements
Mouse motion listener so hopefully those
errors go away and they did so now what
implement means is we have to use every
method that was in the class Mouse
listener and there are five methods in
this and Mouse motion listener and there
are two methods in this so what Java did
is they put methods inside Mouse
listener and Mouse motion listener to
automatically detect Mouse events so
whenever you move your mouse it's going
to be registered in an object called an
event so let's go ahead and I'll just
start building these methods and you'll
see exactly what happens so the first
methods we need to implement are those
five methods from Mouse listener and
these are mouse press Mouse clipped
Mouse released Mouse entered and mouse
exited and I'm going to tell you guys
what these do when I go through them but
for now let's go ahead and build our
third one first one so public void Mouse
clicked and what this does is whenever
you click down the mouse and what this
means and I know you guys perverse NRA I
know what click means when you press and
release the mouse really click really
quick Wow embarrassing that is a click
now a mouse press and a mouse release
are two different things so you know
maybe guys then Noah click men after all
but this is what Java defines a click as
so and all these parameters are going to
take something called this mouse event
event so you might as well just go ahead
and call
that and copy that like that because
we're going to be using it a lot later
on so now whatever we type in here is
finally what we want to happen when the
mouse gets clicked so let's go ahead and
take that status bar and we want to
change the text on it so status bar dot
set text and what do we want to set the
text equal to well let's just go ahead
and put let's put string format and in
our format parameters it takes two
parameters itself and the first one is
clicked at percent D comma percent D so
it's going to say clicked at two
coordinates in Java also has two
coordinates based on this event right
here why do you have this event because
it registers the event like when you
click it decides where it clicked and
you can get to this the locations by
clicking event get X and also but guys
probably can't see this it's a little
better and also event dot get Y with
empty parameters so now whenever you
click this you get the x-coordinate in
the y-coordinate of where the event
happened and you guys can see this later
on but for now let's go to the next
event the next one's will be a lot
easier I just wanted to demonstrate that
you can get the x-coordinate and get the
y-coordinate and one of them but and the
rest of the methods i'm going to make
them real simple so we made something
that happens when the mouse is clicked
but we need to implement the rest of the
functionality and the second one that we
need to implement is public void Mouse
released and this is what happens when
you release that mouse button so
actually let's go the second one is
Mouse pressed that people usually do so
let's go ahead and mouse pressed is what
happens when you press down that mouse
button so go ahead and throw your mouse
event event parameters in there and for
the body let's just go ahead and put
something like status bar set text this
is going to change the text on our
status bar to like you press down the
mouse so now this is what happens that
or excuse me the status bar is going to
pop up this text whenever we press down
the mouse and now we can get the public
void Mouse released and this is the
event of when the mouse releases or
after you press it down you let go of
the button so this is a lot easier to
see with our program actually so let's
just go ahead and copy this now because
we are too lazy and it's going to say
mouse release so you release the button
so now we have three methods that we
implement what happens when you click
the mouse what happens when you press
and release the mouse and believe it or
not these are actually three separate
things I know you think press and
release is the same thing as clicking
but trust me to Java it isn't so now in
this class there are two other methods
that we need to implement public void
Mouse entered and what this is going to
take is of course our mouse event event
first of all can't forget that taste
that baby right there that's what I'm
talking about
and what Mouse entered means is this is
the event when the mouse enters the area
in our area is of course arm or Aria
Mouse panel right here so this is what's
going to happen whenever the mouse
enters the mouse panel so remember up
here we put it at white by default so
now let's go ahead and change that
actually the first thing we can do is
click status bar dot set the text to
something like you know you enter the
area not bad and now let's go ahead and
change the color of our mouse panel so
mouse panel dot set
background not bad ground set background
and what do we want to set it to when
the mouse enters um put something
noticeable color dot red or something
like that
I mean Red's pretty noticeable come on
so of course you're wondering all right
you have a mouse entered method
something tells me that you're probably
going to have a mouse exited method as
well well if you guess that then you
would be correct so public void Mouse
exited make sure that spell excited I do
that sometimes because I myself get
excited about this method sometimes so
you know it happens so go ahead and type
Mouse event events nothing new so what
this happens whenever the mouse exits
the window pretty much in essence so the
first thing we want to do is sit status
bar set text and put the mouse has left
the window BAM pretty much make sure you
spell the wrong make sure you put he
instead because I'm too lazy to fix it
although easily could just fix it right
there anyways enough of that so now
let's take that mouse panel and whenever
the mouse is in the window it's going to
be red so whenever we exit the window
let's go ahead and set set background
we'll just set this to I guess white
again I mean why not make sure we don't
cut in errors and we didn't so all of
these five methods right here these are
the mouse listener events but again we
implemented for Mouse listener and mouse
motion listener
lucky for us Mouse listener has five
methods which we already did and Mouse
motion listener which is um the ones
that the methods are Mouse dragged and
mouse moved it only has two so this
one's going to be a lot easier so in the
next tutorial we're going to finish up
building this program and all we have to
do is implement these two methods Mouse
motion
which are like I said dragged and moved
and once we do that we can finally run
our program and see what it does and
it's going to be awesome it's going to
be amazing but for now thank you guys
for sticking with me thank you for
learning Java with me don't forget to
subscribe to my channel and I will see
you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
