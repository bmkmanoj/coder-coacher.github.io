After Effects tutorial and in this
tutorial it's going to be real quick I
just want to teach you guys about
something called scale and what this
does is make your objects grow and
shrink so if you are watching my last
tutorial I'll show you guys how to make
your objects fade in and out so let's go
ahead and any keyframes that are in your
opacity let's just go ahead and get rid
of them just highlight them and press
Delete and to get out of opacity just
highlight your object whatever object
you're working on and press s this will
change it from whatever it was to scale
again that's s for scale highlight your
object press s from here we want to go
press home on your keyboard this will
bring you to the first frame in your
animation and go ahead and click the
stopwatch to make sure that there's a
box around it once there is a box around
it as you know if you've been watching
my last tutorials now we can begin
editing the keyframes if there is not a
box around it and you try to edit
keyframes won't work so hook it make
sure there's box around it the first
thing that we're going to actually the
first thing that we're going to go over
is these numbers right here this is your
X scale right here X means how wide your
object is and the Y means how tall your
object is so if you want to make it grow
one way or another you have to edit one
of these but well I'm going to keep mine
on is on this this little chain right
here means that your arm aspect ratio is
locked that means whenever you're
editing scale whenever you edit one of
these the other one changes with it so
your object is always proportional if
you have this unlocked then whenever you
change one of these numbers your object
is only going to grow a width or height
it's not going to grow proportional like
um to scale so make sure if you want
your object to go proportional and just
don't want it to grow taller or wider
then make
sure this chain is locked so since we're
on our very first keyframe the first
thing that I'm going to want to do is
I'm going to want to shrink Sammy since
we're going to be wanting him to grow so
go ahead and click on any of these
values and I'm going to change it to 10
and as you can see one Sammy shrunk to
10% and also the Y value shrunk with it
this is because as I was talking about
the aspect ratio is locked the next
thing I'm going to want to do is move my
current time indicator to about 3
seconds now I'm going to tell After
Effects all right at the very beginning
I want them to be 10% but at 3 seconds
I'm going to change this value I'm going
to want them to be um let's go 60% now
as you can see Sammy grew to 60% again
10 at the beginning 60 at the end so
let's go to the beginning again let's go
ahead and press space and watch what
Sammy does as you can see he gradually
grows from 10 60% and that is how you
edit scale in After Effects so again go
to the keyframe change the value of
scale and another way that you can
change the value let me work on this
keyframe another way that you can change
the value is again scrub these values
click and drag to the left or right and
as you can see Sammy is now shrinking
and growing so let's a scrub this value
down to 10 make another keyframe at the
beginning scrub it all the way up to
about 100 and one last time let's see
what Sammy can do
press space grow shrink one more time
grow shrink Sammy the sausage the ladies
and gentlemen so that is how you change
scale and After Effects I hope you guys
learned it pay attention to how you
scrub the values
in scale and once you learn everything I
cover in this tutorial then you're ready
to move on to the next tutorial so thank
you guys for watching and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
