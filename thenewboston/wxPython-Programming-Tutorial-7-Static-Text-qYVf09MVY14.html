tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
to be going over something called static
text now what static text is is pretty
much just plain text just output it on
your screen now I taught you guys how to
get text and buttons and also how to get
information from users where you can put
text on the screen but anytime that they
enter information you want to get that
information and variables or something
you just want to be able to print the
screen and static text is the plain is
the same as like plain text or basic
text so pay attention I'll show you how
to do it's really simple to get static
text you need to write W X dot static
text make sure your speller right and
this is the way you get static text
right there now this takes a few
parameters the first one it takes is the
parent and I'm gonna put mine in panel
your next is your ID number you usually
want to have this at the negative one
and inside your third parameter you just
write this is that it's X or at every
one and you can write whatever you want
but this is pretty much the text that's
going to show up on the screen now this
is all playing the simple but the fourth
parameter is the position of the static
text so again I want mine 10 crossed and
10 down from the top left corner so what
this is going to do is print me out a
static text that's inside my panel and
it's just gonna say this is static text
and it's going to be 10 down and 10
across from the top left corner so let's
go ahead and run this and we'll see what
we got this is static text and see this
top left corner is zero zero so this T
begins 10 down and 10 across from that
so that's static text in aka plain text
and yes it is very plain but luckily we
have a way to spruce this up a little
bit and what we can do is set a custom
foreground and background color so it's
not just gray in black so go ahead and
make a text object called custom or you
can name it whatever you want and let's
go ahead and create another static text
static text so custom is
be equal to whatever this text is so
let's go ahead and create panel again
negative one again and write something
different this time right like this is
custom or something like that
and you want this in a different
position than you did before so instead
of ten ten don't put it ten ten or I was
just going to overlap the last one you
can have a ten across they'll both put
it put it like thirty down and now we
have a new text that's right below this
that says that this is custom so the way
you change the foreground color and
background color of this is like this
put custom dot set foreground color and
remember dispell color this weird way
it's like the british way or english way
or something nazi olor like we spell in
english i don't know why they must have
made it over there but and set this
foreground color to something like white
and this is the foreground color is your
text color and the background color is
gonna be what's below that or behind it
more legit so let's go ahead and set the
background color by putting custom set
background color and also you need to
spell this one weird and said this one
equal to something like blue or
something doesn't really matter let me
tell you this up a bit that's what she
said and let's go ahead and run this and
see what we got we have this is static
text and this is custom again notice
that this is ten across and thirty down
with our position parameter right here
but we also set the foreground to white
and remember the text is a foreground in
the background to blue and that's the
background or you probably name it
highlight if you're used to working with
microsoft word or something
so aside from that we can also do one
more thing that i want to go over and
that's align the text now whenever
you're aligning text you need two
different parameters and it's pretty
much the same on this but the other
parameters you need is the size of
you're pretty much the size of your
background when you use default
sighs it automatically puts it to the
size of your letter so if you want it to
left or right it wouldn't be able to
tell the difference so let's go ahead
and make this 260 wide and you can put a
however big you want I'm gonna put
negative 1 and when you put it negative
1 tall it's automatically as tall is the
letters in it so you usually want to do
that if you put it like 30 or something
you're gonna have a lot of extra space
and after this what you need to do is
write WX a line underscore Center and
this is gonna align it to the center
so let me show you guys what this does
and then I'll talk you through what we
did right here is build a background
that's 260 pixels wide and then we use
this WX a line underscore Center all in
caps I don't know if you can see it but
what that did is made it a line in the
center and let me show you guys what
happened if instead of this negative 1/4
height you added something else if you
added something like 30 then when you're
on it you'd get it like a lot bigger
than you would want and if you add it at
something less than 10 which is I
believe like 3 or something when you ran
it you'll get a little sliver of color
and it'll cut off your text so that's
why you want to usually do negative 1
and this will give you the effect you
are going for most of the time right
there so that's how you make static text
and also how you change your foreground
color and background color and also how
you align it to the center and you can
also align it to the right in you don't
need to run align it to left because
that's the default but that's how you
make static text in how you spruce it up
a bit with colors in the line so thank
you guys for watching and don't forget
