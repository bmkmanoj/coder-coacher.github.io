tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and this tutorial I'm going to be
showing you how to use the remove and
replace methods in the string class so
all you're going to need for this
tutorial is a button and once you have
that on your form let's double click on
it so a right here of the string called
sentence and it's equal to hello my name
is Adam will say we just want to remove
this hello and the comma well to do that
we're going to be using the remove
method so first we're just going to
create a new string I'm just going to
call it after I guess and we'll study
equal to this string only with hello
remove so in order to do that we're
going to use the remove method like I
said before so it's going to place
sentence which is the name of our string
up here and then we're going to use the
dot operator to access the remove method
and just do a move and as you can see
just like the substring method there are
two different parameters you can use you
can either have an in start index and
that will just start at a point and then
remove to the end or you can specify a
start index and account or how many it
will move so we're just going to have it
removed hello here so we're going to
start a zero and then the count since we
don't want it to remove the entire
sentence or the whole string we want it
to just remove this hello so we're going
to count so if indeed one two three four
five six seven if you want to throw this
space as well so we're going to put
seven here and then we're just going to
display this after string in a message
box just to make sure that we did it
correctly all right so now in a debug
should just get a message box that says
my name is Adam because it removed the
hello comma in the space following the
problem yep exactly what we wanted
say we want to remove just Adam well we
can do that you just have to count all
the way until you get to Adam and the
easiest way that I found to count is you
just put your cursor at the beginning or
wherever you want to start removing and
just hold shift and then just hit on
your arrow key to the right so then you
can just count how many times you hit
the arrow key so there's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 so 18 so
we're going to want to start removing at
18 we're going to put 18 and then we
want it to just move to the end you
don't want to see the period so we don't
need this second one so now I'll just
start removing here and it will just
remove the rest of the string so now we
should just get a message box it says
hello my name is and then nothing yep
exactly what we wanted or if you wanted
to remove this space right here we
started removing here you want to remove
this space you could just put 17 there
and a room the space well you can't
really tell but it didn't so that's it
for the remove method we're not going to
be looking at the replace method so say
want to replace this hello with hi well
in order to do that we're just going to
use the replace method so we're just
going to do place and in here you can
put there are two things below you can
put either a character like replace a
character with another character or
replace a string the different string
and if we wanted to replace Hello with
hi
we'd be replacing one string with
another string so the old one is going
to come first so the one that you want
to replace to want to replace hello with
something and then the second parameter
is what you want to replace it with and
we want to place it look hi
we're going to put hi there so now what
it will do is a real cool it will
replace hello with hi so we should get a
message box it says hi comma my name is
Adam yep
and you can also do this with characters
for example if you wanted to replace all
the A's with the letter one well in
order to represent a character in
c-sharp you just do a single quote and
now we're just going to put a character
in here we're going to replace a
lowercase a with a B actually not
something we can shuffle a zero so we're
going to replace the letter A with a
zero so instead of a saying name whether
I should say no one would go zero and
should say add Dome instead of Adam the
out they replace all the A's with a zero
and remember a place replaces all
instances of this character and the same
thing with a string so if we were to
have two holes right here and then
you're placed on hello with hi I will
replace all instances of Hello with hi
so replace this hello and this hello
so again book here you should get high
comma my name is Adam and then hi you
know it places all the instances of it
and that's very important so that's
pretty much it for this tutorial so see
you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
