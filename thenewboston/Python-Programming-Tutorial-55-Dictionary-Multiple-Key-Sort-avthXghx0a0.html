this video I'm going to show you how to
sort custom objects using multiple
different attributes it's actually going
to be really useful but before we begin
I need to ask you guys something
have you ever heard the term I ship
something I was actually texting a girl
uh yesterday and she goes I ship yada
yada yada and I go you ship something
what's that mean was that like a typo or
what the heck are you talking about she
goes now that's like a saying now when
you say I ship something it means you
really like something and I thought she
was just messing with me but then I
looked it up online and apparently
that's like a saying now so if anyone
ever heard before then let me know maybe
I'm just like a way out of the loop um
for those of you who do say that don't
anymore because it sounds stupid but I
don't know learn something new every day
so anyways go ahead and type from
operator import item get ur figure it's
a minute in this video now much work
learning some actual Python now and what
I'm going to do is I'm going to show you
guys how to sort a custom this is
actually more often than not going to be
a bunch of custom objects but for this
tutorial I just have a bunch of
dictionaries in here so each object is
of course has multiple attributes these
ones just have a first name and last
name and I'm going to show you guys how
to sort these and then I'm going to show
you guys why sorting them that way is a
problem and how to do it properly so we
want to go ahead and sort these by I
don't know first name why not so I'm
going to write X in sorted all right
first thing of course what do you want
to sort users so anything we can really
users and what attribute do you want to
sort by so instead of just saying okay
sort these by whatever default method
you have we know that we can actually
access the attributes so we can sort by
either first name or last name pretty
cool how do we do that the key or the
thing that we want to sort by equals
item getter and this is just like
attribute getter essentially F&amp;amp;A
cool cool everyone's going to be sorted
by their first name let's just go ahead
and print this out and all right Amanda
Burnie Tom looking good wait a minute
look at this right here see whenever
it's sorted all the Tom's it didn't
really sort it in a true alphabetical
order because it has Tom Roberts
then Tom Williams and then Tom Jones I
mean if this was a true alphabetical
sort it would be Jones then Roberts then
Williams
so I mean go back here and let me go
ahead and sort by L name and that should
fix that problem what the heck
look at this it's ordered by last names
but whenever sorted by you know this
group Robert says it has Bucky Tom and
Amanda
so I mean Amanda should be first and
then Bucky and then Tom so how the heck
do we sort it in true alphabetic order
where let's say we want to sort by first
names but then those subgroup of let's
say Williams is we want to sort those
further by last name so what we can do
is this
I'm just go ahead and print out a little
separator line and I'm just doing that
because I'm going to post all the source
code on my github page so if you guys
want to sort by one attribute I'll keep
that there too but what I want to do is
I want to pretty much do the same thing
before I'm going to sort users but now
for Mikey come on autocomplete I was
good I don't I get angry like when I
just don't type in one like symbol and
I'm like oh my god autocomplete can you
not just type the rest of my code for me
all these cool features for i DES they
just made me incredibly lazy but you
know I don't know whatever all right so
just like before we're going to sort by
item getter but instead of just having
one attribute in here such as f name
says that didn't give us the desired
results we can actually throw in another
attribute so what we're saying right
here is go ahead get all of these items
and first sort them by their four
name now once you have all these items
sorted by their first names look at the
individual groups of names and then sort
those further by last name really
awesome so now let's go ahead and print
this out so this one was default one and
look at the Tom's in the first one
Roberts Williams and Jones that's not
right the second one however it sorts
all of the objects by their first name
and then once it has sorted it goes
further and sorts them by last name so
now this is a true alphabetical sort
where everything even the subgroups are
sorted properly so a lot more useful
especially whenever you're trying to you
know like make a database and find stuff
a lot quicker so there you go so yeah
again I'm probably going to go look at
some more terms on Urban Dictionary and
yeah maybe you guys want study some more
Python so actually I'll probably just
make another video so I'll see you guys
then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
