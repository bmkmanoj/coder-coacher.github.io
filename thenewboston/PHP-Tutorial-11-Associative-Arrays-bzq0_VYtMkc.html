tutorial and last time I talked to you
guys about an array as you can see right
here and this now I'm going to talk to
you guys about something a little
different and it's called an associative
array and instead of last time where you
just use numbers as you can see before
you just use 0 1 2 to link it to a
string of text I'm going to show you
guys how to use text to link it to
string of text using a technique called
an associative array and what this is is
associate a word with another word so
let's just type in a variable and I'll
call this variable actions and of course
we have to set equal to array to let it
know we're doing an array and inside
your parentheses you need to type a word
that you want to link to another word
and here's how you do that um let me
think
let's use fingers and I want to link it
to hand so here's what I do I type in
the equal sign in the greater than sign
and then I type in the word hand and
what this does is instead of having a
number if you just type this in then the
hand would have the label 0 instead it
gives it the value fingers and you'll
see what this means in a second
I'm just typing some more um might as
well use toes and we will link it to
book
and we'll just do one more for fun let's
just do teeth and we'll lick it some
mouth
so now we have three associative arrays
fingers linked to hands toes tell it
we're talking about the foot and teeth
since we're talking about the mouth now
when we go to the next line we can echo
these using a similar fashion as before
so say we wanted to echo or output
on-screen the word hand all we would
have to do is type echo and type the
variable actions and then inside of your
parameters instead of typing zero or one
or two like we did before you type in
the word at the beginning such as
fingers and what this does got to put
that in quotation marks and says your
string and what this does it says all
right we have the variable actions and
inside we have the parameter fingers and
we want it to link it to hand so let's
save this and take a look at what it
looks like as you can see it output at
hand on the screen
and this is a different way of labeling
here raised instead of just zero one two
when you actually want to use a word to
remember it instead of just a number it
makes it a lot more simple in just a
different way and this again is called
an associative array and it associates a
string of text with another string of
text using the equals and greater than
sign that looks like an arrow so you can
remember it easier thanks bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
