the last video what we did is we created
this little playlist component so from
here what we need to do is we actually
need to take this and add it to our main
app component so why do we have to do
this well remember whenever our angular
application first boots up the only
component that knows about is our root
component so that's why over in our root
component what we need to do is we need
to actually import any other components
that we're going to be working with that
way angular knows that they exist so
we're going to need to import this
playlist component and also since later
on we're going to be adding videos to it
I'm just going to import this videos
class right now so import video from
video and also import what I named this
class playlist component
from play this dot component alright so
now we have those files imported and
actually what I'm going to do right now
is actually just take this HTML and
separate it away like we did in the
playlist component so I don't need to
copy that not that lazy alright so I'm
going to make a new file called app dot
component now right now this is named
typescript so we're just going to name
this one HTML and remember anytime we're
using a separate UML file we need to
include template URL and actually let me
actually just take this and plop it
right in there and that's another thing
you can actually bind and you don't have
to change anything you don't have to
like write the file path or anything
else you can actually just bind your
variables right in those templates so
let me copy this and then let me paste
it right here and of course this is your
app component and looking good so the
one other thing that you need to do is
whenever you include other components
you actually need to setup your
directives so a directive is just your
way of telling a year that hey we're
going to make some new custom HTML in
other words we made this component so
you're going to see a tag called
playlist just like this don't type this
in so we're eventually going to have a
tag like that
so whenever you come across that don't
freak out because it's just some custom
HTML that we created so in order to
declare that you write directives and
then you actually stick that in between
square braces just like this so now
everything is set up beautifully what we
can do now is we can actually just start
making a list of videos so in your app
component class I am just going to name
this videos name it whatever you want
favorite videos my videos whatever and
it's going to be an array now the type
of this is going to be video
boom roasted so I'm actually want to set
this up later
so in our constructor what we can do is
we can actually just start adding videos
to this and let me give myself a little
bit more space I like to be able to
scroll all around art so I'll just say
this videos my list of videos I'll just
put two in there by default so whenever
our program first boots up we'll have
like two or three videos and then later
on I'm going to show you guys how to add
them manually through some other awesome
techniques but for right now I'll just
make a list of videos so whenever we
want to create a new video object will
just write new video and then whatever
information so new video and again we're
going to be filling all of these IDs in
arm dynamically through our program but
right now since we're just creating
these by hand we'll just assign them
manually so my first video I have a
couple line up right here I'll just
write installing Django and what is the
video code of this and what description
can I give it a how to install Jake if
you guys don't know Django then I would
recommend it it's pretty sweet and now
for another one all right Oz from the
wilderness
scribing the wilderness
this is the video code and I'll say
blocky odd goes liking whatevs alright
so just find any two random YouTube
videos and there you go everything looks
good so now we have a list of videos but
check this out in our app component HTML
we didn't even include that playlist
anywhere so remember just like including
normal HTML tags whether it's a heading
a paragraph whatever since we declared
this selector right here we can now
include it using the playlist keyword so
what this is going to do is it's going
to include this component inside this
component pretty awesome eh so now go
back in your main page and check it out
so this is actually our playlist
component again we didn't actually put a
playlist in there yet obviously but this
is how we can see that everything is
working beautifully so this overall
thing is our app component and it's
composed of this heading with a playlist
underneath so that ladies and gentlemen
is not only how you make smaller
components but how you can combine them
and put them together into bigger
components so in the next video we have
to figure out a way to get this list of
videos and we need to figure out how to
pass it to this component so we can
actually display this list so it's going
to be pretty fun I'll see you guys next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
