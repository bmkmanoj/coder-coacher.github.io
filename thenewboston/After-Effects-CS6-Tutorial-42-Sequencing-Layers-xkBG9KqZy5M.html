Blackford here with another After
Effects cs6 tutorial and this tutorial
is going to be about sequencing your
layers and other things that can help
you with editing your layers so pretty
much it's editing your layers so I'm
gonna start off with sequencing and what
that does is puts your layers into
sequential order in the timeline and
it's good for such things as creating
creating slideshows or if you're kind of
like editing your footage inside After
Effects to be a little quicker then you
can do it that way also and it even
creates things like cross the dissolves
and stuff so what I'm gonna do first is
just select a few images here and I'm
just going to drop them down into the
timeline and they all overlap on top of
each other now I want all these to be on
the screen for one second actually I'll
do two seconds how many do I have one
two three four five six all right so
that's long enough so around two seconds
there now I'm you have to click on your
first one and in whatever order you
start clicking it's going to sequence
them in that order so if i just
shift-click on the bottom it's just
gonna do this so right click and then
come up here at the keyframe assistant
and then come over here to sequence
layers and i'm gonna uncheck overlap for
now and i'm gonna hit okay and now you
can see what i'm talking about what it
does so it's it started the two enough
one first and then the McChicken ones
which i selected last was at the end so
I'm gonna hit control Z now if I decide
to hold control and click on random once
watch how a sequences the layers
there you go
but it's still a continuous it's going
to be all continuous now it's rendering
the RAM preview button but I'll just
I'll just go across on the screen and
you can see that they go in and sync
sequence there all right I'm gonna hit
controls need to go back and turn off
this sequencing text now if you want to
add crossfades and things like that
let's go back up to sequence layers and
you click on this overlap here and you
can have a few different transitions
dissolve the front layer you can or you
can cross dissolve both of them together
which I usually think looks better so
lets you can select how long it takes to
crossfade them and let's try since we're
24 frames a second maybe like how about
12 frames maybe yeah that might that
might be decent so if I do a Ram preview
you can see what's going on there it
crosses AHS for us and that's how you
make easy slideshows no need to really
use like PowerPoint anymore if I select
these and I hit you to bring up all the
keyframes you can see what's going on
here the opacity of these has changed
it puts opacity keyframes in there for
you
right
now I'll just show you what it does when
you use the the other option when
dissolve front layer so we'll do that
now if we hit you again to show the
keyframes you can see it only dissolves
the top and you can that's this is how
it looks I mean you don't really want to
use that for slideshows I think of it it
looks stupid now instead of just
dragging all your footage into the comp
here you can create a comp and have the
sequence layer menu come up so if I have
these selected and I click and drag them
onto this new comp here now we have the
chance to create a single composition
with with the sequence layers down here
so you pick which you pick which picture
you want the comp to uses the dimensions
from so I'll take this McDouble one I
think that was the biggest now if I
click click on sequence layers now I can
have them cross dissolve and I open up
this new comp and it already makes it
there you go it already makes it so that
I can sequence the layers and it does it
until the end of the comp which is nice
so that's it for sequencing your layers
pretty easy pretty handy use it mostly
with slideshows or if you're editing
footage so use that next time you need
to do any of that stuff I look forward
to seeing you guys on the next tutorial
see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
