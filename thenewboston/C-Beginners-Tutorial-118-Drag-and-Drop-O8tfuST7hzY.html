c-sharp tutorial that I'm making for the
new Boston and in this tutorial I'm
going to be showing you how to use
drag-and-drop so the user will be able
to drag a file onto your program and
then your program at ulta so for this
tutorial you're going to need to have a
panel so this go through tool box and
drag a panel over to the form first
thing we're going to want to do is set
the border style equal to fit single
just so that we have a black line around
our panel and you can actually see where
our panel is but you obviously don't
need this the next thing you're going to
want to do is change the allowed drop
property to true and this will just
allow the user to actually drop data
onto your form right here or on to your
planet then we're going to want to go
over to the events tab and scroll down
to drag over and this basically this
event will occur when user drags
anything basically over this panel and
when you to drag information over the
panel we're going to make it appear as
though you can drop something so the
users icon or cursor icon will change to
like you know it will drop some more so
to do that we're just going to go into
these event arguments right here and
we're just going to set the dot effect
you set that equal to drag drop effects
dot all so that they can drop anything
so that they can drop anything they want
onto this panel right here so now in AD
bug and if you just drag a file over
here you can see that your cursor
changed and it looks such you can drop a
file right there but since we haven't
programmed it for when you drop a file
nothing will happen on the drop it yeah
so what we're gonna have to do is go
over to the events once again and go
over to drag drop and this will occur
when user drops a file or
vision on to the panic so what we're
going to want to do is retrieve
information about that data and we're
going to want to get the path to the
files of user drops on that panel so
we're going to use once again the event
ARBs class we say e data we're going to
want to retrieve data and then we're
going to want to use the get data method
in order to retrieve data and right here
at calls for a format and anytime it
calls for a format or just automatically
to jump to the data formats class
because it says right here for you to
find format so it says predefined
formats in there so you don't have to
remember all the different types of
formats so we're just going to say data
formats dot file drop and this returns
an object so we're going to have to
convert it into a string array so that
we can access all the files that are the
pass through all the files of these are
drops we're going to pass this at swing
around and then I'm going to obviously I
set this equal to UA string array since
we've passed it so I'll just call those
files all right so now this files string
array should basically be equal to oh
crap okay
it should basically be equal to um all
the paths to the files that the user
opens earning drags on this panel right
here so now we're just going to loop
through every single file inside of this
string right here and if a message box
show the path to it so we can say for
each string pass I'll say files here is
going to have a message box play that
pass so we can say s all right so now we
debug here and we drop files on here you
should get a message box for each of
them and you get a path to them oh yeah
there we go there we go perfect so
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
on using drag-and-drop so
see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
