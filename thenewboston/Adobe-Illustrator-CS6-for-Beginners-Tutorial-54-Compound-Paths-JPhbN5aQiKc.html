Illustrator cs6 tutorial on the new
boston youtube channel today we're gonna
learn about creating compound paths and
we're gonna start working with them to
make a single it's made up it's a single
object made up of two or more objects so
when I click on this path here as you
can see everything is getting
highlighted as well because all these
paths together make up one compound path
I click on the actual shape you can see
everything selects and when I move it
around everything will be together it's
almost like they're grouped together but
they're not so let's start and go I'll
show you how to make one of these let's
select an object we can select anything
we want and select some more objects to
put inside of it I'll grab some of these
here's a star couple stars maybe some
triangles and now we've got the makings
that we can use for a compound path it
can just be one object you can be
several that is up to you go ahead take
your drill X selection tool and select
everything we're gonna go up to object
and we're gonna come down here to
compound mat paths and click on make
it's gonna cut everything out kind of
like a cookie cutter does I click on it
and drag you know you've done it right
because everything gets cut out and you
have pretty much like everything's
together so what happens if you wanted
to make these paths but you didn't want
them to cut it out like that I'll show
you how to do that to go into window and
go to appearance and go to our direct
selection tool and select paths click
off and then select the path or I didn't
want to go to appearance I wanted to go
to attributes my bad
appearance back in their attributes is
what we want you want to make sure all
the options are showing so go to you
want to go to show all
and then this section here or says
reverse pass direction off and on you
want to click on that and then it's
gonna fill in the ones that you want so
I can select my paths and fill them all
in if I want to do or take them all out
so that's how you do that no what if you
decide that you don't want all these in
here or you don't want some of them in
here you can go to take them out of
there go to let me let me turn that at
your buddy back on for these just grab
everything looks like I have to select
them separately there we go
it's easier to see and explain like that
and then maybe we want to take this
triangle out let's go to object compound
path we've gotta select everything it
looks like object compound path and then
go to release and now if I go ahead and
want to grab one of these we'll clicked
at my accident I could take it out of
the compound path that's not a compound
path anymore but I could take it out and
that way it won't be in the compound
path I can make if you want to add more
things to the compound path you just you
go through the same process you just go
to object compound path and go to make
again and it'll add the cutouts so there
you go that's the creating of a compound
path now if you want to include your
strokes within the compound path you're
gonna have to outline the stroke the way
you do that is go to object path and
then go to outline stroke and it's gonna
have everything selected there for you
now if I select these and go to object
compound path make
see it's going to make it with the
stroke and mind and and now since the
stroke has was already in there it's
doubled or tripled the width of the
stroke and when I go to move this you
can see that I'm gonna hit the undo
buttons a few times so that's how you
add the path and with it as well that's
all I want to show you about creating
compound pets and thank you so much for
watching give the video a like button
