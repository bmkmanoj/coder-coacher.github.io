tutorial in the UDK and in this tutorial
what we're gonna be doing is kind of
preparing our level a little better
getting it ready so we can start working
with kismet so the very first thing that
we need to do is we need to add
something called a trigger to our level
so in order to do that go ahead where
the light meets the dark on your level
go ahead and right click somewhere in
there and we want to add an actor and
the actor that we want to add is a
trigger now what a trigger is in the UDK
it's basically like a switch in real
life it's something that your user can
interact with to turn something on and
off look at it it even looks like a
switch that's probably why they named it
a trigger so now that we have that
trigger there doesn't have any
functionality it's just basically
sitting there on the screen so you can
tell already that this is a game element
and whenever we right-click and hit play
from here then it's not going to be
visible so what we want to do is just
for testing purposes we want that to be
visible whenever we play our level so go
ahead and double click it and we're
gonna change the setting in here to make
sure that it's visible and that is if
you go under display you can see by
default it's hidden and this checkbox
means that it is indeed hidden whenever
we play our level if you go ahead and
deselect that then our trigger is no
longer hidden so let me go ahead and
demonstrate this if we go ahead and
right-click and hit play from here we
can now see our trigger whenever we're
playing our game right there so another
thing that I forgot to do is actually
rebuild my lighting so I'm gonna go
ahead and build that and while I'm doing
that I guess I'll talk about this what
we're gonna be adding is right where the
static mesh is I'm gonna be adding a
toggle light so right now we just added
a regular point light and that point
light is going to stay on all the time
but this trigger right here is going to
control this light and this light is
going to have the functionality to turn
on and off so we don't want to add a
regular point light because point lights
just stay on all the time so what we
need to do
is we need to add a toggle point light
and in order to do that here's what we
do go up to where is it
view browser windows actor classes and
expand lights in under point lights look
for a point light toggle now just go
ahead and select that and now that you
have that selected you can just exit out
of here and now what you need to do is
over by your static mesh actually I'm
just going to click anywhere and I could
I can move it around later go ahead and
right click and press add point light
toggle here and whenever you add that
you get your point light tog bowl and
again like I said I'm just gonna adjust
it right now
from a my top two use the easiest just
slide that over right there again you
don't want it to sit right inside your
static mesh the rest are gonna get some
weird weird shadows so just make sure
it's sitting right outside your static
mesh right there so that looks pretty
good
so now here's our lighting system with
our regular light right here and if we
go scroll up here we can see that the
toggle light is right by the static mesh
so this is the light that we're going to
be controlling with this light switch or
trigger right here
so using this trigger we're going to be
turning this light on and off
however here's what I want to do by
default as soon as we start our level
well it's not going to work because I
didn't build my lighting but as soon as
we start our level this light is gonna
be on by default and I actually want to
turn this light off by default so as
soon as we start our level we need to
turn it on so in order to do that you
can either double click your light or if
you select and hit f4 it's going to
bring up the properties window and now
when you're looking at the light
properties go down to light light
component light component and enabled
right here you can see if you hover over
it says is the light enabled this pretty
much means is the light on or off by
default now by default whenever you add
a talkable light it's on but we want to
add that off by default and as you can
see in my level the light shuts off so
now we have
everything we have to set up for this
level we have a regularity
this is basically just working like so
when we first started a level we're not
lost in the dark this doesn't really
have any functionality that we're going
to be messing with we added our trigger
that our user can run into to turn the
light on and off we have our static mesh
of the light and we have our toggle
light that's going to be flickering on
and off whenever we hit that trigger so
now what we need to do is hop in the
kismet and actually piece everything
together so what I'm gonna be doing is
whenever I I stop this tutorial I'm
gonna rebuild my light so make sure
between this tutorial and the next story
that you rebuild your light too so you
can follow along with me so that's what
I'm gonna be doing and in the next story
we're gonna be hopping in the kismet and
piecing all these pieces together so
