opposites and absolute values the
opposite is when you take the opposite
sign of something so say you had
positive five if you took the opposite
of it you would have negative five and
when you take the absolute value which
is indicated by these bars right here
you take the positive value so opposite
is just the opposite value absolute
means the positive value so for this
when you take the opposite sign of five
see and 90 so we get negative 5c -9 D
and for our absolute value we would do
the subtraction inside the absolute
value bars so you get negative two and
then these bars tell you to take the
positive value so the positive value of
negative 2 is positive 2 okay so now
we're gonna do some examples so I have
negative 12 and I want the absolute
value of negative 12 so that means that
our answer is going to be 12 so I have
the absolute value of negative 25 which
is 25 minus the absolute value of 14 of
negative 14 which is 14 and if I
subtract those two I'll get 11 okay so
these once again are brackets that means
you do what's inside the brackets and
then you add so I'm going to take
negative 18 plus I have negative 13 this
minus outside tells me to take the
opposite value so these this becomes
positive so I've plus 13 so negative a
negative 18 plus 13 gives me negative 5
okay so this negative out front tells me
that I want the opposite value of each
so this is gonna be positive it's gonna
be positive so then I'm gonna get 2x
plus 3y okay now when I have this
negative out front it tells me to take
the opposite this 2 right here tells me
to multiply each one of these terms by 2
and this night and this negative tells
me to take the opposite side so I'm
gonna have this is positive 3 so I'm
going to take the opposite sign which is
a negative of 2 times 3 which is 6 and
then this M Squared stays the same I
have negative 2 M so I'm gonna take the
opposite which is positive of 2 times 2
which is 4 M and then this last one is
negative 1 and take the opposite of
which is positive of 2 times 1 which is
2 and here I have opposite absolute
value - absolute value so what I want
you to realize is that this negative
right here can be written as plus
negative 9 absolute value of negative 9
so this lets me know that I'm going to
take the opposite of the absolute value
of negative 3 and the opposite of the
absolute value of negative 9 so I have
the opposite sign um-
absolute value of negative 3 the
absolute value of negative 3 is positive
3 but I have this opposite out front
plus the opposite of the absolute value
of negative 9 which is 9 so I'm negative
3 plus negative 9 which gives me
negative 12 so that's all we're gonna do
with opposites and absolute values
make sure you come back we're going to
talk about how to combine like terms of
equations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
