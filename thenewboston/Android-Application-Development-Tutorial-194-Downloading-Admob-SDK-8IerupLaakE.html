and ninety fourth Android tutorial for
the new Boston and pretty much your
applications done all what we need to do
is maybe monetize it you know add some
ads on there and hopefully get some
clicks and you know make pennies and all
that great stuff you know pennies can go
a long ways but that's what we're gonna
do we're gonna set up ads with our
application but before we do that we
need to download the jar to put
incorporate AdMob within our application
also these last few tutorials we're
going to show you how to you know sign
your application which we kind of did
with the Google Maps as well as you know
put it on the market place and probably
show you guys how to update your
application just in case you need to do
that as well so what we need to do first
is you know get the jar so we can use
some ads ad type methods and refreshing
our ads and all that good stuff and make
sure the connection goes through and you
know you get paid your pennies or
dollars or whatever so what we're gonna
do is we're gonna go to a site called
AdMob comm and we're gonna use AdMob to
put ads within our within our
application so you guys will have to
register you know register for this it's
free so nothing to worry about there but
I'm not gonna go through the
registration process it's pretty much
like signing up for anything else and
then once you do that you want to go to
this marketplace tab here and I'm
probably gonna blur out my information
because I'm sure it's against the rules
if it's anything like Adsense and all
that but you know you might be like well
how much is he making it's not much guys
so trust me on that and also I don't
have any good applications on on this
account so it doesn't really matter but
to what we're gonna do is we're gonna go
down to this button here she's gonna
shoot down to this tab here so just find
a tab like this that says add site or
app and we're gonna click on that and
then what we're going to do is we're
gonna go to the Android app because
that's what we've been developing and we
need to give it some information so app
name we're gonna say the new Boston
basics something like that and what we
need to do now is we have to make that
correlation between our actual package
name and AdMob so we do that with you
know this package URL and all we're
gonna say is market colon forward slash
forward slash details question mark ID
equals and then greater than sign com
dot the new button Boston dot Travis and
then you know lesson sign so that's my
package name again if you guys forget
you just go right here into your project
and here's your package name so just
make sure that that is the exact same
and then we're gonna give it a category
like productivity and we're gonna give
app description now the app description
actually gets viewed by the people at
work at AdMob so you kind of wanna give
it some detailed information so they can
help you or help put the right ads on
your application hopefully you make more
money that way so I'm just gonna say
this is so I just said something like
this is a basic Android programming
example used for teaching Android
development you know and that's probably
good enough if you want to add more
descriptions or more detailed to your
description
feel free it'd probably help you out but
just do that then we're just gonna hit
continue and what we need to do is we
need to download the SDK or the jar that
we're gonna add to our project so we're
just going to click either download here
and it's gonna download to wherever you
guys choose or what we can do is go over
into clips go up to the window tab and
then Android SDK AVD manager we can go
to I'm gonna go to installed packages
because I already have this installed
but this is what you're gonna look for
it is the Google AdMob ads SDK package
and revision to where that's going to be
located is under the available packages
if you guys don't have it downloaded
already third-party add-ons and then the
Google add-ons and it should be
somewhere like right here
actually there's a revision three so
I'll just actually download that and hit
accept all or whatever install and
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
we got our package name registered with
AdMob and we're also downloading the SDK
so we can refer to it in our actual
project I'll catch you guys in the next
tutorial or we'll start getting the
setup and all that great stuff so all
kitchen and have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
