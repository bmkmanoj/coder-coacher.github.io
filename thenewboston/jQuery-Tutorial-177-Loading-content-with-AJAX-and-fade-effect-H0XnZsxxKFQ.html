ahead and test it out load is
essentially a shorthand way of an ajax
call to loads and content into a
particular div which is content area so
now when we refresh and click home you
can see that home the contents of our
home page here is loaded into this div
same with portfolio and the same with
contact so now as easy as it is we just
go ahead and copy this link paste that
and we could say let's just say I don't
know either dot PHP and the only thing I
could think of and then other we can go
ahead and create an other page we could
save that out in pages other dot PHP and
now we've instantly created the same
functionality so we've got this other
link when we click it we load the
content in so that's how easy it is to
go ahead and duplicate the link and
actually you know load in different
pages so now it's gonna save you time
because we've thought about it carefully
and we've taken the attribute from the
link so no need for JavaScript on this
front page so now that we've done this
we wanted to create some effects if I
was to say dot fade in and we'll set a
speed to normal this isn't actually
going to work very well or it won't work
at all and the reason for this is the
div is automatically shown already we
don't have this div here set to hidden
so we're never going to be able to fade
in content that is already shown so just
before the load we want to go and hide
now what this will do is let's just say
we were to click on home or portfolio
we're on at the moment when we go ahead
and click when we go ahead and click on
home this content area div here will be
hidden then the content will be loaded
in and then it will fade in so it's
essential that we get these bound
functions in the correct order
enable to actually get the effect we're
looking for so now that we've hidden the
page prior to loading the content and
fading in will now get that nice fade
effect that you saw at the start of the
tutorial when I demonstrated it and the
links all work properly as well now
let's just say we were to for example
load this content after this fade now
I've already spoken about the importance
of the order you might think yeah I can
hide this fade it in whilst loading the
content but in actual fact now what's
going to happen is when we click on say
portfolio oh it does actually work
alright oh maybe I'm wrong then I'm sure
yeah okay so it's still working all
right but I mean with regards to the
hide here that's extremely important as
well so let's just go change that back
around I mean logically this is the
order that we want to adhere to because
we want to hide it load the content
before it's faded in and then obviously
that will fade in so we've essentially
created the most basic functionality to
a menu with content that we can load in
dynamically now we have got one problem
when we actually open this page up
there's no default page that we have so
we want to go ahead and create a default
page for this so what I'm going to do is
just up here I'm going to go ahead and
say document so we're using the document
selector now when the document is ready
when the event is ready we're going to
create another function much like we did
for this click event handler here I'm
going to pull that down and now here
just here what I want to do is go ahead
and load the first page in the menu or
the first link in the menu now you can
obviously choose to for example only
show content when the page is loaded at
the moment there's no content loaded but
what I'm going to do is I'm going to use
a particular selector that chooses the
first link within this menu top-class
so we can go ahead and say content
area dot load we don't really need to
use effects here there's no real need to
use effects when we actually load the
page in it's nice to then have the
effects once the user is into the
website and they've seen your content
initially but what we want to do is go
ahead and load a particular page so we
want to go ahead and load a particular
selector which is going to be menu top
and this is going to be first we're
loading the first element found with the
class menu top so now that we can do
that we can say dot attribute href and
that will take this value here which
will be the first element href attribute
and then it will load it into this
content area so let's go ahead and check
that out when we come into the page you
can see that the first link has been
loaded
now if we were to for example change
this to last you can probably guess
already this is the last element
therefore when we refresh it will load
the last element so you can see that
using selectors we can actually load in
just the first page or the first menu
item that we have so that is a quick
demonstration of how we can fade in
content and create a nice little menu
system with dynamically loading in
content using the load function in
jQuery which is essentially just a quick
version of an ajax call to load the page
contents into a div so it's extremely
easy to implement and like I've already
demonstrated you can copy and paste
these links choose a new H ref as long
as it belongs to menu class or the class
menu top it will add to your existing
content</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
