thirty-second C++ tutorial and in this
tutorial I am super excited because I'm
going to begin talking to you guys about
something called an array so an array is
basically one of my favorite parts of
C++ because an array is basically a
variable that can store multiple values
and you can do a bunch of cool things
with them and like I said it's one of my
favorite parts dealing with C++ so let's
go ahead and get started
like I said an array is basically a lot
like a variable but instead of just
storing one value like 8 or 20 or you
know 87 it can store multiple values
so you're saying alright that's kind of
weird but let me go ahead and show you
guys how to make one in order to make an
array you first write what data type
you're working with let's go ahead and
make a simple integer array next just
like a variable you type something you
want to call it I'm going to call my
array Bucky because it's pretty cool
name and now right after this with no
space in square brackets you go ahead
and you're right how many numbers in
this case how many integers you want to
store in your array so let's go ahead
and say 5 so what the compiler is going
to do now is it's going to create an
array that can store 5 integers so
whenever you run this your compiler is
going to set aside some space to hold 5
integers so we're saying all right so
now 1 array can hold 5 different
integers pretty cool huh so here is how
well there are a lot of different ways
you can create an array but they're
probably the most basic and easiest to
understand is called an array initialize
your list and an array initializer list
is basically just a list of numbers and
you have to put it in between these
squiggly brackets I don't know the
technical name for them but they're
above the square brackets on your
keyboard and in between it you write a
comma-separated list of 5 numbers so
let's go ahead and print out like um 66
75 2
243 and 99 and that is basically all it
is to create an array so we went ahead
and we created it array called Bucky and
Bucky was able to hold five integers and
whenever we gave it its 5 integers we
had to put it inside something called an
array initializer list so we have 566 75
243 999 so now whenever we want to use
those values you're saying RA say I
wanted to print out one of these values
like two or something so let's go ahead
and see out on Bucky okay well I can't
do that because if I just save the array
name it doesn't know exactly what value
I'm talking about here so in order to
let C++ know what value you want to use
from that array we have to use something
called the array index so let me tell
you guys this first when I said an array
is made up of a bunch of different
values the technical term whenever
you're working with array is called
elements and all they are is values but
you know we have to be professional here
so we're going to call them array
elements so 66 is one element
seventy-five is one element two is an
element so on and so forth so whenever
we want to index a specific element in
our array we go ahead and write the
index number inside our square brackets
so you might be thinking all right the
index number for this one is 1 this one
is 2 and this one is 3 so let's go ahead
and try to print out Buckey 3 and see
what happens let's go ahead and end that
line and we should be expecting 2 right
here so let's print it out and check it
out 43 what the heck I thought it was
going to be 2 okay so
43 is the fourth one not the third one
so what's going on Bucky well the reason
that I printed out 43 is because
whenever we're dealing with computers I
don't know if you guys know a lot about
binary and zeros and ones but you know
how people start counting at 1 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 10 I learned how to get to 10
well computer
they start counting everything with a
zero so whenever we create our array
this first element even though it would
be number one to us to the computer it's
actually element zero so let's go ahead
and print out Bucky zero and as you can
see whenever we run this we get the
number 66 so whenever we are referencing
indexes or excusing the elements in our
array we have to remember that our array
starts counting is 0 so 0 1 2 so this is
actually the two index so let's go ahead
and print out Bucky - and now we go
ahead and we get to right there so again
the basic things I want you guys to
remember is this an array is basically a
variable that can store multiple values
the easiest way to create an array is
this right the data type right your
array name and then right however many
elements you want your array to hold and
we stored five integers in this case so
that's why we passed five integers in in
something called an array initializer
list so basically whenever we create
Bucky five we're telling our computer
our right
Bucky is going to be holding five
different values so compiler go ahead
and set aside some space in our memory
to hold five integers so that's what it
did whenever it created this line and
aside from that I want you guys to
notice this each value in the array I
say value sometimes but technically
they're called an array element and in
order to reference one of those elements
we use something called an array index
and the first element in every array is
index zero so if you wanted to print out
99 it would be zero one two three four
so Bucky four whenever you're around
this program is 99 pretty cool huh so
that's basically the most simple way I
can explain array see you guys again I
said that one way to create an array was
to use an array initialize your list and
the next tutorial I'm going to show you
guys a different way to create an array
and it's a lot cooler way so if you
don't quite understand arrays yet and
quite understand why they would be
useful then just stick around and I
trust me what I say I trust me of course
I trust myself and trust me you guys
will in the upcoming story so again
thank you guys so much for watching and
I'll see you in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
