biology sorrow and in this lesson I want
to start talking about the different
forms of carbohydrates now
carbohydrates are a very complex topic
and there's a lot of crap to cover about
them and they can be classified in
several different ways
but just to give you guys a real basic
understanding I'm going to be showing
you guys the four different I want to
say main classifications of
carbohydrates starting with mono
saccharides and I know my handwriting is
pretty bad but monosaccharides are type
of carbohydrates and they're actually
sugars consisting of three to seven
carbon atoms and I know what you guys
are thinking already you're like whoa ho
whoa first of all you said that they
were carbohydrates but now you're saying
their sugars Buckey make up your mind
what the heck are they believe it or not
sugars are a type of carbohydrate kind
of weird but we'll talk about more about
that later on but for right now uh well
we remember in the last story I told you
guys that glucose had the chemical
formula of c6 h-12 o-6 which of course
means that it's carbohydrate and if we
look at the definition it's a sugar
anything that ends in OSE is a sugar by
the way we'll talk about that when we
get to Sheppard sugars but since the
carbon atoms which is this right here is
three to seven falls in that range which
is six that's why this is a carbohydrate
and it's also a mono saccharide now once
we you know get the step above
monosaccharides above seven carbon atoms
we get something called die saccharides
now disaccharides are actually two or
more or excuse me two monosaccharides
joined together so let's see what we got
let me think of an example glucose is of
course a monosaccharide on something
called fructose you may have heard about
fructose because people say that it's
the fruit sugar fructose is also a
monosaccharides and if you were to
combine
glucose plus fructose you would actually
end up with something called a sucrose
and um this is just the chemical name
for table sugar so sucrose is two
monosaccharides joined together so just
do a recap one last time a disaccharide
right here the definition of this is two
monosaccharides join together so glucose
is a monosaccharide and fructose is a
monosaccharide and sucrose is these two
right here join together and that's why
we call sucrose or table sugar a dye
saccharide now a step above this is
called let me go ahead and get a new
slider right here is called I can't talk
and type in same CC Oh Lego saccharide
now what this is is more than two so
I'll just write a greater than two butts
to ten now it says and I saw her if you
look up the definition in different
places this is what it is and by the way
this is a greater sign right here
not 72 to ten so the definition is this
more than two but usually no more than
ten in your like usually what the heck
kind of scientific definition is that
and that's just because oligosaccharides
and carbohydrates they often come in
some really weird forms so they're like
a more than two but you know ten to
eleven maybe nine anything greater than
this it usually comes as carbohydrates
strung together by like the hundreds and
thousands so just remember that an
oligosaccharide is a carbohydrate that
has more than two but usually no more
than ten monosaccharides join together
so remember whenever I talk about this
I'm talking about mono
Sakurai's not carbon atoms so I won't go
ahead and draw a picture of this because
it would take forever if I draw you know
ten oligosaccharides but the last thing
that I want to go over is
polysaccharides and let me go ahead and
get a new color and uh if you heard that
glugging is the humidifier next to me
and polysaccharides are actually really
common and believe it or not
oligosaccharides are one of the least
common it's the least one we talk about
because it's a really weird range of
numbers right here
however polysaccharides are long chains
of monosaccharides such as you know
glucose fructose that's a definition
long chains and I know that you know
oligosaccharides the definition was you
know two two usually no more than ten
and polysaccharides doesn't have a
number but it just says something like
long chains usually you know thousands
or hundreds and you know these
definitions are kind of weird but once
we talk about sugars and how your body
stores energy and different types of
carbohydrates believe it or not it's
actually going to make sense so
polysaccharide like I said are long
chains of monosaccharides sometimes
thousands of monosaccharides long and
probably the most common one is starch
so starch is polysaccharide made up of a
bunch of glucose glucose it's like
glucose times a thousand if a bunch of
glucose molecules were strung together
and remember glucose is a monosaccharide
then it would be called starch so again
one more time just to embed it in your
brain let's see if we can get this other
so I popped up so carbohydrates come in
one of the four following forms so basic
sugars are three to seven carbon atoms
like you see what's going on here okay
hold on hold on wait for it there we go
all right so sugars are carbohydrates
with three to seven carbon atoms
disaccharides are carbohydrates with
two monosaccharides pretty much put
together
oligosaccharides or oligosaccharides
depending on how you say are more than
two but usually no more than ten
monosaccharides and polysaccharides are
chains of like hundreds and thousands of
monosaccharides so mono die which is to
a lego which is two to ten and poly
which is just like usually hundreds it's
usually not like 13 or 14 usually
hundreds or thousands now in the next
story I want to talk about sugar
specifically because monosaccharides are
something that they're going to take a
lot of information to cover and well you
guys will see in the next video and
hopefully things will start making sense
so if you don't understand everything in
this video don't worry in the next
couple of videos you will I promise
something guys for watching don't forget
to subscribe and I'll see you guys next
