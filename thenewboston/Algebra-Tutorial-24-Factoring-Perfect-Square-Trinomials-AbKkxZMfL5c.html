factoring perfect square trinomials so a
perfect square trinomial will be written
in this form a squared plus or minus two
a B plus B squared and if a trinomial
comes in this form whenever you go to
factor it all you have to do is a plus
or minus B squared
now this plus or minus in the
parenthesis depends on whether this is a
plus two a B or a minus two a B so for
this example x squared minus 14x plus 49
we have to make sure that X is a perfect
square which it is 49 is a perfect
square which is seven squared and that
this can be written as two a which is
one B which is seven well two times
seven is 14 so that means when we write
our perfect square we're gonna take a
which is the square root of x and then
plus or minus but since this is a
negative 14x it's gonna be minus and
then B which is seven squared
so when we will go to factor it this way
we have to make sure that it fits that
formula and if it does you're always
gonna have a single quantity squared so
is this a perfect square well the square
root of 49 is 7 and the square root of X
is X 1 the square root of 1 is 1 and is
this equal to is negative 14x equal to
2a which is 7 7 X and B which is 1 well
negative 14 X is equal to 14 14 X so
that means it is a perfect square
trinomial so when we go to factor it we
take a which we already found with 7 X
at plus or minus but since this is a
negative 14 it's gonna be minus and then
be the square root of B which is 1
squared and if you want to check this
remember that when we have a quantity
squared we have to foil it out 49 x
squared minus 7 X minus 7 X plus 1 and
that is the same thing as up here so
we're gonna do one more example with
factoring perfect square trinomials
they're pretty easy because all you have
to do is recognize them and remember the
little formula that tells you how to
factor so we have to make sure that this
is a perfect square and this is a
perfect square so the square root of 25
is 5 the square root of x squared is X
the square root of 36 is 6 and now we
have to say is this equal to 2 a times B
60 X is equal to times 5x is 10x times 6
is 60 X so yes that does work so now we
take a which is 5x plus or minus but
since this is a positive 60 in the
middle it's gonna be plus the square
root of B squared which is 6 squared so
like I said that's all we're dealing
with perfect square trinomials make sure
you come back watch the next lesson
where we're gonna learn how to factor
normal trinomials that don't follow a
special rule</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
