objective-c tutorial and now that we
already built the interface we can go
ahead and implement this interface and
what implement means of course is we
already have the methods built now we
just couldn't give them instructions on
what to do so let's go ahead and scroll
down and as you can see we already dealt
with person H and this was the interface
so now go ahead to switch person M and
this is the implementation actually
before I even do that go ahead to person
that H and copy all of your declarations
and these can be substituted for the
method headers so now when I'm in person
M it'll make it a lot easier so go ahead
and in another thing I want to take note
of notice that when you ever you put
like import something before we had this
little less than and greater than sign
like import foundation foundation H well
this time we have quotation marks so
what is difference between less than and
greater than sign less than or greater
than in quotation marks quotation marks
means it's a local fire file not fire
that would just be dangerous and that
means that it's in the same directory
like right here so in case you guys were
just a run door and wondering I cannot
talk tonight I apologize guys I'm really
not that sorry but I you know it sounds
nice to apologize for some random things
listen to me ramble on in anyways now
that we got all those declarations we
can go ahead and paste those babies
right here delete all the semicolons and
tighten this up too bit that's what she
said and now we got our method headers
right now so we can go ahead and with
the headers just go ahead and add bodies
and we'll be good
so for print and by the way if you're
wondering why I'm not going over these I
already did all of these in Soria like
six or something so if you want to know
why I'm doing this um go check out that
tutorial but for now I'm just showing
you guys how to move stuff for different
files and at the end I'm gonna put it
all together but anyways
NS log for the print statement in at and
I think it said something like I am
percent I yours old and away that's a
little bit better percent i pounds good
enough and then of course you need to
pass an age and wait and hopefully I
don't got any airs and for set age the
method body for this you scroll down so
you guys can see is real easy age is
equal to whatever you passed in a and
for set wait it's even easier your
weight variable is equal to what you
passed in for W so let me go ahead and
review this make sure I didn't mess up
anything too bad looks good if we have
any errors we'll see them later on I
wanted there we go so anyways now that
we have the interface and implementation
we can go ahead and start working on our
main method now by default I didn't
change anything it gives you this nice
little hello world statement I mean that
is great and all but we really don't
need it now before we even start typing
code in here what we need to do is we
need to import the interface and if you
remember the interface was person H and
I'll show you guys what I'm talking
about in a second so go ahead and import
that is going to be double quotations
person dot H right like there and as you
can see this is what I was talking about
with two different types of import one
with the less-than and greater-than sign
this means that it isn't a local file
and this one person H that means that
this is in the same directory or folder
so let's go ahead and now that we got
that taken care of and make sure your
interface is in port and we can go ahead
and start building an object and again
I'm just gonna build out I'm not going
to talk you guys through because I
already did in like tutorial seven or
something so person it's a pointer I'm
going to name mine
bucky and what you need to do is set
this equal to bracket oops wrong
brackets brackets within brackets and go
ahead and put person allocate memory and
initialize the objects so now we have an
object called bucky we can begin calling
stuff onto it i'm just go ahead and go
ahead let's get one two three four two
three four
i like to get all my annoying stuff out
of the way and then i can type in the
meat so first we want to take this
person called Bucky and set age and set
it equal to twenty three because that's
my age and then we want to take Bucky
and sent oh wait I just had like a
peanut or something - my mouth is gross
and set my way equal to three fifty
because that's my weight and now we want
to call the method Bucky Prince good
enough and after we're done with all
that release the memory my son so let's
go ahead and run this and see what we
messed up on again we're gonna save
everything because they're on the same
directory and succeeded what the heck
how come I've succeeded we must have
done something wrong that's a joke by
the way it means everything worked out
so now it said I am 23 years old and
weigh 350 pounds cool cool beans cool
beans so that in essence is how instead
of a one big file which can kinda get
confusing you make three separate files
an interface and implementation in the
main and you can bring those all
together in your main by creating an
object named Bucky setting age setting
the weight using the print method and
then once you're done releasing it and
in essence that's just what I'm saying
this is how you use different files one
for each on a kind of part of your class
one for the interface one for the
implementation and one for your main
method and that is how everyone programs
in objective-c
so
can you put it all in one file yes but
when you're building huge computer
programs it is very very very
complicated so this is the way we're
going to be programming for now on so
that is why you need to learn it and if
you don't quite grasp it yet I promise
once I start going through the different
and actually building you know you'll
get it eventually that's what I'm trying
to say but for now thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe to my
channel and check out my blog too if you
got some time so thanks again and I'll
see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
