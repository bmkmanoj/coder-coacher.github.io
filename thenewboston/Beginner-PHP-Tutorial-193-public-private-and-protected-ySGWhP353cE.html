and I'm back with another tutorial for
the new Boston now in this video we're
going to look at different properties in
object-oriented programming inside of
classes we're going to be looking at the
public protected and private property
types now let's go ahead and create a
new class I'm going to create a oh sorry
I'm going to create a class and this is
going to be called bank account and
inside this class we're going to address
some property so we're going to create
some properties in here so let's say
we're going to create one and we're just
going to chop and change around with the
public protects and private so let's say
public balance equals three thousand
five hundred so this is a balance of a
bank account I've shown this in my
previous examples and some of the other
tutorials using this code here in which
we create a bank account a we were
either able to put deposit and withdraw
money and also apply it to multiple
users so if you haven't watched that
tutorial already go back and watch that
and you'll probably understand this one
a lot better so our properties well our
property for now is balance now let's go
ahead and create a method so I'm going
to say public function display balance
and what this is going to do is it's
simply going to return this balance now
if you haven't already come across this
this here is a representation of the
class as a whole so what we're doing is
we're taking the balance and bear in
mind we're not using a dollar sign here
we don't use a dollar sign when we're
taking a property value from a class so
we're saying out of this class as a
whole take out the balance so we're
returning this balance value which will
be equal to three thousand five hundred
so now what we can do is outside of our
class we can create a new instance of it
so let's say Alex equals new bank
account
Capital a they remember it
case-sensitive so alex equals new bank
account we don't need the parentheses
there and then what we can do is we can
say echo Alex display balance okay and
remember the parentheses because we're
dealing with methods so we're echoing
out the displayed balance of this
account so let's go over to our browser
and check this out okay so you can see
that we in our browser we have the value
3500 that has been written back to us so
what we've essentially done is use this
method here to return this value here
this property value and then display it
using by calling the method if you like
so now what happens if this data type is
changed to private for example now let's
go back to our page and just with this
simple change when we refresh this time
okay right I see why so what we've
basically list list let's go ahead and
change this program around so we've got
public balance to start with and what
we're doing in here is we're displaying
the balance but what we can do okay so
what we're going to do is we're going to
instead of use this function I'm going
to demonstrate the the public protected
and private by just echoing out the
property inside so what we can do is we
can say echo Alex balance now let's go
ahead and see what's happened
so at the moment we have our property
set to public now let's see what happens
see what happens if we set it to private
and we refresh you see that we've got a
fatal error cannot access private
property bank account balance in now
you'll notice that we've got these two
little colons here as well for a static
value like this we can also do this like
this
so let's go to colons there and it
produces exactly the same result at the
moment oh no it doesn't okay yes so
don't worry about that for now yeah well
we'll leave that out for now not the
point of the tutorial so we're trying to
access this private value but we cannot
so let's change it now to protect it and
press f5 you see that we've now got
another fatal error cannot access
protected property bank account balance
in it tells us what line we're on so
there are different naming standards to
distinguish between different different
private protected or public so let's go
ahead and say public balance or just say
balance so a public variable we usually
be denoted balance and then you will
have camel caps and but the first the
first word if you like will have small
letters so balance of account for
example would denote a public variable
so let's go ahead and refresh this okay
and balance of
I count every up let's just update that
let's go ahead and refresh and oh no
okay so
oh right okay yeah so sorry um let's go
ahead and just put var in there and
refresh so we've got three thousand five
hundred now let's go ahead and change
this to underscore balance okay you can
see that what hot what's happened is
we're saying oh no undefined property
there let's go score balance and refresh
now the value stayed the same but we've
got an underscore balance here and for
protected properties we use an
underscore and then a t so it's just a
mess of a naming standard if you like
for your variables to distinguish
between them so it doesn't actually
change anything but this is how we name
different things so if you remember if
you remember that public is starts with
a small B well in this case and then
we'd have camel caps afterwards a
private would just have an underscore
before it and it protected would have an
underscore and T so you can see that
with the with the public key word we're
able to access the variable outside
however with a protected or private
we're not so let's go ahead and call
this method again so display balance and
let's go ahead and refresh to make sure
everything's working properly okay so
three thousand five hundred now let's
change this to private so what happening
now is we're returning the value inside
here and it's a private data type
whereas before we it didn't last let's
check what happens okay so it comes up
with three thousand five hundred so it's
allowed us to use this private balance
within our class so now let's go ahead
and change this to protect it
let's come in refresh and you can see
that this time it's still displayed it
so you can see that while we're
accessing things inside of our class
protected and private of both going to
allow us to do this
however public is going to allow us to
access it outside now why do we do this
what's the reason for our public
protected and private keywords now if
you were to have a variable inside here
such as the bank account balance that
you didn't want to display allow to be
displayed on its own you can set the
type to private and this means that the
the integer as a whole or the variable
in general as a whole can't be accessed
outside unless a method within returns
that value so for example balance we
want to keep as a private value so we
can't say we can't say echo Alex balance
so this line here will work because we
even though it's private the method
inside of it is accessing this variable
we're not accessing it from the outside
so we're calling a method that is
accessing this variable this property
rather but however echoing out Alex
balance is not going to work because we
are trying to access it from outside and
it is a private property type so that's
just just basically a bit on properties
just so you can get the hang of why we
do them why we give different property
types to properties and a bit of a
demonstration on what works and what
doesn't</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
