tesoro and in this tutorial once we do
is I'm going to be teaching you guys how
to play a sound whenever you hit this
light switch so by default your lights
turn on nothing happens I want to be
cool if the lights turn on and play the
sound at the same time to answer that
question yes it would be cool if you
guys can't figure that one out so let me
go ahead and well I guess I'll tell you
guys how to do that the first thing we
need to do is it's easiest if we select
a sound first so go ahead and open your
content browser and the side for immuno
materials and textures and static meshes
this content browser also comes packed
with a whole bunch of sounds so if we
clear everything out and hit sound cues
go ahead and start a double click in and
if you double click you can preview the
sounds so go ahead and preview one and
look for one you like I'm just going to
go ahead and use this first one right
here as you can tell i use it because
it's very obvious whenever the sound
plays it's actually the sound there's
something called a bio rifle in the
Unreal Tournament and this is the sound
that plays whenever you shoot your rifle
so anyways go ahead and select the sound
you guys can use the same sound as me if
you want and now X out of the content
browser don't do any dragon and drop it
in or anything like that you just need
to have it selected now in kismet what
you need to do is this what we need to
add is a new action and before I even
start adding actions let me tell you
guys that whenever you have an event I
told you guys that an event is basically
something that happens in the UK this
event is us touching the trigger and I
made the action that occurred is us
turning a light on not so whenever we
touch the trigger a light turns on
enough but now let me explain this you
can have multiple actions for a single
event for example what we're going to do
in this case scenario is we're going to
touch a trigger and not only are we
going to turn the light on and off but
we also are going to play a sound so I
just want to point that out that you can
have multiple
actions for a single event we don't need
to set up a new touch event or anything
like that it's really easy so let me go
ahead and show you guys how to do that
the very first thing we needed to add is
a new action so go ahead let me position
this little better right click up here
and hit new action and we want to play a
sound so go down to this sound menu and
hit play sound now this is the place
sound action and then let me position
this love but better so now you guys can
probably guess what's going to happen
aside from having this touched go right
to turn on let's go ahead and also drag
another wire from this to play sound now
you guys can see visually that whenever
we touch this trigger it's going to turn
on the lights and also play a sound
however this place sound action it needs
some more information it says all right
I know I'm supposed to play sound right
now but what sound am I supposed to play
well we need to tell it to play that
sound that we selected in the content
browser so if you look under this act
play sound menu right here you're going
to see a property called play sound now
here is where you say what sound you
want to play and since we already have
that sound selected in the content
browser we can just hit this green arrow
and if we hover over it says use
selected object and content browser so
now when we hit that green arrow if you
have a sound selected in the content
browser it should fill right in right in
there so now it knows what sound to play
and everything is good to go so now we
can go ahead and X out of this hit play
from here and check it out now whenever
I hit this trigger not only although are
the lights going to turn on but it's
also going to play that bio rifle sound
so listen closely I guess you guys
didn't need to listen that closely
because it's often a little loud
actually guys my you guys might want to
turn down your volume a little bit but
I'm gonna do like three more times so
get ready
and one for good measure there we go so
now as you can see if I open kiss meant
one last time a single event cannot only
lead to a single action but also
multiple actions as in the case in this
tutorial this single touch event which
was us touching the trigger not only
played a sound but also turn the lights
on so that's all I want to teach you
guys in this tutorial that that's
basically how you use a sound when
working in the UDK and also the idea
that a single event can lead to multiple
actions so in the upcoming tutorials
actually i'm not even going to tell you
guys what I'm going to teach you guys
end up two upcoming tutorials because I
just guarantee this it's going to be
awesome so just wait and see so anyways
thank you guys for watching don't forget
to subscribe and I'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
