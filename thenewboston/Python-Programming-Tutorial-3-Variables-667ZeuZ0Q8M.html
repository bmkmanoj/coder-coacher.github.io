welcome to your third Python tutorial
now in our third tutorial I'm going to
be teaching you guys about something
called variables now this concept is
going to seem kind of familiar if you
learn any other programming languages
but for those of you noobs out there
what variable is is a placeholder for
something else or it's pretty much a
temporary storage for any value so it's
real easy just to see how it works so
let me get there we go
as soon as my cursor starts working let
me show you guys how this is done how
you um create variables is you create a
variable name first an assignment to a
value now this value can either come
from you or another person so first let
me show you guys how to create a real
simple variable let's start with X
that's a pretty common name for a
variable and let me assign it to any
number like 18 and then just put X
equals 18 and press Enter once you press
Enter X now has the value of 18 so
anywhere when you are doing basic
functions like math functions instead of
typing 18 you can now type the letter X
and it's going to represent the number
18 so instead of putting 18 times 3 for
all you can do or all you have to do is
to put X um what are we going to do plus
15 and it's going to view X as 18 and an
output whatever 18 plus 15 is now this
value stays the same
x equals 18 unless you change it so you
can use it again and again X on the
student exponent 318 mid third power is
that and again that's how you can assign
variables to multiple values or excuse
me just a single value you can also have
more than one variable at a time so x
equals 18 right now
you can also have y equals 54 press
Enter
we now have two variables stored in our
computer X is equal to 18 and y is equal
to 54 now you can use both of these in
the same function if you want X plus y
equals 18 plus 54 equals 72 and you can
keep going on and on like this
another thing that I want to show you
guys is that um if you're just looking
at this and be like alright variables
they're kind of cool but they're kind of
worthless anytime you would want X to
equal 18 or Y to equal 54 when you're
using these numbers why won't you just
type 18 plus 15 or 18 plus 54 it's kind
of a waste of time well in this case yes
it is a waste of time but variables are
useful or they're going to be useful in
future when we're making applications
especially when we don't know what the
value is yet and if you're looking at
what I just didn't be like how can you
not know where you're going to add
before you add it are you an idiot well
yes I am an idiot but more importantly
whenever you get information from a user
in write programs this way those are the
things that you don't know what
information they're going to enter yet
so say you write a program to like a
mortgage calculator or something
whenever they put the price of their
house in that's what you put that that
number is going to be the variable then
you run all the calculations from that
so how can we in Python make it so um
pretty much whatever they are going to
enter is going to be stored in the
variable well I'm going to show you guys
how to do that right now to do this you
need a little function called input so
let's say we have variable let's store
in G so put G equals input now in your
empty parameters just write a little
message put like enter number here now
once you press Enter
a little prompts going to come up
whatever you typed in your parentheses
now this is what the user would see
right here so it's going to enter a
number right there put 43 and once you
press Enter that number 43 this is going
to allow the user to enter whatever
variable they want so instead of just
writing our own variables this is a
little function where the user can have
their own variables now unlike us
assigning the variable the user just
assigned the number 43 to G and this is
why a bunch of different applications
can be made possible now instead of 43
we can simply use the letter G for any
function we want G plus 32 equals 75 G
um exponent 3 whatever that is so again
to assign your own variables just write
a variable name one letter will do for
now and assign it using the equal sign
or if you want to get the user to assign
a variable for you which you can use in
functions later on all you have to do is
make a variable name like anything make
it equals to and put input and then
write a little message so they know
what's going on and again this little
input function right here that allows
the user to assign their own variables
instead of having us do it so again that
is your $2 tore on variables I hope you
learned something
practice assigning your own variables
and practice using the input so that
other people can input variables in your
program and once you learn this and got
used to it then you're ready to move on
to the next python tutorial so again
thank you guys for watching I hope you
learn a little something and I'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
