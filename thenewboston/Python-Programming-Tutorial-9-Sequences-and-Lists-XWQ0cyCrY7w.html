your ninth Python tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm going to be talking to you
guys about something called sequences
now what a sequence is is pretty much
something that lets you store um data
and it sounds pretty simple but it's
pretty much like a list and actually one
of the things in Python it's called a
list and that's what I'm going to be
showing you guys today and the other
main type of sequence I'll probably be
talking about pretty soon it's called a
tuple or T PLA some people call it a
tuple I call it a tupple either way but
uh let me show you guys how to make a
list so you guys actually know what I'm
talking about now make a list in Python
first of all you have to give it a name
and I'm going to name my family next to
make it equal sign and in square
brackets you add all of your elements of
the list so I'm going to have one called
mom dad's part of the family
bro and make sure since these are
strings they're surrounded in single
quotes what else can we add sis um and
let's add one more dog now once you have
your family name and all of your
elements are properly properly formatted
go ahead and hit enter and your list is
now stored in your computer somewhere
doesn't matter now another thing that
you need to take note of is once you
create your list python automatically
numbers every single element in your
list and they're numbered kind of weird
so listen closely unlike the first one
being one in the second one being two
what your computer does a sense it loves
zeros and ones it starts all of these
out is zero so mom is zero dad is one
bro two three four so even though there
are five elements and lists they're
numbered 0 through 4 and why is this
useful because you can access each
individual member of your list or
element of your list by something called
index
so if you go ahead and type the name of
your list then type the index number and
press Enter it's going to show you that
member of your list or that element so
why did sis pop up when you put family 3
again this was mom 0 1 2 3
so since was a third element so that's
how you access that now you can do this
with any other elements in another thing
that they did was once you have lists
that were so long it was kind of
difficult for Python or for you to count
all the way to the end of the list so
they made it easier to count from the
end of the list backwards if you think
that you can do that easier now unlike
what you would usually think instead of
this being 0 the last element in your
list is negative 1 and then it goes on
negative 2 negative 3 negative 4
negative 5 it can't be negative 0
because negative 0 is the same thing as
0 and that would just not make sense so
again let's go ahead and let me show you
an example that family and let me put
negative 2 again it is cysts again and
this is why is because dog is negative 1
once you index from the back of your
list then sis is negative 2 so that is
how you count from the back of your list
the reference numbers and so that is how
you make a simple list in each element
in your list is automatically assign to
values once I mean one of the values is
the values to count forward 0 1 2 3 4
and the other value you can reference it
by is by counting backwards negative 1
negative 2 negative 3 negative 4
negative 5 so that is how you do that
another thing I want to teach you guys
before I leave is that strings can also
be sequences so say you have a string
like a Bucky these are also
automatically numbered 0 1 2 3 4 so if
you want to index something like 3 what
is going to do when we press ENTER is
say alright B is 0 U is 1 C is 2 K is 3
let me go ahead and enter that
that's why outputs K so again not only a
list but also strings you can index to
pick out certain values so that is your
quick tutorial on sequences in lists in
the next tutorial I'm going to be
showing you something really cool so
you're going to want to pay attention to
that again don't forget to subscribe if
you like these tutorials and I guess
that's all I have for this tutorial so
thank you and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
