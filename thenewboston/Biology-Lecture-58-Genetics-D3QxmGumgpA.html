58th biology lesson and in this lesson
we're going to start to look at genetics
so what is genetics well a really simple
explanation is the study of genes and
I'm not talking about you know the study
of designer jeans from the mall I'm
talking about the genes in your body now
whenever we understand genetics it
allows us to understand how sexually
reproducing organisms first of all we
begin to understand why they're so
diverse and also how the parents pass
their traits on to their offspring so
you know I'm talking about trades and
genes so let's go ahead and before we
get into the details of how genetics
works and what it is and everything
let's go ahead and look at some basic
terminology so first of all whenever I
say traits what I'm talking about is
basically characteristics in some traits
for you would be your eye color your
hair color and they don't always have to
be physical traits they don't always
have to be something that you can see
and we'll learn about the different
kinds of traits later on now one of the
categories of traits is heritable traits
now whenever I say heritable traits I
basically mean traits that are inherited
from one generation to the next
so if your mom had blue eyes and you
have blue eyes that would be a heritable
trait now the less you know kind of
terminology I want to go over right now
is gene because you know that's what
genetics is the study of genes so a gene
is basically a portion of DNA so we have
DNA right here and of course we have the
different nucleotides and genes are
actually different sizes but whenever we
say a gene and very you know common
broad sense we mean that a portion of
the DNA that basically determines a
certain trait in an organism so
basically what I'm trying to say is DNA
is the genetic code for the traits of an
organism so basically what you look like
or your traits are based on how your DNA
is coded or how it's put together
so whenever organisms reproduce what
they're going to do is they copy their
DNA and they pass some of it on to their
offspring so that's why their offspring
inherit some of their traits because
they inherit some of their DNA so let's
go ahead and ask the question if that's
the case why aren't offspring exactly
like their parents now the reason that
whenever you have a kid that kid doesn't
look exactly like you or exactly like
your wife or you know your girlfriend or
you know the girl you met at the bar the
reason that they aren't exactly like you
is first of all because whenever they
are inheriting what you have to give
them your traits they get half of the
genetic info from their mom in half from
you the dad unless you're you know a
girl watching these tutorials then you
get half from the female half from the
male now we already know that thanks to
meiosis in something called crossing
over every single sperm in your body
again hopefully you don't have any sperm
in your body if you're a girl unless you
know you just got done doing the deed
then you probably do but every single
sperm in your body or egg is completely
unique each one has a completely unique
chromatin thanks to you know like I said
meiosis and crossing over
now also aside from that whenever you
know an offspring is forming a human
being is forming a sperm and an egg are
going to come together so every single
combination is completely unique so even
if you had identical sperm by you know
the most random chance in the universe
well that wouldn't mean that the egg
would also need to be perfectly
identical to one each other one another
to have completely similar offspring so
that's basically why even if you have
brothers and sisters you guys are all
very different because remember that I
said thanks to meiosis and crossing over
every single sperm is unique and also
whenever you combined it with an egg the
combinations are also unique now another
thing I want to talk about is mutations
now mutations are another thing that can
cause offspring to be slightly different
from the parents and they can actually
cause offspring to be very different
than the parents in some situations
so when I talk about mutations let me go
ahead and draw a DNA molecule so say
that this is a perfectly normal healthy
DNA molecule and we'll draw the little
nucleotides in it look in pretty freakin
good right there
all right so this is a perfect DNA
molecule D and a now a mutation is
something that alters the DNA and causes
it to change slightly so of course if we
have a perfect DNA and we change it by a
little bit that would mean that
something is going to go wrong in your
cell it would either die or it might
behave slightly different may cause
cancer or something like that so that's
what a mutation is something that causes
DNA to kind of change or mutate in a way
now what can cause mutations or what
kind of things can cause DNA to act up
or change well the first thing is DNA
polymerase now remember I said that DNA
polymerase is the molecule responsible
or it's one of them responsible for
replicating or copying DNA whenever you
need a copy of it well that's good and
all but DNA polymerase isn't always
perfect whenever it copies it can
actually make mistakes so you may start
out with a perfect molecule of DNA but
you may end up with one that's slightly
different slightly mutated and we'll
blame that one on DNA polymerase now DNA
polymerase isn't the only reason for
mutations there are a couple other ones
and one of the most common ones that
scientists are looking at now are
chemicals so say that these are harmful
chemicals that get in your cell and you
know affect the DNA maybe these
chemicals came from cigarettes or maybe
you ate some processed food anyways
these harmful chemicals right here can
actually alter the molecules in DNA and
cause chemical reactions that actually
mutate them so chemicals and DNA
polymerase are some things that mutate
DNA and another thing is actually forms
of radiation like x-rays so if you are
exposed to a lot of radiation or if you
you know walk through x-ray machine
every day of your life the
what these x-rays can do is they can
actually physically knock some of these
molecules off the DNA or rearrange them
so that can cause your DNA to mutate as
well so again those are some reasons
that the offspring may be different than
the parent even though they inherited
all the DNA correctly because even
though they inherited that DNA molecule
correctly factors from the environment
or natural factors such as DNA
polymerase can make mistakes and it can
cause weird mutations and whenever we
have a weird mutation in DNA we can have
some weird traits in the offspring</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
