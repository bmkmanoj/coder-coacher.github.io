and this is a PHP video tutorial for the
new Boston now if you're just getting
started with PHP and want to start
developing you're going to need
somewhere to test your code now you may
have already purchased paid hosting and
you may be able to upload PHP files
check with your hosts to see if they
allow PHP extensions 99% of paid and
free hosting will allow you to run PHP
on the server it is pretty much a must
in most cases for most hosting companies
so what happens if we want to test
everything locally on our local computer
it's fair enough us creating a PHP file
and uploading it to a server but we want
to quickly develop we want to develop
quickly and easily on our local machine
so what we can do is we can essentially
turn our computer into a web server now
it's highly unrealistic server because
if it's not properly configured your PHP
ini files not properly configured or
anything else is not configured you're
going to run into trouble so you're
going to have some security issues there
so bear in mind that everything I'm
showing you is to setup a your opening
another port on your computer so you're
opening up port 80 on your computer
which is going to allow people to access
everything that you put into your htdocs
folder if you don't know what I'm
talking about that's fine I'm going to
go ahead and explain to you what you
should do in order to create or install
this mini webserver onto your computer
now I personally use xampp and the whole
thing behind your web server and PHP is
that you're going to be using apache and
then PHP is a module if you like on top
of Apache which allows you to compile in
the background server-side because PHP
is a server-side language it allows you
to compile and PHP files and run them
and display the contents of your actions
in the browser so basically you need
something like xampp or something
like w amp I'm showing you double that W
amp
simply because you know if you're having
problems with that example for any
reason you want to use W app but I'm
just going to show you that to say you
to tell you that is available however
I'm going to be dealing with xampp and
xampp default directories things like
that so if you'd like to follow along
with this tutorial i'm going to be using
xampp otherwise going install w amp and
see if you can take anything from this
tutorial away with you and in apply to w
amp settings as well now the first thing
you're going to need to do is obviously
come to Apache friends org and you're
going to come down here and you're going
to say xampp for windows linux mac OS
solaris anything any the obviously
operating system that you are using so
it's obviously free of charge we've got
little screenshots here an easy
installation the installation etc etc
etc so you can download you can download
this for Windows by just simply clicking
xampp for windows and i'm going to be
giving you the example here and running
through for windows so i'm not going to
be using linux mac OS or solaris i I'm
going to be using windows in this case
so once you've clicked the file or click
this link you're going to come down and
you're going to say download xampp here
so when the installation here says
method a installation within with the
installer or without the install and
we're going to choose xampp here and
what that's going to do is we can click
on installer so i'd highly recommend you
install it with the installer we're
going to click that and it's going to
download so pretty simple stuff you're
going to open this installation file and
once you once it's downloaded so
obviously it's hosted with SourceForge
so you're going to save this file you're
going to wait till that's download it's
sixty three point two megabytes and as
it stands for this version</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
