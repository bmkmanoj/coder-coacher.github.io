tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to have images for
your nose so for this tutorial you're
going to have a button a treeview and an
image to list so the first thing we're
going to want to do is select images or
our nodes so we're going to have to put
those in our image list right here so
let's go ahead and select your image
list go to the images property and then
browse for images I already have some
images picked out right here but all you
have to do is click Add and then browse
for the images that you want I have one
here for animals one for the dog node
one for a cat node and one for a person
node or a people mode so once you have
your images selected just go ahead and
click OK now you can mess around with
the image size I like to keep it a bit
bigger 25 by 25 but you can make it 16
by 16 that's the default it doesn't
matter what size the unit is so once you
have all that set just go ahead and
double click on your button so the first
thing that we're gonna have to do is
create a new tree node that we're going
to be adding to our tree view so we're
going to do tree node I'll call it
tn for tree node set it equal to a new
tree node and this is the tree node that
we're going to be adding to our tree
view so we're going to set the text
property of it something the first note
that we're going to be adding is going
to call person but it doesn't really
matter what you set the text as and the
next thing they're gonna have to do is
set the image index and the image index
is basically the index in the image list
of the image that you want to use and
are a person node we're going to want to
have a picture of a person before it so
we're going to go back here to our image
list and see what index the personal
image is it's 3 P to the 3 right there
so let's just go ahead and click OK so
now we just have to put 3 for the image
index now the way of all our properties
set we're just going to add this tree
node to
you just shrevie one nose and then use
the add method to add our tree note and
if you go right here yep we can pass a
tree note through pass our tree note
that we create it through and the final
thing we're going to have to do is link
our image list with our tree view so in
order to do that just select your tree
view go down to image list and select
image we'll see you created lines it's
called images one so now maybe bug here
and click the button we should have a
node inside of our tree view called
person and there should be an image of a
person over for it yep right here but
notice how when we selected it change
the image and that's not what we want so
we're gonna have to do right here is set
another property and I don't know why
they didn't just do you follow you do
this but you have to manually go through
and do this you're gonna have to change
the selected image index to the same as
your image index unless you wanted
something different so we're going to
change this selected image index 3 as
well so that when we select the image
the index doesn't change because if you
don't set it it default least sets it to
0 and then it just changes if you if
your regular image indexes and 0 to 12
so now we select it it shouldn't change
the image nope it's perfect now and if
you wanted to go through and add another
tree node you could so for the create
node tree node right here I'll actually
just copy all of this create a different
tree node called key I go and this one
will be called animal and the image
index for animal is 0 so this goes to 0
and then we'll add that tree note so now
we should have animal tree node and a
person tree though yeah and just like
before if we wanted to add let's say
another one under animal called like cat
or something I was talking this
all this TC fir-tree note pad all this
cat right here and I always have to get
the image index of it which is two
little mouths up the image index to two
and since we want to have this cat tree
note underneath the animal tree note or
just have to do nodes one because the
index of animal is one key one remembers
going to do dot nodes dot add just like
we learned in the first tutorial when we
were looking at this so I'll just add to
see tour tree no cat and now maybe bug
and click this button we should have
person animal and under animal we should
have a cat node yep perfect
so that's it for this tutorial on the
story we looked at just
so that's it for this tutorial so see
you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
