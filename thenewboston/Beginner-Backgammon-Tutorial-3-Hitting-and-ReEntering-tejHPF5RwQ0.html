another back-end story now in this story
what are we going to be doing is
covering the rest of the rules at
backgammon and once I cover the rest our
rules then we can begin talking about
strategy but for now there are some
other rules that I didn't teach you yet
that we need to know in order to play
the game correctly and the first thing
is this you know how in the last story I
told you that when you roll two numbers
like for example if you rolled five and
one you can move one of your checkers
one and one of them five spaces 1 2 3 4
5 or what you can do is you can add it
together and move 1 6 1 2 3 4 5 6
just like that well here's the thing
when every year old doubles let's say
you rolled a 3 and the 3 just like that
whenever you roll doubles you might be
thinking logically in your head that I
can either move 1 3 and then another 3
or I can move 1 6 and then that would be
my turn but something happens whenever
year-old doubles not only do you got 2
turns but you get 4 turns so this pretty
much count is four threes instead of two
and if you had two 5s it would be four
5s instead of just two 5s so let's go
ahead and play this double three right
here I can go ahead and move this one
one two three
that's one um one two three that would
be two one two three that would be three
and let's just go ahead and move this
one again one two three that would be
four so as you can see not only you get
two moves you get four moves and that's
the same with any doubles double six is
the befores whatever so that's your move
right there the next thing and I want to
talk about it's hitting your opponent
and that doesn't mean you know uppercut
donkey punch oh I mean hitting their
chips so you know when I said that you
can't land let me move these around
getting primed for hitting there we go
you know when I said that there is a
little bit better okay
let's Riku area you know when I said
that you can't land on one of the spots
or one of the points that your opponent
has a check around
well there's one exception to this rule
and this is probably the coolest thing
about backgammon whenever they only have
one checker on a point this is called a
block and you're able to hit this it
pretty much means it's vulnerable so
let's go ahead and say you're all that's
not good rule that's not a good one
either a three and a two what you can do
is sense with one two you can land on
this since there's only one checker
there you can hit it and knock it off
the board and put it on the bar now if
there are two checkers there or three or
anything with two or greater you
couldn't land on it this is only with
one checker on a point so for example
where was that right there I think and
now let's go ahead and say that this was
a four one two three four is there one
checker there yes so I'm going to go
ahead and hit that and take them off
and whenever you hit them you put them
on the bar and this pretty much means
they have to restart from the beginning
remember my point my one point is down
here my twenty four point is up here so
now instead of you know I was so close
to finishing I have to go all the way
around the board again off the bar so
that is how you hit blots or hit
checkers when there's only one checker
on point so never saying all right Bucky
now that these checkers are on the bar
how are you supposed to get these
checkers off we'll check this out say I
roll a three and a four
just like I did right here now I'm not
going to be able to move any of these
checkers until all of my checkers are
off the bar so if I can't make a move
then I have to pass my turn so for
example here's what I would do
I wrote a three and a four remember one
two three I can't do that because there
are two more so I'm going to have to use
my four only so that's the only move I
can make for my turn and remember I
can't move this
on three because I still have checkers
on the bar so pretty much as long as you
have checkers on the bar the only thing
that you can do is try to get them back
and if you can you have to pass your
turn so now that's my turn I have to
pass so you would play for example you
had a 6 into 3 so 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 that
would be your turn now it's my turn
again let's see what I get this time a 1
and a 3 so I could say 1 2 3 can I use
that 3 no I can't because that's blocked
now I have to go for it 1 can I use the
1 yes because that point belongs to me
so I can use the 1 and now I can
continue playing a normal game again so
again like I said you can't do anything
you can't move any of your other
checkers until they are all off the bar
so that's why hitting someone or hitting
a bot is such a powerful move and
backgammon and that's one of the key
aspects knowing when to hit knowing when
not to hit and like this when you're so
close to finishing and you get hit it's
really frustrating so let's go ahead and
let me teach you the last kind of rule
of the game and that's bearing off or
pretty much the end game how you win
backgammon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
