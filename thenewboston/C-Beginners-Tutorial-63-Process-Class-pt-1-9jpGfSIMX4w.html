c-sharp tutorial that I'm making for the
new Boston and in this tutorial I'm
gonna be showing you how to use the
process class so all you're going to
need for this tutorial is this code
right here and a button also we're going
to be using the system that Diagnostics
namespace because the process class is
located in there so under the if
statement here you're going to just come
on and type out process and the first
method that I'm going to be showing you
how to use start method and the start
method will basically just start a
process so for example if you wanted to
open a program such as hxd just like
this you can do that we would use the
start method to do that and we're going
to have it start whatever process that
the user open the file dialog so as long
as the user opens an executable file
then don't start the process of that or
open it
so we're going to off do you have file
name so that it will start whatever
process that the user opens any
different file dialog so debug here
click this button and once you click
open
HFD should open or just show up on our
screen and yep here's hxd for some
programs do not have to type the path to
the program so for example if you wanted
to open notepad you could just type
notepad dot exe right here so not only
do bug and click button one you should
get a notepad yeah and you don't have to
type out the path to this file because
edit it is located in the system32
folder and you don't have to type out
the path to any file inside of the
system32 folder so we just type like exe
up here we search for an exe file um
then we can open any one of these exe s
just by typing the file name we don't
type out the path to the file so another
file or another application that it's
inside of the system xxx
folder is CMD or command prog so just do
cmd.exe and it would open up command
prompt definitely is connect wrong
the next method I'm going to showing you
how to use is the get current process
and the get current process will just
return on the portlet process that
you're currently working and we're
working in this YouTube file or YouTube
project or here so we should just get on
YouTube as the name so it's going to
process name and we're just going to
display that a message box so we can see
what the current process lien is so now
need to bulk here and click button 1 you
should just get a message box saying you
to VCS test yep YouTube dot V SOS is
that is the name of this process so if
we were to go in a task manager right
here you should see YouTube be esko's
somewhere in here name yeah
YouTube dot V sa and another method that
I'm going to be showing you how to use
or actually the last method is showing
that use is the kale method and the kill
method will basically just kill the
process on end of the process so we
still kill and it will just kill this
processor here so as soon as we click
this button and we'll just kill this
process because it gets the current
process and then it kills it so we're
just killing this process right here yep
just the children so that's pretty much
it for this tutorial on in the next
tutorial we're going to be getting into
a little bit more of a process class and
we're going to be looking at this kill
method and using it a little bit
differently so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
