JavaScript tutorial and then the last
tutorial as you can see we talked about
a while loop so let's get rid of that
and in this tutorial I'm gonna be
teaching you about something called a
break now I'm gonna be using this in our
for loop so let's go ahead and create a
basic for loop and if you remember from
a couple of tutorials ago
the syntax for a for loop you just put
four then you make a variable I'm gonna
make mine I is always in set equal to
zero as usual and then our next I'm
gonna make it I and say do this loop
whenever the integer is a less than or
equal to ten and then in our less you
say what you want to increment it by and
I'm gonna increment it by 1 every time
so now that we have that we need an
action so every time we want every time
our integer fits these rules I'm gonna
say document right which just means
output on the screen the same thing as
before if you watch my last tutorial I'm
going to say the number is move this so
you can see
and then I'm just gonna add make sure
you put a space right here it'll make it
easier to read just gonna add the number
and then on my next line I'm gonna have
the same thing document right and then
this one I'm just gonna add a line break
and to do that probably know by now but
you just add the HTML code or XHTML code
for a line break and make sure you put
semicolons at the end of each one so now
we have a basic for statement but you're
saying alright so what exactly are you
gonna teach me see as you can see if we
just save this and refreshed it we get
the number zero one two three four five
six seven eight nine ten just like
before but now we want to do something a
little different and that's add a line
break or now line break just a
JavaScript break my JavaScript break
does is it allow you to execute this
code but it allows you to skip one or
more numbers and what we're going to do
is in this rule we're gonna embed
another loop or another rule and that's
called a break so simple enough we're
just going to add another if statement
actually let me add some line so you can
see how this is separate but still
inside these parentheses
at a simple if statement and this is a
lot easier than you guys would probably
think say if the integer is exactly
equal to 5 then what we are going to
want to do is just say the word break so
as you can see this is all a normal for
loop but inside we have a simple if
statement it's as easy as that so we're
gonna tell javascript do this go ahead
and run this loop go through the number
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
but once you get to 5 if the integer is
exactly equal to 5 we want you to break
the code and forget about the rest of
this so I'm just show you what this
looks like I'm going to save it and
refresh it so what this does as you can
see it went through 0 1 2 3 4 but once
you got to 5 it stopped
and the rest of the code didn't go on
anymore
and this is pretty useful whenever let's
say you want to make a list but you only
want to have a certain amount of items
in it say show the top 10 list so we
want I'm gonna rank everyone but once it
gets the 10 stop and don't show anymore
so that's one use you can use a simple
break statement and drive a strip and
that's all the time we have for right
now I don't know where we're gonna be
learning next probably something notes
that we can put in our loops and please
if you like my tutorial let's go to my
website Auto land chat comm and sign up
and if you do I might even give you a
shout out on one of my next tutorials
