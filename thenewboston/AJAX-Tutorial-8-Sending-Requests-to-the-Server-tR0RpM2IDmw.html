with question marks so food is equal to
and now in order to append strings in
JavaScript you just use + food and the
last parameter is basically this alright
so let me go ahead and talk you through
this so this is basically what we're
sending to the PHP file so first
parameter is what type of request get
the second parameter is okay
you said you're going to send it now
give me the URL pretty much now the
third parameter is just just go ahead
and type true for now now I don't even
know if I want to talk to you guys about
this basically the last parameter true
or false is if the request should be
handled asynchronously or not false if
not true if it is and if you guys are
like all right this is Ajax asynchronous
Java in xml why would you ever want this
false well we'll talk about that later
on basically for this tutorial just
write true if not you know then it would
be a waste of time but let me just go
ahead and format this a little bit
prettier all right so what does the open
method do or function it basically
creates the type of request that we want
so now that we have the request are we
ready to send it well not yet what we
want to do is we want to set this XML I
wish that stuff popped up on ready state
change now go ahead and set this equal
to handle server response
all right now before we just go ahead
and send this request to the server we
need to go ahead and say ok
whenever we get information back we want
to do something with that information if
we just go ahead and made this
JavaScript file to send a request to the
server and the server would you know
send a response back what would happen
is the user would be right here
using the website in your JavaScript
file would be communicating with your
server behind the scenes but when it got
the response back it wouldn't do
anything with it so basically the user
would be you know here typing stuff in
your you know your computer would be
talking to another computer behind the
scenes and it wouldn't even be doing
anything so it'd be like you did all the
hard work but nothing's paying off so
what we're doing right here is we are
saying ok oops mess that up we're saying
ok on a ready state change which
basically means we want to call this
function handle server response whenever
the server responds to our requests so
we're going to send it this request and
whenever it responds we want to do
something to our web file so basically
what process is going to do is it's
going to communicate with the web server
and what this function is going to do is
it's going to do something cool to the
user's web page so that's the three
functions you basically need one creates
the object for communication the second
one communicates with a server in the
third one that we're going to be
building in a little bit that's what's
going to you know either
update your web page or create an
element or do something cool and that's
basically the three parts of Ajax that
you always need alright so now that we
got that out of the way what we need to
do after this is actually send the
request because think about it we didn't
actually send the request yet we made
the request and we said once we get a
response back this is what we want to do
but even though we made the request we
didn't we have to send that I know it's
kind of stupid but that's what you need
to do so go ahead and use this object
and
can you guess the function to send the
request you just go ahead and write send
and in here just go ahead and type null
now I know where you're thinking you're
like all right why would you type in all
there what don't you you know want you
know the request itself you're sending
nothing well actually this is one of the
confusing parts so let me explain it
whenever you send the request off to the
server the parameter that you use is
only used with post now we're using it
right here so that's why it needs to be
null so remember if you're using post
then this is going to be um this
parameter is not going to be now and
I'll talk about that later on but for
now just go ahead and set it equal to
null and that's what we need to do all
right
else go ahead and set timeout and I'll
talk to you guys about this in a second
set timeout process and we'll just go
ahead and set this equal to 1000 is
actually good enough all right so why do
I need a else in what the set timeout do
set timeout pretty much it pretty much
okay I guess I'll explain it this way
the first thing you're doing is you're
checking is the object ready to connect
or is it busy if it's ready to connect
and ready to communicate then you do all
this stuff however if it's busy then
we're you're going to do is you're going
to say okay I'm just going to wait I'm
just going to timeout for one second and
then I'm going to try again so set
timeout says okay how long do you want
white and after you're done waiting what
do you want to do so pretty much okay I
want to communicate communicate
communicate however if it's busy then
I'm just going to go ahead and wait
again wait a second and then communicate
again so that's basically what the
function does and remember this is the
heart of being able to communicate with
a server using Ajax the first thing you
do is you need to check if your object
is ready to communicate next well you
don't need to do this but it's really
helpful to get a piece of information
from the webpage and after that you want
to go ahead and prepare your request and
after that you want to go ahead and say
okay whenever I get a response back from
the server this
is what I want to do and we're actually
going to be coding this in the next
tutorial and then you go ahead and send
your request now if you can't send that
then just wait a second and then send it
again so arm in the next tutorial I
promise is going to be we're going to be
finishing up so thing guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
you guys in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
