now if you have the ion while there's a
track mat enabled for your layer that's
for the mat that's above it's not going
to do anything it's just gonna be on top
and it's going to show so you need to
have that off for enable that to enable
that to work I'm gonna put it back on my
alpha mat here and we can see that the
the mat didn't affect are the four color
gradient didn't affect anything in the
Alpha mat that's because they're on
separate they are separate entities and
are not affected by each other I'm gonna
go ahead and take off this track mat and
I'll hide this alpha dog there I'm just
gonna throw in like a picture of
something it's going to our images here
and I've got this tunic and here there
we go and now I'm just gonna switch that
don't these are on track mask for some
reason I'm gonna put this right above
what I want it to take out and I'm gonna
switch this to do it I'm gonna I'm gonna
show you the outfit real quick though
and you see this whole until your tunic
an is cut out now you're gonna expect it
to cut out the to just cut out the tunic
and there which you would be right if
you expected that now let's check out
the luma on something like this with
different colors
now since the words were in black
they're all cut out and they don't show
up with the luma matte I'll bring up the
colors real quick here is gray so that's
about 50% between black and white now
that's about 50% transparent there we
have blue here which is closer to black
because it's darker and that's getting
cut out a lot there so that's how you
can see how alpha mattes will affect
everything and pretty much that is a
quick explanation of what's going on of
track mats sometimes are hard to figure
out but once you get the hang of it you
can use them like a charm basically and
they are pretty awesome so you don't
have to make masks all the time now
sometimes if you're working on a project
and you have a guy that might be old
school or you have a project that was
maybe made in like after effects cs4 or
something like that I don't know if cs2
head track mats in it or not but if it's
an older version and seus are
after-effects that doesn't have track
mats then the normal way that people
used to do this is by coming up to
effect set the mat we click on what we
had on our background effect and Matt
don't let's see if it's even on in cs6
yep if we go to effect chant oh my lord
effect channel and then set Matt
this is the way we can take the mats
from just like a track mat this is the
old-school way
so there we got the two nine one being
meted out this time and you can take it
from different channels on this one also
other than just the track mats there but
that's how that's pretty much how you do
it there's the invert there and
everything like that so the set mat is
used mostly in old school projects or by
old school after effects users and it
has a couple more extra settings in
there so that's another reason to use
the set mat but just stay stick with the
track mats a lot faster and it's a lot
easier to see you don't have to worry
about using effects and figuring out why
something is doing it with without
having to look at the effects and
controls because I mean sometimes you're
on the project panel and you're gonna be
like what the what the heck's going on
so check your effects see if there's a
set mat on there and also check and see
if there's a track mat on there thanks
for watching the tutorial hopefully you
understand track mats a little better
now and understand what an alpha matte
is and illuminance or a luma matte is
and distinguish the difference between
them and notice that there are two
separate entities</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
