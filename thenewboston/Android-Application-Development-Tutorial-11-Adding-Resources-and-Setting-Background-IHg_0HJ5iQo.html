Android tutorial not 11th my bad 11th
Android tutorial for the new boss and
again with me Travis we're going to do
in this tutorials basically set up some
resources and then set up a background
image for our splash screen that we're
going to create and basically I want you
guys to you know create some sort of
background image and it doesn't have to
be perfect like like the dimensions I'm
not positive exactly which dimensions
you guys will want to use what I use for
this image I believe was 400 by 600 and
then just create something simple it
doesn't have to be beautiful or anything
obviously this one's pretty sketchy I
just copied this off the New Boston
website and then put a black background
for the most part and then make sure
when you save it it's all lower cased
and save it as like a PNG so again make
sure the name is all lower cased and
also you guys want to create maybe a
sound that you might want to put in for
application because we're going to add a
sound as well make that mp3 again make
sure everything's lowercased otherwise
you're going to get some problems so I
created both a sound and just a quick
wallpaper and what we're going to do is
basically put those in the right place
that we're going to need so we can use
them in Java and XML and all that good
stuff so I'm going to open up my finder
or basically you know my computer or
whatever and within here I saved it
again the project or workspace under a
Documents and I called it the new Boston
and then we set up our project called
the new Boston as well and then we have
a resource folder and here's our
drawable that's where we're going to
drag and drop this image into our
drawable high def or basically high
density per inch folder and that's good
you know you can do three different
resolutions if you guys want I'm lazy so
I'm not going to the other thing we want
to do is do our splash and our sound
into our rar folder again if you guys
don't have a rar for
the folder you want to set that up not
too difficult and there we go we
basically added resources to a project
now and again you guys might have wanted
to just drag and drop them into this
actual folder
I believe that won't work I don't I
don't think that will work
you guys actually want to go into where
your workspace was located and where
your project was set up and save them
there so there you go we added resources
if you look they aren't added yet what
we need to do is go up to project the
project tab and go to clean now kind of
clean our project out a little bit
update everything and rebuild it there
we go we have our splash background and
our splash sound now what we want to do
is set up a new layout that's just going
to have this image that we imported as
the background for a splash activity
basically what a splash activity is it
just appears for five seconds tells the
people your name plays a little music
and it's over so it's it's not not all
that important but we want to make our
app too legit to quit if you know I'm
talking about so we're going to do is
right-click on this layout here and then
go to other and then under this Android
folder again we're going to click
Android XML to setup a new layout we hit
next and then we have a we have to label
our layout and we're going to label this
splash and you also have to put dot XML
and make sure it has the layout tab it
should and we're good to go we're just
going to hit finish and there we go we
have blank slate to work with we're just
going to do one thing real simple again
we're just going into the code section
we're just going to set up this linear
layout have the background image be that
resource we just added and you guys are
probably wondering what's this match
parent basically it's pretty much the
same thing as fill parent in this case
so you won't have to worry about it
I mean we can change that to fill parent
if you want so basically it's going to
take up the whole screen and then we
want to use the Android code called
back round I wasn't completely positive
but anyways it's called background and
then how we reference it we're going to
say at drawable let's just do it this
way hit equals and then at drawable
forward slash and then our actual image
name again
you guys might you if you guys didn't
label these properly if you had like a
uppercase letter it's going to mess up
your project then you're going to get
all confused so make sure those are
lowercase and then clean your project
again so then we're going to say add
drawable and then splash under case
background is what I labeled my
background image as and you if you put
the P&amp;amp;G or the extension you're going to
get an air as well so you don't want to
put the extension on when you're
referencing your back or your drawable
folder now we're just going to save it
and check it out looks pretty fantastic
if you're asked if you AskMe
so that's quick tutorial basically how
to set up a new layout and use the
background function from the Android and
also get some resources in our project
so thanks again for watching and I'll
catch you guys in the next tutorial have
a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
