35th place on soil in this story I'm
going to show you guys how to overwrite
variables on a subclass now in the last
tutorial I told you guys how to make
subclasses in super classes also called
parent and child classes but I showed
you guys what to do if you wanted a
child class to inherit all the traits of
the parent class but what if you wanted
it to only inherit some of the traits
well here's what you do
first we need a class and let's call a
parent and in this let's just have a
couple variables let's put very 1 equals
bacon and ver 2 stands for variable 2 in
case you guys can figure that out
stands for snausage not bad next let's
go ahead and make another child class
now what we want this child class to do
is take some of the variables in parent
but also overwrite some of them so we
need a class called child and we needed
to inherit the traits of parent now we
want to keep variable 1 the same so we
leave that as bacon but for variable 2
we want to put bar 2 equals um a toast
so we now what we have done is
overwritten variable 2 in child
we're in child class variable 1 equals
bacon but instead of variable 2 equal in
snausages it equals toast instead so let
me prove this to you guys so let's go P
P AAB for parent object and have this
equal to parent and let's go put table
for child object and make this equal to
child class now let's access some
variables with P AB which is parent
object let's go ahead and put vert one
which is bacon as expected now let's go
ahead and access variable 2 which should
be snausage now in child which is what I
put for that Cobb
they're very one as you can see we
change to bacon in ver to actually we
didn't change it that's the one
inherited but ver - we should of
overwritten sausage and got toast so
let's see cob ver - equals toast so this
is how you can inherit the traits from a
parent but overwrite some of the
variables and this is good if you have
one huge class where you want to use
this big template but you only want to
change a few things in it you can over
ate some a few variables but keep the
rest of the variables or methods or
whatever may be in that class so that's
your quick tutorial on how to overwrite
variables in a sum on a sub class excuse
me while keeping all the other traits of
the parent class and again um I use
child and parent and sub sub and super
kind of alongside each other but that's
your quick tutorial on how to do that
thank you guys for watching I hope you
learned a little something
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
