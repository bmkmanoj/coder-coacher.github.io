absolutely necessary is this thing right
here this is called a bone and as you
can see it looks like a rubber soccer
with a hole in it and this goes right in
the top of your fermenter and the other
piece that goes in that hole is called
this this is an airlock now let me go
ahead and tell you guys why we use this
and why we need it basically where we're
going to be doing is we're going to be
filling this up with sanitizer now of
course all your solution is going to be
in the fermenter right here now remember
that I told you guys that the yeast eats
the sugar and converts it into alcohol
well is a byproduct you also get some
gases carbon dioxide mostly so instead
of just plugging this up completely of
course if you create a bunch of gases
your fermenter would explode so the
gases need a way to escape so this is
how they escape however you just can not
include this because then of course the
gases could escape but then bacteria
would get in so as you guys are going to
see later on this does two things it
allows the gases to escape whenever the
yeast is creating carbon dioxide and it
also keeps the bacteria out of your beer
now the next thing we need is a bottling
bucket now these were designed
specifically for when your beer is
almost done and ready to be bottled that
they basically have a stick it right
here and you hook up a hose to this and
we're going to be talking more about the
bottling process in depth later on but
for right now just remember that you
need a bottling bucket and it's
different than just you know a regular
five-gallon bucket mostly because it has
a spigot right here for bottling and
also these things are cool because they
have little increments one gallon to
gallon three four five gallons and we
actually use that for something aside
from bottling so this is actually a
really handy tool and even though it's
called a bottling bucket we use it for
many different purposes during the
process</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
