biology lesson and in this lesson we're
going to be picking up where he left off
with metaphase 2 so remember right now
we still have two cells and the key
things or key aspects of metaphase 2 is
that during metaphase 2 what's going to
happen is your spindles are going to
attach to the centromeres of your
chromosomes so let me go ahead and draw
these chromosomes first and let me get a
little bit bigger brush size so you guys
can see I'll draw a really simple ones
so there's some chromosomes and there
are some chromosomes and remember each
of these single things are chromosome
they just have two sister chromatid
joined by a centromere so remember that
these are still diverse every single
chromatid is unique to one another so
I'll draw my little you know DNA genetic
information scattered in there in pink
and basically remember that I said that
the spindles are now gonna attach to the
centromeres of your chromosomes and let
me draw it on this cell to so here the
spindles and they're attaching to the
centromeres right there and another cool
thing is that as you can see this sister
chromatid are actually going to line up
in the middle or the equator of the cell
so those are the two key aspects of
metaphase 2 if you only have to remember
two things is that the spindles attach
to the centromeres of the chromosomes
and also the sister chromatid are going
to line up in the middle or the equator
of the cell so after this we move on to
anaphase 2 so anaphase 2
let me go ahead and actually draw myself
before I start talking or my two cells
so let me go ahead and draw one right
here pretty frickin sweet looking cell
just kidding that's actually one of the
worst diagrams I've ever drew and okay
so we have some deform looking cells
right here but good enough who freaking
cares how good they look so now actually
let me draw my chromatid and remember
that even though I'm only drawing four
chromatid in each one remember that each
of these cells have 23 chromosomes in
two chromatid per chromosome so we
actually have 46 chromosomes for we
actually have 46 of these I just thought
it wouldn't be a good idea if you guys
you know sat here and watch me drew 46
of these things so basically you see
what's going on already
is your spindles are gonna pull apart
your chromosomes and you're pretty much
are gonna your sister chromatids are
gonna break right at the centromeres so
here are your spindles they succeeded in
pulling apart the chromosomes and the
area that they break it is right in the
middle right at the centromere of the
chromosome so they split perfectly in
half essentially and another thing
that's noteworthy is that these
chromatid are actually going to move to
opposite ends of the cell so you guys
can probably guess what's going to
happen from here but those are the key
phases from anaphase two remember one
the centromeres are going to break and
the sister chromatids are separated and
also the chromatids are going to move to
opposite ends or poles of the cell so
after this we move on to the last phase
or stage of meiosis 2 which is telophase
2 so at the end of telophase 2 and this
is actually a really easy diagram to
draw because I'm going to draw these
right at the end of cytokinesis we end
up with four sperm cells or four egg
cells hopefully you don't have both in
your body so basically what's going to
happen is
spindles are going to completely
disappear in our nuclear membrane is
gonna form again in all the cells Bam
Bam and another thing that's gonna
happen is your chromosomes are gonna
spread out around the nucleus so here we
go here's some chromosomes DNA spread
out in there and also draw some
chromosomes in this color too so
essentially what's going to happen is at
the end of meiosis 2 at the end of
telophase 2 same thing first of all like
I said the spindles we no longer have
those they're going to disappear we
don't need them anymore we're done with
them another thing is that the nuclear
membrane is gonna form in all of these
four cells and your chromosomes are
gonna spread out just like I said now a
couple other key things we want to take
away is at the end of cytokinesis you
have four haploid daughter cells so four
haploid daughter cells now remember I
said that diploid had 46 chromosomes or
two sets of chromosomes and haploid
pretty much means one set or 23
chromosomes so just remember that at the
beginning of meiosis at the very
beginning of meiosis one we started with
one diploid cell one cell with 46
chromosomes or two sets of chromosomes
and at the end we ended up with four
haploid cells or four cells with 23
chromosomes so that's basically the
entire process of meiosis meiosis 1
meiosis 2 pretty freaking cool so think
yes watching don't you subscribe and
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
