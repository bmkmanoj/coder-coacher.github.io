buddy Blackford here another Photoshop
cs6 tutorial and in this tutorial we're
just going to learn about linking and
unlinking layers and to link a layer
means that you just almost like parent
them together or come combined them
together but they don't combine into one
layer like if you were to merge when you
link a layer you're able to resize the
layer or move the layer both of the
layers together so that's the advantage
of linking so if you wanted to create
like a logo or something like that and
all the logo parts had to stay in the
exact same place but there were all on
different layers in case you needed to
change out things just link them
together and that way you can move
things all around together so what I
want to do is I'm just going to link
together two layers and what I wanted to
do is always have this photo
let me I always have this photo right
below this text so now that they're like
that right there and I always wanted to
be that way I'm just going to select
both layers I got a hold ctrl to be able
to select the other layer and then down
here at the bottom there's this chain
link down here and this is how you link
things so I click that and we can see
that they're linked now when I let me
let me select just the text there and
when I go to move it they both move if I
try to transform they're both going to
transform together so
that's what linking does now to unlink
them just select them both and then
click on unlink button here another way
to link which is in my mind faster
because you're already in this area is
to right-click and then come to link
layers super easy but also super
effective
now you can link more than just two
layers if you want to obviously you can
link several layers and let's go ahead
and do that so we've got this picture
here let me move it over here and maybe
I want to throw some text on it
so we've got that there
and there's some text on it and I want
to link these two layers now so let me
link them and now if I click on the
layer you can see which layers are
linked to what since I have this layer
linked to this text and then this link
to this text if I click on just one of
the things that are linked together
you'll see what it's linked to and then
when I click on the other image you can
see that only the things in the layers
panel that are linked to that show up
with the link symbol there so move that
around and then I can move this around
together so there's the advantages of
linking and remember to unlink you can
just a right-click and come to unlik
unlink layers you can select linked
layers to select them all at once or you
can come down here to the bottom and
unlink by clicking on this button again
to unlink them so that was very very
quick tutorial but it's very helpful to
know how to link layers because you I
actually use it a lot especially when
creating people's logos because they
always want to change things up and if
you've merged the layers then you can't
actually change them a more so that's a
that's the catch there so thanks a lot
for watching this tutorial hope you
learn something and I'll see you guys in
the next one have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
