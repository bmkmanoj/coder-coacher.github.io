welcome to the last tutorial in
inheritance before we get into some
other stuff now in the last tutorial I
talked about overriding methods and a
text message let's see what it says if a
man is drunk and gets naked it's
hilarious but if a man is naked and gets
drunk has just said all right that's
nice thank you Kirk and anyways on with
my tutorial um alright in the last
tutorial we learned how to override
methods ER this pretty much means that
we can add new methods to inheritance
classes as well as edit the ones that we
inherited but the cool thing about it is
you can't only add new methods but you
can also add new variables as well so
let's go ahead and do that right now so
in the son header you see that we don't
really have any variables right now but
that doesn't mean we don't have any in
our class we already inherited one for
mom and that was called number one so we
actually have one there even though we
can't see it so let's go ahead and add
another one and let's just go ahead and
say like int new variable you can name
it whatever you want in new variable for
simplicity so even though we only
declared one explicitly we are actually
have to in here pretty cool huh
so now in our method what we can do is
we can go ahead and take that new
variable and set its equal to something
the kid with set equal to yeah so or you
could set it equal to let's see 101 or
CF set I was gonna do this lol looks
like a person drowning but you know 2:16
and anyways enough of me goofing around
let's get back let's focus correct focus
so now that we have two variables here
we can change our NS log statement so
instead of printing out one variable go
ahead and print out two so this should
go ahead and print out the number is 14
the number is 69 so again like I was
saying even though the son class appears
to have only one variable don't forget
that we inherited another one as well
for mom is
well is a method that we overrode so
that's what's going to go on let me just
run this to prove it to you guys build
and run make sure don't have any errors
and the number is 14 the number is 69
pretty cool huh
so that is the beauty of not only
inheriting variables but you can also
create your own to further expand your
class now the last thing I want to talk
about in this tutorial I'm not going to
be doing any more typing but I want to
talk to you guys about abstract classes
and I'm not gonna be like showing you
because I can't really show you but the
concept is if ever you hear anyone talk
about the term abstract class or
abstract superclass they might call it
it's the idea that check this out
and our main tutorial we created an
object from the Sun class simple enough
I mean we could have gone ahead and
create an object from the mom class but
have you ever seen anyone create an
object from the NS object class no you
haven't because it isn't possible some
classes are you so often that the sole
purpose of why they are built is only so
other classes can inherit from them and
these are called abstract classes
classes were and these are a lot of them
are built in classes that you can never
explicitly create objects from but you
can always only inherit from them so the
definition of abstract class if ever I
say in the future tutorials it's a class
that you can't create an object from but
you need it to create it for inheritance
purposes so for example an NS object is
a superclass of everything it's an
abstract class you can never create an
object from it we could create an object
for a mom to use this num1 inset method
we can also create an object from sun to
use this and these methods right here
but NS object in other abstract classes
you can never create an object from like
NS object n NS object alloc init see
another never anything like that
so in the future we're gonna be learning
how to create well you know don't worry
about we're going to be doing the future
the future is own
a little bit away that has nothing to do
with anything you know might be a cool
shame put on a t-shirt someday but
anyways thank you for watching this
story don't forget that not only can add
methods but also add new variables the
inherited classes and also abstract
classes our classes that you can't
create objects from but you can inherit
from so thank you one last time don't
forget to check out the source code down
in the link below it's free thank you
for watching don't forget to subscribe I
