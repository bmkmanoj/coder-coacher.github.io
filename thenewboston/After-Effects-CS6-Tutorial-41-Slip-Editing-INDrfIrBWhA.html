here with another After Effects cs6
tutorial this time we're going to go
over slip editing and I'm just going to
only cover a slip editing in this
tutorial because it's kind of a little
hard to understand
pretty much when you edit your video
footage like like so and move the time
move the layer and trim it you get this
little light bar right here that is
actually video footage that is still
there but I mean you can't see it so say
you wanted your video footage to only be
like a couple like a second long or
something around there like this but hey
you
you accidentally started on the wrong
section of your video you can come over
to the part of the video that's lighter
and you'll turn into it'll turn into a
double arrow with two bars on the edge
this is when you know that your slip
editing tool is active and you can click
and drag and the video footage will kind
of like slide behind your bar that's
already there
and you can change where the video
footage is going to start like this
now hopefully you get the idea it's a
little hard to understand but just kind
of think of it as this it this is like
your footage right here is like a bridge
and your footage that you trimmed
already is like water and it goes
underneath and you can you can change
where you wanted your footage to start
and everything instead of having to trim
a layer and then move it with a
selection tool and trim it again to get
to where you want it to you can use the
slip editor to easily change where your
layer is gonna where your footage is
going to start also when you're slipping
your footage it's going to leave the
keyframes there in the same place and
you select the keyframes
it'll add or it'll slip along with the
footage they had so if you spent some
time
masking or rotoscoping and you want the
footage to stay if you want your mass to
stay with your footage then you'll want
to have the that mass selected and
you'll want you'll want to have that
mask keyframe selected and it'll slip
alongside with the footage so what I did
is I did a a quick mask here
let's put it on and I just masked out
roughly the nose of the of the lion so
you can see there when I turned the
toggle mask on you can see that there is
a mass there and it's cutting out his
nose and I roughly have it following and
I also have opacity keyframes down here
just to help show you what's going on so
let me slip the footage right here and
watch the watch the keyframes you can
see that they stay in position where
they are well that's not good if I mask
because now the mask doesn't line up
anymore so I'm gonna hit control Z to
get it back to where it was and it kind
of well the nose kind of lines up I
didn't spend a whole lot of time on it
so what you want to do when that happens
is select these keyframes here and when
you go to when you go to slip the
footage now those keyframes that you
have selected will stay with it and I
can come over here to where there are
keyframes and you can see that it's
still like the math still lines up so
there's a that's a way to work with that
so I'll get back there and as you see
the opacity keyframes didn't move along
with it they stayed where they were so
you want your footage to fade out but
you don't what you want the mask to stay
with it use your slip editor
there too to line up keep everything
lined up and move your keyframes along
the time line as you like now if you try
to like move these move this it'll move
the keyframes with it also so I mean now
you can see how to properly use that if
you're working and the slep header just
doesn't show up right here like say
we're at the we didn't need to trim the
footage at all there and now you're like
how do I slip out of these well if you
come up here to the Pan behind tool
which you can press Y for the hotkey for
it click on it and now you slip a doors
back on so as you can see at the end of
this footage over here you can see that
this is being slipped I'm gonna go back
and I guess that's a that's all there is
to really show about the slip editor
it's handy when you're rotoscoping
things it's handy when you just want to
move your video footage around for 4
images it not really doesn't really work
a whole lot you can let me bring this
down here so here's the image and if I
try to slip at it or try to edit there's
not going to be any extra space here for
you slip edit so you would just come to
the Pan behind tool and and move and
move it but I mean there's not a whole
lot of sense but you can still do it
it'll you can move keyframes around like
that so that'll be easy I mean you can
also move keyframes around on an image
with the selection tool so the slip
editor is mostly for video that's all
for this tutorial hopefully you guys
learn something and let's uh hopefully
you can use it on your next project
thanks for watching see you in the next
