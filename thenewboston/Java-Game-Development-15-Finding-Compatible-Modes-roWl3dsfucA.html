15th java game development tutorial and
in this story as promised unless story
we're going to be finding the first
compatible display modes and pretty much
comparing display modes that we give our
game to display modes that are on the
user's video card and we're going to
compare them all against each other and
pull out one that matches so let's go
ahead and write a little comment um
compares vm pass into v video card
display modes and see if they match BAM
look at that and might as well spell
that right I mean why not so what we're
going to do first of all is name it
public we're going to be returning
display mode and let's name it fine
first compatible mode looks good let me
make sure I compatible mode I probably
messed something up but we'll fix that
later and now what we need to do is
we're going to be passing it in a list
of display modes so display mode and
we'll just name our list modes by list I
mean array sorry I use it
interchangeably so now we have a list of
display modes that we pass it in so now
what we want to do is get that um get
all the display modes from our graphics
card so let's go ahead and put display
mode and put good modes and you set that
equal to equals video card dot get and
it should pop up get display modes right
there so now we pretty much have to
erase the display modes we pass it in in
the display modes from our graphics card
and they are named modes and good modes
because we know that these are good
already so you know that's why I named
it of good modes so let's go ahead and
make a for statement to loop through
each of these so put in X arm just set
this equal to zero and
and put X is less than modes dot length
just like that so this is going to do
this for loop it's pretty much going to
loop through the modes that we pass the
in and of course we need to end it with
X plus plus so now we're looping through
all the modes that we passed it in and
we're actually going to make an inner
for loop called for and put put in y
equals zero and put Y is less than good
modes dot length and y plus plus so now
what we're going to do is we're going to
loop through waria we're going to loop
through the modes and then inside that
we're going to loop through the video
card modes and what we're going to do is
make a if statement to compare the our
modes we passed into the video card
modes so how do we do this put if
display modes match display modes match
just like this and if we want in our a
is this a built-in method or where did
this method come from actually this
method display modes match we're going
to be creating this later and what it's
going to do is take two modes and we'll
put the X mode which is the mode that we
passed in and good modes make sure I
spelled everything white right too we're
pretty much going to be comparing two
modes the mode that we passed in to the
mode that was built into our graphics
card and what are we going to do with
this we're going to write all right if
those modes match and this is going to
be a boolean it's going to either return
return true or false so if it's true
where we're going to run do return and
you pretty much I only have to return
one of these on since if they match
they're going to be the same so let's
just put return modes X in
modes like that X so again one last time
what we're going to be doing is
comparing a list of modes we passed in
to the list of display modes from our
graphics card looping through all of
them and when they match each other
we're going to return that mode and why
does it not matter because if we compare
this one in this one and they're the
same then we can just return either of
them since we're going to get the same
result no matter what one returned
because it's only going to work if it's
they're the same so now that we built
this method what do we want to do next
well I can build this method display
modes match to see if they match but
actually that might take some time so
I'll probably do that in next tutorial
let's go ahead and build one more method
and get this out of way get current VM
for display mode so let's make public oh
by the way all this is going to do is
get the current display mode that you're
working with it right now we're going to
be using this later on so public it's
going to return the display mode of
course get current display mode it's not
going to take any parameters all it's
going to do is return
Vesey get display mode right that so
whenever we call this screen get current
display mode function or excuse me
method I'm working with C++ all it's
going to do is return this display mode
you're working with and if you can't
remember display mode is um width height
um and pretty much your bit depth that's
all you need to know really so in the
next tutorial we're going to be building
this method right here to display modes
match to compare to display modes and
see if they match each other and if they
are returned true if they don't match
each other return false but it's
actually a really confusing
tutorial we have to complete compare
height with bit depth and also refresh
rates so it's going to be a kind of a
complex method it's going to take the
whole tutorial probably but it's going
to be awesome very edgy
so thank you guys for watching and don't
forget subscribe and I'll see you next
