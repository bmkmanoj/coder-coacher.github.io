tutorial which is basically an extension
of our last story we just got finish up
editing a few surface properties on our
house which is kind of looking like a
courthouse now but the very first thing
I want to do is I want to edit these
grades right here because they aren't
really looking all that great get it
great great well anyways go ahead and
select this one and this one holding
your control key and now actually I put
the same material on the back so if you
go ahead to the back we can see we can
select those as well and do everything
in one shebang so go ahead and open up
your surface properties window by
hitting f5 and the very first thing I
want to do is is I want to apply planar
alignment this is basically just going
to make sure everything's lineup and now
what I want to do is I want to set the
scale to one which is the default scale
by the way I don't know if I mentioned
this but one is your default scale if
it's point five it's going to be half
the normal size if it's 2.0 it's going
to be twice the normal size and I
actually like the look of that real
quick oh I got like a frog in my throat
or something so now all I want to do is
I want to take this metal edge and align
it with the bottom because if a
construction company were to put this
great roof inn they would actually
probably do it that way so I'm going to
go ahead and pan this down until it hits
right on the bottom maybe one more that
looks pretty good so now I'm go ahead
and X on my surface properties and I
just want to verify that the back and
the front indeed do look the same pretty
cool huh so now the only other thing I
want to change when we're talking about
surface properties is the inside walls
of our house so let's go ahead and look
at these walls real quick they look
pretty dumb that's the best I can
describe it I mean no one's inside of
their house looks like this so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to be selecting
all of these walls however in order to
do that what we need to do is we need to
hold down control and we need to select
all of these manually because it really
isn't a shortcut for doing this since
it's such a specific area we can't
select all adjacent walls route or else
that's going to select like the outside
too
so let me just go ahead and do this
manually make sure you get all the
insides of your windows control control
and now let me just go ahead and make
sure your hold down control because if
you let it go it's going to deselect
everything else and you're going to
probably cut your head off so now I got
everything selected that I need to even
the inside of my windows and doors and
check it out the very first thing I want
to do is open up my server properties
window and make sure to apply a planar
alignment so when you do that everything
it's kind of lined up nicely so you're
inside of your windows line up with your
walls and so on and so forth the next
thing I want to do is change the scale
so in order to change the scale go ahead
and drop this down and I actually want
to pump it up a real big and go ahead
and hit apply and this gives you kind of
a nice illusion in like you know how
some people wallpaper their house and
they have trim well this is kind of
looks like trim now rather than you know
when we had it Oh point five or one
point oh this doesn't really look like
wall at all this gives us the illusion
that yes it indeed is a perfectly
wallpaper at all so now the only thing
that we really need to do is pan this
vertically so in order to do that I
actually want this trip to be on top I
think that'd look pretty cool so when we
paint it vertically it pans down by
default so go ahead and hold shift and
pan it up and let me just pan this up
slowly until the top butts right up
against the top of that so now without
getting out of my surface properties
window I can verify that my house inside
does look pretty dang good and I see my
bottom isn't lining up but that's not
really an issue say that's a you know
the new style not to have your bottom
line up or something like that so that's
basically all I want to do with surface
properties for right now in the next
tutorial I don't know what we're going
to be covering but trust me it's going
to be amazing and we're probably going
to be making our house look a whole lot
better so for now that's all you guys
get that's all I want to cover with
surface properties again those are the
main things I want to talk about the
lighting channels and
Lightmass settings I'll talk about light
mass in I'll cover lights in a whole
nother tutorial but for now these are
the basics of how you can adjust the
core properties of your materials so
thank you guys for watching I hope you
guys enjoyed the video and I'll see you
guys in next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
