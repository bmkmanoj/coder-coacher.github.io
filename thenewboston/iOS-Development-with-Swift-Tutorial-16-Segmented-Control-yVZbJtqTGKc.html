video and this is probably going to be a
real quick video because I just want to
show you guys one more item real quick
and I want to show you guys this because
this is one of the other ones that
you're going to be using it a lot and it
has a lot of flexibility and the next
tutorial that I'm going to make is going
to be getting into multiple few
applications so again I didn't want to
skip over it so yeah that's my nice
little intro segmented controls here we
go so to learn what they are we might as
well just look at one so if you go type
in seg grab segmented control and just
drop it anywhere right here now what I
actually do is I use one of these
whenever I'm making like social
networking apps and say that you have
two settings whenever you make a cup
oast one is private and say that you
made a post that only you want your
friends to see you can set it as private
and if you said is public anyone in the
world can see it so alright so right now
we can see that it's pretty much a
toggle or a list of choices actually
what do they say segmented displays
multiple segments all right so it's
pretty much a list of buttons but you
can use it as a toggle and that brings
me to another point even though right
now it just looks like a little switch
you can also have multiple additional
buttons on here so if you wanted to have
like um five different buttons on here
you can but for this example I'm just
going to show you guys a segment to
control with two buttons or two options
and then once you guys know that you
will be able to learn the more advanced
properties of it so now that we have
private and public what I'm going to do
is I'm going to add functionality to
allow the user to click one of these and
it's going to change this label as well
so this is actually pretty cool because
we can change this label with a slider
that we learned in the last video or
this segmented control so how do we do
that it's pretty easy let's go ahead and
create another action so control drag
sticker right there and of course this
is an action it's going to be called
whenever the
or clicks one of these segments and I'll
just name this toggle now for the type
I'm going to sent this to you I
segmented control and hit connect now
this is a thing that probably gets a lot
of people now of course the sender
refers to this object this is the object
that's going to call this method now
whenever you call it it passes in the
information of did they click this one
or this one did they click private or
public now that information it's stored
as an index so remember whenever you
make arrays just like everything else
including the first item always starts
with zero so private is zero public is
one if you had another item it would be
two three four and so on so again
remember every item in your segmented
control has an index and they start with
zero so that's important right now
because then we can add like an if
statement to test if sender dot selected
segment index and because say equals
equals zero well what happens here let's
just change the label text so I'm Way
too lazy to type all that so we can say
okay if you passed it in and has the
value of zero then we know it must be
the first element which is private so
we'll just type private now right now if
we had multiple buttons like four or
five we would need to test each of those
individually but now we can just write
an else statement because if this method
gets called and they didn't click the
private then it means they must click
the public to call it so now we can just
add another one to change the text to
public so now before I review this let
me go ahead and run it and make sure
that it actually works all right so
check this out of course we can change
the label in one of two ways a slider we
already know or we can
like public Jay's its public private
public slider private public slider do
this all day pretty stinking awesome so
again there you go pretty
self-explanatory you don't really need
to explain it again so uh yeah in the
next tutorial we're kind of done talking
about basic items right now I'm going to
show you guys how to pretty much create
a multiple view application in other
words how to take our iOS development
and add more screens to our app it's
going to be awesome
I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
