to another tutorial and in this little
After Effects project I'm going to teach
you guys how to create a fake meteor
shower now in this story I'm just going
to use a still picture instead of a
video just because I know just because I
feel like it but you can of course use a
video if you want so go ahead and keep
your video clip on a separate layer then
the layer we're going to be working on
and what you want to do above your video
clip or still picture if you want go
ahead and click layer new solid and
you're going to want to make sure you
have a white solid because that's what
color the meteor is going to be and of
course stars are white so you can add a
little blue tint to it if you want but
we'll keep it white so go ahead and
press okay and okay now you see you have
a big white solid over your video so
what we need to do first is we need to
make a particle to simulate the meteor
or asteroid whatever you want to call it
so with your layer selected go ahead and
click effect simulation let's see cc
particle world and what this is going to
do is it's going to produce a bunch of
particles now we see all these particles
right here but we only really need one
for the meteor so go ahead and scroll
way back to the beginning and what you
want to do is first change a couple
settings the first thing you want to
change is the radius so go ahead and
let's see where it is producer radius
and turn these all x y&amp;amp;z to 0 now as you
can see it just tightens it up a little
bit I mean you really can't tell the
difference right now because it was so
small to begin with but later on you'll
see what's going on the next thing after
that let me go ahead and scroll right
here is you want to change all your
physics to zero so go ahead and change
your velocity and your gravity and also
your extra to zero and now you see
instead of a bunch of particle ski now
you only have one particle right there
even though you can't even see it so
let's go ahead and
turn this grid off is just annoying me
and now what we need to do is change the
type of the particle now by default
let's see what it is it's a line and we
want to change it to a lens convex and
this is just because a lens convex in
this is how it interacts with that white
background and as you can see and now
takes the form of the background which
is white and it's just a probably the
most accurate particle for what we're
going to be doing that's creating
asteroid for other effects you want to
choose other stuff but for now this is
good to go so now you see that there's
just one particle chill in there right
now and while we're here remind as well
adjust the birth size and turn this way
down to like point o2 and this size down
to like point o2 or somewhere around
there we're going to be messing with
this later on but for now here's a good
start so now that we lowered the birth
size and the death size what you want to
do is go to the point in your movie I'm
going to start mine in two seconds you
probably don't want to start it right at
the beginning because it will look
unnatural kind of like two seconds in
your movie or something and what I like
to do is go down here under my effect
Sisu particle world and producer and
we're going to go ahead and edit the
position and what this is going to do is
give the effect that it's traveling
across your screen so let's go ahead and
keyframe out the position X and y and
now go to let's see how long you want
your the last word probably like a
second or something it would be flying
across the sky so kind of like a second
later and move your asteroid to where
you want it and I'm going to want mine
to appear like it's going down into the
left a little bit so what I'm going to
do actually is I want to move that up to
begin with and
there we go and now let me just say you
could tinker with your position too so
right there so that's pretty much where
I want my Asher to go and you know what
I'm even going to do this move it a
little bit farther out there you go so
now here's what we have going on right
here a beginning of an asteroid and I
see the first problem we have right here
as this asteroid has like the world's
longest tail in the world so what we
need to do the fix this is shorten the
longevity so you do this by the
longevity is how long the particle lasts
so go ahead and bring this down to about
I don't know that looks about as
accurate as an asteroid would be so now
has actually want to shorten it down to
about maybe even 0.2 there we go so see
I'm not happy with it point two for game
time right there so this is about how
long is the asteroid this tail would be
perfect
so aside from this the couple things you
notice is it kind of looks like it's
hitting a brick wall to begin with and
then as it ends it's hitting another
brick wall it's really unnatural so when
this travels across the sky it's not
like it automatically starts and ends
just out of nowhere so what we want to
do is we want to change the opacity of
the silicon looks like it's fading into
the atmosphere atmosphere and then like
burning out or whatever the heck they do
so let's go ahead and not under your
effects ball under transform for your
main layer we want to start messing with
the opacity so go to where it the tail
just comes out right about right there
and you want your opacity to keyframe it
and then go a couple frames out and
actually keyframe of source one is zero
because it's at nothing to begin with
and then keyframe it a couple frames
later it like
63 that looks good now right before it
stops go ahead and change this to zero
and now go back a couple steps and
keyframe this one at like I don't know
you probably don't want it in 100
because it's not like it's a light you
can see clearly it's way off in the
distance so that looks a little better
right now what you want to do is
probably move these keyframes around and
just tinker with it I mean as you can
see it's not perfect right now because
I'm trying to do this in under ten
minutes but you can see it kind of gives
effects that it's fading in and you
probably want to start a little earlier
but that's good for now you guys can
tinker with that but as you can see you
get the basics of an astroid fading in
moving across and fading out just like
that and one other thing aside from
tinkering it so it looks like it's
coming in and leaving more realistically
the other thing you might want to do is
I'm going to change my birth rate there
you go that's a little bit better and
you also might want to add a glow to it
in order to do this go ahead and select
your white solid and go to effect
stylize glow and now you see you have a
little glow to your asteroid it kind of
makes it look more I don't know if it
looks more realistic but it definitely
looks a lot cooler so that is your ten
minute tutorial in how to make an ash
asteroid fly across the sky and after
effects so um that's it for now I'm out
of time thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
