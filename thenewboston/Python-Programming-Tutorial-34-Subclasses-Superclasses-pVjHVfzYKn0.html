tutorial and in this story I'm going to
be talking about subclasses and super
classes and this is kind of a way of how
you can use one class to inherit all the
traits of another class and if you work
with anything like CSS before then you
probably know a little bit about parent
and child and inheritance and stuff like
that but um well let's just go ahead and
get started the first thing we need to
do is make a class and I promise by the
end of this tutorial you will know what
subclasses super classes are so let's go
ahead and make a class and this is going
to be the parent class so I'm going to
name my parent class go figure
and let's put a couple variables in here
very one equals this but I am very one
just make a string and let's go ahead
and make another one just for fun I
don't know if we're going to use it or
not but say I am variable two now we
have a class with parent class it's
called and we have two variables in it
but what if we wanted to go ahead and
make another class just like this but we
didn't want to type everything out aka
a laziness well you can do this just
make a class go ahead and name a child
class because it's going to inherit all
the characteristics of parent class
without having to type anything out now
after you write the name of the your
class if you wanted to inherit all the
characteristics of this class all you
have to do is type the class you want to
inherit a re to make sure I'm not typing
anything wrong all you have to do is
type what class traits you want to
inherit is parameters in this class so
now in our instruction all you have to
do put pass in case you guys don't know
pass means don't do anything it's pretty
much just a blank I know that it's where
they would have something like that in
programming but they do so now we have a
parent class with all these variables in
a child class with all of these
variables and you can make as many
classes as you want and inherit it from
a class to get all of their
what's it called like information so now
let me show you guys how this actually
works we need a couple objects to access
those variables so we need parent object
and set equal to parent class with empty
parameters and now we can go ahead and
press ENTER and now we can use our
parent object to access the variables so
i shouldn'ta type such long object names
but parent objects bar 1 equals I am var
1 now this was expected because because
we use the parent class to access its
own a variable in a printed out IM bar 1
but we didn't write these two variables
in child so you think it will access the
variable is the same well let's find out
let's go ahead and make a child object
and make it equal to a child class and
put some empty parameters right there
and now we made an object that can
access the variables as well so let's go
ahead and put child object dot bar 1 and
see what we get
I am var 1 let's see if it works for the
bar - just for fun bar - I am var - and
as you can see this is a different way
where you can inherit all the traits of
a class just by putting it in the
parameters and this is useful when you
want to copy an entire class but you
don't want to have to type every single
variable and method in it so that's how
you can copy an entire class and they
name it child and parent or subclass and
super class because this inherits the
traits of a bigger one so that is your
quicksort on parents and child classes
also called subclasses and super classes
by some people so that's your quick
tutorial on how you can use one class
then here all the traits of another
class and also call the variables so
thank you guys for watching I hope you
learned a little something here and I
look forward to teaching you something
in the next thoreau so don't forget to
subscribe and I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
