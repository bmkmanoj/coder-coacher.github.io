welcome to your very first tutorial in
Android app development now before you
even continue on with this video I need
to tell you guys one thing before you
can start making android apps you need
to know how to program in Java now for
those of you who don't know what Java is
and think it's like a cup of coffee or
something Java is computer programming
language in this language is the main
programming language behind Android apps
so if you don't know how to program in
Java you don't know how to make Android
app so if you don't know what Java is go
ahead and type the New Boston Java
tutorial in the youtube com or just look
at my other videos and I'm a like a
hundred Java tutorial so watch my video
series on that the best on the web by
the way and I'll teach you how to
develop in Java and once you're a Java
expert then you can come back here and
begin making android apps now for those
of you who have watched my job tutorials
and or you know if you at least know the
core basics of how to develop in Java
then let's go ahead and continue now we
need a couple things in order to develop
android apps on our computer you just
can't go ahead open notepad and start
making apps you need to develop a bunch
of toolkits and libraries and stuff like
that so the first couple of videos I'm
going to show you we're not going to be
coding all we're just going to be
setting up our computer in order to
develop these android applications so
the first thing we need is the Java
development kit and this is going to
allow us to pretty much program java on
our computer so with that being said
let's go ahead and download that first
again this is called the jdk or java
development kit so let's go historic
marathon match aussie open I have to
read about that later so anyways what I
can do what I was thinking about doing
is just giving you guys a direct link
and say all right click this link and
download that but then I was thinking
you know what the website is changing
all the time and the last time I
downloaded this it was son
and then oracle bought out son so they
changed up all the website so anyways
there is no link I'm going to be able to
post in the description box so instead
I'm going to do this any time you want
to download the java jdk just go ahead
and google and type in download but you
have to spell it right download jdk and
no matter how they change up the website
or who bought out who just go ahead and
click on the first thing and this is
always going to bring you to the
download page page for the jdk now if
you're looking at this and you're saying
all right Bucky told me download the jdk
so let's go ahead and see if we can find
it the jdk jdk 8 k plus javafx plus
NetBeans + e it can kind of be
overwhelming but the thing we have to
remember is we only need the jdk but if
you want to download something else with
it go ahead now what i did is i download
the jdk plus javafx bundle because not
only do i write android programs but
also develop java on my own time but
anyways you can probably develop or
excuse me you can probably download
anyone you want but if you want to stick
with me download the jdk plus your
javafx bundle so go ahead and click this
and by the way i'm not going to be able
to walk you guys through the entire
download since i already have it
installed on my computer but i'm going
to show you what to do so anyways go
ahead and click java jdk plus javafx and
you probably need to agree to this you
don't need to register this is just
optional and go ahead and click continue
and then go ahead and click this the
linker right here and what this link is
going to allow you do is it's going to
allow you to download the executable
file now whenever you have this file
download it go ahead and double-click it
in a wizard is going to open and a
wizard is pretty much a walkthrough
showing you you know it's pretty much
that thing that says next next agree
finish you just have to click Next a
bunch of times and finish and anyways
once you have like I said I'm not going
to explain you how to download something
you should know how to do that already
if you're watching these stories I'm not
going to show you guys like an idiot so
anyways a wizard is going to pop open
once you click that file just hit next
next agree finish
you got it downloaded so check this out
once you have downloaded go ahead to
your command line and you do that by
going start and typing CMD or you know
however you open your command line and
then this thing's gonna pop open now
what your command line is is it's pretty
much like the old school computer let
allows you to open files and run
programs without having to click the
icon so anyways let's go ahead and see
what happens when we type in Java Sea
this should go ahead and give us a whole
bunch of stuff and tell us about our
Java compiler well it says Java Sea is
not a recognized it pretty much says
alright you have it downloaded but it's
not working and why is that it's because
even though we downloaded Java we don't
have it set up so ur computer recognizes
how to use it yet so in order to do that
here's what we need to do so again like
I said after you downloaded that link
open the file and I ran the wizard
here's what you need to do and make sure
you play very close attention to what
I'm doing go ahead to your Start menu
right here and go ahead to computer and
then go ahead to your main hard drive
and double-click it now you're going to
see a bunch of folders you might have a
folder that says program files and you
might have a folder it says Program
Files x 86 now there's going to be a
folder in one of these and the folder is
going to be called Java now mine's in my
program files 86 but like I said yours
might be in your program file so you're
just going to need to look for it but
anyways go ahead and click one of those
folders and find the one that says Java
and go ahead and click that folder right
here now once you go ahead and open this
folder you're going to see another
folder inside that called JDK and it's
going to have a bunch of numbers after
it but anyways you're looking for their
folder that says JDK and again the path
is computer local disk program files
java so go ahead and double-click that
JDK folder right there and now inside
here you're looking for a folder that
says been so double-click bin and you
see this whole list
of crap right inside here now what we're
interested in doing is getting the path
to this location so go ahead and click
any of these files right here i'm going
to go ahead and right-click applet
viewer again like I said right click it
don't left click it and go ahead and
select properties now in this property's
you're going to see a location can you
guys hear that there's like a plane
flying over my house and it's a does
that play not know I'm in the middle of
the door right now but anyways go ahead
and add this location copy this path
it's going to be is going to start with
your hard drive and it's going to end
with bin so go ahead and copy this and
now X out of everything that path is
pretty much a path to what we just
downloaded and we need to tell our
computer that that's where it is so once
we have that location copied here's what
we need to do now follow along with me
go ahead to your Start menu in where it
says computer right here don't click it
but right click it and once you
right-click a drop down menu is going to
appear go ahead and select properties
right there now this is going to show
you all the properties for your computer
but what we are interested in doing is
going to the advanced system settings
and once we click this a box is going to
open in this box we're going to want to
choose environment variables so go ahead
and click that and we want to add a new
variable to our computer so go ahead and
can you guess what 1 i'm going to click
yep new just right there now the
variables name is and you have to type
it exactly like i do pkt age it has to
be called path in the variable value of
course let's go ahead and copy ctrl v
the path that we just had the location
so anyways your path is going to need to
start with your hard drive and it's
going to need to end with bin now go
ahead and click OK and go ahead and
click OK and then go ahead and click OK
and then go ahead and click x and we
should be good go so in order to test if
your java compiler in the JDK is working
here's what you need to do
ghost press CMD or open your command
line any how you do it and once your
command line is open go ahead and type
in java sea again and now when you press
Enter you see we get a whole list of
stuff telling us about the Java compiler
now before it said you know Java Sea not
recognized WTF is Java Sea and now we
get this whole list of stuff given us
information about it so that's how we
know that the java jdk is installed
properly and it's ready to go so anyways
like i said this lays the foundation for
giving us the ability to develop java
programs on our computer but we're not
done yet setting up our computer in
order to finish setting up our computer
for Android development we need to vent
we need excuse me install the Android
SDK Eclipse and also set up the Android
ADT so we got a ways to go before you
can begin developing Android
applications but trust me it'll be worth
it since it's a whole lot of fun so
anyways once you got your java jdk setup
you're ready to move on to my next
tutorial so thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
you guys next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
