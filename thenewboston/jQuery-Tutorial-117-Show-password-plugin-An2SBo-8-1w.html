JavaScript file with all your plug-in
initialized like initialization another
jutted jQuery code but for now I'm just
gonna quit this password is I'm then
going to go ahead and include that as
well so password is is going to be the
file that we actually initiate this
plug-in from so as long as all of these
are included in our page we can go ahead
and do that so I've included a script
type obviously exactly the same thing
with this password that Jas file here so
now that we've got our plug-in available
to use on our page and we've got our
password J's file we can go ahead and
write our jQuery code in here to
initialize this plug-in so assuming I
don't know how to install this plug-in
many authors will give you some kind of
indication of how to use this so you'll
see that we have on this page some
information we can see that all we need
to do is create an input field with the
type of password and supply an ID for
this as well so that's the first step
that we're going to go ahead and carry
out so input type equals password and
we'll give this an ID of a password so
now that we've given us an ID we can use
this as we normally would other elements
in jQuery or other elements in HTML to
reference to this and we can use a
selector to select this element and then
apply the plug-in to it so here you can
see its most basic form you can you just
literally need to select the element
which will be a password and then you
need to just call this show password
here so let's go ahead and do this now
remember our ID is a password so in here
when we create our selector we want to
choose a password and then the call for
this plug-in is show password now it's
extremely important to note that jQuery
obviously JavaScript as well is case
sensitive so we want to ensure that we
use a capital small s and a capital P
exactly as stated here and earlier I
said that this index top PHP will
provide an demo as well so if you go
ahead and you're not too sure or the
documentation is limited on the website
and they do include
a demo file go ahead and open that demo
file up and you'll be able to see all
the relevant information there so with
regards to this now this should be
activated so we haven't supplied any
options to that but we'll make options
to this but we'll take a look at that in
just a moment so let's go over to our
page and press refresh you can now see
that we've got our form field that we
created earlier and we've got this show
password checkbox here so obviously to
test it's working we want to go ahead
and enter a password and click show
password it does appear to be working so
as well as that if we were to go over to
the documentation as well we can go
ahead and look at some examples given
this is particularly well documented
documented we've got some paragraphs
here just giving you know a lot as much
detail as possible so you can see here
we've got a few options that we can give
this for example text and that's you
know sort of noted here that it would
show the custom password text so at the
moment on our page it just says show
password so for example if we wanted to
change this we just take a look at the
notation on the website so in here we
can specify particular options so with
regards to this one we would need to
supply an element and in the options
associated with that element so in this
case checker we can change the text so
we need to supply checker and then in
brackets we need to supply any options
that are available so in here we can go
ahead and the class checker contains the
following options we can supply text so
for example reveal and now when we
refresh this you can see that the text
will owner Adam let's see what we might
have done
here there we are so checker and then
we've got a colon and then in brackets
we've got the options associated with
this particular class so now when we
refresh it still hasn't worked and that
is because sorry not a colon we've got a
comma because remember this is the
element and this is the are the options
so finally no so let's go ahead I think
I know what's wrong I think I haven't
read this properly yeah okay so I've
misread it and haven't done my research
correctly but what we're actually gonna
do here is we are specifying an element
that we want to inject the checkbox into
so let's go ahead and create a span just
at the end of here and I'll call this
checkbox so now in password KS we can go
ahead and say check box text reveal and
that should give us that option there
okay so another probably point now to
make is actually read the text rather
than just looking at the options so now
that we've done that we have supplied
the checkbox class which I've assigned
to this span just here with the text
reveal and we've given that we've put
the text box into this span here and
then just specified a particular option
so that covers just installing a very
basic jQuery plugin we've already spoken
about why we use plugins but things like
this obviously are useful and on a
relatively small in file size we saw in
in our archive earlier that we've got a
1.7 KB file so you're looking at
something that's you know quite quick to
run and the benefit of this is we have a
minified and compressed version as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
