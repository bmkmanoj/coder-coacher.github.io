welcome back to your 26th JavaScript
tutorial now in one of the tutorials
before I told you guys that there are a
couple different ways to create objects
one way is to use something called a
constructor function well in this
tutorial I'm going to be talking to you
guys about the different type of way or
another way to create objects and this
is called object initializers an object
initializer is a lot faster than a
constructor function because it's only
one line of code as opposed to a whole
function and then creating the object it
pretty much takes everything and
squishes it together in one line and why
would you use this and when would you
use a constructor function you would use
this whenever you're creating basically
only one or two objects of the same type
for example if you had if you're
creating like 500 person objects then
you probably want to use a constructor
function but if you're just creating one
Buckey object or a Buckey and the
tailore object then this is fine so for
this example is probably a little more
easier and this is probably what you
want to do when you're just starting out
making objects so let's go ahead and in
our head since we're just going to be
creating our objects now and not typing
anything out let's go ahead and create
our objects right now so you don't use
the keyword var and you don't use the
keyword new the only thing you need to
do when making object initializers is
type the name of whatever you want your
object to be named and I want my object
to be named Bucky and go ahead and set
that equal to all the properties you
want to set equal to whatever it is so
like before we made a constructor
function that had a name and then age
well now let's go ahead and do the same
thing so in order to do that go ahead
and write the name of the property which
is name then add a colon now after this
you write the value what you want it to
equal so I want the name of Bucky to be
Bucky Roberts and now you say alright we
want another property now
so in order to do that just go ahead and
separate it with a comma
and then go ahead and type of the name
of the property which is age and set
this equal to whatever value want to be
equal to 24 so as you can see instead of
writing each property on a separate line
with the constructor function all you do
now is separate your properties with a
comma and go ahead and list the property
: value property : value and I have two
properties in here but you can have a
thousand if you want the only thing you
have to remember is separate them all
with a comma pretty cool huh
so now let's go ahead and make another
object so so so so what the heck one my
Chinese just so we can see more clearly
what's going on so I'll go ahead and
make that other Taylor object just like
before and sorry if I found in any
oriental people there but uh one of the
properties is name and I would want this
to be equal to Taylor Swift and another
property is age so go ahead and add my
comma property age and for the value is
20 so now we have two objects buckey's
name is Bucky Roberts Taylor's name is
Taylor Swift
Bucky's age is 24 Taylors age is 20 easy
enough so now just like before the body
can be the exact same anytime you want
to use your object it's no different
than before just go ahead and write your
object name like Bucky and then go ahead
and write whatever property you want to
use like age name whatever so let's go
ahead and take a look at a quick example
document dot writes and go ahead and
write like Bucky
name loves Taylor name because she is
Taylor H now let's see if I mixed
anything up or messed it up whatever
Bucky Roberts loves Taylor Swift because
she is twenty pretty cool so like before
we can see that whenever we want to use
one of these properties just go ahead
and write the object property object
property object property simple enough a
so now we see that we have two different
ways we can make objects using object
initializers which are these or using
constructor functions and like I said if
we had more than two people like Bucky
Taylor John Steven Tony Mikey Matty we
would have to I mean we won't have to
but it's probably better to use a
constructor function but now that we
only have one or two objects using an
object initializer is fine so that's
when you would use object initializers
as opposed to constructor functions so
for now that's all I have for you um in
the next tutorial I don't know what I'm
going to be talking about but trust me
it's going to be awesome so thank you
