another PI game tutorial video in this
video we're gonna be talking about is
allowing the user to set the power of
their tanks cannon so right now we can
modify the turret and we can shoot you
know shoot the actual tank cannon but we
don't actually have a way for the user
to set the power so as you can see like
on this one we would still not no matter
what be able to get our shot over the
barrier and especially more importantly
we want to actually be able to hit a
tank even like over here so we want to
be able to have enough power that we can
shoot our cannon you know somewhat close
but also it needs to be able to at least
get all the way to the other side of our
map so to speak so when I let the user
be able to modify power but the other
thing is they have to be able to see
visually their power so they need to
know like what where am I in my power so
to do that we're gonna use something
pretty similar to how we displayed score
in our previous video or a previous game
and and then the modification to power
I really have a greatest keys to do it
you could use like the plus and minus
keys but the problem with that is by
default the plus and minus keys well I
think the Maya skied it require shifting
and all that so it might confuse people
so I I will just say that we're gonna
use a and D to modify the power so we'll
come down basically to our key down
events and we'll add a couple more key
presses so we're just gonna say L if
event dot key equals hi game dot capital
K underscore a what do we want to do and
then also for now let's just let's just
write it the pass and then we're say L
if if then dot he equals high game dot K
underscore D what do we want to do for
now we'll just
now let's go up to the top here and
we're gonna define two new variables so
we're gonna have a fire underscore power
and this is gonna be the starting power
of our tanks cannon and we're just gonna
say 50 so that's gonna be half right
we're going to do anything from 1 to 50
basically so fire power 50 and then
we'll say power underscore change and
then that's going to equal 0 so this is
going to be how much do we want that
fire power to change and so as you can
imagine just like change turret each
change will be 1 we'll add 1 to this and
then every loop we say fire power plus
equals power change so we'll come down
here to where we wrote it vent key
equals Pi game K a and now we're gonna
write in here if it's a we want to go
down so we'll say power change equals
negative 1 and then if we'll just copy
this and then if it's d we want to go up
so power change equals 1 easy enough and
then at the bottom here basically you
can just put this wherever but we'll
just put it right here before we draw a
barrier we say fire underscore power
plus equals the power change and then
after that we want to display power
somewhere so I'm just gonna write power
and then fire power so we wanna a
function that is going to display the
fire power for the user so that when the
user is modifying and shooting they can
first of all see what the power level is
that they're using and then they can
modify that and see how much they're
modifying it so now we need a power
function so let's just scroll up right
above game intro and let's just put it
right below this the fire shell function
and we're just gonna call this obviously
power we've already
stated that pretty much so define power
and then power is gonna take one
parameter and it's gonna be leveled so
how much power basically and we're just
gonna say text equals small font we
already defined small font long ago
small font dot render and then what do
we want this to stay well before
remember it said score : now we just say
power :
easy enough power : and then edit it's
like a space there and then plus the
string version of level and then we're
gonna do plus percent so now we know
what the percentage is
will do true and then this will be black
then we just need to like display this
to the screen so we do game display dye
blit what are we gonna blit the text and
then where do we actually want to render
it well we want kind of in the middle
but shifted over a little bit so let's
just go ahead and we could do the whole
getrekt thing and all that but for now
let's just go ahead and just do display
width divided by two and then zero so X
is displayed with my over to Y zero good
enough so that should display the power
so let's go ahead and save and run that
really quick make sure got an error
local variable power change referenced
before assignment I swear we defined
power change
ah so we had power underscore change and
then we had power uh capital change that
is so I'm gonna fix that you can do
whatever you want I'm very bad with my
pep eight I'm sorry it's a power
underscore change power underscore
change and then we'll come down here and
then say plus equals power underscore
change okay let's try this one more time
we must simple ok so now we have power
and it's you know you've got 50% right
now but then we can have you know can
press and hold a oh we did not I would
have to keep key up functionality let's
go ahead and fix that
so we'll go we'll just basically say
let's just copy this this just to the if
copy paste and then right or and then
this right here Kady paste if all that
is the case power underscore change
equals zero so basically if event key is
a or the event key is D that's being
lifted up what do we want to do we want
to just set power change to equal zero
let's try this one more time play and
then now we press D let go nice cool so
now everything is acting as as we
actually intended so that's how we can
set the power now we want to be able to
actually pass the power into the actual
firing function so that's what we're
gonna be doing in the next video you can
already sort of guess what variable in
that function we are going to be
modifying since I showed you guys I'll
show you guys how we're going to
actually modify it in the next video so
stay tuned for that thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
