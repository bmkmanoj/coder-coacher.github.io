angles of triangles so for any triangle
X plus y plus C is equal to 180 degrees
so this is just saying that the measure
of angle X plus the measure of angle y
plus the measure of angle Z is equal to
180 degrees
so using this information we're gonna do
an example
so we know that the measure of angle ABC
is equal to 30 degrees the measure of
angle BAC is equal to 45 degrees and the
measure of angle ACB is what we're
trying to find so we're just gonna call
it x so we're gonna add all of these
together with X just counting for this
angle and set it equal to 180 degrees if
you add those up we get 75 and if you
subtract them over you get x equals 105
degrees so the angle of abies ACB is a
hundred and five degrees so now we're
gonna do it in another example we know
that the measure of angle EG f is 30
degrees is 30 degrees and we want to
find out what the measure of this angle
is well if you remember when I said that
we put this little square sign here that
means that this is a right angle and a
right angle is equal to 90 degrees so
we're gonna add X plus 90 plus 30 and
set it equal to 180 degrees if you add
this up you get X plus 120 equals 180 we
subtract it over you
X is equal to 60 degrees okay now that
we know that property we're gonna look
at the exterior and interior angles of a
triangle and see how they relate to one
another so for any triangle X plus y is
equal to the measure of Z so the measure
of angle X plus the measure of angle Y
is equal to the measure of angle C so
now we're gonna do an example so we're
gonna do an example where we're trying
to find out what the measure of angle K
is that's what we're trying to solve for
so since we know that the sum of these
two angles right here equals angle K
we're going to add 38 plus 45 and set it
equal to the measure of angle K and if
you add those up
you'll get 83 degrees is equal to
measure of angle K so that means that
this angle right here is an 83 degree
angle so now that we know some basic
properties of triangles in the next
video we're gonna do some triangle
comparison</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
