tutorial and in this video I'm going to
show you guys how to view the changes or
differences between your work and copy
which is the files that you're working
on in the main files in that git
repository or your main core project
that usually you know a lot of people
are going to share so let's go ahead and
first actually make some differences so
right now I'm opening a first text which
is pretty much just one of our files and
I didn't make any changes yet so this is
the way that it appears in our main
repository so now let's just go ahead
and on our working copy we'll put
something like Bucky is the best dude
ever and we'll go ahead and save that so
now once we saved it this file on a
working copy is different from the one
in our repository but how exactly do we
view these changes because you know
sometimes we made some changes to a file
and we want to view the one in the
repository and this happens a lot
whenever you're working with code
because you're like alright I want to
know exactly the changes I'm doing and
how this is going to affect the main
project so the first thing that we can
do is type git status and hit enter and
it said all right right now you have one
file first text and it's modified
meaning it's different from the one in
the main project or the main repository
so how do we view what exactly is
modified or different about it well if
you type git diff and hit enter what
this is going to do is let me scroll
down a little bit this is going to show
you the differences so basically this
red one right here says I am my ham some
people call me Sam this is the one
that's in your main repository in this
green one are the differences or the
modifications that you made so now what
we can do is we can um well let's just
go ahead and add it and commit it to the
main project so get
my frickin cursors messing up get add Oh
what was the name of it first text and
then get commit with a message okay we
are committing our changes and hit enter
and now if we do get status it says all
right and for the fun of it we'll just
do git diff and hit enter and what this
command does is it shows you the
differences between your working copy in
the repository and since everything is
up to date and they match there are no
differences to see now another thing I
want to show you guys is this is close
out of this file open second third is
what happens when you make changes to
more than one file it looks a little bit
different so I'm going to show you that
arm will pull for the second one these
are changes to the second file
lalalalala let's copy this and these are
changes to the third make sure it up
sure to put that caps lock so you can
see it alright so now what we did is on
our working copy
we changed more than one file we change
the second and the third they are now
different from the repository so now
what we can do is Obama get bash get
status hit enter and right now get is
saying alright you modified two files so
two files are different than the one on
the repository so what we can do is put
git diff hit enter let me scroll down so
you guys can see all right so what this
is going to do now is it's going to go
through one by one file by file and tell
you exactly what is different from each
file so of course just like before the
red lines are the original ones or the
ones in the repository I should say and
the green is your working copy
or the changes that you're about to make
so again change is second the green is
what we just did pretty frickin easy
once you know the core basics of it so
now what we can do is we can get add
both of them or all of them using period
now everything is adding to the staging
area and we'll just go ahead and commit
all of those and put here are some
awesome changes to two files I don't
know it's so greatest thing I can think
of hit enter and boom everything is up
to date status enter of course we put
git diff to view the differences there
are none because our working directory
now matches our repository so that is
how you view the differences in not only
one file but also view what changes you
made in more than one file so I think
you guys for watching and we can
subscribe and also all of my videos are
on my website
Bucky's room org slash videos so if you
want to check out all my videos and
tutorials do it there so think guys for
watching and I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
