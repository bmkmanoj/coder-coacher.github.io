slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
creating the web favorites tray
application so let's see here we'll set
the favorites viewer YouTube as our
start up project so set a start up
project and if we go ahead and run this
you can see that it opens up this window
right here now if somebody already has
their favorites in their bar of their
internet browser why wouldn't they just
open their internet browser and go to
that instead of opening a whole nother
application to go to it so what we're
gonna be making is a program that runs
in the tray of the taskbar and whenever
they use the right clicks on it they can
see their favorites and automatically
open one of those and whenever they
click on it so go ahead and close out of
this and we'll come over here to our
solution and we'll click file add new
project so we will just shrink this down
some will select a windows forms
application and we'll call it favorites
favorites viewer trip and then we'll go
ahead and click OK and it looks like I
selected a class library so let's remove
this
and we need to do file and new project
windows forms application and favorites
viewer tray and then we'll go ahead and
click OK and I'll just call it favorites
viewer tray YouTube because that project
already exists okay so here's our form
one right here now let's come come over
to the properties and we want it to not
show the form so we'll set the window
state to minimize and we will find the
property show in taskbar and we'll set
that to false okay so now whenever the
form opens it's gonna be minimized and
it's not going to be shown in the
taskbar so what this does is it keeps
the user from both opening this form
because there's nothing on it for them
to use so we'll come over here and let's
add a notify icon go ahead and get out
of the tool box
okay so we'll set this the name of this
notify icon - let's just do icon notify
favorites and go ahead and press Enter
so now we need to select form one and
let's come over here to the events and
we'll just add one more thing that will
keep them from being able to see the
form so we need to find the visible
changed event so here is visible changed
so we'll just use a simple if statement
here so if me dot visible so it gives
the sensor value indicating whether they
can show the control and all its child
controls are displayed so if form one is
visible well if me not visible equals
true
then me dot visible equals false so what
this is going to do is it's going to if
form one is visible and all of the
controls on it are visible then it's
going to set it to where it isn't
visible now we need to go ahead and come
over here and set an icon for our notify
icon see here mmm looks like you didn't
save the name so we'll just call it icon
notify and we will set the icon to the
favorites icon that we have used before
so we'll just go ahead and open that so
now what we can do is we can set the
text to that's what I changed I changed
the text and not the name so we'll set
the text to right-click for favorites so
let's go ahead and run this and we need
to set our start up project to the
favorites viewer YouTube
so let me fix this real quick or a
favourites for you or trade YouTube so
we'll set this as the startup project
and if we go ahead and run this you can
see that nothing shows up but if we come
down here and look in our tray this is
actually my timer for these tutorials to
see how long it's been taking me but we
come down here to our tray you can see
that here is our icon with the star and
it says right click for favorites but if
we right click nothing shows up so what
we're going to be doing in the next
tutorial is learning how to make it show
a menu whenever they right click is so
they can view their favorites</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
