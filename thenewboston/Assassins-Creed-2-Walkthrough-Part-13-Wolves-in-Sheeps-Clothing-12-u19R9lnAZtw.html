memory number five - called wolves in
sheep's clothing and in this memory or
mission we have to protect the Medici
family specifically Lorenzo de Medici
and what we need to do first is locate
on the enemy so go ahead and use your
Eagle vision and to scout out where
everyone is and once you find them start
walking towards them right here and now
you see a big scene take place his wife
there's Giuliano Lorenzo brother really
examine sir yeah so I guess there's no
you saving that guy anymore so that's
pretty much a mission we have to go
ahead and protect the Lorenzo from
pretty much getting killed and I'm gonna
go ahead and choose my sword because it
kills with the sword is pretty much
awesome and just starts swinging to
people and see what happens
and don't let the user counter kills
because you have counter counter kills
is one of the main ways that you can
keep these fights well kind of short as
short as you can so you see the Renzo's
help in the top-left it's flashing and
you usually want to try to stick around
him as much as possible cuz I know
whenever someone's attacking him you can
just go ahead and attack them and it'll
get the attention off of them but for
now you just got to kill off some people
so go ahead and like I said use your
counting kills just stab this guy in the
chest and go ahead and select this guy
cross face and one to the back so that
should be good and this is actually
gonna be a two part video because it's a
rather long mission and it has a lot
video to it so again like I said try to
Oh in the before I even say that you
might get hurt a lot in this mission
just because you're fighting like 800
people a time so make sure all of your
armor is repaired and your medicine is
good before you even start by anyways go
ahead and try to stick around Lorenzo
and another thing you might wanna do is
talk about throwing knives because I
mean once you get done killing people
who are just on attacking you you pretty
much just sit back and pick off people
with throw knives but I like to bash
them with a sword because it's much
funner so let me take care of this guy
one Crescent chest and through the gut
just make sure and this is the last guy
before I can start going to really help
Lorenzo so let's see what you got Oh
like that you like that yeah yeah that's
right thought so now just go ahead and
try to stab all these people in the back
one to the back and you just read it yep
see easy kills when you go around the
back of your stamina so that's it for
this video a tech Francesco don't forget
to subscribe and I'll continue the rest
of the mission in next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
