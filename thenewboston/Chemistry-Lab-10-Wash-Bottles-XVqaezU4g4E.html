welcome to another awesome chemistry lab
video tutorial whatever you want to call
it anyways in this video I want to talk
to you guys about wash bottles now
believe it or not wash bottles are one
of the most commonly used piece of
equipment in the chemistry lab some are
small and some are rather large you know
people have different sizes it doesn't
you know it doesn't make one better or
worse some are nice and soft and some
are you know big and hard and firm but
they basically all do the same thing
whenever you squeeze it a little bit of
liquid comes out oh oh and you know
that's basically what a wash bottle is
now one of the most common uses of a
wash bottle is actually cleaning say you
have a dirty test-tube you dirty dirty
test-tube what you wanted to do is of
course take your wash bottle stick it in
the hole and start getting it real nice
and wet just like this and go ahead and
just slosh it around and dump it out you
have a nice clean test tube now of
course sometimes whenever you use a dry
chemical or you're boiling something
then you're gonna want to use a test
tube brush but for very simple cleaning
you can go ahead and use a simple wash
bottle now aside from just cleaning you
can also use these in chemistry
experiments and they're actually really
helpful when everyone had a very small
amount of liquid to a chemistry
experiment for example these are usually
filled with distilled water and if you
need to add some water right here of
course you wouldn't want to use a beaker
because all of these little reaction
plates would overflow so you would want
to use something like a wash bottle and
just add a little bit maybe a squirt or
a few drops to each reaction plate and
of course there's much more control with
a wash bottle rather than a huge beaker
now these wash bottles right here
they're usually made a very thin plastic
and they're made this way because it
makes it a lot easier whenever you're
squeezing the solution out but since
they're made of such a thin plastic it's
a good idea not to store chemicals in
these for a long period of time because
chemicals can eat through plastic and
when you have really thin plastic of
course it's going to eat through it
rather quick so again whenever you're
storing a chemical
you typically want to store in a glass
container or a plastic container and
that's a little bit thicker than a wash
funnel again if you're just sorting
distilled water or something then these
are fine but nonetheless I would highly
recommend picking some of these up if
you look online they're only about $2
each so go ahead and grab you know three
or four of them and well that's
basically all I got to say so anyways
thank you guys for watching don't forget
to subscribe and I'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
