with a video tutorial for the new Boston
in this video we're gonna be creating a
plugin we're going to be creating a
plugin which counts down a particular
amount of days hours minutes and seconds
to a specified date so inside of our
plugin we're going to be giving the
option which is a string a date string
which will then be converted to a
timestamp and we'll perform some
calculations based on this timestamp
we'll find out the difference between
the date now and the date that we want
to count down to and then we'll update
these divs here now I'm gonna go through
first of all the way that the plug-in
works then we're going to open up my
browser and have a look at how this
actually looks and then obviously in the
second part of the tutorial when we
actually have demonstrated this we'll go
ahead and write the code so the first
thing you'll notice that is that I have
a div called countdown this can be
called absolutely anything and can
actually be you know any element at all
as long as we obviously reference this
when we use the plug-in make use of the
plug-in I've also got for span tags here
with different classes which are days
hours minutes and seconds and as long as
the class of any particular element this
could be these could even be divs inside
here as long as they're called days
hours minutes and seconds then we can
use the plug-in and apply the plug-in to
this countdown div which will update
days hours minutes and seconds now by
default I've got these set to double
zero so if you were to just create this
on a page you would have 0 0 days 0 0
hours 0 0 minutes and 0 0 seconds so
let's just take a look at what I've
included on my page
I've got obviously jQuery here jQuery J
is the latest version of jQuery
I've got countdown jQuery j/s which is
this file here which is my account now
and plug in and I've got ext J S which
is where we call the plug-in from so
inside the xtj s you see that we've got
document ready and then we apply this
cow
down plug into this countdown div that
we're currently selecting we specify a
date and then we have a callback
function here that runs this line of
code when the countdown has finished ie
when it's you know started at a
particular day this here for example and
then reaches you know zero or reaches
the current time and date specified here
then we just change this div to we're
live so in my browser at the moment I'm
going to just show you we've got this
set as 10th to 10th of August 2011 at
1044 inside my browser you can see that
we've got one day 19 hours 13 minutes
and 24 seconds and you can actually see
that this value is decrementing by one
every second obviously we're counting
down seconds and just as you notice it
come to 1 then it will go to 0 obviously
the minutes will then decrease it to 12
minutes so this will that's all you know
it's all bleep on so if we watch it now
get down to 0 you can see that that's
changed to 12 and obviously that that's
back to 59 so we're gonna be creating
this functionality inside of this to
countdown plug-in and we're gonna be
giving the option to specify a date in
string format and then obviously using
this callback function so at the moment
we are on the 8th of August 2011 and the
time is 15 31 so if I go ahead and
change this to 15 33 for example or
15-year 15 33 you can see that we've got
1 minute and 30 seconds left so if we
leave this to run in fact let's change
it quickly to 32 okay so we've got 21
seconds left now no minutes no hours and
no days when this reaches the end this
callback function here will be initiated
and this line will be run so you'll see
the effect of this so really what we use
that we're creating this plug-in but
then putting it into practice as well so
let's just wait for this countdown to
reach 0 1 0 and you see that it's
changed to we're live so we've we've
used the plug-in in this sense however
when we go ahead and refresh obviously
it just stays at where life because
the callback function is when this date
has reached or is you know smaller than
or equal to the current date okay so
let's go ahead and obviously blank all
my pages so we can start to write this I
obviously haven't shown inside countdown
dot jquery.js but we'll be looking at
that in just a moment and creating all
that so I'll go ahead and blank
everything and we'll start from scratch
okay so you can see that I've got rid of
the div here let's go ahead and create
the div and then inside ext is I'll
explain about how we're doing this on
what we're doing so I'm gonna say div ID
is equal to countdown and then that
there and inside here I'm going to
create some spans that have classes of
each element of the time we're counting
from so span there I'll just say /ban so
this one will be days and we can go
ahead and just copy and paste this down
so we've got span class days then we've
obviously got hours and then minutes
which I'm just going to say mins and
then seconds so I'm just going to put
double zero in each of these and we can
see that in our browser now we've got
zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero
for representation of days hours minutes
and seconds now what's going to happen
is jQuery is gonna find this you know if
we if we use the plug-in on countdown it
will find the element inside with dots
days so class days hours minutes and
seconds and it will change these values
so it's important to have them inside of
a of a span or a deer four or something
like that a paragraph anything so I'll
just go ahead and do this so days hours
minutes and seconds and then that looks
something like this so we've got not
days not hours not minutes and not
seconds</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
