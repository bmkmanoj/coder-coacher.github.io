tutorial and in this video finally going
to start talking to you about classes
and objects and some cool things that
you can do with them so first of all
what the heck is a class well the most
simple definition is basically a class
is an easy way where you can group
similar variables and functions together
so say you're making a computer game
usually all of the functions dealing
with enemies and all the variables
through you would want in an enemy class
maybe you have a different one for
moving your character around well all of
those functions for moving your main
character would be in a character class
so on and so forth so again the most
simple definition is it's a really cool
way we can group similar variables and
functions together might be in record
okay just check in so with that being
said let's go ahead and look at an
example right now so in order to make a
class type the keyword class and then at
his face now class pretty much says hey
Python I'm about to make a class now
after this what you want to do is you
want to name your class something and
it's common practice to name it with a
capital letter and this is just so
programmers can differentiate between a
class and like a normal variable or a
function or anything like that so this
is how we make a class called enemy now
add a colon now whatever is indented
after this is going to be part of your
enemy class so every variable inside
here and every function is going to
belong to this enemy class so let's go
ahead and make a simple variable first
so we'll say that each enemy has a life
of 3 so now this life variable is
actually part of this enemy class just
remember that so now what we can do is
we can make a couple functions for this
class so what's one thing that we can do
we'll say we'll make a function called
attack and this is just some what
happens whenever we attack an enemy now
check this out whenever I'm just writing
these parentheses right here
what PyCharm did is automatically filled
in this keyword of self now this is
going to be a little confusing until I
finish this program and explain what
objects are but pretty much think of
whenever you see self it means use
something from this own class so if you
say you're going to see later like self
attack it means use the attack function
in this class self life means use the
life variable in this class again kind
of confusing at first but you guys are
going to see later on what it does
alright so let's make this function
actually do something whenever we attack
the anime we'll just do something like
print attack or actually let's print
ouch
we'll say that at the end we says ouch
and also what we want to do is we want
to subtract one from the enemy's life
now we can't just do this check it out
if we just try to subtract one from life
we get a little error what we actually
need to do is what I was talking about
put self life so that's how you access
the variables inside your class so
pretty much self is saying okay inside
this class take away one from the life
variable simple enough maybe it was easy
I don't understand who knew all right so
let's make one more function so this
class isn't that boring I'll make
another function to check the enemy's
life and of course it automatically
fills in that self variable and we'll
say I don't know maybe a little if
statement so if self not slough so if
self life is less than or equal to zero
and this is actually another thing I
want to point out whenever you're making
computer games don't just check if the
enemy's life is equal to zero to see if
they're dead because like if they had
three life and you had like a super
powerful weapon to like slash them in
and took away five life well then their
life would be negative two so always
make sure to check if it's less than or
equal to zero just a little I don't know
tip for game development so if they're
less than or equal to
we'll just print something like I am
dead Bob the enemy obviously couldn't
say anything if it was dead but this is
our game we could do what do you want
alright so if they're dead they're dead
else we'll just print out like how much
life they had lab so print something
like of course we need to convert it to
a string so print out the amount of life
that they have left and we'll just do
something like this life left like -
life left one life left
tomato tomahto alright so right now we
have a very simple class of enemy so the
enemy has three life and we can attack
him whenever we call this function it
takes one life away and also anytime we
can have it check to see how much life
the enemy has if it's dead it prints out
I'm dead or if it's not that it tells
you how much life you guys love simple
enough now if we just try to do
something like this attack okay well
that's not working now the reason that
this doesn't work is because in order to
use anything inside your class you need
to access it a special way and that is
by creating something called an object
now an object just think of it like this
it's pretty much a way that you can
access the stuff inside your class and I
know I just say that twice but it's
actually really important to understand
and they're really easy to make as well
so the first thing you do is you pretty
much act like you're making a normal
variable so I'm going to make a object
called enemy one so what you said it
equal to is the class that you want to
use stuff from so I want to use the
stuff inside the enemy class so anytime
I want to use that I need this object
code enemy 1 and it's object from this
class right here so now we can just do
something called enemy one
attack and what this pretty much means
is this it says okay enemy one is an
object from what class while enemy so go
to the class enemy and once you're in
there use attack so now if we try to run
this it would say ouch because it just
took one away from the enemy and
actually if we check life to make sure
that worked whenever we run this said
okay it starts with three of course so
we're going to attack this enemy once
say ouch
then it says two life left now I want to
show you guys one other really cool
thing and this is probably the main
reason that people use classes all the
time see each object is actually a copy
of its class so each object is actually
independent of one another
so check this out don't understand what
I mean you will in just a second say
that we have enemy one instead we have
another enemy called enemy to actually
let me code this entire thing and then
I'll talk you guys through do this
alright so what's going to happen is
we're going to make two objects or two
copies from this class one of them is
going to be stored in the object enemy
one and another one is going to be
stored in the object enemy two now each
of these are pretty much thinking though
think of them like their own enemies so
each of those has three life each so
whenever you attack enemy one it doesn't
affect enemy two so let me run this and
I'll show you guys what I'm talking
about so we created two objects we
attacked and me one twice and then check
this life and it had one life left
however enemy two is still had three
life left so this is how people make
computer games
with one class which is pretty much a
template of how do you want to code the
enemy how do you want it to act and
behave and you can create as many of
them as you want just by making an
object for each one so how awesome is
that
so that is the basics of a class pretty
much not only a group of similar
functions and objects but pretty much a
template of how you want an object to
behave and act and of course you can
make as many copies of it as you want
and each of the objects are independent
of one another so if you guys don't
completely understand this or it seems
kind of like unfamiliar whenever we
start making other programs is going to
become second nature and also really
easy to understand but that is the
basics of classes and objects in Python
and also if you have any questions then
ask me on my forum but for now thank you
guys for watching don't forget subscribe
and I'll see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
