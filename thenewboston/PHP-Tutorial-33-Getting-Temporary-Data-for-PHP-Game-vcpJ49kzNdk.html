tutorial and making a game and this
story I'm going to teach you guys how to
if you successfully query your data how
to convert it from your temporary table
to your user table so the first thing
you're gonna want to do I can't talk in
type at the same time you first want to
make an if statement just so you can
tell if your data is successfully
queried or not and this is really easy
just make a if statement and put your
variable result 1 inside it and then
make your curly braces and inside here
we're gonna be writing our if statement
so let's uh do that the first thing we
want to do is count how many rows have
the passkey so how many more throws F
key and to do this just make a variable
called count or something and the
function for this that's built in as my
SQL underscore num underscore rows and
inside your parameters you have to test
where so ours is sort and result 1 and
this number count is gonna return a
number one two three four depending on
how many rows have the pass key so after
we do this we want to make another if
statement and we want this is a if pass
key is in database retrieved data that's
what this if statement is going to do
and this is even easier so to do this
make a if statement and um let's add
those I select ahead of those before I
even filling my parameters now let's put
its count if they're variable count is
exactly equal to the number one so if
there's one pass key in the dad base
which it's going to happen unless
something unless like they messed up
somehow
so if there is one instance of the
passkey in our database what do we want
to do the first thing we wanted to do is
set a variable equal to Rose and I'll
show you guys why this is necessary
later and you wanted to do my SQL
underscore fetch underscore array and
this is a built-in function that uh well
I'll tell you guys with those later I
don't want to confuse you but you want
to fetch result one the next thing you
want to do is make another variable
called we'll name this name X and we
will set this equal to the place in the
the array where it's the variable is
equal to Rose and username and as you
can see you guys can pretty much tell
what MySQL fetch array is it pretty much
goes to wherever your roses and remember
we set this equal to well how do I
explain this
it takes the row of data and turns it
all into variables so it's gonna take
that row and it's gonna take that
username and make it a variable I'm just
gonna show you guys and by the time I'm
done your guys are just kind of like oh
yeah that's what it does the next thing
we want to do is get a variable for the
email so I'm gonna make a variable
called email X and I'm gonna set this we
can just copy this from now it's really
easy email and the last thing we want to
do is make a variable called password
X
and set that equal to you guessed it
password so what this is pretty much
doing right here it's pretty much saying
all right I want to take wherever that
result was wherever they had that key
get their username email and password
and I want to set it to a name email and
password that we can use for this
program so again it pretty much just
takes the data from your temporary
database and turns them into variables
that you can use in and what we're gonna
be doing is putting it in our permanent
database but before we even do that we
want to do one more thing to a test for
spam and we want to take out the spaces
in their username so for example if they
had something called Bucky and they put
a space in a set of Roberts or they had
a password that was like my mom space
secret Space 42 we want to take out all
those spaces and this is a security
function that we do so if someone like
is gonna try to use MySQL or something
like to insert like as you can see it
from right here this is MySQL and it has
spaces in between them if we take out
all the spaces then it's going to be
incomprehensible to our computer so if
someone's trying to enter this and be a
douchebag and enter all this into their
username then we're gonna say all right
you're not going to be able to do that
because we're going to take out your
spaces right now and this is how you do
that you need to change the variable
that's let's first make a variable
called name and we're gonna take the
variable name X and take out all the
spaces in it so here's how you do that
you have to put name equals the built-in
function is STR underscore replace and
this stands for string replaced and in
your parameters the first thing you want
to do is put what you want to replace so
put
was it gonna posh freespace ' and we
want to replace it with a push for your
posh free so this takes a space and it
replaces it with nothing at all just a
collapsed emptiness and the next thing
you want to do is put what where the
string is that you want to replace in of
course this is named X not named rx so
what this is going to do is take an Amex
strip all the spaces of it and store it
in the variable name and of course we
want to do this for email equals STR
underscore place and of course just like
before posh free space a posh free we
want to replace that with apostrophe
apostrophe and we want to do this to
email X and the last thing we want to do
this for is password there we go
password and we want to replace password
X so now we want to use these variables
instead of these variables these
variables can have spaces in in there in
secured or unsecured the probably hints
occur to if they hate themselves but
anyways these variables are a lot safer
because they are MySQL free so that is
how you take the spaces out of your
variables and in the next tutorial we're
going to be taking these variables which
is the data that the user inputted and
we're going to be inputting it into
their our permanent users table so that
they can access the information and log
into the game so study this actually you
might want to just watch my next
tutorial and I'm gonna have everything
covered then so take a look at this make
sure how to you know how to take out
spaces and make sure you know what this
function does is I explained before and
once you're ready to move on I will see
you next time and make sure to go to my
website the new Boston comm if you have
any questions I'll answer them for you
there so thanks for watching now see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
