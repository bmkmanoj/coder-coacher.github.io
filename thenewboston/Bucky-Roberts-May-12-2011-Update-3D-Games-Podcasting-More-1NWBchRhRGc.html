update video as you can see or maybe you
can't tell but I'm on my brand-new
webcam right now I bought a brand new
webcam and I'll tell you why a little
bit later on I'll save that for a little
surprise but if the audio or video is a
little weird this is the first time I
use my webcam and I'm also have to use
my microphone that I used to make
tutorial so yes this is actually what I
look like when I'm making tutorials so
in case you guys you know we're
wondering here it is
but anyways sorry I haven't made an
update video in a while but I've been
super busy I know I haven't actually
made any videos in a while and that's
because last weekend I flew up for
Mother's Day I had to fly up to New York
and then when I got back I had to order
a bunch of audio and video gear for I'll
tell you why later on but anyways I have
been super busy so uh that's why I
haven't been uploading or making any
videos but anyways speaking of videos
I'll give you guys a quick update about
what's going on for the biology videos
we just uploaded for new biology videos
I put those on right before you're
watching this video so if you can see
this video right about like 30 minutes
ago I uploaded four new biology videos
we're also in the process of making a
new algebra math series but I decided
instead of just uploading those videos
as they're made I'm gonna wait until the
entire series is created that way I'm
not spamming your guys's inbox and also
as soon as you see an algebra video you
can watch the whole series if you want
to I just think it's better that way and
it helps me organize my videos a lot
better so that takes care of their
videos that they were making and now for
the videos that I'm making as a lot of
you guys know I'm making a C++ series
right now and I think I'm like 60 videos
in and I actually hope to finish this
series this weekend so I have to work
tomorrow and when I come back I gotta
take a nap
and as soon as I wake up I'm working
straight through the weekend Friday
night Saturday and Sunday I'm gonna try
to pump out
many C++ videos as I can actually you
guys are in luck because we covered all
the really confusing stuff like
inheritance and polymorphism templates
all the stuff that's kind of stress your
Brule
Lola stress your brain so from now on
it's not the easy stuff I don't want to
say it's easy but from now on I just
have to teach some concepts that are
core concepts that you need to know and
like I said they're not easy but they're
a lot easier to grasp so you definitely
don't want to miss those so I'm gonna
try to get into you guys this weekend
but it might take a couple more days I
have a few more subjects to cover
probably 40 more videos so aside from
that you guys are probably wondering are
right so after C++ everyone wants to
know what am I gonna do next what
subject am I gonna teach next and
drumroll please you guys all ready for
this I'm gonna be teaching something
called blender 3d now a lot of you guys
are probably cheering right now and a
lot of you guys probably have no idea
what blender 3d is blender is a program
that allows you to make 3d models and
like if you want to make a cool 3d logo
or if you want to make awesome movies in
3d like animations or if you want to do
something like character modeling for
games and you can do all of this in
blender and the coolest thing is
everyone can do it's a free program a
lot of really good 3d programs cost like
hundreds and hundreds of dollars but
this is one of the best programs and
it's absolutely free so anyone can
follow along with these tutorials I know
there is a huge request so I'm doing
this and the reason that I'm teaching
blender 3d is because after blender 3d
in this that series is probably gonna
take like 50 videos to complete I'm
guessing it could be way off but after
blender 3d and after we learned how to
create awesome 3d animations and models
I'm going to be teaching something
called ogre 3d now over 3d for those
guys who don't know
Oh career 3d is a graphics engine for 3d
objects and what this means is blender
allows you to make the models and the
graphics engine allows your computer to
work with the 3d models basically
basically what I'm saying is once you
learn C++ and blender and ocher 3d
you're gonna be able to make
full-fledged
3d games and if you guys are like yeah
right what kind of cool games can I make
with C++ and blender in this over that
you're gonna be teaching probably some
crappy you know Nintendo looking game
well I'm gonna post in the description
box below a game that was made using I
don't know how they modeled the
characters but you can model characters
it really doesn't matter what program
you use but it was made using C++ and
also ogre 3d so this is an idea of what
type and um you know not just crappy
games we're gonna be making it we're
gonna be making high quality awesome
amazing 3d games I'm talkin like black
ops in World of Warcraft
of course we probably can't make a game
that advanced because I mean they take
millions of dollars in thousands of
people and you know three years over
five years to complete I'm only gonna be
making teaching you the concepts but
definitely you're gonna have the skills
to create games like that so that's what
I'm gonna be doing don't forget to click
the link below and you can see an ogre
3d and a C++ game so basically you're
going to be using C++ to do all the
programming a blender to make the
character modeling and although you know
cool textures and pretty much everything
you see in ocher 3d to handle all the 3d
graphics and piece everything together
so I'm super excited about that and I
cannot wait so aside from that I told
you guys earlier that I bought a bunch
of audio gear and new video gear and
that's because of this
beginning next month I'm gonna be
beginning to podcast on a website called
Ustream now if you've never heard a
Ustream before it's called Ustream comm
with you and this is a website that
allows you to broadcast live streaming
video for example sometimes they have
sporting events on there sometimes they
have live concerts sometimes if like
anyone wants to make their own web show
like iCarly I know I watched icarly
before on Nickelodeon that's kind of
what I'm gonna be doing so that's what
Ustream is and I got a little cheat
sheet about things I'm supposed to talk
about here but also I'm gonna be
recording these videos in HD and posting
them on YouTube and whatever website I
make I don't even have a name for the
show yet but I'm gonna have a name and a
website soon and in case you miss an
episode
or you know you don't have time to watch
it each week we're gonna be posting them
live on this channel and also on the
website whatever it is so I am super
excited about it I ordered a bunch of
audio VI order mixer board HD webcams HD
camcorders a bunch of awesome
microphones I actually have to go get a
new office tomorrow I think I'm gonna
get one upstairs and I also have to hire
two new people I think I'm gonna hire a
dude in a chick or male and female so
that's what I'm gonna be doing I am
super excited I'm super excited for a
lot of stuff coming up so uh that's what
it's gonna be so basically it's gonna be
a radio style show it's gonna look a lot
like the Howard Stern Show when it's
everything's produced and pieced
together but we can't talk about you
know some of the things they talk about
actually we're basically going to talk
about whatever is on our minds this show
is really about nothing specific
basically whatever I'm feeling whatever
is on my mind whatever I want to talk
about it's gonna be fun and entertaining
and like I said nothing really specific
but it's gonna be super awesome so
lastly with that in mind I need
something from you guys this radio show
doesn't have a name
so I need a good name for you know
whatever this thing is a webcast a
podcast a radio show and online
extravaganza I don't know but I need a
good name from you guys to call the show
and also remember it's gonna be a
website too so you know you can't have
something like The Daily Show because
that's taken already
so anyways from you guys I need a really
good name for my podcast and webcast to
show whatever you want to call it and
I'm gonna look through the comments and
pick whatever one I think is you know
the coolest sounding name so with that
being said I hope you guys are excited
for at least one of the things I talked
to you guys about I know I am I'm super
excited I'm about to pee my pants so
thank you guys for watching thank you
guys so much for subscribing to my
channel and supporting and thank you
guys
especially whoever donated to my channel
you cannot believe the donations I've
been receiving lately and all of this is
possible thanks to you guys so I'm gonna
try to pump out as many high-quality
tutorials as I can this weekend looking
forward to blender and ogre and that
being said thank all of you guys for
watching and subscribing and I'll see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
