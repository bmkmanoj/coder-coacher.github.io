tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
to be showing you guys how to use a do
loop and else if else statement to make
a simple program so let's go ahead and
make a couple variables first I'm going
to be what our program is going to do is
ask you how old I am then you're going
to have to guess what my age is and
based on the input it's going to give
you a choices on what to do so let's go
ahead and make a variable for your
answer and of course if you have an
answer you need a question and my
question is how old is Bucky and I'm 21
by the way in case you are we're just
dying to learn already and you just want
to watch your video because of that so
let's go ahead and end that line and
then once we got our variable in our
question we can go ahead and start
making our if statements so the first
thing we want to do is have the user
input an answer for our variable so
whatever they input right here that's
going to be stored in the variable
answer so now that we have that let's go
ahead and make a simple if statement if
the answer that they did is greater than
21 I'm gonna have it output too high
since I am NOT over 21 yet and then we
want to end that line and then uhm in
the last tutorial I told you guys how to
use it else but if you have multiple
choices you can use something called
else if not is if and this allows you to
have multiple choices that same question
so I'm going to have if answer is less
than 21 I want you to let's just copy
this
we're copy and paste if it's less than
21 I'm going to have you input to low so
let's if you guess 13 then that's too
low but if you don't guess an answer
that's too high and you don't guess the
answer is too low I am going to have you
output on the screen let's see what can
it be
let's just have a say correct nice and
simple and line with a semicolon
now since we have a basic statement what
this is going to do right now is it's
going to allow you to run the entire
program once so say you guess an answer
that's higher than 21 it's going to say
too high and then it's going to end the
program so let's go ahead and execute
compile and run right now hopefully I
didn't mess anything up and it says how
old is Bucky now you guess 43 press
ENTER to high press any key to continue
that's the end of your program but you
want to keep guessing and guessing until
you get the right number so to do that
here's what you need to do you need to
make a simple loop called a do loop and
remember a do loop executes any bit of
code at least once before checking
whether it's true or not so you want to
do all of this code at least once and
the syntax for do loop is of course do
and once you get to while this is where
it checks if your test is correct or not
while the variable answer is not equal
to 21 and then and that so what's going
to happen is this you're going to keep
getting this test over and over again
and it's going to allow you to keep
guessing and guessing and then at the
end if you guessed 21 it's going to end
the program but as long as you didn't
guess 21 and as long as your answer is
not equal to 21
it's going to keep doing this loop over
and over so again do this loop while the
answer is not equal to 21 so let's go
ahead execute compile and run and let's
see as long as we didn't mess anything
up we should get a nice working program
how old is Bucky 55 too high 66 or 68 I
want that too high is the 11 too low how
about 21 correct and that's the end of
our program so again using a do loop and
a while loop in the simple if statement
this is how you can build a very simple
C++ program that has multiple options
and again if you want more than one
option you can use a else if statement
as many times as you want you don't have
to use this just once you can use it ten
times as you if you want so again that
is how you build a simple c-plus plus
program with multiple options study that
and learn how to use the do loop to
repeat your program over and over and I
will be posting this code on my website
the new Boston comm so if you want this
raw code you can go and get it there for
free so thank you guys for watching now
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
