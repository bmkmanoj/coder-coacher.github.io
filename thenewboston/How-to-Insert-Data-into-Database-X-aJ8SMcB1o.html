our prerequisites for our form handling
in PHP we created our database and our
my sequel syrup and our my sequel
database we have also created a user's
table inside of that database and now we
need to create a form which you can see
I've already done here I created a form
with an action of form handler PHP that
is the PHP file that we're going to send
this date to and we're going to post
that data to our PHP file now you can
see I've added an input of type text
with a name of F name which stands for
first name and I've also added a label
out to the side I'm going to put a brake
tag in between those so we can get some
space in between and I've also created a
another input type of text with the name
L name and so I'm also going to put a
break in between that and our submit
button so save that and let's go take a
look at our PHP file this should look
familiar if you've been watching the
past tutorials you see that I have this
connection right here where this is the
variable that I'm actually connecting to
our my sequel database with you can see
and I'm connecting to the New Boston
and you can also see that I've added
some conditional statements inside this
is saying if the connection doesn't work
then you're going to go ahead and kill
the mice equal I'm not on my sequel but
the PHP script and here is some very key
information right here this first name
variable with this dollar sign
underscore post and this left bracket
and quotation fname quotation right
bracket and then a semicolon and what
this is saying is you're going to grab
the data from the input box that has
been submitted to this PHP file so for
instance you can see that here we have
this name fname and whenever we click
our submit it's going to go to this PHP
file because that is the action that
we're sending it to it's going to go to
that PHP file and it's going to look for
this f name and it's going to assign it
to the variable first name and we're
going to the same thing with the L name
and so below that I've created this my
sequel select DB statement that is
telling the it is telling the PHP file
to look at the New Boston as the
database and then it's telling it to use
this connection variable which we've
created up here that's telling to look
at the local hosts and is telling it to
use the user New Boston and use their
password that they created inside of the
database so once you connect to the New
Boston database using new boston as the
user looking at the love most
then you can start to do some sequel
statements on that database and you can
actually start to read and to insert and
delete and do whatever kind of data
manipulation you need to do to your
database so for this example we're just
going to insert into our new users
whoops we're going to insert into users
and we have first name and last name you
see it's separated by commas and what
this is this is the actual field names
that we're going to be inserting into
and then after you fill this part out
you type in values after that and then
you open it up another set of
parentheses and you need to follow in
order exactly like you did right here
like first name and below that whenever
you answer values you're going to insert
first name and you can see that I've
taken this variable that we defined
right here and I have wrapped it in
single quotes make sure you put a dollar
sign before that and so what that's
saying it's saying insert into first
name whatever variable is inside of up
here once we click that submit to post
the data to our form and form handler so
insert in the first name first name and
insert into last name the variable last
name so make sure that you guys whenever
you're feeling out your whenever you're
filling out your my sequel query it's
very important to understand how that
works how you have first name and first
name and last name and last name
because if you don't keep those in order
you're going to end up putting in some
data into your database that you do not
want and I've already went over what
this result variable is doing and what
this loop is doing and so what we expect
to see now is once we submit our form
it's going to grab our variables and
then it's going to insert those
variables into our database and after it
inserts those variables it's going to
select this star or all it's going to
select all from users and then it's
going to output that inside of this loop
right here so let's run this so you guys
can finally see how to handle our forms
inside of PHP and again this is a very
simple example and you can do a lot more
with this but I know that some people
are asking how to do this and I just
went into to help you guys out and run
through a quick tutorial and show you
guys exactly how easy it is to insert
some data into a database using PHP so
what we have here is the form that we
created inside of form input HTML and if
you guys don't remember that is right
here we have our form data inside of
this form right here so let's go back to
the forms of the form input that HTML on
let's go ahead and type in a name I'm
going to type in just a simple fellow
named Jane Doe and want to submit and
you can see that I've already submitted
a few records into our database and
there you go we have
inserted Jane Doe into our PHP or into
our my sequel database so let's just do
this again just to make sure you guys
see this working lamed oh there we go so
I'm going to go ahead and go back to the
New Boston I'm going to go to a PHP my
admin click on the new ballston click on
users and now you can see that this is
where our data is sword this is a this
is it so hopefully the last four
tutorials you guys have learned
something and you guys have little light
bulbs going off in your head thinking of
all these things you want to do with
forms and how you want to store some
data and this is really just the surface
of how powerful PHP and my sequel are
together especially since they're free
it just really makes handling
server-side code and dealing with
database is a lot of fun but PHP and my
sequel I could spend probably four
months teaching you guys things about
PHP in my seal because there is just
such deep holes to fill and to
understand and to learn but you guys
have seen a few basics here and it's
these form handling tutorials and I'm
not really sure what I'm going to start
going over next but I guarantee you it's
going to be awesome so you guys stay
tuned to keep watching and make sure you
guys give me some feedback and let me
know if there's anything else that you
guys want me to teach you because that
would be more than willing to help you
guys out so thanks for watching and
don't forget to subscribe to the new
boston and i will see you guys in the
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
