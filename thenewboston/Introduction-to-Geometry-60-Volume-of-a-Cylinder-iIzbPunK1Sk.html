to find the volume of a cylinder so the
volume is equal to the base area times
the height so for a cylinder each each
base is a circle so that means that the
volume for a cylinder is the base area
which is PI R squared times the height
which is always perpendicular to both
bases and it's kind of hard to see but
if this was sitting up like a soup can
that side of the soup can is
perpendicular to both circles so PI R
squared times H so now we're going to do
some examples so we have a radius of 8
inches and a height of 9 inches so
volume is equal to PI R squared H volume
is equal to PI R radius which is 8
squared times our height which is 9 so
PI R squared is 64 x 9 and I have to
plug that into a calculator 64 x 9
equals 576 pi inches and remember we're
in volume so we're talking about three
dimensional space so it's inches cubed
now we have another example with a
radius of 3 centimeters and a height of
12 centimeters so volume equals PI R
squared H volume equals PI our radius
which is 3 squared x 12
pi three times three squared is 9 x 12
so our volume is he a hundred and eight
pi centimeters cubed ok so wait one
final example volume equals PI or
squared H so pi we have a radius of 5 so
5 squared times our height which is for
volume is equal to 5 squared which is 25
times for so volume equals a hundred pi
and remember volume is three-dimensional
so centimeters cubed so when we find the
surface area of a cylinder we find the
area of the label of a soup can and the
two lids of the soup can when we find
volume of a cylinder we find out how
much soup can be held in that soup can
so that's why when we find surface area
where in centimeters Q squared and when
we do volume where in centimeters cubed
so that's all we have for volume of a
cylinder next we're going to go into
surface area of pyramids which are
another kind of three-dimensional shape</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
