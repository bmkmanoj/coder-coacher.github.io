tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and in
this tutorial we're gonna talk about the
lab color mode and I bet a lot of you
haven't even heard of the lab color mode
and it's unique it was developed in
France and it's an old system but it has
some cool features to it that you can
use to professionally edit your photos
and especially stock photos so let's get
into this now all you need to do is grab
photo prefer being maybe like a stock
photo or something that's been edited
already and come up to image and go to
mode and just click on lab color you can
you don't have to do anything before you
change it to lab color so when you do
that go ahead and come over to your
channels and you'll see that you got
some new channels we got lab which is
everything combined together we've got
lightness which is basically a grayscale
Channel we've got a which is red to
green channel so you can see some green
in there and you can see some red and it
looks looks creepy in there and then we
got the B channel which is blue to
yellow so you can see blue down here and
then you can see yellow and as you start
adding these together we're starting to
get our lab so let's start with the
lightness let me turn all this other
stuff off real quick so we can see how
they add together so we got our
lightness and then let's add in a you
can see it's adding color then let's add
in the B you can see it added in the
final two color so we get our final
image so one of the good things about
using lab color mode is that it's good
for moving between operating systems so
if you're working on Photoshop on a Mac
and you go to like your clients house or
something like that he only has
Photoshop on a PC well you can bring you
can make the image a lab color mode
it'll preserve the colors for you and
it'll open up just fine on the other
photoshop on the PC so that's awesome
and because of the ability to separate
out gray tones into the individual
lightness channel here pretty much the
lab color mode is good for sharpening or
increasing contrast of an image without
it without changing the colors so that's
awesome a lot of times when you take or
when you edit photos for someone who's a
photographer they are very particular
about their colors because they worked
really hard to get the particular colors
within their image sometimes so if you
ever get one of those at work in the lab
color mode so let's go ahead and show
you what I mean
go to lab make sure all your channels
are on let's go to image adjustments and
let's just go to levels and make sure
that your channel here is on lightness
and just for being quick what's put on a
preset and we'll just go to increase
contrast and I found that increased
contrast 3 works the best for trying to
show what I want to show okay
so I want to show you what I mean when
you can increase the contrast of the
image without changing the colors so
let's go ahead and apply the levels
adjustment to the lightness layer so
select your lightness layer we'll go to
image adjustment in the levels and for
the sake of being quick we're just gonna
use a preset now you can you should only
be able to check lightness if you only
have the lightness channel picked and
we'll just pick up something like
increased contrast to and/or increase
contrast 1 or 3 or something like that
whatever you feel like looks the best
and then you can preview here how much
the contrast is increased I'll hit OK
and then I'll look here and see that the
contrast has been increased now let's
check it out the differences here so
there's the difference in contrast all I
did was go to my history panel and I'm
going back and forth to the two things
that I are the step that I just did so
that's how you increase the contrast and
if you try to do it when you have the
like everything selected and I go to
image adjustments levels and I go to try
to increase the contrast it's not it
doesn't work as you can see nothing's in
getting increased so I mean doesn't
really work so that's how a lab color
mode is used it's pretty good for the
main thing that is I would the two main
things I would say just to remember
about lab color mode is that it's good
for sharpening the lightness channel or
making contrast on the lightness channel
and then also moving from PC to Mac or
Mac to PC within Photoshop or other
programs as well it doesn't just have to
be a Photoshop so thanks for watching
this tutorial hopefully guys learned a
lot and I'll see the next one have a
good day everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
