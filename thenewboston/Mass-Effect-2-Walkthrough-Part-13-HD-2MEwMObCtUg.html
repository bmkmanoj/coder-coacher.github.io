Shepherd
I thought you were dead what are you
doing here good to see you too I'm just
surprised to see you and me both still
it's good to see a friendly face killing
works as hard work especially on my own
well we got here but I don't think it
now will be as easy no it won't that
bridge is saved my life funneling all
those witless idiots in the scope but it
works both ways they'll slaughter us if
we try to get out that way so we just
sit here and wait for them to take us
out it's not all that bad this place has
held them off so far and three of you I
suggest we hold this location wait for a
crack in their defenses take our chances
it's not a perfect plan but it's a plan
I didn't like sneaking anyway time to
spill a little mert blood glad to see
you haven't changed let's see what
they're up to
hmm looks like they know their
infiltration team fails take a look
scams Eclipse I think more than scouts
one less now indeed we better get ready
I'll stay up here I can do a lot of
damage from this vantage point you you
can do what you do best just like old
times Shepherd let's give these bastards
everything
there we go heads up for the coins night
tempur answer
it's not that
99
never saw me coming
shooting dead drop yes
ah
there we go
I love scratch one drop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
