and in this video what I want to do is
now that you understand the nitty-gritty
details of the Krebs cycle
I want to go in the other direction and
give you guys a very broad simple
summary of the entire kreb cycle how
each step is pieced together and
hopefully what this will do is it'll
clear up any confusion that you have on
the little pieces and it will also help
you visualize exactly what's going on so
remember that by the end of the Krebs
cycle we ended up with two ATP's eight
and a DHS and also two fadh2s
now if you guys are like alright I just
watched all those videos and I'm getting
different values than you well remember
that I demonstrated one molecule how it
went through the Krebs cycle but
remember glucose splits up in glycolysis
to two molecules so times everything by
two and you guys should get the same
numbers as me so remember we started
with pyruvate which was a three carbon
molecule and on the way to the
mitochondria it actually formed an N a d
H so let me go ahead and write all of
these in purple actually I'll go ahead
and this will be my symbol for NADH so
on the way to the mitochondria if for an
an NADH and also the next thing is it
lost the co2 and it combined with
coenzyme a so see Oh a and whenever this
happened it was no longer called
pyruvate it was called acetyl co a so
this was the molecule that we said that
was allowed to enter the Krebs cycle so
this is the beginning of the Krebs cycle
step number one now the very first thing
that happened to acetyl co a is it
combined with that four carbon molecule
because remember this acetyl CoA is only
a two carbon molecule and it combined
with that four carbon molecule and it
became I'll just go ahead and write
citric acid
so now at the end of step one we had a
citric acid so then in step number two
might as well write each step a
different color they'll probably be a
little bit easier to visualize what
happened is this was the easier step the
molecules just rearranged a little bit
and we formed an isomer called ISO
citrate so that was all step to us
molecules changing around moving around
a little bit
now after step number two what happened
is I forgot my rule new color step
number three it released the co2 so
we've lost a carbon and actually formed
and I guess I'll make an a D H with my
little cloud around it by the way this
isn't like the standard symbol for NADH
I just thought it would be cool I don't
know this is actually what I thought
would be cool how boring is my life if
drunk clouds around NADH is cool anyways
step number four moving on I don't need
to talk about my emotional problems here
it actually really says another co2
molecule and forms another and ADH yes I
get to draw another NADH and ADH
hopefully I'm not going off the screen
here I'll move up so after that we move
on to step number five and in step
number five remember this is a step that
it formed the GTP GTP and just remember
right now that probably shouldn't draw
another arrow GTP is a molecule that can
be used to make a teepee so that's where
I'm getting my ATP from right here and
even though this is the only one
remember for all of these molecules
since this entire molecule pyruvate is
actually two molecules that's why I'm
getting this number two ATP's and I'm
gonna be multiplying everything by two
so this is the only ATP that's formed in
the Krebs cycle
however since two molecules we get from
glucose we get two ATP's in total so now
moving on
the sixth step remember in the six step
or you know maybe you don't remember is
that two hydrogen atoms were donated and
they pretty much stuck on 2f ad and
whenever they stuck on the F ad you got
fadh2 so step number six is where we got
fadh2 so that is where we get these two
fadh2
right there so now again remember to
fadh2 Allah cubes because this is one
and we're multiplying it by two okay so
you guys could probably do that math I
don't know why I said that but basically
the seventh step was another easy one a
water molecule was added forming malate
saw just but h2o was added and now we
have malate that for him and then step
number eight which was of course the
last step step number eight NADH was
formed and crap forgot sorry new color
and a the H was formed around my little
cloud and if you guys are counting my
clouds this was one two three four this
was your fourth NADH and of course
multiply that by two gives you your
eight na DHS and ol color was every
writing in white and basically this
malate turns into I'm gonna have to
write this freaking word
mallet turns into oxaloacetate and
basically this was molecule right here
that combined with acetyl co a to form
citric acid and then again it just
repeats and repeats and repeats until
you die literally I know that sounds
kind of messed up but that's what
happens literally so once the cycle is
complete this oxaloacetate combines with
another acetyl co a and it does the
whole thing again again again again I'm
just gonna keep saying that for like the
next three minutes again again again
again so basically now that you guys
understand the nitty-gritty details of
the krebs cycle and you have this broad
overview of how everything is pieced
together and again remember in the first
tutorial that I said that this right
here was kind of the preparation stage
but this is actually the Krebs cycle
steps one through eight so if you want
to say that this was part of the cycle
you can if not you know you don't have
to it's kind of the intermediate stage
between psychosis in the Krebs cycle but
anyways what what do you want to call it
I don't know just follow your heart but
I hope you guys understand the crypts
like well if you have any questions just
go ahead and ask me on my forum the link
is below thank you guys for watching
think guys for supporting my videos and
I'll see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
