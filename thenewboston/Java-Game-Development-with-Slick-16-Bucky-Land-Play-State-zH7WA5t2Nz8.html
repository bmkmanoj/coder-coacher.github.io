and now that we took care of all the
boring stuff the main menu and
downloading images and setting up all
the classes we can finally go ahead and
hop into the place state now the play
classes we're going to be doing most of
the coding and it's actually where the
user is gonna be spending most of their
time walking around the world
so let's just go ahead and I'll shut up
and start coding so the first thing that
we need to do is we need to set up a
couple animations now go ahead and type
that so I don't mess that up
now there are gonna be five well kind of
four different animations four or five
depending on how you look at it an
animation is basically gonna be Bucky
walking as of now all of the things on
the map such as the trees and the
buildings those stay in one place so the
only thing that's gonna be moving is
Bucky however we don't just have one
animation for Bucky it's actually four
different animations moving up or
walking up walking down walking to the
left and walking to the right so these
four different animations Bucky is gonna
be set to one of these depending on
which way he's moving so the first thing
I want to do is I want to make an
animation called Bucky just because this
is pretty much the default Bucky this
animation is going to be set to one of
the other animations basically depending
on what direction is moving so the
second animation is moving up which is
the animation that's going to play
whenever he's walking up and moving down
moving left moving right and I know that
you guys don't know how to create an
animation yet but I'll explain that
whenever we get to it for now just
remember that there gonna be four
different animations for moving up down
left and right and Bucky dapeng on which
way he's moving is gonna be animated to
look like he's walking in one of these
ways so the next thing I need to do is I
need to set up or pretty much load the
main map so image and I called this
world map basically all the land the
building the trees that's what this
image is right
now so after this I'm just gonna go
ahead and make Abu lien
call it quit and set this equal to false
by default now what this variable is
going to do is whenever the user is
playing the game we're gonna give them
the option to quit the game just like we
gave them an option to exit the game on
the main menu so we're gonna be giving
them an option to quit the game
whenever they're playing it and whenever
we do that of course this variable is
going to be set equal to true but we'll
see that more later on so after this
what I want to do is I want to make an
int array and I want to call this
duration now the reason that I want to
do this is because whenever you have an
animation you need to tell the animation
how long do you want the animation to
last for well in order to do that you
actually pass in an array of numbers so
let me just go ahead and code this first
and I'll explain it 200 200 I guess I
might as well give you guys a real quick
explanation of how animations work in
slick 2d as you know just like movies or
flipbook and animation is made up of a
series of images so once you play image
after image after image each image is
slightly different however once you play
them in a row it kind of looks like one
big movement or one big animation so in
select 2d each of these images is called
a frame and the duration of how long you
want each image to last is specified in
this array right here so basically what
we're saying is okay
whenever Bucky moves up is going to
consist of two different images the
first image is gonna last for two
hundred or two tenths of a second and
the second one is going to last for two
tenths of a second so this entire
animation of moving up is gonna happen
in less than half a second so basically
just remember that in order to create an
animation and slick 2d as you guys we'll
see you later on whenever I show you
guys the code but you need a series of
images and you need to tell it how long
you want each image to last and when you
put all the images together it's going
to look like something is being animated
so with that long-winded example let's
go ahead and code some more simple
variables float Bucky position X set
this equal to zero and of course what
this variable is going to do is keep
track of Bucky's position in the game
and if I copy this and add another one
but call this Bucky position Y this is
gonna keep track of well it's pretty
self-explanatory his x coordinates and
his y coordinates so by default
zero zero Bucky is going to be at the
starting location zero zero now what I
wanted to do now is put float shift onto
X first x equals Bucky position plus 360
and let me go ahead and code these
tutorials I mean excuse me code the
freaking tutorial code these lines first
and then I'll explain you guys what I'm
doing why and why alright so basically
what we're doing right here is we're
setting up a variable to shift something
360 and also this should be 160 and this
should actually be 320 because the game
the entire game let me go ahead and run
this real quick this entire window right
here is 640 pixels wide by 320 pixels
tall so in order to have Bucky in the
middle of the map what you need to do is
you need to get the coordinates for half
of those so when you shift it 320 over
and 160 what that's going to do is it's
going to give us the coordinates 320
over and 160 down right in the middle so
basically what's gonna happen is
whenever you move Bucky he isn't gonna
he isn't gonna go like this he isn't
gonna walk over and you know go off the
screen and start walking into you're no
freaking desktop icons what he's gonna
do is he's gonna walk but the map itself
is gonna move so Bucky is always going
to be in the middle of the screen and
the map underneath it is going to be
moving which is going to give the
appearance that Bucky is actually
walking around the world and
him to have a map that's bigger than
your game itself so it's a pretty cool
technique and once you guys see it
actually in action it's gonna actually
be really cool so now we basically have
all of the variables set up we have all
the animation variables we're about to
load our image itself of the map into
the game and we keep track of Bucky's
position and this is just for Bucky
being centered in the middle of the
screen so now that that is all setup
we're ready to move on to the good stuff
so for now thank you guys for watching
and I'll see in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
