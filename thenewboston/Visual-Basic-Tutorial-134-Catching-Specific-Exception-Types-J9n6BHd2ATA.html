slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
learning more about try-catch statement
now when you use the try-catch statement
you try the code and then if there an
error happens this catches that error
and then you can do whatever you want if
an error happens now you can also catch
the exceptions themselves and so the
output of that so what I mean by this is
let's go ahead and catch and then we're
going to use a name for our exception
you can name this whatever you want I'm
just going to call it E and you can see
here that it gives us a little help here
it's got catch exception as and an
exception type and then there's the wind
keyword which we will be learning about
later on so we'll just call our
exception e^x as and we'll just do a
simple exception so any kind of
exception is going to fall under
exception so let's go ahead and show an
error has occurred and what we'll do is
we'll add a new line so environment
dot new line and now what we're going to
do is we're going to show that error so
we'll just access our error object which
is e^x so if that error is caught it's
created and we can show e^x
dot to string so let's go ahead and run
this we will go ahead and click add all
and you can see it says an error has
occurred and it says system index out of
round out of range exception index was
outside the bounds of the array at try
catch form one button add click so this
shows us the project this shows us the
class this shows us the method in our
case the in our case the button click
event and it shows us the location of
the where the program is run and it
shows us the line number that the error
is on now this is very useful when
you're debugging your program and if you
release a program
you can have this in here and it will
you can tell them to let's say email
exceptions to them so that they can fix
it in so that you can fix it in updates
so let's go ahead and close out of this
now we can also catch certain exception
types so we will catch an index out of
range exception which is the type of
exception that this try block throws for
us so throwing an exception is basically
the what you would call an exception
happening now you can also throw your
own exceptions by using the throw
keyword but we're going to learn about
that later on so we're going to be
catching an index out of range exception
let's go ahead and run this we click add
all and you can see that it gives us the
same output here now let's go ahead and
catch a different kind of exception here
so let's go ahead and catch and you can
see there's a whole bunch of exceptions
that we can use so let's do in
Valentine's timezone exception so if we
go ahead and run this click at all you
can see that it crashes now the reason
it crashes is because this catch
statement is only going to catch invalid
time zone exceptions it's not going to
catch any other type so that is one
reason to use just exception as a
default type once we'll catch any type
of exception now you can also have
multiple catch statements so we can
catch an index out of range exception
and we can come down here below this
right here and we can also catch other
types of exceptions so catch e^x as
let's just say application exception
even though this will not run so message
box and we will just say an error has
occurred
in the application so now you'll know
the difference between each one of these
so what it's going to do is if this
happens it's going to go ahead and run
this code and if we get an application
exception it's going to go ahead and run
this code so this is very useful if you
want to see what happens and then you
want to tell them a way to fix it so if
the index is out of range you can have a
message box it tells them how to fix
that problem or if there's an
application exception you can tell them
how to fix that problem there so let's
go ahead and run this go ahead and click
add all and you can see it catches the
index out of range exception we'll go
ahead and click OK and we'll close out
of that so go ahead and practice this
some you can add multiple catch
statements now if you catch an exception
just a normal exception of a default and
then capture another exception it's
going to run that code twice because
exception is there for anything and then
let's say you have the index out of
range exception after that whatever code
is in between each of them is going to
run so for example if I type exception
right here and then application
exception you can see that we get a
warning and it says onions local
variable e^x
which that doesn't matter but it says
caps block never reached because system
not application exception inherits from
system dot exception so what that's
saying is that this will run and then it
will never get to this because this
inherits from that and this is going to
cover everything so we'll just go ahead
and take this out right here so practice
with some try-catch statements use
multiple catches you can find out what
types of exceptions they are by using
the exe to string and you can add a
catch statement for that so in our case
it was an index out of range so once
you're comfortable with using that go
ahead and move on to the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
