slash on live gamer for the New Boston
in this tutorial and in the next
upcoming tutorials we're going to be
creating a calculator so let's go ahead
and get started by making a new project
we'll select windows forms application
and we will just call it calculator and
we'll wait for that to load now let's go
ahead and add some stuff to our form so
we'll open up our toolbox we will add
three text boxes and for the third text
box we are going to set read-only equal
to true so read-only is now equal to
true and we'll go ahead and set the
names for these so the first one is
going to be text num1 the second one is
going to be text num2 and the third one
is going to be text numb three or text
answer now let's go ahead and add some
buttons here so we'll just add them
below and we will make this a little bit
bigger okay so here's our add button
will add a subtract will add a power
what else can we have we'll add multiply
will add division and we'll just add PI
so now that we've got some buttons and
some text boxes let's go ahead and
rearrange these and make it look a
little bit nicer
so we'll strength these down and you can
see here that lines show up whenever we
want to shrink them down and this is
what Visual Basic does to help you make
your forms and controls look a little
bit nicer so let's go ahead and set the
name of this one to button add we'll hit
enter with we will have button
subtract button divide button multiply
instead of power for this one let's just
do button modulus and for this one we
will do button pie so now let's go ahead
and set the text value for each of these
so the first one is just going to be ad
this one will be subtract and this one
will be divide multiply modulus and pie
so now let's add some labels so the user
knows what these boxes are for so we
will just select all of these and drag
them down some will drag this down and
this down with it will open up our tool
box we'll add a label and we'll have
this label say first number we'll copy
this and paste it and we'll set the
second one to second number
and we'll set the third one to answer
so we'll just ctrl-c and ctrl-v to paste
it
so for this one we'll just type answer
okay so now I'll just create click
events for each one of these now if you
don't want to double click on each one
of the buttons you can go ahead and
select the button and click the
lightning bolt and find the click of it
and double click on that so now that
you've got your forum initialized and
you know what it looks like you can you
don't have to make it look exactly like
mine but um go ahead and once you've
made that move on to the next tutorial
and will start putting in the code for
this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
