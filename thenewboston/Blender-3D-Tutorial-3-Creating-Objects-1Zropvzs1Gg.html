third blender tutorial now in this
tutorial we're going to be creating
objects but uh before we get started I
gotta ask you guys something because I
got to find out if I'm the only one who
feels this way and if I'm just crazy or
if this is the way it actually is but
does it seem like every single person
who eats sushi they have one common goal
and that's to get other people to eat
sushi it only happens with sushi and
nothing else because I don't eat sushi
but anytime
um someone asked me if I eat sushi or
not and I say no they're like oh you got
to eat it you just got to eat sushi and
then if I'm like uh well I mean I tried
it once and I didn't like it but he got
tried again he's got it he's got each
sushi you didn't eat it right or I got
taken to a new place so uh yeah so you
know take it easy crazy sushi eaters I
don't want to eat sushi so for the next
10 people who asked me you know I'm not
eating it so but anyways uh you guys
ain't come here about my sushi stories
or at least not most yeah you guys came
to learn blender so let's do that so
make sure you open blender and hold down
control press X and push erase all and
this will say back to defaults no matter
where you are pretty much started new
and now the first thing we're going to
do is learn how to slug so we can go
ahead and select this camera this little
thing over here is the camera by right
mouse button clicking it just like that
and another cool thing before I continue
if you just hate selecting things with
your right mouse button because it's
common to select them with your left
mouse button we can do it with scroll
down here and scroll down a little bit
more and you can select with the left
mouse button right here and this will
give you the common left mouse elect and
then you're just going to have to follow
along in that kind of way but since I'm
teaching everyone um you know the mass
general public I figured I would just
keep all the defaults but anyways if you
feel like changing it's up there and
anyways like I was saying
select this camera go ahead and right
mouse button select it and that will
select it it will turn pink
now just like other common programs you
can select multiple things by holding
down the shift key on your keyboard and
selecting this and selecting this which
is the light so again holding down shift
on your keyboard lets you select
multiple things at once in another
hockey for selecting everything is the a
button on your keyboard so go ahead and
press a toggle it on and off and as you
can see everything is deselected or
selected so what a stands for and
blender is all and that allows you with
one button to select all of everything
or deselect everything so the first
thing we're going to want to do is we
want to get rid of this cube so go ahead
and right mouse button only your cube
make sure you have nothing else selected
and you can either hit X or delete on
your keyboard and when you do you're
going to have to go through this okay
and when you put a left mouse button on
answer a question it deletes your cube
so again if you hit X or delete with
anything selected in blender it'll
delete it I usually use delete because I
mean they didn't make a delete button
button for nothing so the next thing we
probably notice is this little crosshair
thing right here that happens when we
left mouse button click and what this
little crosshair is is called the 3d
cursor now what this is is wherever you
click this 3d cursor that's where a new
item is going to appear when you create
it in 3d space so if you want to move
this around to create an item a new
location left mouse button click that
location so I'm going to be creating one
right in the middle so I'm going to left
mouse button click right in the middle
so to create an item we finally get to
create one here's what we do go ahead
and press space on your keyboard and
click add mesh ecosphere or I think
that's how I say then go ahead and click
that and then we can just go ahead and
click OK by the defaults and now we have
a sphere created right in the middle
so say we want to create another object
what we have to do is click away click
that 3d cursor somewhere else actually
as click it to the left
press space add mesh and we'll add a
cone this time and go ahead and click OK
and we're looking at it from the top so
that's why it looks weird right now but
again any time um you like creating
objects and you can you can't see that
you created a new one chances are your
cursor is probably set on top of your
other one so well just take note of that
if you copy a bunch of items on top of
each other that's what's probably
happening but anyways moving on let's
move on with some simple transformations
or how to move these babies around
the first thing we're going to want to
do is select our ecosphere or I'm just
going to call it ball or something and
the first thing we're probably going to
want to learn how to do is to rotate
these things so with the item selected
go ahead and press R on your keyboard
and what you can see is you have this
little line that comes out of the sphere
and it starts rotating it well when you
rotate this we can do is drag you don't
have to click anything but R and if you
clicked with the left mouse button it'll
set it if you click with the right mouse
button it'll reset it to the default so
if we're saying R I'm going to press R
on my keyboard and um do I actually I
changed my mind I don't want to set it
anytime you want to reset it just click
right any time you want to set it just
go ahead and click your left mouse
button and it'll set and there are a
couple other things that you can do um s
if you have items selected and you press
s what this does is scale it to make it
bigger or smaller and again to set it
just go ahead and press your left mouse
button and look at that it sets it into
place gives a new scale or the last
thing I'm going to teach you for this
tutorial is how to grab it and move it
around to grab it go ahead and press G
and now you can do the same you can just
move it around and set it somewhere new
like looks prettier right there but
another thing I want to teach you with
grab
go ahead and press G and now you can
move it around freely but sometimes you
only want to constrain it to certain
accesses since this red axis that goes
left and right is the X and the one that
goes up and down is the Y so if you only
want to be a lot of movement along the x
axis go ahead and tap X on your keyboard
and now look at this we can only move it
left or right and again that works for Y
and also Z so go ahead and press a left
mouse button to you know set that into
place and you know we're getting pretty
late in this tutorial and I got some
sushi to eat just kidding I'm not going
to eat it
I mean seriously stop getting me to eat
sushi it's not going to happen but
anyways that's that for this tutorial in
the next tutorial we'll be learning some
other cool stuff we can do these objects
now that we finally learn how to create
them so thank you guys for watching make
sure all you people who don't eat sushi
watch my next tutorial and all you
people who do eat sushi I'm sure you
have a sushi cult meeting where you have
to get other people to eat sushi or
something like that so thank you guys
for watching don't forget subscribe and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
