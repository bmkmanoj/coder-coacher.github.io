quick little video just wanted to make a
quick video giving you guys a update
about a couple things
the first thing is you guys probably
notice I'm not in my room anymore so if
you guys are missing that beachbum
poster in the background I apologize but
I'll find something cool to put back
there later on but I actually had to
rent a couple offices in the city next
to me next to where I live because I was
getting too much equipment in too many
computers in my room my room was like 10
foot by 10 foot and I like five
computers in there so I finally decided
that it was time to move out from there
and get some more space so anyways at
least a couple offices and carry which
is the town next to me and I put all my
equipment here now another reason that I
needed to move out of my room is because
there's going to be some big changes to
the new Boston coming up not even for
the next month but for the future the
biggest change is that not only are we
going to continue teaching computer
programming tutorials but we're going to
expand to other subjects as well and
this pretty much is every subject that
you can think of I'm talking math
biology physics chemistry we're going to
begin teaching all the subjects under
the Sun so what this means for all you
computer programmers is nothing bad
because I myself in continue i'm going
to continue to teach computer
programming and you know like adobe
products and all that i'm going to
pretty much be covering all computer
science aspects so um if you're saying
alright you're going to start teaching
that that means you're not going to
teach a computer program and anymore no
that's not what it means i'm going to be
pumping out a ton of computer tutorials
so you guys don't worry now that leaves
who's going to be teaching all that math
and biology and chemistry physics and
stuff like that well actually I got
another office right over here I'll show
it to you guys later but I'm going to
hire people to tutor in all those
subjects I just talked about mostly math
sciences all that good stuff so it's not
only going to be me making tutorials
anymore it's going to be a team
people in the New Boston so another
thing aside from that is I used to make
tutorials probably two hours a week or
you know maybe less than that maybe a
little more but I'm going to use make a
couple tutorials a week and that's all
going to change see I have a full-time
job in I work from 7:00 until 3:30 and
that covers my bills and health
insurance and everything like that but
from pretty much like four until when I
go to bed at night and also on the
weekends what am I going to be doing now
instead of you know going home and
playing ps3 I'm going to be coming here
and I'm going to be making tutorials so
I'm pretty much gonna have two full time
jobs I'm going to dedicate all of my
free time to helping them with Soros and
also pumping out more computer program
tutorials myself so that's another thing
that benefits you guys a lot more
tutorials a lot better quality so the
last thing I wanted to mention is not
only are you going to get more tutorials
in different subjects but I invested it
in more computers faster computers the
best software so the quality of these
tutorials is going to be amazing and not
only that but there's going to be no
more you know doing a couple videos on
this and cutting off the series halfway
through whenever I start a series now
I'm going to finish it all the way to
the end so pretty much like my C and my
JavaScript tutorials I'm even made 10 or
20 and just cut it off halfway no more
that I listen to you guys and this is
what you guys want you guys want full
in-depth tutorials covering the whole
subject not just you know the first
couple chapters so that's what I'm going
to do for you guys whenever I start a
series I'm going to finish it all the
way to the end in the last thing and
again of course this isn't anything new
but I just want to reiterate the fact
that all my tutorials are continuing to
be free no charge for anything I'm not
selling any DVDs I'm not asking for a
subscription fee I'm not going to give
you like some websites give you the
first three lessons for free and then
make you charge for all the good stuff
everything I give you guys is going to
be free oh my tutorials all of their
tutorials everything is free I'm never
asking you guys for one penny so um
those are some changes that are going on
with the new boss and I can't wait to
start hiring people in pumping out
tutorials I'm actually going to start
tutorials tomorrow so uh you guys who
are creating the tutorials I know I've
been gone for a while but there you go
so anyways um that's all I have to say
um stick around and I'll give you a tour
of my office so yep alright so as you
guys saw already here is my garbage not
bed and here's the tripod where that
camera is set up I'm holding it now
and here's all the crap I had to buy a
couple new computers this desk that took
me about seven hours to put together all
this stuff I'm actually on the second
floor right here got a nice American
flag in the background a little
different than the beach bums poster but
you know we'll deal with that um all
these chairs I hope you guys like my set
up right here I'm the most fire hazard a
wire just laying on the ground so yeah
it's only a matter of time before I burn
this baby down so anyways that's my
office right here that's where I'm going
to be making all my tutorials and here
is the office I got for my employees let
me open this let me stand back give you
guys a little better view here is a Mac
that I got Mac station in here is the PC
station right here so I'm probably going
to have to hire two people full-time and
also a couple people part-time maybe to
help me on the weekends or after school
or whatever here's just a plain old
closet and I was actually going to get a
bookcase to get right there but they
shipped it to my house and it's like
eight foot tall and I don't know how to
get in my car so if you guys can just
picture a bookcase right there then I
yeah that's what's going to go there so
anyways here is uh their computers their
stations and here is mine and this is
the beginning of the education
revolution so this
or all is going to start so maybe in a
couple years I'll have my own ten story
building but for now this is all we got
guys so I hope you enjoyed that little
quick tour of my office and thank you
guys for watching thank you guys for
subscribing and I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
