another adult After Effects cs6 tutorial
for the new basta and my name is buddy
Blackbird today we're going to be
talking about scale and I saw in the
comments on some of the other videos you
guys are wondering where Bucky is you're
wondering if he's alive well I can
assure you that he is we just took a
picture the other day I pulled up so you
guys can see and we were just having a
cookout grilling steaks grilling chicken
and I just decided to take this picture
of us that's me in the front and that's
Bucky over here and this face right here
pure enjoyment Wow he's so happy well
now that you guys know he's alive we can
rest easy and start getting on with our
next tutorial so let me show you guys
how to do a couple tricks of scaling and
first off the an easy way to scale is by
these handles right here just like in
almost any program you can use these
handles to scale and usually you want to
take one of the corners because you can
always you can go any way with a corner
if you hold shift after you've already
dragged it'll stay proportionate most of
the time you don't want to squish most
of the time you don't want to squish
things so try to stay proportionate for
most of the things that a client doesn't
usually like it when you
disproportionately scale their logo or
something that they created so another
way to scale is in the transformation
menus down here so you press s on the
keyboard to get to the scale menu we can
type in different values
and it will scale according to the
percentage that you put in same with you
can click-and-drag same with the opacity
position you can click and drag and if
you hold shift it'll go fast both of the
x and y scales are currently linked so
when you move one it moves with another
now the way you can get it to not do
that is clicking on this little chain
right here that breaks the link and now
you can scale each coordinate
individually a trick that I learned with
a scaling is that you can invert or flip
your image so if you want to flip over
the y axis come over here onto the X and
hit negative 100 and I'll flip it the
other way then you can go ahead and link
it again and now you can scale them
facing this way now if you would like to
flip that back you just change that back
to regular 100 and then you can so you
can see
now if you click on your layer and have
it selected and you hold ctrl alt and
you press F click on it Patrol F it will
fit the image to the comp so I can undo
it it says undo fit to comp so that is
what that is called when you hold ctrl
alt and press F and the Mac command
instead of control pretty much anytime I
say control I'm using the Windows
version and that's almost the only thing
that's different between a Mac and a
Windows is instead of pressing ctrl
you're going to press command so if you
have a Windows I mean if you have a Mac
computer when I say control just think
of the command button</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
