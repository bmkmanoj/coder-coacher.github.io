tutorial and in these upcoming tutorials
I'm gonna be teaching you guys how to
animate something aside from just
movement so let me go ahead and I'm
gonna be teaching you guys how to
animate a material in other words when
you're playing the game make a material
on a static mesh change color so let's
go ahead and build a real simple
material I'm gonna go ahead and open my
content browser and remember way back
when I made this package called Bucky's
awesome package I'm just gonna go ahead
and build a material in here by creating
new material and I'm just gonna name
this material um
barbecue I guess I don't know why the
first thing that popped in my head I
guess I might be hungry or something and
now I can guess I can go ahead and
expand this I'm gonna go ahead and just
add a simple color to this I'm gonna
make it the most basic material that I
possibly can so I'm gonna go ahead and
right click and under parameters I'm
just gonna go ahead and select if I can
find it
new vector parameter so I'm gonna go
ahead and plug this into diffuse which
is the overall color of a material and
in my parameter I'm just gonna give it a
read of one so basically I just have a
red material again a parameter is like a
list that has our G be in a value mine's
1 which means all red no green no blue
and 1 alpha that pretty much means you
can't see through it at all so again a
very basic material using a parameter
list and again what we're gonna be doing
eventually is in matinee we're gonna be
editing these parameters of this list so
if we you know change one to zero and we
turn green from zero to one then this
material is going to turn from red to
green so that's what we're gonna be
basically doing but check it out
whenever you build a material you don't
just have a one parameter list you
usually have you know ten or twenty
different parameter lists so we need to
give this parameter list a name so we
can identify it later on and since we're
gonna be applying this material to the
door we're just going to put like a door
or which for like doors main color so
now this parameter has a name so
whenever we write all right we're in
matinee right now and we want to modify
doors main color it knows that we want
to modify this parameter list right here
so let me go ahead and just save that
right now and again all we did right
there is we made a really basic material
however check this out in the UDK
whenever you're playing your game they
set it up where you can't modify your
materials directly because it's just too
much on memory and it's too much on your
processor so what they did is they
created something called a material
instance now these material instances
were kind of like versions of the same
material
however they were meant to be modified
during game time so in order to turn
this material into our material instance
in other words a material that we can
edit in matinee go ahead and right-click
it and hit create new material instance
constant and now go ahead and
right-click this in by default you have
the name of the name of your material
with an instant again go ahead click OK
and it looks good
so now we have our main material in our
material instance constant now again
like I said this is basically just a
version of your material it's the exact
same thing except that this material
instance constant we can modify in
matinee and you know kismet where every
one modify it so in order to apply this
material instant constant to the static
mesh go ahead and just drag and plop it
right on there and now you can see our
static mesh is red just like our
material pretty cool huh
so before I forget let me just go ahead
and save this package and also I'm gonna
right-click it and make sure it's fully
loaded just like me and I think
everything looks good go right now so
that's all I want to teach you guys in
this tutorial again the things I want to
go over is this whenever you make a
material go ahead in
a mere parameter because whenever we're
editing it in matinee it needs to know
what parameter we want to edit and since
we're gonna be wanting to change the
overall color we name this parameter
Doris main color and again any time you
want to change a material during game
time you need to make a material
instance constant because materials were
made kind of for static meshes materials
that aren't going to be changing
material instant constants were made for
materials that are going to be changing
in matinee and stuff like that so in
order to do that go ahead and
right-click your material and hit new
material instance constant and apply it
to your static mesh so now that you got
that figured out you're ready to move on
to the next part of this tutorial which
I'm going to be making in the next video
but for now thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe and I'll see you
guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
