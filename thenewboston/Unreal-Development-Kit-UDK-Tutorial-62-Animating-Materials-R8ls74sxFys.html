tutorial and in these upcoming tutorials
I'm going to be teaching you guys how to
animate something aside from just
movement so let me go ahead and I'm
going to be teaching you guys how to
animate a material in other words when
you're playing the game make a material
on a static mesh change color so let's
go ahead and build a real simple
material i'm going to go ahead and open
my content browser and remember way back
when I made this package called Bucky's
awesome package I'm just going to go
ahead and build a material in here by
creating new material and i'm just going
to name this material on barbecue i
guess i don't know why first thing that
popped in my head guess i might be
hungry or something and now i can guess
i can go ahead and expand this i'm going
to go ahead and just add a simple color
to this i'm going to make it the most
basic material that I possibly can so
I'm going to go ahead and right-click
and under parameters I'm just going to
go ahead and select if I can find it new
vector parameter so I'm going to go
ahead and plug this into the fuse which
is the overall color of a material and
in my parameter I'm just going to give
it a read of one so basically I just
have a red material again a parameter is
like a list that has our G be in a value
mines one which means all red no green
no blue and one alpha that pretty much
means you can't see through it at all so
again a very basic material using a
parameter list and again what we're
going to be doing eventually is in
matinee we're going to be editing these
parameters of this list so if we you
know change 120 and we turn green from 0
to 1 then this material is going to turn
from red to green so that's where we're
going to be basically doing but check it
out whenever you build a material you
don't just have one parameter list you
usually have you know 10 or 20 different
parameter list so we need to give this
parameter list a name so we can identify
it later on and since we're going to be
applying this material to the door we're
just going to put like door
or which for like doors main color so
now this parameter has a name so
whenever we write all right we're in
matinee right now and we want to modify
doors main color it knows that we want
to modify this parameter list right here
so let me go ahead and just save that
right now and again all we did right
there is we made a really basic material
however check this out in the UDK
whenever you're playing your game they
set it up where you can't modify your
materials directly because it's just too
much on memory and it's too much on your
processor so what they did is they
created something called a material
instance now these material instances
were kind of like versions of the same
material however they were meant to be
modified during game time so in order to
turn this material into our material
instance in other words a material that
we can edit in matinee go ahead and
right click it and hit create new
material instance constant and now go
ahead and right-click this in by default
you have the name of the name of your
material with an instant again go ahead
click OK and it looks good so now we
have our main material in our material
instance constant now again like I said
this is basically just a version of your
material it's the exact same thing
except that this material instance
constant we can modify in matinee and
you know kismet wherever you want to
modify it so in order to apply this
material instant constant to the static
mesh go ahead and just drag and plop it
right on there and now you can see our
static mesh is red just like our
material pretty cool huh so before I
forget let me just go ahead and save
this package and also i'm going to right
click it and make sure it's fully loaded
just like me and i think everything
looks good go right now so that's all i
want to teach you guys in this story
again the things i want to go over is
this whenever you make a material go
ahead in
aim your parameter because whenever
we're editing it in matinee it needs to
know what parameter we want to edit and
since we're going to be wanting to
change the overall color we name this
parameter doris main color and again any
time you want to change a material
during game time you need to make a
material instance constant because
materials were made kind of for static
meshes materials that aren't going to be
changing material instant constants were
made for materials that are going to be
changing in matinee and stuff like that
so in order to do that go ahead and
right-click your material and hit new
material instance constant and apply it
to your static mesh so now that you got
that figured out you're ready to move on
to the next part of the story which I'm
going to be making in the next video but
for now thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe and I'll see you
guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
