field so inside here this would be Alex
and this would be Guerra so what we can
go ahead and do then is actually combine
it so what I want to do is I want to say
combined underscore text remember this
is the variable that we initiated up
here and then I want to say plus equals
so this will just add this value on
every single time we then want to go
ahead and append a space on that on just
on the end of here so what we can do now
is we can go ahead and alert say comm
combined underscore text so we're
looping through each input field with
the type text so using each we're then
adding the value with a space on the end
on to combine text and then we're just
alerting out so we can see what result
we've got already virus to type Alex and
Garret and click combine you see the
result is Alex Garrett so now what we
want to go ahead and do is actually
place this inside of the combined div
remember we created this div down here
where we can display our result and in
here I use a selector combined because
we're selecting by ID and then I just
simply say text combined text and now
when i refresh and enter some more data
and click combine you see this text
appears down here now like I said with
the each we actually are looping through
each element that has or they exist
within this range of this range of
selectors so for example if I was to go
ahead and just literally create another
input field of the type text remember
that's important I now have three so I
can go ahead and type Alex James Garrett
and because we've used each to loop
through to loop through every input
field with the type text because this
selector still matches we're going to
loop three times this time first of all
with the index 0 then the index 1 then
the index 2 and when we click combined
we get all the results here so there's
not really any need for you you know
using these this selection method
but for example if you wanted to go
ahead and loop through all input fields
to check if they were all empty for
example you could do this for things
like form validation so for example if
you wanted to check all input fields had
actually had a value you can go ahead
and do this so let's just give an
example here let's get rid of this
combined text and let's also get rid of
this combined div and we're just going
to be displaying a message out so let's
just say we want to validate each box so
all three of these we want to go ahead
and check that they have a value within
them so if someone has typed something
so what I'm going to do is I'm just
going to get rid of this and I'm gonna
say if and this dot val is equal to
nothing then I want to say let's just
say failed equals true and let's just go
ahead and get rid of this here failed
equals false so essentially what we're
doing is we're setting a failed variable
up here equal to false now that will
remain false until here unless one of
these input field is empty so if this
dot Val for each field equals nothing
then failed is equal to true or that
failed as assigned the value true so now
what we can do now here is we can say if
failed equals equals true
alert fill out all fields else if failed
is equal to false alert thanks for
filling out all fields just as an
example hopefully you understand what
we're doing again I'll just run through
it for those who don't
we've got VAR failed equal to false so
you know we this comes into this check
down here now for each input field we're
checking the value against nothing and
if the value ie if the first value the
second value or the third value is equal
to nothing this variable is changed to
true and therefore we have this part of
the if statement executed if it stayed
at false ie if all the values were full
then we execute this part of the if
statement so for example if I click
combined now thanks oh no ok yeah so
we've got something going on wrong here
let's just double check oh yes sorry
I've included a dollar sign there that's
just probably because of my PHP
background so let's go ahead and click
combined it says fill out all fields if
I go out and fill the first one and
click combined it still says fill out
all fields because these two are empty
therefore the failed variable has been
set to true let's go back and just set
the third one the second one sorry fill
out all fields and finally the last one
and now failed will continue to equal
false because it wouldn't have this line
here wouldn't have run when we click
combined thanks for filling out all
fields so that's just another example of
how it can be useful for say validation
purposes you might have a lot of text
fields that you want to check and if you
are doing front-end validation as
opposed to back-end server side
validation then this is a great way to
do it because you are saving yourself a
lot of duplicate code a lot of nested if
statements or a lot of if else if
statements so this is a really good way
to do that obviously the first example
was less more more pointless than this
one but this one is relevant and using
each is a great way to loop through
different
and remember this doesn't just apply to
text fields it applies to anything check
boxes text areas you know you name it
any field even divs for example or spans
or you know paragraphs anything
absolutely anything see as long as
you're using a selector here it will
pick up on each element that you know is
returned by this particular selector so
that's the each function if you like in
jQuery and a bit about how useful it can
