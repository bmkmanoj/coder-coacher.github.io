c-sharp tutorial then I'm making for the
new boston and in this tutorial we're
going to continue working on our capture
generator project and really what we
have to do in this tutorial is draw all
the shapes that will be around and on
the string that we drew in the previous
tutorial to make it so it's harder for
BOTS and computer programs 2 i'll read
that text all right so since we're going
to be drawing multiple shapes here which
is going to be using a for statement
we're going to save for and i equals 0
while i is less than Y 66 and we're just
going to want to increment I by one each
time so that it actually only does six
all right and we don't want it to just
draw only a rectangle or only a circle
so we're going to have it randomly
select which one we choose so we're
going to say in j equals grand dot next
and then the minimum will be 0 and if
it's 0 it's going to be either a
rectangle or square and if it's one it's
either going to be on a circle or an
oval and we're going to put 2 is the
maximum because if we put one is the
maximum it will always go 40 it'll it'll
never actually get the maximum it will
always go one lower alright and now
we're just going to say if j equals zero
then we're going to be drawing a
rectangle so we're going to say gee draw
rectangle and a pen that we're going to
be using and the pen that we created up
here so we're just going to say p is our
pen and then the rectangle that we want
to draw in we're just going to randomly
select this so it's not always drawing a
rectangle in the same spot so we're
going to say ran dot next and for the
minimum we're just going to put a 0 and
for the maximum we're just going to put
about half of what this thing's with is
and that would be 111 so to put 1 11
right there for the maximum and then for
the width or the Y location of this
rectangle
we're going to put a brand next post
randomly selected on x axis as well 20
for the amendment for that and about
half the height which would be like 60 l
say so six feet and then for the width
and the actual height of this thing
we're just going to have it be the same
so number really gets off the screen and
it should be at least some of them
should be on top of that text string all
right and now we're just going to want
to see if j is equal to 1 so let me say
right here else if j equals 1 then we
wanted to draw an ellipse so we can just
go ahead and basically copy this code
right here and just say draw a lips
instead of draw rectangle so just say
draw ellipse alright and now that it
actually does draw these shapes you
wanted to reset the color or select a
random color the pen tool each time so
that all the shapes are not the same
color so we're going to say p dot color
equals and then we're just going to copy
this code right up here this basically
generates a random followed all right
there we go so now let's just go ahead
and test this out so i'm just going to
hit debug right here and click start and
as you can see we have shapes all over
that arm string right there so this
makes it harder for a computer to read
it and it really doesn't make it that
hard for a human to reach you can tell
that's like p1h fmc all right so that's
pretty much it for this tutorial so see
you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
