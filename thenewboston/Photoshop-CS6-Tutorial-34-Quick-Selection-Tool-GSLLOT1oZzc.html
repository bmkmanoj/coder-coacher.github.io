Blackford here with another Photoshop
cs6 tutorial and in this tutorial I want
to show you how to use the quick
selection tool it's one of my favorite
selection tools because it kind of works
like a brush like you're actually
brushing on some of the stuff and you
can adjust the size of your brush and
everything like that
so the quick selection tool here is
right next to the lasso tools and right
below the move tool it is right here and
quick selection tool now you'll get in
icon that'll kind of looks like a cross
hairs and this is your basically your
paint brush where you can paint on your
selection now to adjust the size of your
cross hairs or paint brush icon here use
the left and right brackets on your
keyboard and they will increase and
decrease the size like so so with this
type of tool I can come in and almost
finally come in and paint on the
different sections that I want here so
click and hold and this will paint in
the different contrasting sections here
and you notice that right now I was just
trying to get the basket but I've got
some extra up here and maybe a little
too much over here now what we can do is
hold down the alt button and the plus
cross hairs in the middle turns into a
negative and just click and then that'll
erase some of the selection that you had
that you maybe didn't want so like that
use the zoom tool to zoom in and figure
out what else you have to do so there's
too much there and one of the good
things is that it tries to figure out
what's best for your selection now you
can see it doesn't get like in there
like perfectly but it's pretty decent
a little too much over here probably
there go and then anything that's within
the circle is going to be cut so there
we go now I've got the basket all nicely
made now I will all try something like
this tire it starts selecting where the
selection tool really starts like
becoming like a weak tool is when we get
into areas like this and most of the
selection tools aren't the greatest for
working with stuff that has like a bunch
of things in front of it so if I try to
go down here it's going to start trying
to collect all the wheat in all that
stuff so what we need to do is use like
our lasso tool or something like that to
cut this out on our by hand probably now
we have a couple different options up
here for the selection tool here we've
got the first one up here is just going
to be creating a new selection and then
this second one here with the plus sign
above is going to be to add to the
selection and subtract from the
selection is the next button so this is
not holding alt and then holding alt
will change it to the negative selection
or you can just click up here if you
would like now we've got our brush type
here we can set our hardness spacing
size so hardness if we put that down
it'll be like a much more liberal
selection because it's a lot soft softer
and our spacing you can just mess with
that to get a little bit more finer
tuning detail within your selection tool
so if I put this facing up now and start
trying to select with it it's going to
be a little bit easier it's not going to
select all this other stuff like it did
over here so um that's how that works
put this back down to like 50% or
something like that
we can set up the different like that
type of angle we want on a brush so if
we go like 50 or something like that not
too much difference with when you're
messing with that but that's a kind of
up to you we got roundness let's put
that at zero so we would get now you can
see that we get like a slice going on
here so that you can upgrade or you can
manipulate the different kind of angle
and what kind of crosshairs you want to
use and then you got size here which
says pen pressure if you're using a pen
tablet you can use this you can use your
stylus wheel to move the size so all
that's up to you so if I click and then
oh not working I don't have a stylus
that's why duh I just have a mouse
so let's can't do that so we got our
sample all layers button here which
means that um if I had a multi-layered
objects it would actually create a
selection around every single one of the
objects that you have each layer instead
of just the layer that you have selected
so it will select that if you have if
you're selecting the one on top it'll
also slept everything below it if you
select the one at the bottom it's also
going to select everything above it if
you have sample all layers now the auto
enhance up here this selection just
check that box to reduce roughness and
pixelation on the edges so that's up to
you it depends on what your edges look
like if they don't need it don't use it
if they do need it then that's fine use
the auto enhance so um that's uh that's
all for the selection tool it's a pretty
helpful tool it's my favorite out of the
different selection tools and next we'll
go over the magic wand tool which is a
lot of other people's favorite tool so
might as well do that one next so see
you guys in the next
I look forward to seeing you guys view
in the video have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
