Effects cs6 tutorial my name is buddy
Blackford and today I'm going to teach
you about stretching out your lair you
can also compress the time of your lair
by using this method and there's hack
keys for it and everything else the
whole nine yards so let's get started
this effect is actually called stretch
so time stretch so what you need to do
is right-click on your layer and come up
here at a time and we're going to come
over here to time stretch you can select
the how long you want it to be stretched
and this is like kind of like a
percentage here you can set your new
duration of your actual layer if you
would like if you don't know the
percentage you want to use but you know
the time now you can check you can
stretch from the current layer it the
endpoint which is would be the beginning
you could stretch it for more your
current time indicator is that or you
could stretch it from the out point so
the current frame would stretch it from
both sides and the out point would
stretch it from this side in so I'm
going to bring this layer to the middle
so we can see how it stretches so that
way we can see from both sides so let's
use our time stretch time time stretch
and I'll start it from the layer
endpoint and I'll just stretch it 150
hit OK and you can see that it stretched
farther to the right and now the footage
will actually be slower let me put this
on like a fast preview fast draft there
we go
so that way I can move in through the
frames and it's just a line walking
towards us now let's try it again
I'll hit control Z to go back and it
brought it to where we originally was
and we'll do it this time
from the current time indicator which is
current frame and we'll stretch this out
150 and you can see that it is stretched
out both ways 150 percent so that's
that's it for that control Z to come
back and I'll just might as well show
you the last one also see I hit freeze
frame accident I might as well show you
the other one just so you know what it
looks like obviously going to stretch
out from the left side there so and
that's what it did so we'll go back now
there is some hockey's that we can use
ctrl shift and the comma button is how
we stretch from the stretch out the end
point so where I want the end point so
this this edge right here to be so I'm
going to hold ctrl shift and hit my
comma button and it'll stretch to where
my current time indicator is I can also
compress it that way ctrl shift
comma and bring it in so to you to do
the out point which I'll come over here
more control alt comma that's the out
point and now if I want to come out here
same thing control all comma does the
out point out point so those are the
different methods on how to stretch it
and what it's going to do is increase or
decrease the amount of frames in between
each actual in between or in between
your footage so it'll add frames or
lessen the amount of frame
you can also see this in your timeline
all right in your letter panel over here
so if I right click and go to columns
there is a stretch point here and then
we can stretch it this way if we would
like to and that that shows us it'll
stretch it over all kind of like just
from where you're out point is our
endpoint is so it just stretches the
entire thing over all using this method
here if you click on it then you can
come back come up to the time stretch
properties panel so there's another way
for you to work on that that was
remember right clicking up here in your
where the column names are coming into
columns and clicking on stretch also
duration you can do that same thing this
way and it does it extends the out point
this time so that's about the same thing
going on right there so same thing with
duration so thanks for watching the
tutorial on how to stretch and compress
your footage and I'll see you guys in
the next one thanks have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
