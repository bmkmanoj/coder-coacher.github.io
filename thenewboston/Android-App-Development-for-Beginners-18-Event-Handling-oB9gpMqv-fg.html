video and in this tutorial what we're
going to be doing is we're going to
start learning the basics of event
handling now up until this point what we
did is we just made a really simple app
we had some buttons and widgets on there
however whenever you click them nothing
happened
so these are like the dumbest apps ever
made you know pretty useless
so what event handling is is essentially
how to make your app interactive
whenever they do something like click a
button you can call an event and I don't
know something occurs so of course it
would probably be pretty important
during our app development process if we
learn how to do this so that's what I'm
going to be teaching you guys in this
tutorial the very basics of how to make
your app interactive so the user can
interact with it so what I'm going to do
in this example is I'm just going to
have one button and then I'm going to
have some text on there and whenever the
user clicks the button the text is going
to change pretty boring but it'll be
pretty easy pretty easy to demonstrate
what I'm trying to do so prep should
mention this I actually started a brand
new project with a blank activity and I
name my project smart button but you can
name it anything you want of course so
the first thing I want to do is I'm
going to open up this activity main
layout and I'm going to delete this
textview right here so highlight it and
hit delete and the reason I did that is
because I just want to drag a large text
right there because it's a little bit
easier to see during the tutorial and
again I need a button as well so go
ahead and take a button and drag it
right in the middle so again eventually
the user is going to click this button
and it's going to change this text right
here now whenever we're learning event
handling of course what this means is
we're going to have to wait for the user
to click the button and then change the
text so we need a reference to both of
these objects right here so we need to
set an ID for both of these widgets so
you can do these in any order but I'm
going to go to my text view first
and scroll down to ID and right here it
says textview but that is kind of hard
to remember I'm pretty generic so I'm
just going to name this Bucky's text and
hit enter name it anything you want but
actually write this down or remember it
because it's pretty important and for my
button I'm going to change the ID to you
guess that
Bucky's bun hit enter so now again one
once each of these widgets has an ID we
can reference them through our code now
the only other thing I want to do before
we hop into our java file is actually
take care of these little warning
messages right here you guys already
know what these are says treat your
strings as a resource so click this
click the arrow and let's just give the
string a name so for the text I'll just
name it like message underscore text
make sure you don't name this the same
as your ID your outs that'll get
confusing so that's for my string and do
the same thing for the button alright so
for the button string resource I'll just
name this like the button text so this
will be the text that's on the button
and hit OK so now what I want to do is I
want to change the default text for both
this string right here and also the text
that's on the button now what I can do
is I can go here and show you guys a
shortcut but your file that strings that
XML file is actually under App resources
that's what re S stands for
values strings that XML so for the
button I'll just set something like arm
what can I put for the button like click
me pause so that's the text that's going
to appear on the button now this right
here is the default text so it's the
first thing that user is going to see
whenever they open their app now again
whenever they click the button it's
going to
change but by default I'll just write on
something like hello since that's a
pretty creative
you know just hello how boring is that
now if you hop back over you can see
okay
the default text of each change
appropriately and actually let me close
out of this because we don't need it
anymore so now that we have our
interface set up let's go ahead and hop
over to our Java file and the first
thing that we need to do is we need to
import a few things so since we're going
to be essentially writing some code to
tweak both of these things what we need
to do is we need to import in troy'd dot
view or excuse me
oh yeah I guess I'll do it in this order
Android dot view view and remember a
view is basically any type of widget so
after this we just need to import
packages for the button and the textview
so Android dot widget dot button and
import Android dot which it dot and I
just remembered something
textview now also what I'm going to do
is I'm going to go ahead and start my
emulator so that should be ready by the
time you're done with this and actually
let me just pause my screen recorder
because I don't want sometimes when I
run my emulator my screen recorder
automatically gets stuck on that and my
mouse won't move so let me pause alright
so hopefully you guys can see my mouse
moving right now if not and if I have to
re-record this then I'm going to
uppercut my computer and then drop kick
someone else's computer because it's
really annoying when that happens my
anyways alright so we have everything
set up we imported all the stuff we need
our interface is good to go now let me
talk you guys through the basics of
event ham
so like I said event handling is
essentially making something happen
whenever the user interacts with one of
these widgets in this case clicking the
button so event handling kind of has two
parts to it the first thing that we need
to do is we need to tell the spun ok
button you're not just a dumb button
that's sitting on the screen anymore you
actually have to sit and wait for
something to happen and this is called
adding an event listener so adding an
event listener means that your button is
now going to listen for events in this
example a click so once we added an
event listener is going to be waiting
for a click now the second part of event
handling is of course after that click
occurs you need to make something happen
because even though it knows it got
clicked it would be pretty useless if
nothing occurred so the thing that
happens is called a callback method so
again event listener is basically
waiting for a click in the callback
method is the code that happens in this
case changing the text on the screen so
really simple to understand two parts
but it does take a bit of code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
