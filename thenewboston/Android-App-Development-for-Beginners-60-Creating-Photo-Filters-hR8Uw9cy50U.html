we know how to make really really creepy
inverted photo effects what I want to do
is of course show you guys how to
overlay photos on top of each other in
other words this is how you make frames
and if you ever saw like the vintage old
beat-up look at where you take a photo
and you added like some cracks and
scratches and dust speckles to it that's
what we're going to be doing so there's
actually a bunch of these overlays that
you can just get online anywhere you
want but um this is the one that I'm
going to be using so what I want to do
is actually go down to this chunk of
code right here and this is all from the
last couple tutorials so I'm just going
to comment this little chunk out we
don't need to do anything with this
invert image because this is just a
method and if we don't call it then it
won't bother us but what we're
essentially going to be doing is this we
need to do something called layering
objects or layering um kind of think of
it like stacking photos on top of each
other so if we had this photo just think
of it like you're holding it in your
hand set it on the table now if you had
this photo set this on top of it that's
essentially where we're going to be
doing with our program so in order to
get these layers or in order to use
different layers if we call drawable
what we can do is we can make an array
of label objects so I'm just going to
name armed my array layers instead of
equal to new drawable and insert in here
of course we need to say how big is your
array well are only going to be stacking
two things or layering two things on top
of each other so two so now what we can
do is we can go through and start
building this a layer by layer so in
your layers the very first item is this
of course the first thing we want to
stack is this that's going to be the
base of it so if we go to get resources
on this we can call get drawable and for
the parameters r dot drawable
that's Bucky right there so we already
saw what this did again it's just my
face my profile photo that's the very
first layer now we're going to be making
another layer on top of that so we can
just copy that because we are lazy and
this one was named dirty so this is
dirty right here so now we have two
layers looking good however right now
all of this only exists in memory
nothing is appearing on the screen
nothing showing up on your phone
anything like that in order to take this
object in memory and convert it into
something your device can use you need
to turn it into a drawable object so the
class for this is right there layer
drawable and I'll just name it layer
drawable and you set equal to new layer
drawable and in here it's the easiest
thing ever you just throw in your layers
so this is going to take whatever your
stack is whatever layer is a photo you
have and it's converting to convert it
into a drop object so your device can
display it so now the only thing you
have to do is you can just take your
image view which is that area where you
can display an image set image drawable
and in here we can just type right like
that the drawable layers so now let me
go ahead and run this alright guys so
here it is I know it doesn't look that
great it looks like I have like a bunch
of crap on my beard or I don't know just
like a bunch of weird it just looks it
just looks like I'm dirty rather than a
cool effect but I don't have a
background in photography or anything
like that I'm a computer programmer so
that is how you achieve the effect um
you know hopefully whenever you guys do
this you can make it look like you're
not dirty and also since this is kind of
a short tutorial I'll let me show you
guys had to do one extra bonus thing if
you ever want to save an image on your
device
show you guys a real quick way to do it
it's actually some different methods but
um uncomment the code you can just
comment all this out and uncomment this
so pretty much you're back at where you
started at the beginning of this
tutorial and the line that you can use
to actually save an image on the user's
device is this if you go to media store
images dot media dot inserts image then
the first parameter is get content
resolver and after this what you can do
is you know how in the last tutorial we
returned this new photo in this new
photo was that creepy inverted image
that looked like I don't know I was like
you're not from a scary movie or
something you can pass that in as your
second parameter and every photo that
you store on your Android device on your
phone it needs a title and a description
so fright now I'm just going to write
title but later on you might like want
to allow the user to type in the title
through input or just name it something
like random and of course I'll just put
the word description for a description
but this would be something like me at
the beach or hey this is me and my
girlfriend and this is private so
hopefully you're not reading this right
now so you know something like that off
the top of my head so by the way this is
not my girlfriend for everyone who's s
and this is my sister and uh yeah some
people asked her she was my wife and
she's she's definitely not so that is
how you do this and of course if I ran
this right now then we won't be able to
see anything but if you are running this
on an actual device and you run this bit
of code right now you can run it and
then if you close out of the app and
look back in your gallery or your photos
whatever it's called you're going to see
that it indeed did save the image it did
save the image to your device and again
all of the source code is going to be
available on my forum so if you want it
then go ahead and it's you
but for now thing guys for watching
don't forget subscribe and now will
smell you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
