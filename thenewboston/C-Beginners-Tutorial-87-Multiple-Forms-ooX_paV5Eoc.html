that I'm making for the new Boston in
this tutorial I'm going to be showing
you how to add another form to your
application so up until now we've mainly
been working with code we haven't really
looked too much at I'm creating user
interface so it needs next following
tutorials we're mainly going to be
looking at creating the user interface
and to kick it off we're going to be
creating another form so I'm sure you've
seen with other programs that like when
you click a button make you something
another form will pop up and you'll have
more options or something well all we've
been doing is we just have this one
former here there is no other forms all
we have program well in order to add
another form you're going to go up to
project add windows form then just make
sure windows form is selected and you
can name your form anything you'd like
I'm just going to call it form key right
now and then just go ahead and click Add
and over your solution Explorer you'll
see you now have a form one and a form
two or whatever you name your second
form and we also have a nice design
window that I've formed too and we can
do anything one with the second form
just like with this main former year so
if we wanted to add like a button or
checkbox or anything I'm just going to
add a label right now and I'm just not
so the text of this label to form to
just so we know this is going to be
those funky rivet but anyways so now as
of now we cannot display this form
there's no way to access is formed from
the first one right now like no matter
what we do no other form will be
displayed and in order to display the
second form we're going to create a new
instance of this form and in order to do
that we're going to have to go over the
view code and this will just show the
code for the this former here and as you
can see the class is called form two so
in order to now access this form we have
to create a new instance of
- so unbuttoned one click on display the
second form so it's going to arm - we're
going to get a name to it I'll just call
it app set if you go to new and now the
method that we're going to be using in
order to display the form is called show
and show will just display the form so
there's going to be a path dot show so
now let me click this button up here we
should get our second form and again
what we're doing right here is we're
creating a new instance of this form and
that's the class right here and then
we're just using the show method in the
form class to display it and inherits
from this form class right here and
that's just in the form class so now let
me put button one should get the second
form if we have two forms a year we have
our form two later so there's also
another method in the form class called
show dialog and I'm going to show you
the difference between the two now it's
just to show go up here you can move in
between these two forms freely there's
no air or anything well if you do show
dialog it disables that you cannot now
you cannot go in between the two forms
if you try to do that let's make a
little sound yeah now we can only do
things inside of this form and usually
you're probably going to want to have
show dialog but depending on what you're
doing it depends so it's good to know
both of those so as of right now on
these two classes are completely
separate this form one in this form
- well say we want to use a string from
this class or yeah this class right here
and use it in this class well in order
to do that you can just pass a method
through the constructor and form - right
here this is the constructor so if you
wanted to pass a string variable through
right here we just call it we do
I call it my screen now it will just
pass a string variable through this form
to class and now when we go back here
and now cause for a string well I'm just
going to create a text box right here
and basically what it will do now is it
will take the text from this text box
and pass it into form to instructor
right here so we're going to pass it in
text box ones
text and then we're going to take the
text from this text box and set it equal
to the text of this label so now what
we're going to do up here is we're just
going to do the evil one
dot text equals eye string and that's
whatever we pass through the constructor
right here and pass through text box
ones text so what we'll do when we click
this button is it'll create any instance
of this form class as soon as it does
that it will set on label ones text on
poem two to string that a pass to the
constructor which is text box one's text
and then it will display the form so as
soon as you click this button right here
you should get a new form with a label
on it saying whatever's in this text box
so almost like atom right here should be
the form this is that if we get atom
type something else like hello get hello
yep
so that's just a real quick and simple
way of passing variables to your second
form and you can put multiple through
here like if you wanted to put like
integers or something like that you
could do that as well there's there's no
one in just like any other constructor
so that's it for this tutorial on forms
so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
