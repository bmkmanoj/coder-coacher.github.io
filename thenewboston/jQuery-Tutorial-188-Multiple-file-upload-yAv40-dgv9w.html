count we need to first of all select all
types with that have the file property
so all input types with this file here
so we use a selector and we say input
and we have two square brackets and then
we say type equals file now we've
successfully selected here all input
types on the page so all input types
here which have the form the type for
file sorry and at the end of that we
just put length without brackets like
this this is just going to count the
amount of elements on the page so at the
moment if we go ahead and alert out
current underscore count you'll see that
when we press add more we have the value
1 and this means that we can add a value
to this and then the next file type we
create we can add this number here so we
can have file underscore two and then
the next time we click add more the
count will be two so the next file will
be file underscore three so hopefully
that makes sense let's go ahead and get
rid of that alert okay so now we want to
do is supply another variable which will
just be the next count or the next file
count I'm just going to call this next
underscore count and that's going to be
current count plus one so now what we
have is the name of the next form field
this file field you know available to us
we can call it file underscore file
underscore next count and that will be
two in this case because we've added one
to this original variable right so now
we need to actually go ahead and prepend
an element to this form so we need to
first of all select the element that we
want to prepend to and this is file
underscore upload remember that's the
name of our form here file upload and we
want to go ahead and prepend something
so we're going to do this inside single
quotation marks and this is essentially
going to be paragraph tags
inside an input type of file with a name
of file underscore and this is going to
be X now X is going to in a minute when
we modify this be the next count
variable here so what we want to do is
we want to just essentially just append
on this next count variable so now the
next every time we press this button so
every time you click will count the
current amount of input type files or
input input fields with the type file
add one on and then create a new one
with the file underscore and the
additional count so now that we've done
that let's go ahead and test the actual
functionality event so remember prepend
is essentially going to inside of the
element that you specify prepense and
data so every time we prepend what it's
going to do is it's going to prepend
another input type there okay with the
paragraph tags as we've specified it in
ext Jas
so let's go ahead and refresh let's
click add more you can see that it's
prepend Ingush code that we've supplied
in ext Jas
now we need to go ahead I'm just going
to get rid of this at the top now I need
to go ahead and check that it's actually
submitting it properly so for example I
was gonna choose a file here and click
upload we've set the get the method to
get so we see file underscore one equals
tartan jpg that's not a problem because
that's the name that we gave now we need
to know that this replacement of this
variable or this number here has
actually worked so let's go ahead and
check that and we can check that by
returning to the original page we'll add
say three different fields and upload
three different files as choose
different files for each one upload and
now you can see that the variable that
we replaced for the name has actually
updated by one or incremented by one so
we've got one here two here and then
file three here and that will continue
as you add more so
you could add a hundred and you would
submit files you would have you know a
hundred different input fields of the
type file within the name being file
underscore and then it would go from 1
to 100 so that's essentially it this
probably is the easy easiest way to do
this by just preparing this different
different element on you notice that
when we obviously upload we lose all of
these and that's for the reason that
we're not actually sending this to a
file
other than the start so there are ways
to make this slightly more efficient but
this gives a really short and quick
example of how to achieve something like
this and how to file obviously add
different or additional file input types
now if you were going to go ahead and
handle this in the backend so for
example you would obviously go ahead and
change this value here to post so it's
sent as post data with this anger type
here over here now the action would
obviously be a specific file so for
example it would be you know upload dot
PHP or something which have a language
that you're using and then you would
have to obviously find a way in the web
language that you choose to grab all of
these you know different file files that
have been sent this to this page and
that's quite easy I'm not going to go
into it but you can use I know in PHP
you could say go and use dollar
underscore files and you could use a for
each loop for each one so you could say
for each files as file and then you can
retrieve the particular data from here
so it's quite easy to do with regards to
actually processing the upload once
you've sent it but for now in jQuery
that's how we would prepend a you know
an additional element to to a particular
element so the reason we obviously
prepending is because we if we were
going to go ahead and append and make
these appear under underneath each other
it would automatically appear under
add more link at the very end of the
forum so there are way obviously ways
around this you can use the next and
previous next and previous functionality
in jQuery but I think pretending it's
better because it then becomes them very
most top element so that's quite a quick
and easy way to do it
obviously there are ways to improve this
code but for now that's a quick and easy
way to do this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
