24th java game development tutorial and
in this story we're going to be building
a bunch of easy methods adding to our
sprite class and we might even finish it
so all of these you probably already
know how to do but let's just go ahead
and it's just just to get the properties
of the sprite so we need a method to get
the x position so just put public float
get X it's not going to take any
parameters and just return the X that we
created up here now we need to do that
for Y to get the Y positioning of it
because you know get Y positioning get Y
and return Y so BAM we just built two
methods so now with these two methods we
can get the X and y positioning that
pretty much gives us the position on the
screen where the spray is so it would be
useful to set spray X position as well
so let's go ahead and do that with
public void set X and for the parameter
we're going to pass in where we want to
put it so just put flow X and put this
objects X which is pretty much means
this sprites x position is equal to the
X that we passed in so now let's go
ahead and set that Y position and put
set sprite Y position set Y flow Y this
Y is equal to Y looks good good to go so
now we just need to do a couple more
things and one thing we need to do is
get the sprites and when I say spray I
pretty much just mean image is just an
image moving around your screen that's
what programmers call sprite so what we
need to do is get the images width and
height and you'll see why later on when
we run into calculating when it bumps
into the screen you need to find its
width and height so let's go ahead and
get sprite
wit and how do we do this we do public
int get with and in order to get the
width of your sprite remember let's go
ahead and make a return
we are spray is pretty much an object in
a and remember this is because where'd
we put it in our constructor we set the
spray equal to an object a so whenever
we tell a it's pretty much the image so
a dot get image dot get height right
there it's Bill and Method and for your
images server and get height just put
null um because we didn't learn about
images server we don't need to know it
for now so when you got your spray you
have to get the image for some reason
and then you get the height and this
gives you a return value of pixels of
how tall your image is so now let's just
go ahead and copy this and get it for
excuse me that was with and therefore
that would have been bad so get with get
with so now let's go ahead and do that
for height height get height and get
height just like that so let make sure
that mess I think get with get with to
get with get height return image get
high all right so now we have the
sprites width and pixels and height in
pixels and again like I said I'll show
you guys later on what these two but now
we only have to be able to get and set
for and more things so what did we work
with already we got and set the
positioning and we also got the height
value we don't need to set it because I
mean whenever we create our image that's
already set for us the only thing we
need to do is make get and set methods
for the velocity so this is going to be
very easy get
so horizontal velocity close enough
spout right and what we need to do is
public float get velocity about X
because remember on your screen X goes
left and right so that's horizontal so I
could put get X plus VM a bug and we
don't need any parameters because we're
just getting something in return
V X and what this means is return your
velocity X so how fast is going left to
right so now let's go ahead and copy
that and if I move copy it might as
respite might as well spell it right a
so get horizontal velocity get converted
really I hate that stupid insert button
vertical velocity it takes me wanted to
write my comments then actually does my
code get velocity of Y return velocity
of Y so this gets your speed how fast is
going left to right and this gets your
speed how fast is going up and down so
easy enough and now what if we want to
change that well set horizontal X
actually put our horizontal velocity
that might get confusing so now if we
want to change the speed of the x value
or excuse me the X velocity put public
void set velocity good gotta make sure I
spelled it right spit in X input float
VX so now we're going to pass it in a
value which is going to be like 0.4 or
something and you're going to put this
object's velocity X value is equal to
the value that we passed it in VX so
again whenever you put this VX it refers
to this right here and whenever you put
VX r for
as to this up here so that's what the
dis keyword does pretty much so set
horizontal velocity which is the X and
set vertical velocity vertical velocity
coming this fall that's kind of cool
things and this would be the V Y this V
y equals V Y looks good so now we do
look we have get X to get its velocity
left and right get Y to get it speed up
and down set speed the left and right
set it speed up and down and the last
thing we need to do is we need to build
a method to get pretty much the sprites
image and the sprite like is the image
but I just like my comments really
descriptive so you can put get get spray
or image there we go that a floats my
boat little better so public image since
it's going to return the image just name
it like get image or something like that
and in order to do this let's go ahead
and put return whatever object we're
we're going to get image right like that
and BAM before you know it we are done
with our sprite class so now that I have
time let's go ahead and review this one
more time we had five variables one for
the animation what picture did we want
to use as it the position and the speed
of how fast we wanted to move around the
screen we said we gave it a picture to
use we change the positioning of it I'm
using this little formula right here and
then we just made a bunch of get to get
the positioning set when we want to
change positioning this is to get the
width of the image or the sprite this is
to get the height of how tall the images
this is to get the speeds all that and
this is the set of speeds both left and
right and up and down and what this does
is get the spreads image and didn't
you have that up there get height get
with good position good position no
guess not so with that we are good to go
this is all the methods that's all the
information we need in our spray class
so now we can use this information
information in our main method to
actually make something move around and
it's only going to take one more
tutorial well maybe two I might be in
line but it is going to be awesome
this is way cooler animation than the
last one so thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe and I'll see you
next Oriole</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
