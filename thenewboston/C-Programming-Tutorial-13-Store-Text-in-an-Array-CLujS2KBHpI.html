story I think you know I should really
write this down because at the beginning
Africa sort of Michael look tutorial
number is it anyways welcome to your
13th story I think if it's not who cares
and in this tutorial we're done learning
you know concepts theory let's go ahead
and actually build a useful program so
let me throw something at you say you
own this brilliant software company and
a client comes in and he's like I have a
million dollar idea for piece of
software I need you to build I want a
piece of software that allows a user to
enter their name like Bucky Roberts and
then enter a sport like hockey or
football and then it prints out on the
screen
Bucky Roberts loves hockey BAM there you
go how awesome idea is that and we're
like oh yeah that's awesome
you are an idiot but we don't tell them
that because they're paying us what we
do is we go ahead and recreate this
program anyways so let's go ahead and
create it right now and Aaron our money
well let's go ahead and we decided to
take whatever name they entered and we
said the best way to store this is in a
character array
all right makes sense so let's go ahead
and twenty characters should be fine
enough and now we need a blank array for
the sport that they enter so character
array sport and see no sport is more
than twenty characters long unless it's
Russian and I got a joke um if someone
asks you are you Russian back no I'm not
in a hurry get it I'm sorry that was
dumb I probably should just redo this
whole tutorial and not include that joke
but anyways it's a dumb joke one free
dumb joke bird story
so anyways back to the story now that we
have two blank character arrays one for
name and one for sport we now allow them
to populate the array and here is how
you allow the user to populate an array
CIN of course name and now whatever they
whatever text they end
is going to be stored in the character
array name and CIN sport and now
whatever text they enter is going to be
stored in the character array sport
looks pretty good and now all we have to
do is remember what he said he wants the
name then loves sport like Bucky Roberts
loves football so let's go ahead and do
that from name loves sport and go ahead
in in that line and L for n line so now
what's going to happen is this it's
going to put a blink cursor on our
screen have us enter the name and then
you're going to want to press enter
enter the sport press enter again and
it's going to say Bucky Roberts loves
football so let's go ahead and run this
and see what we get Bucky Roberts enter
whoa whoa whoa spray Graham's messing up
already
Bucky loves Roberts what that sounds
like some gay joke and I don't like that
one bit so let's go ahead and see what
we did wrong and now we see this
whenever we build a program this way
here's what happens it allows us to
enter our name which it saw is Bucky and
then it saw a space and then our
compiler thought all right whenever you
hit a space this must be a new variable
that you're going to enter and I'm going
to store this in sport but what we want
to do is allow the user to enter their
entire name and then once they hit enter
we're going to want them to a input the
sport so instead of separating it with a
space we're going to want to separate
the variables with an enter or return
whatever keyboard you have so how do we
fix this well this is something we
haven't gone over yet but on my PT jet
to you guys right now instead of cin go
ahead and type cin dot get let's go
ahead and delete these instead of cin go
ahead and put cin dot get line and now
as your parentheses
all right let's back up for a second
Bucky you're going a little too fast get
line is a function that allows the user
to enter a line of text instead of just
one word separated by space so now what
get line is going to do it's the same
thing is you know allows the users to
enter text but this is going to take the
entire line of text and now when they
hit enter it's going to end it so this
is a better way than just separating
everything with spaces it waits until
the user hits enter and once they do it
takes whatever text is on that line and
stores it in this variable which is in
this case name so anyways this function
takes two parameters the first thing is
what variable or in this case what array
do you want to store this text inside
name of course and it takes another
parameter which you usually just have
the same as your array what is the
maximum amount of characters that you
can enter and let's just go ahead and
press 20 and now this is going to take
the entire first line of text so this
will take Bucky Roberts and store it in
the array name perfect that's what we
want and CIN dot get line again of
course we need another one for sport and
20 as well just go ahead and set this
second parameter equal to however long
you made your array and now let's go
ahead and run this program again build
and run Bucky Roberts go ahead and press
ENTER and press football and make sure
you spell it with two T's and not two
O's or else it won't work and check this
out Bucky Roberts loves football how
awesome is that we just sold this
program to this guy for a million
dollars
BAM I just made you guys millionaire so
anyways the key to this story exists
whenever you want to take any bit of
text and store it inside an array you
know whenever you want the user to enter
their own text you can do it in two
different ways
one is just using the basic C n that we
learned before and this is going to take
anything they entered and treat each
word as a new variable or you have
different way to do this if you want to
take whatever they entered on an entire
line and store that in the character
array you need to use this special
function that I taught you guys about
called CN get line and of course this
function takes two parameters the first
one is name or whatever variable you
want to store it inside and the second
one is how many is the maximum amount of
characters you can store and let me show
you guys what I mean by this the user
can enter more than 20 but it's not
going to store more than 20 so let me go
ahead and build this and show you Bucky
Roberts is the best guy ever that's
clearly more than 20 I think let's just
add this just in case and and check this
out Bucky Roberts is the loves it stops
at 20 and then you know it's not going
to mess up if the user enters more than
20 is just going to cut it off right at
20 so anyways that's what this little
you know stop sign means the second
parameter so anyways that is the
difference between C in and C in get
line one takes only a word separated by
spaces and one takes an entire line of
text so in this case this would be the
better way so anyways I think you guys
for watching don't forget subscribe and
that's all I have for you guys for this
tutorial in the next story I'll promise
I'll be going over something a little
more interesting or will I see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
