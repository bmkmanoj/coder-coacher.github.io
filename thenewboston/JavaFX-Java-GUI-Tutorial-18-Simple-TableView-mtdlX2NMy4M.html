let me explain exactly how this is going
to work so we're going to have a bunch
of different products and these are just
going to be regular Java objects so
we're going to have like a laptop toilet
cheeseburger whatever products that we
have a bunch like I said just plain old
Java objects now once we have those
we're going to convert them into an
observable list so we use observable
list before we saw all the benefits of
it and an observable list is what we're
going to use in our tables so objects to
an observable list to a JavaFX table
simple enough let's go ahead and get
started all right
so oh I just say like a little fruit cup
in between the last tutorial on this one
and uh I don't know I feel like I need
to eat more fruit but I'm too like lazy
to peel the orange so I just buy these
fruit cups but whatever all right so
observable list and inside here inside
the I would say curly brackets but
they're not Oteri's regulator I don't
know less than greater sin than regular
brackets I guess you write what type of
data you're going to have in your list
now before we saw string double int but
the type of data is actually just the
name of your class so we're going to
store product objects in here so we can
just write product and you can just name
your method anything you want get
product so what this method is
essentially going to do is it's going to
load in all of your data I'll say uh
like get all of the products and it's
going to look a little bit goofy because
I'm just going to make a bunch of you
know products real quick but again this
would typically be something like
connecting to the UM you know a database
on the internet or looking on a file on
your computer for like a CSV file or
some or something but I can just type in
a bunch of products whatever so again
we're going to need to return an
observable list of product objects so
the first thing we need is an observable
list
it's going to hold products and I'll
just call it products instead of equal
to FX collections hold on I got a cuff
my god Wow
okay where was I FX collections dot
observable array list and this is a type
of observable list rügen store java
objects inside and now we just need to
add a bunch of products to it so
products add and just create whatever
product you want so new product holy
sweet tamale and remember for the
product constructor whenever we create a
product we can just create it all in one
line passing in a name a price in a
quantity so for my first product I'll
just say laptop and for the price how
much does a laptop cost 859 not bad it's
going to be a sweet laptop and the last
one is we have 20 of them so you can
just do this for whatever fake products
that you want I'm just going to say I
have like five different ones I have a
laptop move that all the way bouncy ball
what do I have
toilet the notebook DVD awesome movie by
the way and corn all right now let me
just change these up so I know how much
is it bouncy about $2.49 and how much is
a toilet $99 the notebook DVD is $19.99
and corn I'll say corn is a dollar and
49 cents and the bouncy ball we have 198
of those I have 74 toilets a bunch of
toilets in my store I have 12 notebook
DVDs and I have 846 corns court up
corns corns and toilets boys come and
get them corn and toilet sale that's a
going to be my commercial alright so now
we have a bunch of products stored in a
servable list we just have to return
that's a list right now
just go ahead any time we call this
method right here it's just going to get
all over products and return the list
and again like I said this is usually
going to be a database or something but
whatever this is how I run my store do
not judge me
so now that we got all the boring
behind-the-scenes data stuff taken care
of we can get to the good part learning
how to make the actual table the user
interface is going to be awesome alright
so the table is just called table view
this is your entire table and it's like
that one don't want to import swing and
in brackets you write what type of data
are you going to be story in your table
well of course we're just using it to
store our products and now you give a
name I'm going to be really creative and
just name mine table awesome alright now
here's the thing whenever you create a
table essentially whenever you create a
spreadsheet you need to have at least
one column now ours is going to have
three columns one for the name one for
the price and another for the quantity
so again just remember if you try to
create one without using any columns
you're going to get a bunch of errors so
the first thing I always like to do is
set up my columns so I'll just write
name column and this is how you set up a
column the first thing you have to write
is table column and as you saw it takes
two pieces of information the first one
is just the type of data in your table
so again product like before and the
second one is what type of data is going
to be in this column so in the first
column we're going to have string data
for the name the second one doubles and
third one integers so for the name
column we're just going to use a string
nothing new and I'm just going to name
this name column and you set this equal
to new table column and just pass the
name
column so again we're going to have
columns and the header of it is just
going to say name at the top and that's
just a little indicator so the user
knows what the heck that column is
supposed to be and you can also do
something like this name column set min
width and just give it a pixel value so
the minimum width of this column is
going to be 200 if you don't have this
then they kind of look like all the
columns are bunched together kind of
looks a little bit goofy so I like to do
that and the last thing you do to every
column is this name column set cell
value Factory so what we're going to do
is for the name column we're going to
say use the name property of our objects
so for this column look to our objects
and get all the values of their name so
it's going to have laptop bouncy-ball
toilet the notebook DVD and corn so this
is where you kind of tie your data
together saying use this data for this
column and the parameter that you pass
in is new booooo property value factory
and then you just write the name you
actually don't need these little
indicators because everything is implied
so that's how you set up a column real
simple and now we can just copy this and
do it for the other two so named column
1 0 1 price
all right so for the price column this
is obviously going to be price column
and we aren't storing prices of string
we're storing it as doubles and we'll
just say price right here and price so
again make sure that you whenever you
throw in this parameter right here that
it's the exact same is this variable
right here this one this very first one
this is just the header and it can be
whatever you want I'll say like a item
price you can have that if you want but
this one has to be the exact name of
your property so make sure I got that
what's the width of my price let me have
that at 100 I don't want my numerical
columns to be quite as wide as measuring
columns so are moving on quantity
quantity column quantity column la la la
la la la nothing happened nothing to see
there art 1 and let me just write
quantity in quantity alright so it looks
like I have everything set up correctly
name price perchick one quantity 100 100
Quentin Quentin corny alright did a
little quick check in my head alright so
we have three columns set up and they're
just showing there they're ready to
stick inside a table and to set our
table up it's actually really easy table
equals new table view and after this we
have to do two things the first thing is
loading all of our data so what data do
you want to use for your table we're
just going to call set items and this
method right here we made to load in all
of our data so that's going to get all
of these products as an observable list
and those are the items that we're going
to use in our table and the last one is
we just have to add our column
through it so table get columns a doll
then just add all your columns so this
was the name column and then the price
column and quantity column alright so I
art now I actually have to add our table
to our layout and everything should be
good to go I think all right sexually
find out so I'm going to run this and
check it out alright so we have our name
column our price column and our quality
column and one of the awesome things
about JavaFX is this see we didn't build
any functionality ourselves to sort all
of these columns what it's doing it for
us and also we didn't have to build
anything to like select this and you can
also if you grab one of these you can
drag it into a new location did we have
to build that all done for us so that's
one of the amazing things about JavaFX
but there you go that is how you create
a really simple table again what we did
is anytime we have data that we want to
represent build a new class and make
sure to include all of the properties
and then once you can treat your data is
a Java object take all of the objects
and stick them inside an observable list
and then your table can use that
observable list beautifully thanks the
JavaFX so in the next story I'm going to
show you guys a couple other cool
techniques that you can use with the
table but for now thanks for watching
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
