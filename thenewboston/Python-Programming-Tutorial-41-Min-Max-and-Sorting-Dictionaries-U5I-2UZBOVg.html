good Halloween boys for a homie coming
up I have to keep that voice around
alright Bucky get off track already ten
seconds in so let's focus on the
tutorial well I'm going to teach you
guys in this video is how to get the
minimum the maximum of a dictionary and
also how to sort the entire dictionary
so it's nice me and in order now you
guys may be thinking that there's some
really easy function that's already
built into Python to allow you do this
in a simple kind of way but
unfortunately for us there is not and
it's not really intuitive to figure out
at first so that's why I want to make
this tutorial it's going to save you
guys a bunch of time in you probably
want to do this every time you work with
dictionary so hohoho that wasn't me um
so I'm going to have to blame it one on
someone else all right so the first
thing we need is a dictionary so I'm
just going to make mine out of pretend
stock prices that I'm just going to pull
off the top of my head and we'll say
that we have like five companies or
something now I know the ticker symbol
for Google is goog and this one uses
trades for like five hundred twenty
bucks and just make something else I
know Facebook FB like 76 54 45 whatever
Yahoo I do know this one to UM say this
one is like 39 28 and what's another one
I know Amazon and Apple and that's it so
Amazon that's not it AMZN on this one is
actually pretty expensive around like
three hundred five dollars usually an
Apple AAPL that's the last one I know
that is as far as my financial knowledge
goes it's somewhere around 100 bucks so
this is a dictionary of course these
aren't accurate values but it's good
enough for this example and this would
resemble something like if we scraped
some website and pulled of the prices
off or maybe someone emailed us a list
of
stocks that they were interested in and
wanted us to make some program for it
this of course would be an example of
what they gave us it's not sorted in any
kind of way not alphabetical order not
by price and of course it would be handy
to have this nice and sorted so the
first thing I want to do is show you
guys exactly we need to do to either get
the minimum get the maximum or just like
sort it and print it out so first what
you need to do is actually use that zip
function that we learned earlier and
what we're going to do is actually treat
this as two lists a list of keys which
is the name and the list of values now
if you guys don't know what zipping does
um go watch my zip tutorial I made it
like two tutorials ago but a one
sentence overview it takes two lists and
it zips them together until a list of
tuples so now they're tied together and
now we can do some pretty cool things to
them
so again what we're going to do is we're
going to use that zip function and I
want to mention this you can not just
sort a dictionary by default but you can
sort a zipped list since it is a list
now whenever python sorts things it
looks at the first element in that list
so remember whenever you zip a list you
give it to lists which in this case is
the prices or the name and you time
together so why am I saying this I just
said that well it's actually really
important because the item or the list
that you've thrown first is how it's
going to sort it by so if you throw in
the prices first your result is going to
be sorted by prices if you throw in the
names first is going to be sorted by
names in other words alphabetical order
so let's say that we actually want to
sort these by the prices remember
technically these are called the keys
and these are called the values so the
first item we zip is going to be the
value so stocks values that's the first
list were thrown in all the blue stuff
the second one is just going to be
stocks
and keys right there so now what we have
is pretty much a nice list that zipped
together and we can perform any function
that we would on any other list so let's
just go ahead and get the minimum value
of this list by taking this and thrown
it in men and there we go
so what this is going to do is it's
going to get the minimum value of this
nice zip to list now actually just want
to print out that value so that is how
we're constructing that and I know I
kind of build it inside out but I just
wanted to break it down you know not
kind of like rap game break it down but
yeah that's how it works so let's run
this and check it out so again it gives
us thirty nine twenty-eight yahoo now
again the thing I want to point out is
that even though the zip list consists
of two values it's sorted it or gave us
the minimum price because the value of a
dictionary is the second element so
that's why it sipped together got the
minimum and it printed it out now of
course the max is just really easy
change min to max run that bad boy boom
roast the next thing you know you got
the max price pretty freaking sweet now
of course if you want this sorted you
guys want like the third easiest thing
in the world change that max to sorted
and now let's go ahead and run this Oh
mg Bucky check it out you just sorted an
entire dictionary really really easily
so again now you can see kind of how
this entire um as if the list is
constructed by a set of values in keys
and of course the reason that it's
sorting by the price is because we threw
values and first so it goes from minimum
to maximum Yahoo being the cheapest and
Google being the most expensive if we
ever wanted to sort it by the name all
we have to do is change this the key
these and this the values and what this
is going to do is it's going to zip it
together a little bit differently
flip-flop the two around but you still
get a nice sorted dictionary now in
alphabetical order so you guys are now
experts on how to get the minimum
maximum and make a nice sorted
dictionary check this out it's pretty
much all one simple line of code Python
would be really nice if they have
built-in way but you know it was easy
enough so thank you guys for watching
and I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
