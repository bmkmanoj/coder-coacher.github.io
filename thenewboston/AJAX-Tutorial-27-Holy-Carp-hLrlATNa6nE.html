HTTP status text now this is a property
of basically it's basically going to
give you a status message if something
went wrong so that's all you need to
remember hopefully we won't see that
anyways now in the 200 which would mean
a successful communication in the
request process you know successfully
and your response is ready of course we
want to do something with that response
whatever we ask you know our server to
do this is where we you know kind of get
to the good part
so of course whenever it needs to
communicate back I said put everything
in a try-catch statement and I actually
just want to copy my catch so it's going
to try to do something and catch it if
something goes wrong but this try block
what do we want to do first well the
first thing we want to do is since we
were requesting this text file let's
actually get the text of this as a
string now you can actually whenever you
receive a response from using Ajax you
can get it in a bunch of different ways
you can get as an XML file in that way
you know you saw in the first couple
examples we can handle that in specific
ways but we just want to you know get
this as a very simple string since this
is a very simple example so let's go
ahead and store it in a variable called
text and we'll set this equal to XML
HTTP response text so basically this is
just going to generate static plain born
text and return it to you in a variable
called text so now this text variable
should be equal to this sentence right
there holy crap this actually worked so
now what I want to do is I actually want
to set the inner HTML of status 4
because if you took note we actually did
it for status one status two in status 3
but we didn't do a status for you so let
me just go ahead and since this you know
has to be nice and me status 4 remember
that
that status4 basically meant that um
quest is finished and response is ready
and I know I spelled some crap around
there but not important so that's
basically what status 4 means your
request whatever you ask for is finished
and your response is ready to go
maybe that response is successful and
maybe that response is just as simple as
hey dude you requested some page that
does exist but anyways status 4 means
that response is ready so now the last
thing we want to do is we actually just
want to output this text on the screen
so basically all we did now is we took
this text and we set it equal to a
variable but now we just have to output
that variable on the screen so let's go
ahead and do that by this simple line of
code right there
so basically I think that I you know
hopefully I didn't get any errors let's
just go ahead and see right now so let
me go ahead and refresh upload all this
to my server someone's texting me right
in the middle of a frickin tutorial and
let me go ahead and refresh this and
hopefully hole yeah everything worked
perfectly so the first thing we did is
we just said ok we're connected to the
server we made it this far and then once
we were connected we sent the request
through Ajax and the request was
basically hey send us a text file and
once we got the text format it appeared
on the screen just like I showed you
guys now take note of the fact that even
though we wrote code for status 1 2 3 &amp;amp;
4 since this is Google Chrome
whoever develop google chrome thought it
was a good idea to ignore status 1 so
some of you guys watching this tutorial
and running this program you may see
status 1 some of you guys may not see
like status 3 or something but as long
as you get this last part holy crap this
actually worked or holy carp this
actually worked then your program works
even if it isn't the exact same so there
you have it now hopefully you understand
the little intricacies
why we build Ajax program and why states
are so important so we are finally done
and guys probably the last probably this
is where I'm going to be going with this
tutorial series I want to talk to you
guys a little bit more about XML files
and show you guys some really cool
techniques and some other things and
probably in 20 tutorials or so once I'm
done covering the basics of everything I
want to create the coolest program and
that's a ajax chatroom now a problem
with a lot of chat rooms is that if it's
built in flash or Java or something
maybe the users need to download it or
maybe you know they don't have Flash
installed with Ajax it's compatible on
almost every computer and there is no
I'm I don't want to get ahead of myself
but that's what I'm super excited about
so you know I shouldn't have even told
you that but I let the cat out of the
bag it's going to be awesome and I'm
going to show you guys how to create an
awesome freaking sweet chat room in the
upcoming tutorials so thing guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
