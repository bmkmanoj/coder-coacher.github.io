Robertson welcome to your very first
tutorial in MySQL now in order to
understand what exactly MySQL is we
first need to take a look at what a
database is now a database is pretty
much a collection of data on a computer
now it isn't just a whole bunch of data
packing to a file or randomly jammed on
your computer it's organized in a very
specific fashion it's actually made up
of something called tables now each
table is going to store similar
information sounds pretty confusing well
let's go ahead and take a look at a
quick example say you are making the
website YouTube
now YouTube stores a bunch of
information like usernames passwords
links to videos people's comments
favorites they don't just want to store
all of this information in random files
so what they decided to do is better
organize this in tables so instead of
just taking all the information they
need and throwing it randomly onto a
file they broke it up into a user's
table videos table and comments table so
as we can see we can use tables to
organize similar information so now all
of the users would go in this table all
of the videos in another table all the
comments in a separate table and now
that you are separating specific in
similar information it just helps you
organize your databases better so now
that isn't only the only way that we
break up to organize that we actually
break up these tables in a very specific
way as well so let's go ahead and take a
look at those so tables each individual
table is made up of columns in rows now
the columns are like categories and the
rows are like each separate entry so if
you're saying what the heck columns in a
row is kind of like a grid well yes it
is kind of like a grid now if we took a
look at a table here say I wanted to
make a table to organize all of my
friends so I would have each column with
a specific category for example the
first column would be name all of the
items in this column would be the name I
would have another column or category
which would be age in this case now only
age is going here and my last category
for this example is profession so again
as you can see columns are kind of like
categories now the rows are a little bit
different because each individual entry
goes on a separate row the first entry I
have is Bucky who's 25 and his
profession is a shepherd now on the
second one like I said each row is like
an individual entry so for Lisa's entry
it would be named Lisa age 68 profession
magician so as you can see once we have
each column with a separate category in
each row is a separate entry it could
really help you identify and organize a
bunch of data very specifically because
then if you're saying okay how old is
Ashley well you know to go in the H
category and you know to scroll down
Ashley and where the two meet that's the
answer you're looking for so instead of
just scrolling through random data
breaking databases up into tables and
then further more into columns and rows
could really help organize your data in
a very productive manner so as we can
see say we wanted to make a huge
database that was going to store all of
the people in the United States well
whenever we were making the database say
we organized it like this we would say
okay database look for a person named
Bucky and I would say okay arm I didn't
find one there actually six thousand
people in the United States named Bucky
so we say okay um what about a person
named Ashley who is unemployed and it
says okay and think about this for a
second how many people named Ashley are
unemployed in the United States right
now probably five thousand I'm guessing
well this isn't a really effective way
to make a table because you can have a
lot of duplicate entries even you can
even have as
that's 21 and unemployed there probably
a couple hundred of those so instead of
just making a table like this what you
need to use is a primary key now
remember this whenever you make a table
in a database you need to have a primary
key and that is a column that's
guaranteed to be 100% unique
so basically no entries or no rows can
have the same primary key so let's go
ahead and take a look at this table with
primary keys so whenever you're making a
website aside from letting the user have
a user name which may be the primary key
it's always good to assign them an ID
number or our primary keys in America
are our social security number no one
else has our same social security number
so basically whenever I'm saying okay
find all the buckey's well it may return
600 but if we say okay return the person
with a primary key of one it's only
going to return one result and you can
say to your database okay um find all
the Ashley's who are 21 and unemployed
while they that may give you 500 results
but we only are looking for this Ashley
so instead we would say okay find the
member or find the person with ID of
three and that is why you use a primary
key because it's guaranteed to only
return one result so say this Ashley
right here died and we needed to remove
her for a database from the database
instead of saying okay remove Ashley
from the database which may remove 500
people we just say okay remove the
person with the ID of three and bam
we're good to go we didn't screw up our
database so now before I let you guys go
I'm all I want to cover one more thing
what is SQL because these tutorials are
going to cover MySQL SQL is the language
that databases use now we just can't say
you know shout into our computer hey
database um delete Ashley it doesn't
understand English it needs to use a
special language and we'll look at that
in a couple
that's called SQL now what my SQL is is
basically a program that understands SQL
now whenever we learn this SQL we just
can't open notepad or Microsoft Office
and start typing this in it's not going
to know what the heck this crap is so
instead MySQL is the program that
understands SQL and also there is other
software asad for MySQL that can
understand this language but MySQL is
the best it's free it's fast and that I
mentioned it's free oh yeah it is
so anyways there you go there is your
quick background on databases tables in
SQL so yes thank you guys for watching
I'm going to be making a bunch of
stories so don't forget to check out the
next tutorial don't forget to subscribe
and I will see you guys in the next
