50 second java tutorial and the store is
probably going to be pretty long it's
probably going to be a multi-part
tutorial and we're going to be talking
about event handlers so what an event
handler or event handling is is in
Lesson toriel I showed you guys how to
build a simple GUI or GUI well what an
event is is anything that the user can
do like move their mouse click a button
press Enter
those are called events in computer
language now what an event handler is is
the code that responds to your mouse
movement or button clicking so the event
would be click a button the event
handler would be the code that says ok
when you click this I'm on another box
the pop-up that says you just click the
button or something like that absolutely
the event is what the user does the
event handler is what the programmer
makes when they do that event and this
overall process is called event handling
so I'll be talking about this later on
but you guys need to know um pretty much
I just want to tell you in this program
or tutorial we're going to be building a
window on the screen and we're going to
be building some text boxes inside that
window and whatever the user enters text
and press Enter um the event handler is
going to say alright I'm going to pop up
another box so let's just go ahead and
get started if you know I'm talking
about then you'll figure it out
eventually
ok neat little break now the first thing
we need to do is import a bunch of crap
that we're going to use in this tutorial
so I'm going to go ahead and type import
java.awt dot flow layout and make sure
your egg is not capitalized and go ahead
and you can just copy this right here
because we're going to be using
something similar to it so we imported
java.awt flow layout the next thing we
want to import java.awt events
dot action listener let me make sure I
spelled listener right yep and what this
does the flow layout pretty much gives
you layout the listener listens or
pretty much waits for the user to do
something like press ENTER or something
so now the last thing we needed poor
import from the AWT is event
come on cursor seriously AWT event
action event and these are events which
I told you about last time now we need
to import four things from the swing so
let's go ahead and import Java X make
sure you have the X swing dot J frame
and now we can go ahead and well might
as well copy that because we're going to
important three other things
copy paste paste paste we need to import
jframe jtextfield and make sure that you
got your cap elation same as mine with a
TF capitalize jframe J texture J
password field in text field is
somewhere working type text pest
password is the same thing but instead
of showing the text it covers it up in
Asterix so you can't see and the last
thing is option pane so now we imported
everything that we need for this
tutorial and these pretty much are all
built-in methods and variables that
we're going to use so now what we need
to do for our tuna class is just like
before we need to extend or inherit all
the stuff from J frame and what this
pretty much does is give us all it
pretty much lets us to use a window so
now we created a window like any other
program now we can start putting stuff
in it so we're going to put three items
plus a password field in it or pretty
much for text fields so let's go ahead
and make variables for those let's make
our item our first text field first so
private J
text field and you need to put
jtextfield and you can name anything you
want I'm just going to name my item one
and I'm going to make three of these so
I'm just going to copy this because I am
extremely lazy item two and I'm three in
the lesson
sorry about that head take a little
break help my room I find his phone but
alright so we created three text fields
right here now let's go ahead and create
our last password field and we'll set
that to private as well because I mean
why not J password field like that and
let's just uh give this variable oops
password field looks good so now I did
something oh no semicolon embarrassing
so we created three items plus a
password field now let's go ahead and
create our window so let's go ahead and
create a constructor for this and since
of my class is named tuna I'm going to
have to create a method that's named
tuna so I'm just going ahead and go
inside public tuna doesn't take any
arguments and whatever I create in this
is pretty much the window so the first
thing I need to do or first thing I
actually want to do is add a title to
this and if you remember from the last
tutorial to do this you just put super
and then in your argument you put the
title or whatever you want for the title
not going to get anything fancy because
I'm not creative at all so now we're
going to have to set the layout for this
which is pretty much how things are
placed and we don't want to have to code
a new layout and place everything so
we're just going to grab a 1 by default
and how you do this put set layout and
if you're wondering where all these
methods are coming from they're imported
some are up here all these built-in
methods that I'm using you just can't
make set layout and put it in everything
you actually have to import it
so set layout takes one argument and the
argument for this is new flow layout
just like that and that is a method in
itself so make sure you have that up
just like that so now we have a title in
a layout to our window so let's go ahead
and start adding those
um textfields right there so the first
thing we're going to add is the item one
and we're going to set this equal to nu
J text field and in the parameters for
this set the length of it is 10 and now
we have an item but we didn't add it to
the window yet so let's go ahead and add
item 1 and this will add the item to our
window so now although you can't say you
pretty much have a blank window with
just a little text field on the screen
now we're going to go ahead and do that
for the rest of our items so let's go
ahead and put item 2 and set this one
equal to and these are going to be a
little bit different just to change
things up a little bit new J text field
but is your parameters go ahead for this
one and put like enter text here now
what this is going to do is give you a
default text inside and it pretty much
is like a prompt now let's go ahead and
add this one to the screen item 2 so now
we have a pretty much an empty window
with two things on our screen two text
fields so now let's go ahead and change
our item 3 variable - yeah you guess the
new J text field and for this one we'll
go ahead and type all right let me think
of something to do there we go let's go
ahead and type we'll make this text on
editable and we'll give it a default
value of 20 and now we have a text field
that says uneditable in it and we want
to make sure that the user cannot edit
this so we're going to what we're going
to do is take that item 3 which is that
text field and how you set the editable
Ness is go set editable and what you're
going to do for this is put false and if
you put false in that that text field is
not going to be editable so the user is
going to be able to change what's on the
screen I mean I read what's on the
screen but they aren't going to be able
to edit it and now what we want to do is
just I'd add item number 3 to that and
the last thing we're going to make is
our password field
just go ahead and our password field and
we're going to set this equal to nu J to
get it
password field make sure it's typed
everything right and as a default you
can give um get out of there
my pass or something and this is going
to show up in asterisks on your screen
so now that we have that we can just go
ahead and add on the password field or
don't want that so now we have a screen
with four things on it we have four
different text boxes and each of em them
is a little different I just want to
show you guys that I'm changing the
parameters does a little thing different
to it and you'll see this later on
visually but in the next tutorial we're
actually going to be adding and event
and handlers to this that means when you
enter text and press Enter do this or do
that but for now I just wanted to get
our window set up and in the next
tutorial we're going to start
programming this baby so I cannot wait
thank you guys for watching now see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
