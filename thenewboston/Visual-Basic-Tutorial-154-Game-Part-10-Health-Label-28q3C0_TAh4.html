youtube.com slash on live gamer for the
new Boston and in this tutorial we're
gonna continue working on the game so
let's go ahead and we'll close out of
this right here and let's open up the
forum 1vb designer so we will
right-click and click view designer so
here's our forum we've got our timer and
our forum right here so let's go ahead
and we'll come down here and let's make
it so that the person can see the health
of the current player and the enemy so
we'll come over here to the toolbox
we'll add a label and we will make
another label so we have label 1 and
label 2 so this will set the text of
this one to health and also the text of
this one to health to so we'll come back
over here
and we need to change the names of these
so that we can remember what they are so
label pop eye health and then label
enemy health okay so now let's go ahead
we'll come back here in two for one DB
and so the form unloads what we want to
do is generate an enemy so here's our
generate enemy sub if you don't know
what this is then you may want to move
back and find where we did that so after
they have created the enemy what we want
to do is just go ahead and set the
health label so we'll just type label
enemy health dot text equals health
and then we will add current enemy dot
health so what is this gonna do is gonna
set the text to contain the current
health of the enemy now if you notice we
have done this several times whenever
they attack it sets the progress bar
right here so let's just go ahead and we
can create a sub that will do this for
us so we'll just type private sub update
enemy health go ahead and hit enter and
we'll make another one for the hero so
we'll just do update pop by health okay
so whenever we update the enemy health
what we're gonna do is set progress bar
enemy dot value equal to current enemy
dot health and then after that we want
to set this right here so label enemy
health dot text is going to be equal to
your health and then the current enemy
so to update the pop by health we do
pretty much the same thing but we're
using different variables so progress
bar Popeye dot value is going to be
equal to 0 dot health and then we'll set
label Popeye health dot text is going to
be equal to health and then we'll add
hero dot health
so now that we've created these two subs
let's go ahead and use them in our enemy
attacks and our other attack methods so
for enemy attack we're just gonna try
and update Popeye health so if this
returns an error it's going to do
everything in the catch block so
probably smart Popeye that value is
going to be equal to zero and then one
set health back to 100 and then we are
going to put that back up to the top so
we'll just go ahead and leave this the
way it is and when we click attack it's
going to attack so let's just go ahead
and try to update enemy health so it's
gonna update the enemy health and it's
gonna start the timer now we'll go ahead
and run this and see if everything works
the way that we intended
so here's Popeye it's got health and you
can see that we didn't initialize it
when the program starts but we can fix
that easily so we can go ahead and
attack and you can see the health fields
have 95 and then when a Popeye gets
attacked back has helped us down to 90
so we can attack again it goes down 10
and this one goes down 10 this one goes
down 20 and then this one goes down 10
this one went down I don't remember what
it was
it may have been 30 something and then
this one went down I think 8 so we can
just keep doing that and the health is
going to update as we go along and you
can see that the health here is set to
zero so we'll come back in here and
whenever an enemy is generated let's
just go ahead and update enemy health
and whenever the form1 loads we want to
update enemy health or that's gonna be
done through generate enemy so when
generate enemy is run it's automatically
gonna update the health inside of that
and we also want to update the popeye
health so you can see that we got health
at one hundred so we'll take away
fifteen and then we get attacks for five
damage take away 10 and then we get
attacks for a whole bunch think that we
still left eat brains to do 50 damage
then we can continue to attack and you
see you can see that Popeye loses and
whenever we click ok on that button what
we want to do is we want to update the
health again so for enemy attack it's
going to say that Popeyes lost and then
we'll just update Popeye health so let's
go ahead and run that and let's try to
get a zombie here so here's our zombie
and you can see that pop is lost and
when we click OK
it says his health back to 100 then we
can attack again until the zombie is
dead and you can see that we have a
little problem
if the health is equal to zero it
technically isn't out of bounds so we'll
go ahead and look at how to fix that in
the next tutorial so go ahead
I'm create these two methods if you
haven't already then once you've done
that go ahead and move on to the next
