29th tutorial and in this tutorial I'm
going to show you guys some different
ways to create an array the first way
I'm going to show you guys is how to
create an array by you basically tell it
how many things you're going to store in
it and then you store the things in it
so unlike before where you do everything
at once this is just a different way
where you can create RA so the first
thing that we need to do is create the
array and tell it how many items we're
going to store in it so I'm going to
make an array called things and of
course you set equal to new array and
instead of listing all your items in
there what you need to do is just list a
number so I'm going to say 3 this tells
our array that we're going to store 3
items in it so now what we need to do is
we need to treat each index like a
variable and assign a value but remember
we don't start it 1 then go to 2 to 3
since we're storing 3 things in it we
start with 0 and then we go to 1 and
then we go to 2 so even though we said
we're going to store three things in you
we actually never use the index of 3
just 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 in 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 that's three
things so in order to assign values to
these variables things 0 and then you
just assign a value to this like I don't
know what's one thing sirs-e sure looks
good so now what we need to do is we
need to do this two more times so just
go ahead and copy this and just like the
easy there we go
so thing 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 so we can list Jersey
Shore in all of them but let's go ahead
and let's dirty sure
Brian Regan that's one of my favorite
comedians and also as a third one
the New Boston so now what we did is
this we created the shell of the array
by basically saying Ari we're creating
an empty array called things but we're
gonna be storing three things in it so
what this does is JavaScript says
alright computer set aside some space so
when he enters the three things you can
do it just fine so believe it or not you
can actually make some code right here
and then do it later on it doesn't have
to be right after it but I just did it
right after because I mean I really
don't have anything else to code so just
like before whenever we want to access
one of our items in our array let's just
go ahead and print it out on-screen
document right you do it just like
normal um type the name of your array
and then the index just like that now
whenever you print it out check it out
the new Boston so unlike before say you
want to make array and then you want to
write some code and then you want to
assign values to those indexes this is
one alternative way you can do this and
actually later on I'm going to be
showing you on some programs where you
need do this way you don't always have
the availability to make an array and
list all your items in there right as
you create your array sometimes you have
to wait to I don't know maybe the user
needs to enter information or maybe you
need to go grab it from a database so
you can't always add all your
information in your array as soon as you
create it so that's why I needed to show
you guys this now the last um different
kind of way I guess I could say of
making an array is it's pretty much the
same as we did before but instead of
adding a number where it sets aside
space we're not going to add any number
at all and this is going to create an
empty array an array that we can add
items to dynamically or change the size
as it goes on so say we wanted to create
an array of
things that the user likes but the thing
is we don't know how many things they're
going to put so we don't know the size
of the array right now and we also can't
create an array and list all the items
right now because like I said we don't
know how many things they like we don't
know what they like so we pretty much
just need to create the shell of an
array so in order to do that here's what
you do go ahead and make a variable and
name it like stuff or something like
that
I know name array anything you want and
then of course you take new array but
since we don't know how many items are
going to be placing this array or even
what the items are just go ahead and add
empty parentheses just like that what
this does is saying alright I'm going to
create an array and I'm going to call it
stuff but I'm just going to add elements
as you tell me to add them I'm not going
to set aside for spaces and I'm not
going to add anything to it by default
I'm pretty much just creating an array
right now so later on whenever you want
to use this array it's available too so
you can actually um you know maybe do
some random coding variable x equals 9
variable tuna equals um 54 or 65-54 and
you do all your coding you need to and
then later on when you say hey I
actually need to use that array right
now here's what you do just go ahead and
take whatever index you need to store
that value in and store anything you
want in it like Baconator just like that
looks pretty good and then you can do
this as many times as you want so you're
not limited to you know four spots or
three spots or whatever you can go ahead
and add your items dynamically as you
need them so stuff 1 equals um old
pumpkins just like that so now you can
see this is a kind of a different way of
making an array like I said this pretty
much just creates an array that you can
use later on and then of course whenever
you need to actually use those indexes
you can just like we have always before
document dot right
and then just go ahead and type the name
of your a which was stuff and type the
index which was one and this should
print out old pumpkins on the screen
check it out old pumpkins pretty cool
huh so that is how you create an array
using the method of assigning space
beforehand and also creating an empty
array so now with all of our information
we know how to create an array three
different kinds of ways and you might
think alright I just use the one
whatever works for me whatever I think
is the best well sometimes you can do
this but other times when you're writing
a program you need to use one over the
other it's a lot better too so keep all
of these in mind just don't remember one
of them and think that you can forget
about the other two so anyways that's
all I have for you right now so thank
you guys for watching don't forget to
