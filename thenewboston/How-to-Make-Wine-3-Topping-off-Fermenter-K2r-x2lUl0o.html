in the bucket then what I'm gonna do
next is I'm gonna take my water and I'm
gonna start pouring it in the bucket now
what we want to do is we want to
actually guess correct
probably can't hear with it important in
there it's pretty loud but what we want
to do is we want to bring the water
level or one level up to six gallons
exactly now a lot of people think okay
you know what what I'm gonna do is I'm
only gonna make five gallons because
then it's more potent it's more
alcoholic
well actually it's very important to
follow the steps bring up to six gallons
exactly because if you don't then all
the other stuff we're going to add the
clarifier the yeast it throws the
balance off in your entire batch can be
ruined so if you guys want more potent
alcohol then go to the store buy like
some vodka or something but when you're
making wine you need to bring it up to
exactly six gallons so let me go ahead
and do that now and if you guys are
looking on the side of my bucket and you
see that it only goes up to five gallons
this bucket right here actually has a
line on the inside that I'm looking at
for six gallons so even though you guys
can't see it
I can suckles all right so we're almost
at five this might be perfect actually
all right so that six gallons exactly
right there now we just need to stir it
for a couple seconds make sure
everything's mixed together properly I
feel like a witch starting for cauldron
now the next thing that we have to do
once we're done mixing everything
together is grab your hydrometer and
stick it in your wine and some people
actually get a separate sample of wine
put it in a separate container like a
graduated cylinder and then take a
reading from there but you can actually
just stick it in your bucket it's a
whole lot easier however when you do
stick in and spin it because once you do
that there are some bubbles
whenever you stick it right in that can
stay on your hydrometer and they can
affect the reading so go ahead and spin
it and then make sure that any bubbles
that were stuck on it you know you drift
off it so basically what we're testing
for the most important thing is the
density of the wine which basically
gives us how much alcohol we're going to
end up with now the reading that we
should be looking for is specified on
your instructions so for this one it
says one point zero four eight to one
point zero five two so if you look at
the hydrometer we are in that range and
let me go ahead and zoom up and show you
all right I know it's twisting around
but hopefully you guys can see so there
is your done so these settings right
there and as you can see we are well
within the recommended range</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
