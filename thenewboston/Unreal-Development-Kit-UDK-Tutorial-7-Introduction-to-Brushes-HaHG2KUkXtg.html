tutorial and in this story I'm gonna be
talking you guys about brushes now a
brush is a way you can create very basic
shapes using the UDK I'm talking about
cubes spheres cones cylinders I'm gonna
be teaching you guys how to create very
basic shapes now before everything is
started with this story I want to
mention this I'm not gonna be going over
at the rest of the interface like I did
with the viewport options and the reason
behind that is all of these options are
pretty advanced options we are nowhere
near learning this stuff yet so instead
of you know jumping into the most
advanced stuff first and foremost and
instead of overwhelming you guys with
stuff that would just confuse you what
I'm gonna be doing instead is I'm gonna
be learning these options as we go along
it's much more natural and it'll make a
lot more sense to learn everything piece
by piece
and set it throwing everything at you
guys at once so that's why I'm not gonna
be going over this buttons a lot of them
are actually self-explanatory like save
save as cut and copy but with all this
advanced stuff up here I'm gonna be
waiting until the time is right to cover
that stuff so don't freak out don't
think you missed the video or anything
that's what I'm gonna be doing so with
that being said now is the time that I
give you guys the introduction to
brushes now these are your brushes over
here and by the way let me mention this
whoever named these things brushes they
didn't do the best job naming these they
probably should have named them shapes
or something because whenever I think of
brushes I think a Photoshop or you know
just me painting a house me wiping a
brush with paint on him all these are
are basically shapes so whenever I say
brush just think in your head shape so
the core tutorial behind how you create
a basic shape is this you go ahead and
you pick pick your shape right here and
then whenever you pick your shape you're
gonna get a red wireframe that's what
these lines are called a wireframe it's
basically an outline of your shape so if
you went ahead and you picked a
staircase that would be in the shape of
a staircase so let's go ahead and stick
with cube right here and now our red
wire frame is gonna be in the shape of
cube so you basically
your shape and then you go ahead down
here to CSG now CSG the technical term
for it is constructive solid geometry
again probably the same person name this
name brushes because it's not the best
name you can give a user it's basically
mass or a solid object so let's go ahead
down here and click CSG ad and whenever
we click that we're basically telling me
you decayed add a solid object in the
shape of this brush to our screen so go
ahead and click that and as you can see
we now have a solid object a cube pretty
cool huh
so that's the basics of how you create
simple shapes go ahead and select your
shape and click CSG ad simple enough so
now with that being said let me tell you
guys how you can move these brushes or
red white referring shapes around the
screen up here at the very top of the
UDK are your transform tools now the
select tool will start with that the
select tool goes ahead and it selects
one your shapes so if I want to select
this cube
I'm just gonna go ahead and click on the
cube now this next tool right here is
probably the tool you're gonna use most
often that's the translation mood mode
and that's how you move your basic
shapes so go ahead and click that and
you're gonna get three arrows one moves
them in the x-axis one Y and one Z so go
ahead and click and hold the green arrow
and as you can see whenever we move it
it just moves it around
it's basically your move tool that's
what I'm gonna be calling that probably
you a move tool so go ahead and I
practice moving your box around and
there you go now this next one right
here is rotation and that does exactly
like you think I don't have to explain
to you guys what rotation is it pretty
much takes your box and rotates it
however you want it
pretty cool huh and this next one right
here is a scaling mode now you have two
different scaling modes this first one
is the uniform scaling if you go ahead
and click and drag then your cube is
gonna scale uniformly and by that I mean
every axis is going to scale at the same
rate now if you want to own
stretch it in one direction then you
need to use this right here non-uniform
scaling whenever you click that you can
pull it and only stretches it or scales
it in one direction so with those let's
see how many with those five tools we
can basically get any shape cube we want
and we can rotate it and move it any
place we want so that is the basics of
how you create a basic shape and the
different transform tools that you can
use in order to customize your shape so
in the next tutorial I'm going to be
talking more about brushes and some
other native gritty details with them
but for now that's all you guys get so
thank you guys for watching don't forget
to subscribe and I'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
