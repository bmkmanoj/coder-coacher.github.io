to your 18th objective-c tutorial and in
this tutorial I'm going to be building
another program to demonstrate the
if-else the only difference between this
one and the last one is that the last
one was kind of useless a dating website
really and this one is gonna be a bit
more practical so alright how much more
time I got what 10 minutes oh my god I
thought that was gonna take a longer to
drag that out more I have to actually
teach you guys stuff oh well let's get
started
alright so what we're gonna have is a
program that takes a number from the
user and it tests if it's even or odd
since people can obviously not test this
for their self so we don't trust them so
let's go ahead and make two variables
we'll put a number that they're going to
enter and we'll put a variable for the
remainder both are integers we don't
trust them with the doubles or anything
like that yet and now I guess we can
just give them a little prompt and well
we'll have to be mean with them you know
mean but firm like that's our number
idiot and let's put an explanation point
just so they know just so they really do
it don't even think about it anyways
let's go ahead and after this what we
wanted to do is give them a chance to
input that number because if we don't
they'll be really confused and we do
this using the scanf function and go
ahead and put % I know at sign and then
go ahead and put at number so now
they're gonna enter a number and it's
gonna be stored in the variable and and
definitely needed to put and and not ads
and there we go I knew I get it
eventually
all right so whatever number they enter
is gonna be sort in the variable n so
how do we test if that number is even or
odd well what we need to do is take that
remainder variable and set it equal to n
modulus 2 so this remainder is either
gonna be for example say they entered 5
5 5 by 2 is 2 with a remainder of 1 so
then R would be equal to 1 so in this
case R would be equal to 1 say they
entered 10 10 divided by 2 is 5 with a
remainder of 0
so then R would be equal to 0 so what
would happen here is anytime they would
enter an even number R would be equal to
0 anytime they would enter an odd number
R would be equal to 1 so we can use the
if-else statement to test what R is to
determine whether the number is even or
odd
so let's go ahead and put if and as your
condition what we want to do is test if
R is equal to 0 now what you need to do
is put R equal equal 0 in now you're
saying all right why did you put two
equal signs idiot well I'm not the idiot
they are and here's why anytime you use
one equal sign what it does is it takes
a value and assigns it to a variable
anytime you use two equal signs equal
equal that means we're not going to
change any values we're just testing
whether the value is equal to the
variable so one equal sign is to assign
numbers or anything to variables it's
called the assignment operator two equal
signs is the test to see if things are
equal to one another and there's also
all these other tests less than greater
than less than or equal then and greater
than or equal to you know but for now
all we need is the equals equals so if R
is exactly equal to zero this means that
their numbers even so NS
log then they just go ahead and put your
number is even and I spell number wrong
good good good
just making sure else if it it's well I
guess we can do that else if R is equal
to one what do you want to write and
let's just go ahead and copy this
because I'm Way too lazy to type that
whole thing again yeah right I got stuff
to do and paste that and write your
number is odd so here's what's going to
happen if they enter an even number the
remainder is going to be zero in our
little test story here and it's going to
say your number is even but if they
enter odd number when you run it it's
gonna say your numbers odd so let's go
ahead and build this and we'll run it
twice
they say enter a number
idiot wow that's kind of harsh I
probably shouldn't put that I forgot I
was the one doing this um we'll do 13
press ENTER and it says your number is
odd all right let's build and run the
skin enter a number
idiot um 20 enter your number is even
Wow this program is amazing maybe I can
make some money off of this baby
game time and so one last time here's
what happened we have two variables one
to hold the user number and one
calculate the remainder we gave them a
prompt that says enter the number idiot
because we're mean but you know
sometimes they have to be mean to get
your point across
next we scan in a number from the user
and what we did is we divided that
number by 2 and figured after remainder
and we store that remainder in the
variable R now if the remainder is zero
when you divide by 2 that means your
numbers even so that's why we said if 0
your numbers even else if you know you
have any remainder at all that means
that didn't divide evenly and that means
your number is odd so that's why we made
this little else at the bottom to say
your number is odd so again either this
runs or this runs
like I said no possible way that this
statement and this statement can run no
matter what kind of computer program
you're both it's either this one or this
one but not both so I hope you guys
learn a little more about the if-else
statement and you know maybe a little
bit about math too
who knows but uh thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and we
get some free time check my blog mmm see
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
