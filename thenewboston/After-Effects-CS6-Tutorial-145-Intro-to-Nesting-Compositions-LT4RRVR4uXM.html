Blackford here with another After
Effects cs6 tutorial and today we're
gonna be talking about nesting comps now
nesting in a comp is all this is taking
a composition and putting it within
another composition and I'm talking
about this now because it kind of acts
like a alternative to parenting and you
can use that if you plan ahead and you
can apply different effects to the
parented layers all at once and you can
also add opacity and other things that
you can do while you have layers
parented so I'm gonna show you about
that stuff but I want to tell you a cool
story real quick because I haven't told
one in my past few tutorials in a little
while
no story I want to tell you about is
about wasps and since I live in New York
there is a bunch of wasps I decided to
come out and build nests on your house
and stuff like that and they're pretty
much a nuisance and I really don't like
wasp that much I've gotten stung by them
several times in my life and it really
they just really suck not like the look
not like bumblebees who like kind of
stay away from you and just go do their
own thing I'm talking about these wasps
that'll come in like try to like defend
their territory and sting you and some
of them live in the ground and some of
them don't and it really sucks so I saw
this article yesterday actually and it
made me really really not like wasps
even more so I'll bring it over and we
got a wasp ear it's probably not in my
area
I didn't read where it was but they now
have zinc tipped drill bits in there and
they in their stingers and they use it
to like drill into like
like figs and things like that and
what's gonna happen when the wife's are
on me evolve with
like metal drill bit stingers this
shit's gonna hurt
so hopefully that doesn't happen so let
me get it off of that topic because man
I just don't really like wasps probably
one of the my least favorite things in
the world
so let's well that and never mind I'm
not going to say it let's get on to the
tutorial so we're gonna you talk about
nesting instead of parenting cooked so
let me go over a parenting like really
really really quick with parenting
you're allowed to like have objects
follow another object by their position
the scale and the what was the other one
and rotation that was the other one okay
so you can have like these two objects
these two logos follow this logo over
here by its anchor point on the position
scale or rotation but what you can't do
is lower the opacity you can't add
effects that affect them all and then
you can't you can't move around like the
anchor point or anything like that
two of these ones to have get affected
by or of this one to get affected by the
other ones so what do you need to do to
if you really need to add those
different kind of things you really want
to go on to each layer and add the
effect on or going to each layer and and
personally animate the opacity and
everything like that you could do that
if you only had a couple of things or if
you want to be faster you would just add
though or turn this into a comp and just
nest everything together
so here's what I'm talking about let's
go and turn these into a comp so it can
add effects and change like the opacity
and stuff so what we're gonna do is
click on everything that we want to be
in our composition
so that's gonna be all these layers
right here that I have so let's go into
layer and we're gonna go to precompose
or you can just start out your entire
composition would just these in it and
then create another composition to put
them in so we're gonna pre compose these
into another composition and usually
what you want to keep on do is move all
attributes into the new composition and
they've got little little captions here
to tell you what's going on and this one
says use this option to place the
currently selected layers together into
a new intermediate composition so I'm
going to name it up here and we'll name
this a logo and hit OK
so now we've got all our logo all
together in one composition and we can
apply effects to this composition you
can see the composition down here in the
layers panel I have it selected so now I
can animate things such as the opacity
and the opacity of everything will get
affected and I can add effects let's add
effect let's do a fast one blur
what's ADD fast blur because that's my
go to fast one there and now
everything's gonna get blurred and if
you remember that with a parent it
doesn't work that way so with a cotton
nested comp
you can actually go into the composition
and adjust anything that you actually
need to adjust and you can add
animations and then I'll appear
correctly within the nested or within
the regular comp so that's what nesting
compositions is good for now this nested
comp is usually called a pre comp and
some people will call it an intermediary
comp but most people call a pre comp
that's why when you go into layer pre
compose it's that's what that's where
they got the name pre comp from and that
just means that it's not your final comp
that's going to be fully rendered out
you're going to have it within another
comp or nested within another
composition so uh and therefore this
introduction tutorial and then the next
couple tutorials will be about a little
bit more about what you can do with pre
comps besides just adding blurs and
changing their opacity and things like
that so thanks for watching this one and
stay up to date by subscribing and
you'll see when the next tutorials come
out about pre comping and thanks for
watching this one have a good one
