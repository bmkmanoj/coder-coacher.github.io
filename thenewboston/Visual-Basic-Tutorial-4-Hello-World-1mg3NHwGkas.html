Microsoft Visual Basic tutorial in this
tutorial we're going to actually start
programming now to start off we're going
to go ahead and click new project and
this will open up our new project window
now here I'm going to have to try to get
this into frame we're going to go ahead
and use install templates under Visual
Basic going to select a console
application now we could do windows
forms application that has a lot of code
that's already pre-made for you and this
could confuse you even more if you're a
beginner programmer and you've never
learned a language so I'm I'm just going
to go ahead and name this one VB hello
world and now I'll just go ahead and
click OK and it will start loading our
project here's our module that we've
created now you can see inside our
module it starts with module module 1
that's the name of the file and then it
starts with it and then it ends with an
end module now everything you're going
to make is going to have to start with
the type that is like a class as I class
my class it's always going to have to
end with end my class and for instance
here's our main so here's sub main and
ends with in sub and now when I said a
class my class and in my class it'd be
class my class and an end class sorry I
screwed that up a bit but it's going to
be starting in every program there has
to be what's called a main sub now what
this does is it's the first sub that
runs no matter what the program has to
have a starting point you can't just go
and create a bunch of subs and then run
it and expect it to know what to do it
won't know what to do so you have to
create a main sub now in this case it
has been created for us so let's go
ahead and start typing code inside of it
so we're going to start by typing in
console now you can see that there's a
window that pops up right here now it
has a bunch of words in here that you
may or may not know what they do now
what this is called is it's called
intellisense this is one of the most
helpful things
that is built into your IDE it looks at
what you've already written and gives
you suggestions based on that so you can
see here that the first one is console
which is what we want so we're just
going to type console dot and then we'll
do write and you can see here that it's
got right and right line we'll just
arrow down and select the right line
press tab it will automatically fill
that in for us now when we call right
line this is a sub and inside of it
inside of these parentheses right here
is what's called arguments now the
arguments for writing a line to the
console is a string now what a string is
is it's a bunch of characters put
together and they're stored inside of a
of two quotation marks so we'll just
type hello world now this is our hello
world string it is not stored as a
variable or a datatype it's just there
for the time we need it and then it's
gone now in some languages this is
called a literal string I don't know if
it's the same in Visual Basic I haven't
looked that up but I'm just going to
call it a little string a literal string
because it's the same thing so down
below that what we're going to have to
do is type console dot read line and
we'll leave empty arguments for that
because we don't have to tell it to do
anything specific now if we come up here
you can see the start debugging err
arrow what this does is it runs our
program and in debugging mode which will
show us the errors down the error list
so you can click this or you can just
press f5 and you can see that it starts
up a console window or a CMD window if
that's true that's what you want to call
it and it says hello world and you can
see that it stopped right here because
it's stopping to let us read the line
that's why we called console dot
readline now if we take out this line of
code and run it you'll see the window is
going to pop up and disappear really
fast
here I'll do that one more time so in
order for us to be able to see what's
actually going on before closes we're
going to have to do console dot read
line we run this and you can see it says
hello world so congratulations guys
you've successfully created your first
hello world program and stay tuned for
the next tutorial
