another cool Adobe Illustrator cs6
miniseries here we're gonna start
working with graphics in Illustrator and
you can do things like we're gonna learn
things like how to trace the graphics to
create and to create a vector yourself
and that way you can manipulate that
yourself and move points around and
everything and we're gonna learn how to
fix appearance attributes edit graphic
styles and among other things in this
little series so stay tuned and keep
checking out the videos that are coming
up for the graphic series so let's start
out with going over the types of
documents you're able to open up our
graphic documents here will open up in
Illustrator so you can open some Tiff's
JPEGs gifs pngs
there's a lot that you can and for me to
just name everything off it's kind of a
long a long list so you can just take a
look at this list and either pause the
video or just go to the website up here
if you want to it's on Adobe's website
here and this is just a list of the file
formats supported for opening and
placing both which our forum our ways to
open or start working on a graphic in
Illustrator so let's get started on the
basics of how you're supposed to work on
graphics so the first thing you need to
do is open a graphic so there are two
ways to do that you can either open or
place so go to file - open this one go
file open and then you can check out
your different graphics that you have
and pick pick one out and then I can hit
open and this is already open so it's
let me know that so I'm just gonna hit
yes and and now it's open again so I've
got two two of them open and they're
basically the same thing now you can
switch between multiple open graphics by
clicking on these tabs and I've got two
of the same
so you can't tell them switching but you
can see that feeling that this one has a
different canvas and the other ones to
work on you can open up multiple
graphics at the same time to create
multiple tabs so if I go to a file open
and I just click on these couple ones
and I hit shift I hold down shift select
these or I can pick ctrl hold down sorry
about that
hold down ctrl to select what to select
objects here that aren't contiguous I'll
hit open and some of them couldn't open
and then the rest could so maybe one of
them was in a file format that
illustrator supported but now we've got
all these opened up and we're good to go
so there's you can see multiple tabs
that you can click through the next one
you want to do it is placing an object
so I'm gonna make a new canvas here and
I'm gonna hit OK and the way you can
just put an object right here without
opening it up onto your original canvas
is file and then go to place and then go
ahead and pick the what you want to use
so let's try this one and that's pretty
big and I'm able to adjust it and that's
a good thing with place it already comes
up with the free transform on there so
you can adjust how big you want it to be
and if I just click off it's there you
see it's very easy now there's a couple
options when you're placing so if I go
to file place and we look down here on
the left we've got a couple options and
I'll let you know what those are so link
here
is it places a screen version of the
graphic and links the document to the
graphic file so it pretty much saves
some space the next one is template and
what you can do with that is it places a
dimmed version of the graphic on the
template layer and that's for tracing so
if you want to go through a trace and
then the last one is replaced and that
if you have an image
affected already and you click on that
it'll replace the image that you have
selected with the image that you
selected in here so if I clicked on this
at the file place and then I picked this
one maybe and I hit replace I don't need
to link it but if I had replace in it
place its yep it changes it out so
that's what replays does so that's about
all I want to go over with you on how to
open up and place your graphics and it's
basically just the starting point from
which we're gonna start out in the next
one I'm gonna in the next tutorial I'm
gonna show you guys how to trace raster
graphics and we'll learn all about that
and doing that can save you a lot of
time in having to create your own images
and stuff like that so thanks a lot for
watching give a thumbs up if you liked
and be sure to subscribe to get more
notifications on when the new videos
come out so thanks a lot everyone have a
good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
