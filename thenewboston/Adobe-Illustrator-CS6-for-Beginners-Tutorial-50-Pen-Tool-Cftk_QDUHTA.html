illustration cs6 tutorial and and this
one we're gonna learn how to draw with
the pen tool and the other tools that
come with the pen tool so over here on
the left is the pen tool and the hotkey
is P and it looks like a ballpoint or I
like some kind of old-school style pen
the tip of it at least and something to
help you out would be to make sure you
don't have any fill on and go ahead and
put down a stroke and you can leave your
stroke at 1 or 2 or something like that
it doesn't matter so the first thing
you're gonna do is go ahead and click
and what you've done is you've created
an anchor point now with a with the pen
tool what you're doing is you're
creating paths and the paths consist of
curved or straight segments it's
connected by anchor points so if I click
again I'm going to create a second
anchor point and what I've done is I
created anchor point and another anchor
point here and the path connects those
now if I need to want to create like a
polygon or a triangle all I need to do
is continue to make another anchor point
and then click the last anchor point
that I had or clicked on the first
anchor point that I had at me and that
will close it up now this is called a
closed path when you end at the first
anchor point that you created
that's called a closed path now if I
created another path here and maybe I
only used three anchor points or two
anchor points and left it like this this
would be called an open path if you
control hold down control and click it's
going to deselect and just leave it as
an open path and that way you won't be
creating another path from another path
from your last use anchor point so those
are how you create the straight segments
and they always come at certain degree
angles here they're not curved at all
there's there
sharp edges so I'm going to show you how
to create a curve the line I'll start it
down here first you're gonna click and
you're gonna drag and you can see that
these handles are coming up and you can
either use the smart guides to give
yourself an idea of your angles there
click drag and let go and that creates
your first Anchor Point come to your
second Anchor Point create click drag it
and then you'll get a curved so if you
keep on dragging in the same way that
you did before you're gonna get an
s-curve if you drag the opposite way
you're going just going to get a regular
curve and I let go and you can see
though that I have a curved line you can
continue to draw more points and
continue your actual curves and then if
you want to you can close there you go
and now you create a closed curved path
now what are you working with these
curved paths sometimes it's hard to get
exactly what you wanted the first time
around the way you're going to be able
to edit paths and anchor points is by
using the direct selection tool which is
the white one here and the high key is a
this way you can actually click on
anchor points and maneuver the handles
so that you get some type of path that
better fits what you were trying to make
you can move the handles and you can
also move the anchor point itself and
maneuver these into some type of path
that it's gonna work a little bit better
for you oops I clicked the wrong part
there we go I'll just move this and I'll
try to get them like on top of each
other or something like that and I'll
try to make some kind of like infinity
sign
and I'm getting close to doing it not
perfect but if I just move over these a
little more into and have a little more
patience and make this I could make an
infinity sign that looks pretty cool so
that's how you manipulate the points I'm
going to show you some more things if
you go to the pen tool and click and
hold we've got a couple extra tools that
we have add Anchor Point tool and delete
Anchor Point tool let's go to the add
Anchor Point tool and we'll work on this
path here that we made you could work on
any of the paths that you make but we'll
just work on this one if you go ahead
and click on the path when you have the
add Anchor Point tool it's going to add
another anchor point now you can move
that again with the selection tool to
create new paths or to create new shapes
or adjust and edit your shape the delete
Anchor Point tool is going to do
obviously what it says it's going to
delete anchor points that you click on
if you click on something that's not an
anchor point this is going to come up
because you got to click on an anchor
point to use it if we go to the regular
pen tool again you can already see that
when you hover over top of your path the
it changes to a plus sign and this
automatically converts it to the add
Anchor Point tool and I have added it
and then if I hold hover over top of it
it turns into the delete Anchor Point
tool and I have deleted that actual
income Anchor Point and there we go so
you don't always have to switch between
it but that's up to you if you don't
want to mess around and create things
that they're creating coins by accident
and stuff like that and you want to just
go around deleting you might want to
change this to the bility Anchor Point
tool depends on what you're doing in
your project the last thing I wanted to
show you for this tutorial is the
convert Anchor Point tool which is the
last one underneath the pen tools and
what this does is it converts the anchor
points from curved
two straight or from straight two curved
so if you have a straight one like I do
here on this point here I'm gonna click
and I'm gonna drag and I'm able to
create a curve the line if I click on it
after it's curved and I just click it's
gonna change it back to a straight well
I could try it down here on this path
let's find an anchor points here there's
one I just click on this it's going to
become straight and there we go now
we've got now we have a couple of
straight line or straight points on the
anchor or straight anchor points so
that's it for this tutorial
and I'll get a little bit more in depth
with the with the pen tool in the next
tutorial you can go over some options
and customizing how it looks and
everything like that so stay tuned for
that tutorial we're and you'll learn how
to gain more control over your pen tool
and set it up to your liking after that
I guess just have a great day see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
