tutorial and before I start showing you
guys the Ruby code I want to talk to you
guys a little bit about computer
programs in general so just remember
that computers can't understand English
computers can only understand simple
instructions now in Ruby programming we
call these instructions commands so
basically whenever we write a ruby
program it's going to be made up of a
bunch of little commands in each command
is going to be on a separate line so
just remember that we can tell the
computer what to do by writing a bunch
of little commands or instructions and
whenever we put bunch of these commands
together we turn into basically a
computer program that's all a computer
program is a bunch of little commands
pretty much put together simple enough
so let me go ahead and show you guys a
very simple command we already looked at
one in the last tutorial which was like
seven plus four or something like that
but let me show you guys a command just
so I can talk you guys through so I know
you guys don't know what any of this
stuff means yet but let's just go ahead
and type something real quick um mmm
bacon just like that and and so
basically what I wrote is this seven
times do print mmm bacon end okay sounds
kind of weird well this is a sample or
an example rather of a very simple Ruby
command even though we can't understand
it it's a command that Ruby can
understand well excuse me got some
phlegm in my throat
so basically our language is different
than Ruby's language and it's my job I
guess to teach you Ruby's language so
another thing that I want to point out
before we continue along is let's take a
look at the interactive Ruby environment
this IRB just stands for interactive
Ruby and it's basically just the program
don't mind this main for right now I'll
talk about that later on
now the 0:01 is just the line number the
very first command me write is going to
be zero zero one the next one is going
to be on line zero zero two if we were
to write something else
such is I know you guys don't know this
command either but um like this one it
would be on 0-0 - the next one would be
on zero zero three so on and so forth
now after this you see an additional
number which is zero zero zero this
number is the depth and I'm going to
talk about the depth later on when we
begin talking about classes and stuff
like that but for now on just
concentrate concentrate on the line
number one two three
each command you write is on a separate
line now while I'm talking about the
interactive Ruby environment I guess I
might as well mention this because I
know a lot of you guys are like wow this
is pretty much the most boring looking
program ever if you want to change the
colors of this text then go ahead and
right-click it and choose properties and
if you go to font you can go ahead and
change the size of it colors you can go
ahead and change the text color and I'll
probably change these from tutorial 4 to
tutorial depending on you know whatever
mood I'm feeling but you can go ahead
and change all the colors here so now
with that being said like I said my job
is to teach you the basic commands
basically I want to teach you the
language that Ruby understands now
probably the most basic command and the
easiest to understand is just a print
statement go ahead and write print now
in between double quotation marks go
ahead and write anything like hello
armed people of YouTube now go ahead and
hit the enter button and whenever you
hit enter it basically takes what's ever
in between those quotation marks and it
prints it out on the screen in this case
hello people of YouTube now what nil
means is you say okay it printed that
out
good job Ruby but it also has this
little equals in arrow sign and it has
nil what the heck is this well don't
worry about the equals arrows right now
I'll be talking about that later on but
now I'll explain this Nell pretty much
means nothing Nell and il equals nothing
so why does it say hello people of
YouTube nothing that doesn't make sense
basically it says no because you have
nothing or no airs you didn't mess up at
all pretty much all your code was typed
perfectly like Ruby expected if you do
type a command or something that Ruby
doesn't understand for example just go
ahead and slam your fingers across
keyboard and type something random now
if we hit enter Ruby's not going to
understand this command it doesn't make
sense it doesn't even make sense to us
so go ahead and hit enter and we see
that we get an error message name error
undefined local variable so that's
difference between a successful command
and an error
whenever you have a successful command
for example this print command is just
going to go ahead and run that command
and return nil and whenever you have an
error or something it doesn't understand
an error typically looks like this it
says what type of error it is and then
it gives you some information about it
so basically that's the difference
between a successful command a very
simple basic command and an error so I
just want to tell you guys that give you
guys a little history of computer
programs what they're made up of
basically I showed you guys a simple
print statement such as print hello
people of YouTube that's a very basic
command but there are a ton of other
commands that we need to know for the
Ruby programming language and again if
you ever have an error you're going to
see something like this right here
so anyways in the next story I'm going
to be talking about how to do some
simple math with Ruby as well as
teaching guys about something called
variables and it's going to be amazingly
exciting so anyways thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and I'll
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
