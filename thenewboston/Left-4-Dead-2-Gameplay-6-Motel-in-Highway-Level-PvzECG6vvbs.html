welcome to my 60 left 4 dead video and
this is the part of the highway where
you go through the motel and for some
reason my teammates are going over on
the other side except following me so
this should be a good start so make sure
not to start that which if you can let
me just um I did anyway so that's good
and uh let me just get oh oh yeah
teammates you can just say take your
time over there I'm fine over here
knocking come over anything so let's
take your time I'm
right here so please shoot the switch 80
times oh and now you decide to come oh
you brought a bunch of zombies really
cool well I got best teammates ever so
anyways uh kill these zombies right here
and shoot your teammate if you have to
because they're totally worthless at
this point and once you're done with
that we're going to need to go upstairs
they'll make sure you kill all these
people now that i have like amounts of
health rose so let me go ahead and
reload and I better keep watching my
bullets in my shotgun and grab that pipe
bomb after yep I figure someone will
heal me now that I'm almost dead go
ahead and grab this pipe bomb because
we're definitely going to need a later
on so grab it and now once you grab that
you're going to need to go up the stairs
and this is how you get to the other
side of the motel or hotel I don't know
if this is a motel or hotel I don't
really know difference I think a motel
only has one for I'm not sure someone
not let me come in tell me I'm
interesting note so kill that guy real
quick and what you have to do is
actually get across there and you do
this by going through the door to the
right and you'll eventually do this
after you have to take care of these
double banger rapid come on out let's
get on my way so go ahead and open this
door and kill this person to your right
and now you can see that you go through
here and where the heck did you come
from hiding behind the door and go
through here and now once you kill these
people what does the propane tank in
there oh no blazer site so go ahead and
grab laser sight for a gun laser say on
a shotgun hmm odd but hey I'll take it
and jump out this window and now you can
start go ahead and I was going to say
pick up these
great explode that in my face so now
this is going to attract the ton people
so I was gonna save my Python but it
might as well just throw it out here so
I don't get absolutely destroyed so
throughout your pipe on so you don't get
pummeled and that'll kill those people
and now hopin these people over fence
you're basically out of the motel right
now so now that you got through the
motel arm again you can go down the
stairs but I decide to get a rumor
explode on me instead as I saying once
you're at the motel what you have to do
is go around back to a hill and I'll
show you guys in next video how to
navigate through so thanks for watching
don't forget subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
