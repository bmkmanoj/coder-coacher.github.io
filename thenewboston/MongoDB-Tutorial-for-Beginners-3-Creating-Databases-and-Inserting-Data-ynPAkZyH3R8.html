really basic commands that you're going
to use all the time the first one is how
to create a new database so by default
whenever we set everything up we were
given one database called local now if
you guys don't even know what a database
is whenever you create a new project or
a new website each website that you
create your wanting you're going to want
to create a new database for it it's
pretty much the main container for
everything for all of the data that's
going to be on your website you're going
to want to throw into this database now
technically a database is made up of
different collections now a collection
is just groups of similar data so let's
say that you're making a social network
all of the users basic information is
going to go into one collection all of
their let's say posts are going to go
into another collection anytime you want
to have a group of similar data you make
a new collection and each item in that
collection is called the document but
I'll actually show you guys a couple
examples I think will be a little bit
easier to understand so um let's just in
this tutorial pretend that we're going
to make a website about hockey hockey
players stats a bunch of hockey related
information we'll call it hockey comm
like that's not taken already alright so
the first thing we want to do is we want
to type use hockey because remember the
database we're using right now is just
local and that's just the default one so
we obviously want to make a new one
called hockey now you can run this by
either hitting this green button or hold
down ctrl and hit enter and we now
switch the DB hockey so we're now using
the hockey database so what this use
command does is it pretty much looks and
says alright do you have a database I
already called hockey if you do I'm just
going to switch that if you don't then
I'm going to create it for you and
switch to it so this isn't only
switching to a database it's also the
same arm command to create a database as
well it's actually pretty handy so if
you ever just want to check what
database you're currently using then you
just type dB
haki obviously no surprise there if you
ever want to delete a database then you
can just use DB which gets the current
DB of Paki
and you can Co drop database and that's
going to delete the current database of
hockey and it says okay however I
actually want to create and use that so
I'm just going to type use hockey again
and I'm also going to clear this out a
lot whenever I have a bunch of info so
if you just right-click it and hit clear
all it keeps all of the settings so for
example we're still still using hockey
it just you know pretty much just wipes
your slate clean so now we have a
database code hockey let's go ahead and
insert some information into it and I'll
show you guys some cool things before
this tutorial what I did is I just made
a bunch of sample um JSON data so if you
go to my source code from tutorials on
my github page and by the way if you
have your own data that you want to use
it's fine um you know it's kind of not
going to make a big difference but if
you want to use mine follow along go to
my source code from tutorials scroll
down to this other sample JSON data and
I just have this real quick penguins
players which is just a bunch of
information about armed players for my
favorite team Pittsburgh Penguins what
position they play a random ID number
that I got on their way hi birthplace
age their name and has birthdate and
their number that's on their Jersey and
if you want to use this one Fink big
data then say that you were making a
website for a bank this is just I'm not
like thirty five customers or something
with a fake balance in their name and
all that good stuff and by the way I
have to show you this because I can't
keep it a secret any longer
if you ever just want to generate a
bunch of random data and don't want to
use any of mine then go to this website
jason generator and what you do is you
pretty much type in all of the fake
information that you want
you just hit generate and it just makes
a bunch of fake info from you and you
can put it in any format that you want
and actually that is how I got all this
fake Bank data right here so this is
just you know randomly generated users
this however is actually real
information of people so there you go
all right now what was I going to do oh
yeah so let's say that we wanted to
pretty much take this data and use it in
our website so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to go and grab one of these
dudes at the top
this guy is Craig Adams he is uh I don't
know not that great but he has a lot of
heart so let's go ahead and add him
don't figure out how to do that so in
our database which is hockey remember
any time we need to insert a new Doc's
document or a new piece of information
it needs to go in a collection so a
collection like I said is just a group
of data what is this data about well
this is all just player data data about
the infirm individual players so I'm
going to name this collection players
and then after this use a command called
insert now if you guys are like you know
what you're trying to insert information
into players but you don't even have the
players collection yet well what this is
going to do whenever we insert it is
just like before it's going to look for
a collection called players if it
doesn't exist it's just going to create
it for you on the fly so inside here you
just throw in any object which is Craig
Adams and I'm just going to go ahead and
run this and there you go so it says I
now have one collection called players
and it has one document in that document
is this right there and just for fun
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
insert one more and who is this Beau
Bennett he's a pretty young all right so
if I want to insert one more player into
the collection players this is what I do
DB players insert another player beau
Bennett all right so we now have two
players inserted into our collection
players all right what if we want to
actually add a bunch of these guys at
once because if I have to go through one
by one and copy all these that's going
to take a while well check this out
let's just say that we want to grab all
of these guys right there we can
actually grab the whole file but I'm
going to be doing a few things later so
what we can do is this if we go to DB
players insert we can actually insert an
array by using these little square
brackets right here now inside this
array we can just throw in a huge list
of players and remember separate them
with a comma and after your last one
since you don't have any after that you
don't use the comma so now if we go
ahead and run this it's going to say
inserted seven apparently I grab seven
new people so we have those seven that I
just inserted and two before it so we
should have a total of nine so actually
let me go ahead and clear this and I'll
show you guys some stuff so if we just
want to take a step back and actually
see what's going on what we did the
first command that we can use is show
collections and if we run this it says
we now have the player's collection
which was that group of data that we
inserted everything into and this system
that indexes this is just one that was
given to us by default it has to deal
with behind the scenes stuff not really
really worried about it right now
so now inside this collection let's say
we wanted to look at all the documents
in other words all the players that we
inserted so we're going to DB which is
hockey players which is that collection
and we can just call the command fine
so hit this and it's going to find
all of the players or documents that you
inserted now alright it gives it to you
in a nice long string it's kind of all
jumbled together if you ever want to
make this a little bit prettier or
formatted you can just go find by the
way I'll mention that anytime you want
to just say you want to call this
command again but you're too lazy to
type it out in your command prompt you
just press the up arrow and it's going
to get the last command so you can
actually press up cycle through the last
couple ones but remember find just takes
all the documents in the collection and
displays it now we want to display a
little bit prettier so the command for
that is actually pretty I'm not making
this up hit enter and we now get all of
the nice pretty formatted documents in
our collection so there you go now one
other thing before I let you guys go is
if you have several documents like we do
I think we have what do we have like
nine or eleven players seven I don't I
can't remember how many but we have a
bunch if we ever just want to get one
and view it then we call DB players so
database collection and find one which
essentially means find one document so
it finds the first one remember we
inserted Craig Adams at first so I know
I gave you guys a lot of information in
this tutorial but just remember you have
a database and inside it you have
collections and inside your collections
you have documents in other words the
individual players in this example and
if you guys like I said don't quite get
to hang a bit then watch like three more
tutorials and you guys will be fluent in
MongoDB but for now ten guys for
watching don't forget subscribe I'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
