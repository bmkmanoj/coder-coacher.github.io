your 16th intermediate job tutorial and
in this tutorial we're going to be going
over sets now what a set is is it's a
collection but the thing is is it cannot
contain any duplicate items so say you
have a list or something and you have
the word Bucky
twice in it what a set was a set
wouldn't allow this and we're going to
be using using something called a hash
set so it takes a collection such as a
list and if it finds a duplicate item in
it it's going to remove it for you and
then return the new and enhanced
collection so let's go ahead and get
down to it and the first thing we want
to build in is pretty much any array of
strings but make sure you have at least
one or you can even have more than one
to two items in it so go ahead and make
it string I'm going to name my things
and set it equal to something like um
Apple Bob ham and then go ahead and
duplicate an item go ahead and put Bob
again and for last one I'll put bacon
because I'm hungry and after this what
we want to do is convert this array to a
list so go ahead and put list that we're
going to be storing string that in it
I'm going to name my list and put arrays
as lists and pass in the parameter
whatever you call your array and I
called my things there we go
so now what it does is it takes this
array and we can treat it as a
collection list now so let's go ahead
and just print this out right now so you
can see the original whenever we change
it so system.out.print f and go ahead
and print out the entire collection
right here by passing in a string
variable and then go ahead and put lists
as your second parameter and let's go
ahead and print a blank line after this
so system.out.print line so this way
let's go ahead and run this first before
I continue you now see that we output
our list Apple Bob ham Bob which is this
is a twice um
second instance of this element and then
bacon at the end so let's go ahead and
get to the heart of this tutorial and
that is using a special set called hash
set to remove any duplicate items from
that original list so all we have to do
is we need a set unlike a string it's a
different form of collection and we're
going to be using string data in this as
well so name anything you want I'll name
it set and set it equal to new hash set
in of course we're going casting string
and as its constructor what it takes is
the list that you want to turn into a
set so let's go ahead and I named mine
list so this is going to do in its
constructor when it's creating this set
object this is going to take a list it's
going to see that it's a list and it's
going to remove any duplicate items
which is in this case only the second
Bob right here so now that we did that
let's go ahead and put system.out.print
F and let's go ahead and unlike before
when we print out the list we want to
print out the new set so we can compare
it to so as our format let's go ahead
and brown string in and also set right
there so what this is going to do this
program is first it's going to print out
well let me run it and then I'll give
you guys an overview one last time on
what we did so here is our list right
here Apple Bob ham Bob bacon and what it
did when it created the hash set is it
removed the second instance of Bob so
this had five elements in it and now you
see it only has four with four original
unique elements in it so what we did one
last time is we created an array called
things and then we created I mean excuse
me we converted that array to a list and
then we printed out that list which was
pretty much is a basic list and then we
said all right you know we want that
list but we don't want any duplicate
items in it so what we did is we pass a
list in as a hash set object and
whenever we created that hash set
it took all the duplicate items out and
just printed it out as a normal set so
this is how you print out any set right
there with print format and that's that
simple enough so thank you guys for
watching in this tutorial in the next
tutorial we're probably going to be
going another over another data
structure and I promise you guys we're
going to be going over applets soon so
for now that's all the time I have so
thank you for watching subscribe and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
