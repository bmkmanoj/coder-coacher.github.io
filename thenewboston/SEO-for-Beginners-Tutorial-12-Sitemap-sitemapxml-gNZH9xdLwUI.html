video we're going to continue on with
the next google webmaster guideline and
that is a sitemap so every single
website you make should have a sitemap
all right so what the heck is a sitemap
a sitemap is essentially an XML file
that all it does is it lists every
single web page that you want crawled so
why would you do this I mean Google
already does a pretty good job of just
using their spider and finding all the
pages on your website already well let's
say that you I don't know let's say that
you have some web page that isn't linked
or connected to anything else well
Googlebot is going to have a really hard
time finding that so instead you can
just add it to your sitemap and you can
actually do some other cool stuff with a
sitemap and that is list the importance
of each web page so this is my home page
right here we already know that that is
really important page for my website
this search page it doesn't really get
used that lot I mean it's not that
important so you can pretty much give
these numerical values of priority or
importance so on a scale of 0 to 1 this
might be a 1 and this might be like 0.7
or something so let's just go ahead and
whenever you make it all you do is you
right-click new file and just like your
robot that text file
you name it sitemap dot xml all right so
how do we format this do we just start
writing anything we feel like there's
actually a specific protocol that you
follow and if you go to sitemaps org is
basically going to give you a template
of everything that you need so I'll just
talk you guys through it so the first
one is just a declaration of hey this is
an XML file we're using these type of
you know normal English readable
characters and essentially it's made up
of a bunch of these so didn't mean to
click that so every single web page is
going to be referenced by URL tags now
inside here you're going to have of
course location which is essentially
just a link to whatever webpage a
modified date
and this helps tell Google how often or
when this page was last modified so if
it's trying to index that page again
it's like hey nothing changed on here so
you really don't need to you know update
your search engine or anything like that
change frequency what this is is
essentially a way to tell Google hey
check back here monthly or weekly if you
just make a website and it's going to be
the same for the rest of your life you
might want to put like yearly but let's
say that you have a home page and it
changes every single day well then you
might want to put daily now priority
this is what I was talking about it's
basically the order of importance so let
me see if they have another example down
here all right
so for example this webpage um what is
this a catalog for vacation items or
something that is it really important so
they give this a priority of 0.3
something like your homepage however
their homepage has a priority of 0.8 so
very important the homepage and again we
just talked about that so there you go
and I know you guys are thinking now all
right there is no freaking way in the
universe that even if this thing is
important for Google I'm not going to
make an XML file and go to every single
web page on my website and type all
these in I mean that's going to take
like eight years luckily there are a
bunch of automated tools where you can
do this a couple of my few favorite
sitemap generators are this one com XML
- sitemaps com and again these are both
paid but this one right here it gives
you a free sitemap for up to 500 pages
so if you guys have a small site um it's
awesome so this is one that you can use
and the one that I actually use is this
right here it's called screaming frog
this is actually a product that I had to
buy um I think it was like 99 bucks a
year but it is awesome and essentially
I'll show you guys a real quick demo and
again if you guys know of any like
really awesome free ones then let me
know what I think would actually be
awesome is if someone made an
open-source one like in Python just
using like the command line or something
and I tried to look for one on github
but they really weren't that great but
if anyone like wants to make one that
would be freaking awesome and I'll
promote the crap out of it alright so
anyways for here you basically just
paste in your home page press Start and
it's going to start crawling all of the
links so again a lot faster than doing
it by hand and whenever you're done just
press stop and you go to site map create
XML sitemap so there you go so again I'm
sure they're like a million online if
you want to do pie hand uh you know feel
free but I wouldn't recommend it so use
a sitemap generator and you can also you
know whenever you're making these lists
the priority and stuff like that so
there we go
now we know what a sitemap is now we
know why Google recommends it and why
you can use it and why it's useful all
that fun stuff so I have nothing else to
say so I will see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
