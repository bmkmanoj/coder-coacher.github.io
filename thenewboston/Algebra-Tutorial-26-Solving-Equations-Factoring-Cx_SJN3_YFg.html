equations using factoring so to solve an
equation by factoring you have to have
an expression set equal to zero you
can't factor it until you set it equal
to zero otherwise it'll give you the
wrong answer so then the next step is to
factor out your expression now for this
particular one it's a trinomial so we're
going to have to factor it out and
there'll be two quantities that will
multiply to give us this so this will be
an X and this will be an X now we ask
ourselves what two numbers will multiply
to get positive 12 and add to get
negative 7 so two and 64 and three
twelve and one so four and three are
going to want or what's going to add to
give us negative 7 so it means negative
4 and negative 3 which if you if you add
those together they'll give you negative
7 and if you remember when you multiply
a negative by another negative you're
going to get a positive so this is still
equal to zero so then we take each one
of these factors and set it equal to
zero now we do this because if you
remember whenever you multiply a number
by zero it's going to give you zero so
this equation is going to equal zero
whenever one of these two factors equal
zero they can both equal zero or just
one of them can equal zero two ways that
a is equal to 0 and
we add forwardable to both sides of this
equation and we add 3 to both sides of
this equation so x is equal to 4 and x
is equal to 3 that's the solution for
this equation up here so this time we're
going to do a different kind of
factoring so we can pull out a V from
both of these and we get B squared minus
4 equals 0 and then since this is a
difference of squares this becomes V
minus 2 and V plus 2 equals 0 and then
you have to set each one of these
factors equal to 0 and recounts as a
factor because if V equals 0 then this
whole thing is going to equal zero so V
equals 0 V minus 2 equals 0 B plus 2
equals 0 that's already solved for you
if we add 2 to both sides we get V is
equal to to subtract two from both sides
so we get B is equal to negative 2 so
this and most of the time you are going
to have more than one solution to your
problem ok so again since it's a
trinomial we're going to have two
expressions now if you think about it
the only two numbers that are going to
multiply they get well there are four
numbers two and three and six and one
and in this case they will only one of
them will be able to give you a negative
six as well as a negative 5 which is
going to be six and one because if you
take
negative six with a positive one you'll
get x squared plus X minus 6x minus 6
which is going to give you x squared
minus 5x minus 6 equals 0 ok now this
work was just a check of those factors
really do multiply to give me this so
then I said each one of these equal to
zero I add the six over and get x equals
6 and x equals negative 1 now we're
going to do two more examples ok so
remember the first thing I said is you
have to have an expression that equals
zero so in order to set this equal to
zero we have to subtract this 10 / so
this becomes x squared minus 10x plus 9
equals 0 now if you think about it the
only thing that's gonna multiply to get
9 and add to get negative 10 is going to
be nine and one since it has to be
negative that means both of these have
to be negative minus and a negative
times a negative is going to give you a
positive and if you check that you'd
find out that you get x squared minus X
minus 9x minus or plus line so then we
set each one of these factors X minus 9
equal to 0 x equals nine and x equals 1
we have to move this annex over we can
factor in X out and we get will get X
minus 8 equals 0 set both factors equal
to 0 add 8 to both sides you get x
equals 8 and x equals 0 so that's all
we're going to do with solving equations
today but if but make sure you come back
and watch your next lesson where we're
going to talk about solving word
problems using factoring</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
