need to make a video today because I
have some excellent news so I got back
from work today and I checked my email
and inside my email was a message from
Alex from PHP academy' now alex from PHP
academy' was the one who was making 200
brand-new jQuery tutorials for the in
Boston so anyways I read his email and
he told me that the 200 jQuery tutorials
are finally complete so I went and I
downloaded them and I have them now and
I went and looked through them real
quick of course I didn't have time to
watch them all because of course it's
200 toriel's but there are tutorials on
everything jQuery you could ever want
and I'm talking about selectors event
handling let's see effects plugins
he even builds a bunch of like sample
jQuery applications so you can walk
through and trust me guys if you don't
know what jQuery is then watch these
tutorials and they're gonna take you
from absolute beginner to incredible
advanced jQuery pro so if you're
unfamiliar with Alex form PHP academy'
he owns a youtube channel called PHP
academy' and it's dedicated to some of
the best PHP tutorials on the web and he
worked with the New Boston before making
a PHP series and he makes some of the
most in-depth most excellent he covers
topics like you want to believe in
they're some of the most highest quality
tutorials on the web and of course they
are all entirely free so if you aren't
already subscribed to his YouTube
channel PHP academy' I am begging you
guys please go and subscribe now because
he has helped out the New Boston like
you guys would not believe above and
beyond anything I could ever expect so
Alex thank you so much for me in the new
Boston community it means so much to me
so like I said go and subscribe to PHP
academy' and also he has a website PHP
academy' org and you can check it out
all his videos are you know nice in
order you know sometimes it's easier to
see him in a list rather than searching
them on YouTube so go check out his
website PHP academy' org he has a forum
like I said all the videos are in the
list so that's basically all I wanted
say so I don't know how long it's gonna
take me to upload 200 swirls depends on
you know how fast my internet feels like
being today but I'm gonna try to upload
them starting tonight and like I said I
don't know how long it's gonna take me
maybe two three days that's my best
guess right now but trust me these two
hundred jQuery tutorials are coming so
you guys have that to look forward to so
like I said Alex from PHP academy' thank
you so much you have no idea how much
you have helped in new boston and for
everyone else go and subscribe to PHP
academy' it would mean so much to me so
