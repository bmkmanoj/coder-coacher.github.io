second MySQL tutorial and in this lesson
we're going to be talking about my SQL
servers no more slide shows it's time to
get our hands dirty and start doing some
stuff on the computer so like I said the
very first thing that you need in order
to start practicing MySQL is a my SQL
Server what this is is a server with
MySQL installed on it so if you're
learning this because maybe your boss
said hey you need to learn MySQL or
maybe your work in your taking a class
on databases
then 99% of the time they already have a
server with everything set up ready to
go the only thing that you need to know
how to do is log in and they're going to
give you the login information however
if you're just learning this at home
because I don't know maybe you just want
to learn about MySQL or learn how to
make awesome websites then you also need
access to a MySQL server now it isn't
like you can just go look under your bed
and find one laying around it's not like
a shoelace you probably need to go
Google web hosting companies basically
you need to find somewhere where you can
access a server and install MySQL on it
now like I said you can either Google
server space and buy an account then
install it or what you can do is you can
just look for companies that offer MySQL
already installed on the server and it's
not like this is an uncommon thing where
you guys are going to have to search for
hours 90% of the companies already offer
servers with MySQL installed on it
that's how common this is the only thing
that you need to know how to do is
basically you're going to just need to
create an account log in and you're
going to be ready to go everything is
going to be set up now the company I
recommend if you guys don't have access
to a server already and you need one I'm
going to recommend going through
Hostgator comm and I don't say this
because they pay me or anything although
I kind of wish they did but this is an
awesome company and they have all the
tools awesome support and I just love
them I actually been with them for a
long time but I want to mention this if
you guys can find a free one then I
highly encourage that and if
anyone can actually find a free one then
go ahead and leave a comment below don't
keep the secrets to yourself like I said
I'm always encouraging free schooling
and education especially when it comes
to software so like I said leave a
comment below or on my forum and I'm
sure they're free ones out there so
anyways once you have a server set up
whether it's through your school or work
or you have to buy one online then what
the heck do you do where are you
supposed to start typing this SQL code
well there are a couple of different
places you can start practicing SQL
MySQL now I want to mention this before
you guys you know get disappointed if
you are doing this through school then
your teacher is probably going to make
you use some command my prompt that
looks like this
let me actually go type in the wrong
thing there CMD they're going to make
you use a command prompt that looks like
this it kind of looks like you're
programming the matrix or something I
don't know why they do this it's just
torturing you guys but anyways
whenever I was in college that's what
they made me do now I'm going to be
using a different tool that's a little
bit prettier why well first of all
because I'm not 60 years old and I don't
want to use a tool that looks like this
but I want to mention that no matter
what tool you use you're going to be
able to follow along with these
tutorials just fine so don't think just
because I'm using a different tool then
you're not going to understand what's
going on the core language is basically
the same no matter what tool you use and
for those of you who are wondering what
tool I'm going to use it's called
phpMyAdmin whenever you log into your
account it's going to be right there so
anyways that's what tool I'm going to be
using and like I said no matter how you
log into your account no matter where
you get your server from no matter what
tool you use you're going to be able to
follow along with my tutorials just fine
so in the next tutorial what we're going
to be doing is we're going to be
creating our very first database and I'm
going to be showing you guys how to
import all of the tables that you need
and yes I made them in there available
for 100% free
thank you very much and I'm going to be
showing you guys where to download them
from my website and how to import them
so you can follow along with my
tutorials
but for now thank you guys very much for
watching and I will see you in the next
video oh and by the way don't forget to
