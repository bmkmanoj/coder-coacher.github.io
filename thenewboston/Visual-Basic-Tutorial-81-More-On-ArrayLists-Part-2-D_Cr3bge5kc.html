slash on live gamer for the new boss sim
and in this tutorial we're going to be
taking a look at a more in-depth look at
ArrayList now we do this in the last
tutorial and this is going to be a
continuation of that so what we're going
to be talking about in this is removing
stuff from ArrayList and maybe something
else if we have time for that so let's
go ahead and add some more items to our
ArrayList so my ArrayList dot add will
add 20 we'll add a couple strings and we
will add let's and we can even add a
baleen
so my ArrayList add true ok so now that
we've got some more stuff added to our
ArrayList we can go ahead and run this
and you can see that it will print them
out for us so now what we can do is we
can remove items from our ArrayList so
let's just do this right before
everything is printed out on the list
box so we'll type my ArrayList and then
when we use dot it gives us a whole
bunch of functions and sub subs that we
can use so what we're going to use is
we're going to use remove so what this
says is removes the first occurrence of
a specific objects from the system
collections ArrayList so what this means
is whatever you type in it's going to
remove that so if I type in true it's
going to remove the first occurrence of
true which is at index here 0 1 2 3 4 5
so at index 5 it's going to remove true
now I index index 6 or 7 if we add true
again this will stay inside of our
ArrayList and this one will be taken out
because as you saw it said it removes
the first occurrence of it so if we type
my ArrayList out remove true we can go
ahead and run this
and you can see that if we click display
ArrayList everything is here except
we're missing the true that was
somewhere right here
but you can see that the last true is
still there because it removes the first
occurrence now what we can also do is we
can remove at so instead of remove we
remove at and it says removes the
element at the specific index so inside
of our arguments we're going to use the
index of the place in our ArrayList
or the atom so let's just remove hello
and that's going to be at index of one
because they always start with zero so
if we remove one or remove at the index
of one and click display ArrayList we
got 10 and then you can see hello is
gone and then everything else is still
there now here's one thing that I would
have covered in the last tutorial but I
didn't want to confuse you guys just yet
so if we come up here let's just declare
an array so private my array and we'll
just leave that empty as array or not as
array we want it to be a string and then
we will just populate this array so
we'll type Sam and then so we'll just
add this stuff right here and so now we
have an array that has three items at 0
1 2 &amp;amp; 3 now what if we want to add all
the items of this array to our ArrayList
we could use a for loop but there is an
easier way to do this we can just type
my ArrayList dot and range and you can
see it says adds the elements of a
system collections I collection to the
end of the ArrayList so it'll just add
all of the stuff in my array to our
ArrayList so if we type add range and
then my array or
what it's going to do is just going to
add all of these three strings to the
end of our ArrayList so let's go ahead
and run this and you'll see how this
works so we'll go ahead and click
display array list and you can see that
adds Sam on left gamer and YouTube
because we used add range and it adds
each of the items in our array list so
in this tutorial we looked at removing
items from an ArrayList by using their
name and removing them at certain index
and and we also learned how to add all
the items of an array to an ArrayList so
I'm practice that a little bit and once
you go that down move on to the next
tutorial and thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
