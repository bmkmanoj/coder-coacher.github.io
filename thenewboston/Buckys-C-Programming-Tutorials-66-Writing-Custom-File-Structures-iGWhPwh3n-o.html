tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
to be teaching you guys how to make a
custom file structure to work with your
program because whenever you build your
own custom program you just don't want
to use any file format you know playing
off-the-shelf format you want to build a
custom file structure so that it makes
it easier for your program to work with
your files and I don't know what I'm
talking about now but trust me you will
buy that in this tutorial so the first
thing we need is an idea actually before
we get started let's go ahead and say
that we wanted to make a game like Sim
City or whatever where we had a bunch of
different players or a bunch of
different characters and we wanted to
store all the character information and
the text file well the first thing we
need is of course a text file so go
ahead and put of' stream and we'll just
name it like the file good enough I
guess
and we'll just go ahead and create a
file called players dot text now
remember if this file already exists
then C++ is going to look at it's going
to open that one but if it doesn't exist
yet which it doesn't let me go ahead and
pull up my directory see no players that
text since it doesn't exist already C++
is going to automatically create one
once it sees that indeed does not exist
so let's go ahead and the first thing I
want to give is we're going to be making
a program basically to enter the
character information you know say we
wanted to build a bunch of characters
ourselves well let's go ahead and give
the user an ISO prompt about what we
want them to do so see out not mmm close
but you know not close we'll just go
ahead and put enters enter players ID
and then you know maybe they have a name
for each player and maybe they have like
a bank account money or something simple
enough and then go ahead and end that
line so this is just going to print some
text out on the screen telling them what
to do so we're going to enter a number a
name and another number the first one's
going to be the ID number the second one
is going to be their name like Bucky and
third one's going to be like 48 dollars
in their bank account something stupid
like that
and now what we want to do is we're
going to be working with something
called an end-of-file marker now before
I go on let me say this every file on
your computer when C++ opens it's going
to look for the end of file marker this
is pretty much the end of your file it's
I mean no weird complicated explanation
it's just a little symbol that goes at
the end of your file to tell C++ you
know how long your file is whenever it's
reading your file and it gets that end
of file marker that's where it knows
where to stop it's pretty much telling
C++ where the end of your file is simple
as that now what we can do is we can
explicitly enter and end a file
indicator and I'll show you guys how to
do this later on but basically whenever
you hit control hold down control in his
e on your keyboard if you're working
with Windows this inputs an end-of-file
marker and I know it's kind of a weird
way to do things because if there was an
end-of-file marker button on your
keyboard it would be a lot easier to see
but if you're working with Windows then
hold down control in his E and this puts
the end of file marker and so we'll just
go ahead and they probably don't know
that so we'll just go ahead and put
press ctrl + Z to quit the program and
you know stop um inserting characters or
whatever so go ahead and in that line I
know that's a little weird but we need
it or this program would just keep
running forever so now we need three
variables that are temporarily going to
store this information just go ahead
we'll make the ID number an integer and
we'll make
the name our string of course and we'll
put the money since it has decimal
points like 48 dollars and 87 cents
we'll go ahead and make a double so we
have three variables ID number name and
money now what we need to do is we the
user want to be allowed to enter this
information whenever this program is
running so let's go ahead and make a
while loop because we really don't know
how many characters the user is going to
enter and here's what we do remember
anytime you want to get information from
the keyboard
aka from the user use CIN and then the
first thing they type in is going to be
stored in the variable ID number the
second thing they type in is going to be
the character's name and the third thing
they type in is how much money the
character has so the user is going to be
able to type characters information you
know maybe five different character
informations and then we want to be able
to store in a file so this basically the
user is going to be able to type in as
many characters as they want so this
loop is going to be true as long as they
don't get to the end of the file and how
do you know you get to the end of file
because of this weird control-z thing so
basically whenever the user enters
information we now have an ID number a
name in some amount of money so now the
only thing we want to do is we want to
insert it into the file so of course
remember just like before in the last
Oriels we write the file object and this
is pretty much a synonym for players
text so they can be used interchangeable
they can't be used interchangeably but
whenever you're looking at it just
assume that this means player is a text
so anything we insert it just gets
directly inserted into the file players
out text because that's the file
associated with object right here so the
first thing we want to insert is the ID
number and then just so it looks nice
and pretty just go ahead and insert a
little space
and then the next thing what do we have
a name and then a little space after
that and then the last thing is money
and line and let me make sure I got
number space namespace money and line
okay so it's good go
so basically well let's go ahead and run
this program and see what we get it says
all right
enter players ID name and money so let's
go ahead and make a couple players for
this you know Sim City social community
game whatever that game were making so
the players ID is going to be like 1 and
the players name is going to be like
Bucky and the money I have is like $65
and 47 cents go ahead and press Enter
add another character on the ID is 2 the
name is Sara and she has 43 dollars and
21 cents and let's make one more 3 is
Sofie and she has two dollars and 54
cents now let's go ahead and press well
we can just go ahead and press ctrl-z
right now and sometimes you have to
press ENTER and then your program is
going to stop sometimes you can just hit
ctrl Z and it send a file sometimes you
need hit ctrl Z enter so anyways I hit
ctrl Z that signified the end of the
file and of course when I got to the end
of my file I couldn't insert anything
else so my program quit as you can see
right here so now if you go up to your
documents you can see that you have a
txt file created called players text so
let's go ahead and click that and you
can see at the well basically it
inputted exactly as we input it does
that make sense no well too bad you can
see that it wrote to the file exactly
what we wanted to exactly in the format
that we wanted to so basically what was
going on is this we first created a file
that we open and whenever we open it we
have access to that file we then gave
the user a nice little prompt to show
them how to input the data and then
made three variables so we could
temporarily store the data now the user
was allowed to fill in the variables ID
number name and money and whenever we
had those variables populated with
values we just stored them in a file
using whatever format we wanted to in
the format we wanted to store min was
the ID number space name space money and
then once you got one character or one
player inserted just go to the next line
and do it again so that way on the next
line it was ID number name money on the
next line ID number name money so that
is how you can have you know a way of
storing data into a file formatted how
you want it so you're saying all right
why would I want to format it like this
well maybe you wouldn't but whenever you
know the structure of how your file is
formatted that way whenever we open the
file to read all the information in we
know what format it's going to be and so
that's why you want to create custom
file structures because custom file
structures make it easier for your
program to work with files if they know
where the data is going to be and also
what type of data is going to be there
for example in our game we knew that
that first row was always ID numbers
that second row was always names in that
third row was always and by the way row
I mean column that third column was
always the amount of money so I mean it
just makes it really easy to program
this way so that's all I have for you
guys for this tutorial I know this was
kind of weird with this control-z thing
I probably should have made it without
it but hey you guys learned something
new I guess so thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
