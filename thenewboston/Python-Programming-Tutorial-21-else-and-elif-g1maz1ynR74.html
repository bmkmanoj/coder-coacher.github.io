tutorial and this tutorial I'm going to
be covering else in else if statements
now in the last order I told you guys
alright if statement is pretty much a
test and if the test is true do this but
if it's false don't do anything well in
this tutorial I'm going to show you guys
how to execute a piece of code if it's
false so this is called the elf syntax
and let me show you guys how this works
literally the easiest thing you're ever
going to learn in your life just go
ahead and write else semicolon then
write your test condition so int it then
excuse me this test condition if fish
equals bass we're going to write this is
a as well very bass right there this is
a bass alright else um prints let's go
ahead I don't know what this is so
here's what's going to happen
fish equals tuna right now is going to
test if it equals bass which it doesn't
so it's not going to print this at all
so once it went through this option and
saw that this wasn't false or excuse me
this wasn't true it's going to go to
this and this is kind of the default
statement so once it does this and this
doesn't execute you're going to give
another choice do this instead so this
is pretty much if this is true do this
else do this instead that's what else is
short for so let's go ahead and press f5
save it run it and see what we get
it's again I was it's going to say I
don't know what this is so this is from
last tutorial don't mind them so just
going to say I don't know what this is
and let's see why that was one more time
fish is equal to tuna we test if it
equals the bass right here if it was
equalled bass it would print this but
it's not equal to bass so your by
default it's going to print this now
let's say you wanted a way to test the
fish was equal to something besides bass
or tuna or trout or salmon in a bunch of
different ways well instead of just
having one choice and then a default we
can give it multiple choices
to do this you use something called the
elf's if statement and this is the
second easiest thing you're ever about
the lyric and the syntax for that is e l
I F and that's short for else--if but
you have to type it like that so um what
you do is just like a if statement you
give another test condition so instead
of saying bass if fish is equal to UM
salmon well not not slamming well let's
put slamming why not if fish is equal to
slamming go ahead and put your semicolon
and print um I hope I don't get slamming
ill poisoning I hope I don't get slam
Anila poisoning good enough so and now
let's give it one more else else if just
for fun LIF if fish is equal to one as
well make this one true tuna put your
colon what are we going to print let's
put easy there tuna boat so here's
what's going to happen we're going to
test what fish is equal to what is tuna
it's going to say first I'm going to
tested the bass it's false so I'm not
going to run this piece of code at all
next I'm going to test it to salmon or
slammin it's false so I'm not going to
run this piece code at all
next I'm going to test the tuna whoa
whoa whoa look what we got here a true
statement so I'm going to print this
right here
easy there tuna boat so let's see what
happens press f5 and run it it says easy
there tuna boat so pretty much the only
condition that was true is this so the
only block of code at ran was this but
if we change this say spelled that wrong
then it's going to run through all these
options and it's going to come to your
else statement so changes tuna to
something else like trout and then type
f5 and it's going to say I don't know
what this is and what happened in this
case is it ran through all these none of
these tests
salmon trout were true it was actually
tuna so once your default so again this
is your syntax for your else--if which
is pretty much more ifs and your else
which is pretty much is if all of this
is false then you're going to want to
run this so that is your quick $2
tutorial on the else statement and else
if statements in Python we're going to
be using these a lot later on so get
used to it Pratt excuse me practice the
syntax and practice the short program
and once you get good at it you're ready
to move on to my next tutorial so thanks
