tutorial for the new Boston I know in
that last tutorial we went pretty
quickly if we set everything up but
hopefully we're going to slow it down
here all we did for the most part we set
up all of her references pretty normal
stuff well it's the only new thing that
we had was this intent and we got two
extras and as long as the extras was
equal to something we're gonna set up
our app widget ID and you know it's just
gonna return one app widget ID for us
and that's what that method means
otherwise you know it's never gonna
return something like this we're just
putting that in there for kind of
checking and then what we need to do is
we also need to set up this app widget
manager so a below our if statement
we're just going to set that equal to
basically be related to the context of
this class so how we do that is we do
set up our app widget manager equal to
our app widget manager class again we're
just that's just a default class comes
with the SDK and all that you guys
probably know that by now but then we
say dot and what we're gonna do is we're
going to say get instance of a context
and again the context that we're
referring to is the context of this
class which we set up in the last
tutorial to equal be equal the see you
could also just type this out here but
just for simplicity we're just going to
type C here so that kind of builds a
bridge for app widget manager to relate
to this specific class and now what
we're gonna do is we're just going to
set up you know our on click method
according to what we want to happen so
we're just gonna you know create a
string call E and this is gonna be equal
to our info or edit text called info I
should say and then just get text to
string again nothing new and we're just
gonna set the string for this one and
and then we're gonna get into opening
another activity so this is kind of kind
of similar to what we have done
previously but let's give us a little
space to work here again we need to set
up a remote views and we're gonna call
it V and we're going to set this again
equal to new remote views
and then we refer to a context again we
find that variable called C and we're
just gonna say get package name then
we're gonna relate to the layout that we
called for widget itself so again we're
messing with the widget layout so that's
what we need to refer to here finish off
our statements import again nothing too
new here and we have a we're getting an
error because again this onclick method
you know pull that gives us a view to
work with and they call that view so
we're just going to change this to views
whatever that works then what we're
gonna do is we're gonna again just say
views set text view text and we refer to
the ID again r dot ID dot text views
configure input so what that first text
view is called what we're gonna do is
pass in you know whatever our string is
from our edit text so yeah pretty much
the same as what we've done the last
tutorial this one's going to be a little
bit just kind of a review as well but
we're gonna get into something new it
something a little bit new that you guys
need to realize when you make one of
these configuration things classes so
we're just going to refer to our again
app widget manager we're just gonna say
dot update app widget and we refer to
the ID which we called aw ID again and
the views which we called views as well
so we don't have to change that one and
there we go we basically updated our app
you know the only other thing we need to
do is we gotta say finish because again
we want this activity to finish when you
know when they hit that button so that's
pretty much the core concept of probably
this tutorial again we just kind of did
it a little bit different referring to a
context get instance of the context here
since again if I switch over to this
class we don't actually get the context
like we do with the update method so we
have to kind of create it
to relate to this class so that's
something pretty important and we also
want to finish this activity somehow and
you know close it out so again it's
probably not too new just to kind of go
over some stuff again and and just to
make sure you guys finish the activity
and I'll catch you guys in the next
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
