with a video tutorial for the new Boston
now in this video we're gonna be taking
a look at creating a jQuery plug-in but
this time we're going to be allowing a
callback function for our plugin so what
do I mean first of all by a callback
function now let's take a look at how
this works
is a simple countdown where we can
specify a single integer and we count
down from that integer to zero when we
reach zero we then give our you know
indication that the function or the
plug-in has completed and then we can
run the callback function and in this
case the callback function is going to
be an alert box so when i refresh the
page you can see that we start counting
down from five when we reach zero or
when we reach you know one still
displayed but I you know haven't gone
into technicality with the plug-in we
show this done input field so
essentially what we're doing here is I'm
applying this to a difficult countdown
we have the div here and I'm using my
countdown plugin which I've created
inside plug-in is I've got an option
that I can specify from and I'm saying
from five so we can go ahead and change
this to ten if we like and it'll go
ahead and count down from ten at ten
nine eight blah blah blah and then this
is the callback function here so when
it's done ie when it reaches zero we use
that weand so send this callback
function or allow this callback function
to be executed and that just alert it's
done so this could be anything it could
be something like window dot location
sorry equals HTTP Google Doc credit UK
for example so we could count down from
say three you know there's there's many
useful ways that you could go ahead and
use this application and you see we're
now at Google so there's you know
there's there's a variety of you know
ways that you could actually take use of
callback functions particularly when you
are creating your own functions let's
just go back and
okay so we need to figure out what we're
doing now if you haven't already looked
at creating parameters or sending
settings to plugins I recommend you look
at that first because I'm not going to
be going over it too much in the
tutorial but the main thing we're
focusing on is this second option about
our plug-in declaration and that is our
callback function so we're going to be
creating this countdown timer so if you
wanted to follow along and create that
as well we're going to be creating it as
a plugin obviously and then sending this
callback when we're done or when the
counter reaches zero so without further
ado let's go ahead and take a look at
the code okay so on the index page here
we're going to need to create an area on
our page for the countdown to be placed
so the numbers that are decrementing and
eventually reaching zero are placed so
I'm just going to go ahead and create a
div and this is going to be called
countdown now inside ext ojs we can use
our countdown to apply our plugin and
I'll plug in wherever it's called on
which selector that it's called will
place the countdown so this could be
absolutely anything it could be a
paragraph as long as it as long as you
select using the plug-in it will always
place the that the numbers that are you
know decrementing in that area
so inside ext look Jess let's go ahead
and outline how we might want to use our
plug-in before we go ahead and create it
inside plug-in j/s so the first thing I
want to do is say document dot ready and
inside here we run a function so this is
just standard you know sort of notation
for when we start a jQuery application
or jQuery code now inside here I'm going
to go ahead and select what was it
called countdown so we want to select
countdown and we want to apply it the
countdown plug-in to this now at the
moment I'm not going to go ahead and
specify any options we'll do that as we
go along and as we create our plug-in
but essentially now we are creating the
countdown plug-in to this countdown
selector so
the numbers will be in here like 10987
blah blah blah as I as I've shown you
before we need to specify two things in
here the first one is the options that
we want to send to the plugin the second
is the callback function so we'll do
that in a minute but now let's go ahead
and start to actually create our plugin
so if you've already dealt with creating
plugins we use function and sorry that
needs to be in brackets so we use
function and then we use a dollar sign
in here don't worry if you're a bit
confused with this it you know it
doesn't sort of really make sense but
this is the way we make plugins and then
we come down with this sort of block
here if that makes sense
now after this we want to go ahead and
write jQuery and then a line terminator
and this here is the standard notation
of creating or outlining a plug-in we
then need to go ahead and name our
plug-in so we use dollar sign in place
of jQuery remember we would usually use
jQuery but now we can use dollar sign
dot F and which stands for function name
or function and then we call our
function you know whatever we want to
call it as long as it doesn't conflict
conflict with an existing plug-in or
another functionality or another you
know jQuery functionality now now that
we've said dollar dollar function count
down this is equal to a function and
inside of here we'll go our code so here
it goes our code now inside of here what
we want to do is we want to go ahead and
actually create the countdown itself
with an interval we're going to be
setting an interval but inside this
function here we first of all want to
specify which options and also callback
so options we're going to sort of
condense down into a list of settings
and at the moment we've only got one and
that was from and a particular number
and then we have our callback function
at the end so let's deal with this from
10 at the moment so specified the
setting as as I call my plugin now I
need to go ahead and work out how to
handle it so the first thing I need is a
variable called settings and this is
array of data and that array of data
takes the argument or parameter name and
then a default value so I'm going to set
the default value to 60 what I then want
to do is check if a user has provided
these options now this settings hit not
to be confused with the option set but
what we want to do is we want to go
combine them if options have been
provided ie if the user has typed in
here so I'm gonna say if options and the
block that we want to run if options are
available is we want to extend settings</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
