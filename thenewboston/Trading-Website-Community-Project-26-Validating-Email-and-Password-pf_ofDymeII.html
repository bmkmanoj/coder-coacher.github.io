let me think about this for a second I'm
actually going to pause the video and
write this bit of code for the
validating the email because I'm gonna
need to go ahead and write some regular
expressions and it's going to take a
while so because I'm really slow with a
regular expression so hold on one second
while I pause it all right so i went
ahead and i coded it and this is what i
got so what i did is instead of you know
talking guys through all this regular
expression i actually had to look online
for most of it i went ahead and i tested
what they entered for the email if they
didn't enter anything then of course
it's going to test true for empty so
then we just arm gave them an error
message dude please enter your email
please enter something the next thing I
did is I wanted to test the regular
expression to make sure that what they
entered was actually a valid email and
that includes this regular expression
right here and what this regular
expression does is it make sure that the
string that they entered is in the email
format for example um you can't enter
dollar sign dollar sign KH h that
obviously isn't an email you can't enter
just numbers just letters those
obviously aren't emails so this makes
sure that the string is in the email
format and I actually don't want to
werder up that now if it is indeed in
the email format then what we need to do
is we're going to take that and I want
to run this through the function my SQL
real escape string now you're going to
see this function a lot because this is
a security function what it does is it
basically takes a string and it converts
it into a string that's database safe
because there are some things that users
can type in such as mysql and it can
actually get passed into your database
and ruin your database so this pretty
much makes sure that it's MySQL safe and
I'll talk about more at the end of this
series when I talk about PHP security
but hopefully this is
we want to happen if not and it doesn't
pass the test of a valid email then we
just say hey dude your email address is
invalid maybe you forgot an @ sign or
you know something stupid like that but
after we validated user name and after
we validated email then only other thing
we need to do is we need to validate
their password fear what they typed in
for password so this is going to be real
easy the first thing we want to do is
I'm actually just going to go ahead and
copy this beast right here is I'm going
to go ahead and check if password is
empty obviously you can't type nothing
for a password because what kind of
password would that be if it is then
let's just go ahead and stay on a bunch
of stuff please enter a password else
then what we're going to do in this case
is set create a variable called password
and we're going to set this equal to my
SQL underscore real underscore escape
underscore string there we go turns blue
that means you typed it right and now
just go ahead and throw the password
right in there and what this pretty much
does is it cleans up their password so
it's safe to enter our database and it
stores it in a variable called password
now before I continue I want to mention
this you guys are probably saying okay
one second why do you need to escape the
password and escape the email to make
sure it's safe for the database but you
didn't need to clean up the username
well the reason I don't need to clean up
the username is because we're only
allowing the user to pretty much use a
username that consists only of numbers
and letters now the things that are not
safe for the database are things like
MySQL comments which include quotation
marks slashes like forward slashes and
stuff and like minus signs those are all
the symbols that aren't safe for the
database now since the username
is not allowed to have these these
things but you can indeed have like
quotation marks in your password and you
know weird symbols in your email
possibly then that's why I wanted to
clean those up so basically there we go
we validated the username the email and
the password hopefully if they don't
generate any error messages then we have
three nights variables username email
and password that are ready to be thrown
into our database so there you have it
think you guys for watching and I'll see
you guys in the next video where we are
actually going to be throwing these and
testing if anyone else is registered
