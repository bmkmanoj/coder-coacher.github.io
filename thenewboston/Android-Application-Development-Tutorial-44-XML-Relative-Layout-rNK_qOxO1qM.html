tutorial for the new boss and again with
me Travis and what we're going to do is
kind of give you guys a review on
passing data getting data starting an
activity for a desired result so we're
going to build kind of our own
application and kind of because I mean
we briefly talked on those subjects but
is kind of probably confusing for the
most part so we're going to build our
own application and break it down for
the most part so what we need to do is
set up to XML layouts so I'm just going
to hit set those up real quick I'm going
to call one send XML and I'm going to
call the other one other one get four
the most well I don't know what I'm
gonna call this ya get oh yeah there we
go basically enter get XML it's going to
be pretty simple layout we aren't really
going to care about the layout for the
most part we're just going to add an
edit text so under our text fields plain
text right there and two buttons and
then a textview
but we are going to do something new
with this layout for the most part so
stay tuned for that but two buttons and
an edit text and let's go into the XML
because this is what I'm going to teach
you guys that's new for the most part
instead of relative or I'm sorry Lin
linear layout we're going to learn about
relative layout because some of you guys
might like this for developing and
whatnot so instead of linear view just
type relative layout and there we go and
then delete our orientation because we
won't need that and let's set up our
edit text the ID and all that stuff for
all these things so edit text just right
here and we're going to change this to
ET sindh because we're going to send
some data through the edit text and then
it's pretty good for a button we're
going to say start activity for the text
and our other button we're going to say
start activity for result just kind of
get this boring stuff set up for the
most part not result well result and
then B we're going to say s a free2play
esa for the edit and then for a textview
we're going to say TV for textview and
then got and leave it as textview for
now it doesn't really matter then what
we're going to do is what we can we can
find the with the relative layout is the
position positioning for the most part
as you can see it's kind of messed up at
the right at the moment everything's
kind of set in the same position so
we're going to do is we have this
basically our edit text here this lines
messed me up for the most part with the
edit text and what we're going to do is
just kind of layout these buttons
according to
the other little items within here so
what we're going to say is Android for
our button Android and then we can say
layout now we can say like below I
believe and then we just add the
reference of whatever ID that we want to
lay it below so we're gonna say well at
id /et send and let's check that out
save it and it's going to put below and
another method we can use is like
aligning that that button so we're going
to say Android and then we're going to
align it according to the parent which
is the ID reference that we just set up
so we're gonna say Android layout align
parent right so we're going to set up to
the right of basically the textview and
it's going to line it to two that we
need to set this to true or false so
we're going to say true and as you can
see it moves this button over here now
we're just going to set this start start
activity for result to the left of this
button that we just set up so we're
going to say Android layout left oops or
two to the left of and then we just oops
sorry always for some reason
to the left of and then we have to
reference ID again so we're going to say
ID forward slash whatever ID of that
button was so that was a ID BSA so ID be
sa and then check that out it's going to
be aligned to the left what we're now
going to do is set basically the top
alignment to the left of that parent as
well or you'll see I'm sorry it's kind
of hard to talk and think at the same
time man but so now what we're going to
do is basically say to the left of and
then we also say layout and we have to
set up the linemen so we're going to say
align top and then we can set this equal
to basically our reference as well so
we're going to say a at id /b s a
question mark /p sa and check that out
and it's going to line the top with the
top of this pretty much alignment now
see I mean I don't know if you guys
wanted to use relative layout or not but
I just thought I'd show you guys the
option all we need to do now is change
this text view as well so we're going to
say just quickly Android layout and then
below at whatever that button was called
so that's the @ ID /b start activity for
results and you know that's good enough
for the most part you could also set the
alignment to there as well but I just
want to show you guys the relative
layout how that works and then we're
also going to set up our other layout in
the next tutorial so I'll catch you guys
then peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
