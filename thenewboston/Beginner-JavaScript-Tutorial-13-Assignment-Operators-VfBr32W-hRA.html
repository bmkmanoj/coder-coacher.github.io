to your 13th JavaScript tutorial and
this tutorial is probably going to be a
real quick one because I'm only going to
be talking about one thing and that is
called assignment operators so I already
taught you guys what the assignment
operator is so say we had a variable
equal to Bucky and let's go ahead and
set it equal to 24 because that's my age
and if we go ahead and just document
right out
Bucky it's going to go ahead and print
2400 screen no need to show you guys
that but hey I will anyways right there
so that is the assignment operator
basically an equal sign but there are
different types of operators to in there
pretty much like little shortcuts and
there's an add an assigned operator
which pretty much takes a variable and
in order to use the add in a sign
operator you put plus equal sign and
then to the right of it you put a number
like 54 now what this is going to do is
it's going to say all right the value of
Bucky is 24 so if I add 54 to it I get
the new value of 78 so now Bucky equals
78 so let's go ahead and refresh this
and when it prints out Bucky it says 78
so it doesn't change Bucky 254 what it
does is it takes Bucky adds 54 to it and
assigns it the new value so aside from
um which is called the add and assign
operator you have the subtract and
assign operator right there choose 54
why not which gives you negative 30 the
multiply and assign
and the divide in a sign which is I have
no idea what this value is oh nice
so aside from the add in a sign
subtraction sign multiply divided and
assign there's one other one and that's
called the modulus and inside modulus
and a sign and to tell you the truth
what this does is it takes an integer
remainder or basically the remainder and
it you know what remember this don't
ever use the modulus and a sign I've
been programming for I don't even know
how many years and I never used the
modulus and a sign
other than just teaching people what the
modulus and a sign operator does so
basically you're never going to use the
modulus and a sign so wipe that out of
your memory and yeah I probably should
edit that out at the tutorial but
anyways I won't so aside from that the
other thing I want to teach you guys
before I let you guys go is that you
don't have to only use one of these you
can go ahead and assign 67 to that and
let me see if you guys can figure this
out and go ahead and you know 32 and
then Bucky x equals 4 and then Bucky um
mult
divided equals 5 or something like that
so go ahead the original value of Bucky
is 24 plus 67 minus 32 times 4/5 and I
messed that up right there but I'm going
to wait 10 seconds and I want you to
leave a comment below of what you think
this equals and let me see if anyone can
figure this out in 10 seconds 9 8
three two one and let's see what it was
forty seven point two so how close were
you to that hmm let me know in the
comment section below because I bet you
were way off because I was by anyways
thank you guys for watching that's all I
have for you guys for the story I just
wanted to talk to you quick about
assignment operators and don't forget
don't ever use the modulus in assign
operator I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
