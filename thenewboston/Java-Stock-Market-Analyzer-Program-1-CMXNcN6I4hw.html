welcome to your very first lesson and
how to build a Java stock market
analyzer program now in this series
we're pretty much going to be building
is a program written in Java entirely
and we're going to do things like a look
at trends of the stock market analyze
the historical data and kind of pretty
much find the best stocks to buy
depending on what time it is and not not
like time like 9 o'clock but you know
based on just data that was proven in
the past kind of find the best stocks to
buy and how to analyze that and it's
pretty cool I just thought of this
program I thought it would be a neat
idea so I figured why not teach you guys
as well so um and another thing you
don't need to be an expert in stock
market because trust me I'm not and this
is pretty much just learning how to
program in Java and remise well put it
use build a nice little program so in
order to analyze data the first thing we
need is data and lucky for us yahoo
gives us free data what kind of folks
they are and here's what you need to do
to get it and you can do this for any
stock you want I'm going to just do mine
for Dow Jones probably so go ahead in in
finance or whatever I'm going to go
ahead and click that Dow on the left
side of your screen you see this little
thing right here that says historical
prices go ahead and click and if you
want to search for a stock you want to
do and actually you can download a bunch
files and you can run them through this
program now analyze data for you but I'm
just going to start with one right now
the dow jones average so once you click
on historical prices in Yahoo Finance
you get this huge list of prices since
the stock first um was open to the
current day so this includes the date
the open price high low close the volume
in the adjusted close and this is all
the data that we're going to be
analyzing so how awesome is that that we
just got access to free data but we
can't just
use it right from the site we actually
need to download it so if you scroll all
the way down
Yahoo gives you option that says
download two spreads for you so let's go
ahead and let's open this with either
notepad or notepad plus plus and go
ahead and click OK and once you do that
you see that it gives us this huge huge
list of all the data in the history of
the Dow Jones so this is kind of
overwhelming if we wanted to analyze
this ourselves so that's why we need to
build a computer program to do it so
let's go ahead and we can't just some
let's go ahead and select all of this
using file or edit there we go select
all and let's go ahead and edit cut this
and in a new file paste it again so
paste all that now the thing is all of
these rows are useful except this very
top row right here date open high low
close volume and just to close those are
seven different things but when we're
analyzing this data we can't have that
rone there so go ahead and write that
down so you know each one of these means
and go ahead and delete it so now we
want to get rid of that first row
entirely because it's just going to mess
us up so now we have all this data
without that you know we don't want the
title in there because that's for sure
we just want the data to analyze so
let's go ahead and where do we want to
put this file well what we want to do is
put file save as and if you go to your
computer right on your C Drive make a
folder called stocks sto
C KS and in that folder save this file
is a new Dow I'll do with you
new Dow dot CSV and what CSV means is
pretty much a file that's separated by
commas in essence it's what like
Microsoft Excel reads and stuff like
that
but save it is new Dow CSV in the stocks
folder that way we have it in the same
place menu so go ahead and click Save
and I already have one and I'm going to
replace it right now
so now what we pretty much have is this
file in that location so now we can
begin analyzing it so go ahead and I'm
just going to cancel that actually I'm
going to cookin um and get out here
and let me see how much time I have
won't even tell me so now what we need
to do is well now that we have the data
we're good to go for the next tutorial
so this tutorial is pretty much getting
that stock data and again you don't have
to do with the Dow Jones you can get it
with any stock you want but make sure
you have some sort of data to use and
once you do you're ready to move on to
next tutorial where we're going to start
analyzing and programming it and I'm
going to make it real simple for you
guys so um for now thank you guys for
watching and don't forget check out the
next tutorial will where we will be
putting this data to use so again thank
you don't forget to subscribe and I'll
see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
