with a video tutorial for the new Boston
in this tutorial we're going to be
taking a look at the slider in jQuery UI
what we're going to do is we're going to
implement a simple slider onto the page
and take a look at some of the options
that are available to us so when the
slider is in operation we're going to
create a div underneath the slider
that's going to hold the div and we're
going to feedback the values associated
with the slider so this is useful for
things like if you've looked at clothing
websites or other websites you have you
know such as just retail websites you
might have sliders that allow you to
pick a particular value of in the range
of a particular value for example in
currency you would have a slider that
would allow you to only show items
between certain amounts of money so
sliders can be implemented in this way
obviously we're not going to be looking
at it in too much detail in this
tutorial by just demonstrating this
slider effect or slider widget in jQuery
UI but we're just going to take a look
at some of the options available some of
the more useful options so the first
thing we want to do is actually
implement a slider into our page so I've
included obviously all the necessary
includes that we've been using
throughout the tutorial series but the
first thing I'm going to do is go over
to style dot CSS and just style some of
the body elements or one of the body
elements which is the font size and I'm
going to set this to 14 pixels I'm also
going to be setting the size of the
slider a bit later on we're going to be
fiddling around with this during the
tutorial but for now I'm just going to
leave that blank until we implement the
slider so the slider we're going to
place into a div element on our page I'm
just going to call this slider and
underneath I'm gonna have an area where
we have the slider value so I'm just
gonna call this div slider value so the
slider is going to be implemented in
here and the TEC of the value associated
with the slider will go into this div
here so if we go over to UI j s which
i've included on my page we can start to
actually activate the slider so we're
going to reference using a
selector this slider div here so we'll
go ahead and write slide it in there and
then we just want to write dot slider
now this will be this will automatically
activate the slider and we can view it
on our page so yeah that should be
slider so let's go ahead and refresh our
page and you can see that we've got a
basic slider with no minimum or maximum
value and we're also not feeding back
the value to the user so the first thing
we're going to take a look at is
actually feeding back the value so
inside the options we're going to set an
event based on the slider value so the
event name is slide so if we just write
slide in here we can create a function
associated with this so we'll come down
a couple of lines let's just pop this on
a separate line all together down here
okay so one when we've actually when
we're actually taking the slider and
dragging it across this bar anything
inside here we want to feed back so this
function here is going to take two
parameters which is event and UI now
we're not going to be looking at event
but we're going to be looking at UI
which is obviously going to feed back
the value of the bar so I'll show you
how to do that just now now we're going
to select our slider value div and we're
gonna place some text inside there we
can use HTML or text if you're putting
anything else other than yeah thing you
know like you might want to go ahead and
implement a pound sign for example let's
just do that to test and then you want
to append on UI dot value now we're
gonna be changing this a bit later on
with the other options that we're going
to give it because value isn't going to
work for values in between so you know
your you'll understand a bit later on
that we'll go ahead and change this and
access is access it as an array but for
now what's going to happen is we've set
up the slider when we slide we run this
current function and from UI we place
the value of the slider into this slider
value with a pound sign on the front
so let's go ahead and refresh you can
see that as we slide this this is now
updating so you can see that the value
is increasing by default is from zero so
back to zero here all the way up to 100
now because we're going to be setting
values a bit later and using these in
several places what I want to do is just
go up here and set a few of these values
into variables so I'm going to set the
min value equal to one we want the value
to always start at one and I'm going to
set the max value to 400 okay so now
what we want to do is actually implement
these as options so the two options
we're looking at here is min and Max so
just under here I can write min and I
can go ahead and put min value so now
min will be equal to 1 so the slider
will always start at 1 and max we can
use max value and remember this comma
here because this comma separates this
option value here from this slide here
it would usually look like that so now
that we've set a minute and a max we can
go ahead and check that you can see that
it will have started at 1 and as we go
all the way up it's now a maximum value
of 400 so that's essentially how we are
setting the minimum and maximum values
of our slider which is almost always
going to be the case we might not want
the 0 to 100 we might want a larger
value so assuming this is pounds we have
an option from 1 pound
to 400 pounds so this could be a slider
for example I don't know how much money
do you want to borrow or how much money
you know would you like to donate or
anything like that there is another
option that we can use called step which
will step an incremental point in the
slider so for example if we only wanted
multiples of 5 what we could do is we
could set a step value so I could set
the step value to 5 for example and
what's going to happen here is when we
actually increment it it's going to go
up with a value of 5 so you'll notice at
the moment
we've were going up in five because we
started at one so we can either change
this to 0 or we could step at 4</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
