video and in this video what we're gonna
be doing is we're gonna be setting up
Bucky's world itself so the first thing
that Bucky who probably wants is you
know a world to walk around in so go
over and hop in in it right now and make
sure you're in your play class obviously
and remember we name this variable world
map and just set this equal to new image
in wherever or whatever the image files
name if you downloaded everything from
the forum it's re s world dot ping just
double check in there it actually is
named world uh ping so now our world map
or actually Bucky's world map is loaded
into memory now I want to show you guys
how to set up the first part of the
animation remember I told you guys that
each animation consisted of a series of
images that lasted for a certain amount
of time well you actually since we
already have the amount of time right
here sorted in variable called duration
we need to go ahead and set up all of
the images for each of those animations
so make a image array and name the first
one walk up now of course this image
array is going to be the animation
whenever Bucky is walking up if you kind
of guess that so in order to create this
just go ahead and your little curly
braces and this is gonna be a very
simple array I'm just gonna make a
really really basic animation that only
uses two different images pretty much
the smallest animation you can possibly
make but if you want to make more
complex animations then you can use the
same technique just add more images and
also make sure that you have the same
amount of time as you do number or
amount of images in your animation so
new image okay caps lock
Wow I'll figure this out one day okay
new image in the first one is re s
Bucky's back dot ping and the second one
is new image re s Bucky's back dot ping
so we're basically saying okay what's
gonna essentially happen is this we say
whenever you press the up arrow on your
keyboard make an animation of Bucky
walking upward now whenever he walks
upward we're basically starting with his
back and ending with his back so
basically well you guys will see later
on once we're playing the game what's
going on but that is how you create the
basic basic image array needed for your
animation so now we need to do this
exact same thing and make three other
image race for the three other
animations walking down left and right
so let me just go this down left and
right and obviously we need to change
the image right here so whenever he
walks down we want to see the front side
of them so Bucky's front and Bucky's
front whenever he's walking to the left
you know this is pretty self-explanatory
but into the right and someone's sexting
me right now
and Bucky's right so now let me just go
ahead and make sure I didn't miss
anything up okay so whenever he's
walking up we want to see his back
whenever he's walking down we want to
see his front left and right right re so
we're good to go so now basically what
we have is all the pieces that we need
to create an animation in selected A to
D we have a series of images and we also
have a duration that says how long each
image is supposed to last for so now all
we have to do is actually create the
animation itself so here is basically
what we've been waiting for this is how
you create an animation so let's go
ahead and start with moving up remember
we already declared all of our
animations up here so we pretty much
have to make them so anytime you want to
make an animation of course moving up go
ahead and write your variable and set
this equal to a new animation object and
this animation object takes three
parameters the first parameter is
basically what images do you want to use
in your animation well we want to use
for whenever he's moving up the images
in this walk up imagery so go ahead and
pass that and now after this it says
okay I see that you have two images in
your walk up imagery that means that I
need one second all right guys actually
that was my friend knocking on my door
he just tried out my sensory deprivation
tank and well yeah it's pretty much
that's it so I had to talk to him but
alright where I was I animation so
basically to create an animation you
give it a series of images pretty much
what images do you want to use in the
animation so this is the array of images
that we want to use now it says okay you
have two images now I need an array of
integers telling me how long you want
each image to last so all of the images
are going to last for 200 200 pretty
much this animation is going to be like
half a second long so in order to throw
this and just go ahead and throw in
duration which throws in the
time each image is gonna last now for
this last thing just go ahead and put
false right here and it has to do with
something called Auto updating and for
now we don't really have to worry about
it just go ahead and set it to false so
basically we created we now have a
successful animation of whenever Bucky
is walking up use these images which are
Bucky's back how long do we want the
animation to last pretty much half a
second and this last parameter false
don't really worried about it right now
now we need to go ahead and of course
make three other animations just kind of
you know redundant stuff we did before
moving down moving left and moving right
so of course the only really thing we
need to change is all of these
animations are gonna be for the same
amount of time they just use different
image arrays so walking down walking
left and walking right so now hopefully
we shouldn't have any warnings or
anything like that
the only other thing that we need to
take care of is this animation right now
so remember that I said whenever
basically this is how our games going to
work we have four different animations
moving up moving down moving left and
moving right
however this animation right here is
called Bucky it's gonna be set to one of
these other animations so I think that's
the easier way to develop a game just
have one animation whatever your
character name is and have them set
equal to another animation and you guys
will see you later on why it makes it a
whole lot easier than trying to mess
with all of these every time so remember
since we are in the init method right
now this is whatever happens when we
first initialize the game whenever we
first start the game so by default Bucky
is going to be facing us which means
he's going to be set equal to the
animation moving down so there you go
now I don't know if anything's gonna
happen when I run this game play now
nope and that's because I need to do a
bunch of other stuff first actually
needed ROM render them on the screen but
basically
we got everything initialized all the
animations all of the images everything
is set up we just have to you know drive
everything on the screen and code
everything you know I said that like
it's only gonna take like two seconds
it's actually you know kind of a lot of
work but that's what we had to look
forward to something guys for watching
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
