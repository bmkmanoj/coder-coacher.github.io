your let's see 15th
I think tutorial I don't know who's
keeping track and in this story we're
gonna be talking about the wild loop now
in the last couple tutorials we learned
about a sweet loop and all it did was
execute cute code over and over and it
was called the for loop well in this
tutorial we're gonna be learning about
another loop and again all loops do is
they take a piece of code and run it
over and over and over again so you
don't manually have to do it over and
over and over again so let's go ahead
and get started let's go ahead and the
first thing I'm gonna do is demonstrate
a simple wild loop so let's go ahead and
put int number and set it equal to 1 or
0 you decide I'll give you the freedom
and now what we need to do is go ahead
in the syntax which means the code to
build a while loop is first you put
while and then inside your parentheses
right after you write the condition now
what the condition is is it's basically
a test and your computer's gonna say
alright as long as this test is true I'm
gonna keep running this code over and
over again but as soon as this test
inside my parentheses is false I'm gonna
stop not running your code anymore so we
need to make something that it's gonna
change so let's go ahead and put while
number is less than or equal to 6 so as
long as our variable number is less than
or equal to the number 6 it's going to
keep running so some time now that
number is equal to 1 we're gonna have to
change its value so go ahead and inside
your curly braces this is also part of
the while loop so first you have your
test and inside your curly braces you
have your statements or instructions of
what you want to run so the first thing
we want to do is let's go ahead and just
output our number NS log and put at and
just go ahead and put like percent I and
now go ahead and write number not number
there we go that's a bit better and now
what this does is it says alright I'm
gonna test if your number is less than
or equal to 6
and then I'm going to output your number
so what does will do right now is it
would say 1 1 1 1 and then we'll run
that forever but we want this loop to
eventually break which means stop
running so what we're going to do is go
ahead and change the number value so
number plus plus that means every time
you run this code add 1 to number so
let's go ahead and run this and then
I'll talk you guys through save and run
and it goes 1 2 3 4 5 6 so what exactly
happened here well we had a variable
cone number and we set it equal to 1 and
then we put it in a while loop and this
while loop tested and it ran this code
so long as the number was less than or
equal to 6 so the first time it said all
right I got this number and it's 1 so I
can run this code I'm gonna print it out
add 1 to it all right let's do it again
I got this number and it's 2 so I can go
ahead and run my code so to change it to
3 so I get to the number it's 3 and it
went so on and so on and it printed out
6 down the line and eventually when it
got to 7 it said all right I'm only
supposed to run this code when it's less
than or equal to 6 so now that number is
7 I can exit this program and I'm not
going to do this anymore so those are
the basics of a while loop and how it
kind of works again like I said first it
has a test and if the test is true it
runs but if the test is false and it
fails the test then this never gets ran
and again if you never change the value
of number then your test would always be
true so you're gonna have this loop that
goes on and on and on forever and it's
going to strain your computer so that's
why you don't want to do that so let's
go ahead and build kind of an
interactive program and I need my dang
hanky again so hold on one second
can you find it
moving this on the bloody floor
well that's embarrassing and disgusting
so let's go ahead and get to the rest of
our tutorial and let's go ahead and I
deleted everything so we have a number
and it's set equal to one
well now let's go ahead and make another
variable let's tighten this up a tad bit
that's what she said
aunt Bucky and this is gonna hold a
number and this is just a little more a
better explanation of when to use the
while loop so let's go ahead and put
scanf so the users gonna type in a
number and it's gonna be an integer so
go ahead percent I and it's gonna be
stored in that variable Bucky so what we
did is our program is just gonna have a
blink cursor in it and we're gonna enter
a number and then that number is going
to be stored in the variable Bucky so
now what we need to do well we don't
need to but we just wanna is let's go
ahead and test number less than or equal
to ten so as long as this number vary
the variable that we made is less than
or equal to ten
so pretty much whatever I'm about to do
I want to do it ten times you're gonna
run this bit of code well let's go ahead
and put NS log and then go ahead and put
something like at and percent i times
percent i make sure your spell times are
on equals percent i so what we're gonna
do is take that number that we have it's
going to go from one to ten and we're
gonna take Bucky the number that they
entered this is gonna be constant and
we're gonna times them together together
and give them the number times Bucky and
that's good and now of course we need to
take that number and add one to it every
time so this loop eventually stops going
so let me go ahead and run this and this
is a neat little program sung as I don't
had any airs so it says running now
let's enter a number twelve press ENTER
and it says twelve times twelve is
twelve yadda yadda add six times twelve
72 9 times twelve is 108
times 12 is 120 and that's it so how
exactly did this program work let me
explain the two guys one more time and
this is would be an example of when you
would use the while loop it's a little
more um you know useful than just
outputting like my little example so say
for example you wanted to do your time
staple is 1 to 10 you would make a
number and this is variable and this
would go from 1 to 10 eventually we said
it a 1 to begin with
next we have the user enter what number
they want to times buy and store it in a
variable called Bucky or whatever you
want
Bucky is pretty good one I think you
should use that next we make a while
loop that basically goes ten times now
we could have easily made this in a for
loop it doesn't really matter later down
the road you'll come across situations
where for loops better and wild was
better above for now I'm telling you
guys both of them so since we have this
number going 1 to 10 anyways for the
while loop we said all right we're gonna
take the number that they entered which
is Bucky and take the number that goes
from 1 to 10 which is going through the
wild loop and we're gonna times them
both together and for your answer it's
just number times Bucky so that again
like I said is a little more useful and
that's probably all the time I have for
this tutorial so thank you
I hope you learned a little bit about
while loops and build a simple program
and you'll figure it out so thank you
guys for watching and don't forget
subscribe and I'll see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
