tutorial today I'm going to be teaching
guys how to hook up PHP on your computer
and how to actually use it now I'm not
going to be teaching guys the history of
PHP or what you can do with it or
anything like that because I don't feel
like it so I know a bunch you guys
already saw some PHP code on internet
and I was like ah that's kind of cool so
you try to type in your notepad editor
and it didn't work
that's because you guys are idiots and
you don't know anything but I'm going to
change that I'm going to teach you some
stuff so listen long very closely
because you're probably going to mess
this up go to google.com it's a website
type in X a.m. PP and type in search the
first thing says if Apache friends click
it now this will give you a list of all
the different ph PS you can download
most of you will be clicking windows now
click it and download it now it's very
easy to download you just got to click
Next like 40 times
if you've ever downloaded anything in
your life then you can figure it out and
if you can't figure it out then just
stop watching this video and go do
something else so once you have it
downloaded you're going to have this
little thing right here called the
control panel double click it
mine's already open so when you
double-click it you're going to get
something like this that says Apache
MySQL this means that you download it or
write if you can see this now if you see
if you go into your notepad editor and
you just start typing PHP it won't work
under this right here where it says
Apache you have to click start and when
it says running you're good to go
that's what it stands for the running
stands for start making some PHP I know
you want to think that but Italy does
but you're not ready yet pay attention
pay close attention because I know a
bunch of guys are going to screw this up
too click on file then click on open now
click on my computer and find your hard
drive you're going to have a folder in
that says XMPP now you want to click
that now see all this stuff right here
but the one you're looking for is called
H T double click that and this is where
we're going to be making all our
websites so make a file and save it as a
PHP file
I saved mine is tester page.php make
sure it's in that exact location now
Oh what the heck is this oh my god
that's embarrassing anyways here's what
you want to do as you see you can start
typing PHP now oh man are you kidding me
whoa oh I'll review it anyways go to
that go to your harddrive htdocs
and click on your page now you can start
type in your PHP but once you go to run
it won't show up so here's what you need
to do and this is the same for everybody
go to HTTP colon backslash backslash
local host backslash now whatever you
saved your file as I save mine is tester
page dot pH PHP so after that click
tester page dot PHP click go now as you
can see this is my PHP that you are too
dumb decree right now so I'm going to be
teaching you guys that next time so
again whatever you saved your file as go
to localhost test your page that PHP and
substitute tester page with your name
now once you get this as you can see I
click echo what up I can type Greg Fred
just save it and now when you refresh it
you got your PHP right there now all of
you idiots who are trying to type it in
notepad before and wondering why it
wasn't working
hopefully I just solved your problem in
the next tutorial I'm going to be
teaching guys how to use some PHP so
watch it see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
