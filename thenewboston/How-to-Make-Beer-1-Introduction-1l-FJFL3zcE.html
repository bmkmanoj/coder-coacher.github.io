is bucky roberts and in these videos i'm
going to be teaching you how to make
beer now believe it or not beer is
incredibly easy to make a lot of people
whenever i teach them how to make beer
for the first time they're amazed at how
easy it is so basically what you do is
just like you're making anything else in
the kitchen a cake or a pie you follow a
recipe and you end up with beer is that
easy so if you can heat up mini ravioli
on your own without having to ask your
mom and dad for help then you can
probably make beer now of course the
only thing that'll probably limit you is
the equipment that you need to get
started but once you have all the
equipment it's actually cheaper to make
your own beer than to buy in a store and
aside from that it tastes a lot better
so once you start making your own home
brews and tasting them you're going to
wonder why you were ever drinking that
crap in a store now the last thing I
want to mention before I get started
showing you guys how to make beer is
that even though all the equipment and
all the ingredients are legal to buy if
you're under 21 or whatever the legal
drinking age is wherever you live you
should not be brewing your own beer or
drinking alcohol if you're under the
legal drinking age so again like I said
even though all the ingredients are easy
to get legal to buy and all the
equipment is also legal to buy for
anyone you should not be making your own
beer and you should not be drinking your
own beer that you made or any alcohol
under the legal drinking age
now before we start mixing bunch crap
together let me go ahead and talk about
the supplies you need in order to get
started the very first thing you need is
beer if you aren't drinking the beer
while you're making beer it's not going
to work so make sure you have a glass of
beer and there are many different ways
to get ingredients some people like to
brew everything from scratch go out and
buy each individual ingredient but for
people starting out I highly recommend
getting a recipe tip whenever you get a
recipe kit online what you do is you
just pick your kit and mine is I think
it's I think this one is I can actually
American wheat beer so what it comes
with is everything you need to get
started so then you don't have to buy
the syrup and the hops individually so
the recipe kit that we're looking at
right here this is what it included this
is called malt syrup now it does a lot
of different things and I'm going to be
talking about it in detail later on just
remember that there are a lot of sugars
in this syrup easy to remember now all
of your kids are also going to come with
something called hops now these two
packs are different kind of hops and you
add them at different times during the
brewing process and again there's a lot
to cover involving hops but just
remember for right now that they add to
the aroma and also the flavor of the
beer now this is yeast
you always need yeast when you're making
beer and every kit comes with hops some
kind of extract or we'll talk about the
alternative to that later on in each
yeast is basically what makes alcohol in
your beer what it's going to do is it's
going to convert the sugars in this to
alcohol so if you don't add yeast to
your beer you're going to have
non-alcoholic beer so if that's what you
want then you know don't have the yeast
but we want alcohol in our beer so make
sure to get yeast now the last thing
that your kit includes is some kind of
priming sugar and we're going to be
talking more about this whenever we
bottle our beer but just hold on the
left right now now the last thing
whenever you buy a recipe kit that
comes with of course aside from all of
the ingredients our recipe now each
different recipe you know it has
different things like maybe you need to
add different hops or boil something for
a different amount of time that's where
your recipe comes in handy this is your
little cheat sheet and it tells you
exactly how and when to add all the
ingredients</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
