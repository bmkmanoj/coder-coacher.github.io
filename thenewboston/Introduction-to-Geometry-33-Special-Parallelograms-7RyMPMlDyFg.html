rhombuses and squares which are all
special kinds of parallelograms so for
each one of these the rules of a
parallelogram also apply so opposite
sides are still congruent opposite sides
are still parallel opposite angles are
congruent and consecutive angles are
supplementary so each one of those
things is still true but there's also
more into them so a rectangle is a
parallelogram with four right angles so
that means in a rectangle every one of
its angles are congruent not just
opposite angles so all angles are
congruent with their measure equal to 90
degrees because they're right angles so
diet' diagonals of a rectangle are
congruent which is a new thing before we
just knew that they cut each other in
half now for a rectangle we know that
they're congruent so for a rhombus it's
a parallelogram with four congruent
sides so the sides are still congruent
but it just means consecutive
consecutive sides are also congruent
and the diagonals are perpendicular
which means when they intersect each
other they form a right angle so they
form four triangles when you draw both
diagonals in they form for right
triangles on the inside of the rhombus
so last we have a square and the square
is a parallelogram with four right
angles and four congruent sides so
basically a square is a combination of a
rectangle and a rhombus so because it's
a combination of a rectangle and a
rhombus everything that's true for a
rectangle and true for a rhombus is true
for a square so these diagonals are
congruent so they have equal lengths and
they're perpendicular to one another so
when you write the diagonals of a square
in they're gonna form for right
triangles that are also congruent on the
inside of the square so now we're going
to do some true or false questions so a
square is a rectangle and aramis well if
we look if we go back to what a square
is it has four right angles which is
true of a rectangle and it has four
congruent sides which is which is true
of aramis therefore number one is true
so number two a rhombus is always a
square if we go back a rhombus is a
parallelogram with four congruent sides
but a square has four congruent sides
and four right angles so number two is
false a rectangle is also a square if we
go back and look at what it rectangle is
it's a parallelogram with four right
angles but a square also has to have
four congruent sides so a rectangle is
not also a square so make sure you come
back and watch the next video where we
talk about other kinds of parallelograms
called a trapezoid</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
