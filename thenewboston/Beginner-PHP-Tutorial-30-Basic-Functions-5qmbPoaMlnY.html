academy' de org creating this PHP video
for the new Boston now in this video I'm
going to be talking loosely about
functions why they're useful in PHP or
in fact any other programming language
and also how we can create a function
and use a function within our page now
first of all what is a function a
function is something that allows us to
declare a block of code that we might
want to reuse we can feed in parameters
to this more arguments as they're
sometimes referred to or usually
referred to and then we can use this at
different parts in our code to save us
we type in code out and as per the named
functions they will do something so you
know they will do something that will
allow you to declare them and then reuse
them over and over
so the standard syntax for a function is
function we have two brackets and then
we have a block here denoted by two
curly brackets and opening and closing
now inside here will go out arguments in
this video I'm not going to be dealing
with arguments I'm just going to show
you how we're using a function and how
to call it so we already know that a
function is used to speed up basically
our writing of our program by keeping
some code that's going to let us or
declaring the function and a lot of code
now what we haven't done is given this
function a name I forgot to mention that
we're going to give this function a name
and this is going to be called my name
you can write it any way you want
small with camel caps anything really so
we'll use a capital m and a capital and
just so we can see so it's really
important that you name your functions
well my name doesn't really tell you
what I'm going to do but you know it it
it could it could do it might not it
depends on who the if you're writing to
an audience say you people are gonna see
your code as long as you know what it is
and if it's staying personal to you
that's absolutely fine so in this I'm
just going to simply echo out
Alex now let's just suppose in my code
bring this down I want to I want to echo
out Alex a few times so for example and
echo my name is and I want to break down
now I'm just going to call my function
my name down here now what this is going
to do is it's going to echo out my name
is it's going to line break down and
then it's going to call this function we
call it simply by its name and then just
two brackets like that arguments would
usually go in here but in this purpose
of this short tutorial I'm not talking
about arguments and then as always we
end with a semicolon so the the result I
want from this is to echo out my name
basically after this sentence here so
let's test if it works we refresh and
you can see it says my name is Alex now
obviously we could take away this line
break and just include a space here and
you can see that it has exactly the same
use this is obviously a useless function
it would be a lot easier to declare it
or not declare it but type my name over
and over again if I needed to but this
example just demonstrates how to create
a basic function and what it does I mean
for example in our function we could
want we might want to echo out a
specific variable and that we don't want
to keep read eclair in in our page but
then again that might be useless as well
so I mean functions can be used for
different things obviously depending on
your program you just have to think
logically about it but for now this is
an example of how to you declare a
function I've talked about why they're
useful and in the next video we're going
to look at passing arguments to
functions to create something that's
maybe a bit more of use</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
