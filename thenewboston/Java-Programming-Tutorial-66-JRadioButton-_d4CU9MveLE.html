Java tutorial and in this tutorial we're
going to be making a GUI with radio
buttons on it and what a radio button is
it's kind of like a check box but the
only difference is it you can only have
one radio button selected at a time
so if you have 4 radio buttons and
they're side to side if one selected and
then you click another one
the other one automatically Dee selects
and they actually got their name from
the older radios I guess I don't even
know if I was alive during this time but
evidently the old radios when you press
the one button all the other buttons
would pop out so you can only have one
button select at a time so that's your
real quick tutorial on what we're doing
and also a little tutorial on
old-fashioned automobiles so you know
the Saiga 2 for one so let's go ahead
and start making this right here we're
going to have let's see like 10 variable
variables or something to start out the
first variable we need is something
called a J text field and this is just
the same one from less storoe and I'll
just name this TF like last time and
this is pretty much going to be the
field that stores a text if you couldn't
tell and next we're going to have a
private a font variable and we're going
to have four types of fun we're going to
have plain font we're going to have bold
font and we'll name that be F best
friend and we will have another font
called italic font and you can't write
if like this because if is a key word so
you got to write ITF that might be
confusing but eh we'll get through it
and then lastly we're going to have a
font that's both bold and italic so I'm
going to put bold italic font vif bit
it's pretty cool-looking variable biff i
got named more stuff biff next we're
going to have 4 radio buttons and these
are the buttons I was talking about so
let's go private and there's J radio
button just like that and I'm going to
name my first bun plain button and when
you click this button it's going to give
you that plain font right there so now
let me copy this because I'm lazy
and make four more or excuse me three
more next I'm going to have a bold
button BB next I'm going to have an
italic button and I'm named IB and next
I'm going to have a bold italic button
name bib so now this plane gives you
plain file bold font italic font bold
and italic font when you click these
buttons and the last variable we're
going to be using in this tutorial it's
actually a group variable so let's go
ahead and write private button group and
you can name it anything you want I'm
going to name my group for simplicity
and what this group is going to do this
is pretty much going to establish a
relationship so that only one button can
be selected at a time if we didn't have
them related they know pretty much
before separate buttons on your screen
each acting independently we wanted me
each be part of a family so that way
they can know when each other's clicked
in each other's on clicks or select it
or deselect it if you prefer that
so now enough for the variables let's go
ahead and start making our constructor
public GUI won't take any parameters and
let's go ahead and start making the body
the first thing that we're going to want
to add in our constructor is of course
the title like always and I will name
mine the title pretty cool huh
and the next thing I want is the layout
so I'm going to put set layout and of
course in here since we don't know
anything else new new small flow layout
just like that looks good so now we got
a title and a layout on our window what
else can we do to this well let's go
ahead and add that text field that I
talked to you guys about and I named it
TF if you guys forgot and I'm going to
set it equal to Nu J text field and this
field needs to be capitalized and for my
parameters I'm going to first have
what's in the text field
so I'm pub lucky is awesome and hots
that's what I you know that's what girls
usually say to me
walking down the street but anyways and
25:4 sighs and now we just need to add
this text field to the screen because
that we definitely want that to show up
so now we got a title a layout in the
text field just chillin on our screen so
what else can we add well we probably
want to put those buttons on there so
I'm going to take that PB which is that
plain button I'm going to set it equal
to nu J J radio button just like that
and the parameters for a button is first
what do you want appear to the right of
the button I'm just going to have plain
since it's plain font and I'm going to
set this equal to true now hold on and
let me H my ear Oh feels good oh I get
in there now the parameters it takes for
true and false that are pretty much true
is checked and false is unchecked so if
we're stabbing a relationship we can
only have one true at a time so the
first thing we want to do is set one of
them to true and later on it's going to
do automatically for us when you click
it but for now let's just go ahead and
copy this and the rest of them are going
to be false by the way since we only
want one checked at a time because
that's kind of the concept of radio
button the next bold button is going to
be equal to nu J radio button we'll put
this equal to bold and we'll put this
equal to false now after let's go ahead
and copy this one make a life a little
bit easier so now we have two buttons
created now let's go ahead and what do
we name this other one italic button for
IB purpose should named it a little more
descriptive but and we'll name this
italic and this will be the text chillin
next to the button now set this equal to
false - and our less button is named bib
bold and italic button so we'll just
have like bold and italic sitting next
to it so now that we created these four
button objects we can go ahead and add
the screen using ad and PB this should
make this so you can add multiple ones
at one time but I don't think they do so
add BB add IB
and add what else we got here BIP BIP
BIP BIP there that's enough that so now
we pretty much created four buttons and
we actually added them to the screen so
that they showed up now like I said
before the last variable we had it was
this button group right here so that's
what we're going to be doing right here
right now we're going to be setting an
object just called group and we're going
to be setting equal to new button group
like that and this doesn't take any
parameters for a constructor and what
this group is going to do is anytime you
add an element to the group it's going
to add it pretty much to the group
pretty confusing huh so let's go ahead
and group add and the first thing we're
going to want to add is the PB which is
the plain button so now this group has
one button in it so let's go ahead and
add another one group add dot b b now
the group has two buttons in it think
you see where this is going
group dot add I be sorry has be in there
for us pretty cool and group dot add and
first one excuse me the last one bib so
now our family has four buttons in it
and we were wondering all right how come
we needed a group them we need to group
them so that they know when each other
is checked and when each other is not
checked since we group these they
automatically by default know that when
one of these is checked the rest of us
has to turn off so that way only one
button can be checked at a time it's
pretty cool functionality that they you
know built that in for us and we don't
have to talk to each other for us so the
last thing I'm probably going to be
doing in this tutorial is just setting
the font which is up here P FBF ITF and
bi F this is pretty much the fonts that
I'm going to set and I need these fonts
to pass in later so the first thing the
plain font is going to happen when you
click that plain button and it's going
to be equal to new font and in your
parameters for font first type
Seraph and lastly font the plane and
give it like a size of 14 or something
looks good and now let's go ahead and do
this for the other one so there's for me
let me think plain font bold font italic
font so plain for bold font italic font
bold attack bar so plain font bold font
italic font and vif right yup looks good
to me so now this is going to be font
dot bold for the bold italic fonts going
to be italic and the bold and italic
fonts going to be fun dot bold
plus font daunt italic just like that so
now we got our four fonts on the screen
well not yet but um that's it for this
tutorial so I'm going to catch up with
next tutorial
don't forget to watch it don't forget to
subscribe it's going to be awesome it's
going to be amazing so thank you guys
for watching and I'll see you next
