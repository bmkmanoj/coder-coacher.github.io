look at this this is looking fantastic a
billion dollar website already but it
definitely needs some CSS I don't know
maybe I want to change all these
headings to blue or something so
remember our CSS actually goes in the
static directory so this is just a
static file it doesn't change so I'm
going to right click this in hit new
style sheets and I'm just going to name
this style CSS you can actually name it
any CSS that you want it doesn't matter
because we specify it later on so I'm
just going to style that CSS and let me
just write some quick CSS in here oh
wait what heading was this alright so
we'll change the color of headings
heading one just so I don't know in what
school color actually let me pick one of
these mmm no okay deep sky blue there we
go alright so we have the CSS file that
says all heading ones are deep sky blue
because our boss selected this and he's
like this is beautiful but I wish that
this was deep sky blue we got this we
can through this alright so now if we
just run this right here nothing what
happened because we need to specify for
profile to HTML use this file right
there how do we do that well so glad you
asked what you can do is you can add
link rel stylesheet and this is just you
know not flash just basic HTML now for
type text/css okay nothing new now you
may be thinking okay so this is the
point where I actually link to the CSS
file so I'm just going to go like static
and then style slash CSS but what you
actually want to do is you actually want
to call a flask function from here all
right now why you do this is going to
make sense in just a second but the
function is called URL underscore 4 so
we want a URL for
attic is the first parameter and the
second one is just the file name so file
name is equal to if I can type style CSS
alright so remember this isn't a
hard-coded URL it's actually dynamic and
what it's doing is it's getting the URL
for the static it already knows where
that is and inside that directory is a
file called style.css that's what we
want to do so now if I go ahead and run
this bad boy again check it out
let me go ahead and refresh it and there
you go and if we actually look at the
source code we see that what it did is
it generated that URL for us but now
we're scratching our head thinking you
know what it was kind of a pain in but
typing you know this entire Python
function when we could have just as
easily have written this so you know
what F that row Bucky I'm just gonna you
know write my pass right in my HTML
templates seems a lot easier that way
well the cool thing about doing it this
way is a lot of the time whenever you're
making a website what you're going to do
is you're going to actually maybe move
the CSS to another location move all
these style sheets around and whenever
you do that all of your templates are
going to get messed up let's say that
you had 50 different templates you're
going to have to go through every single
file and say ok now update this update
this update this a million times however
what you can actually do is if you throw
in this function then later on I'm going
to be showing you guys how to change the
default static directory in one line of
code and you only have to update it in
one place and then all of your templates
still work perfectly so it may look like
you know kind of unnecessary and pain in
the butt right now
but trust me guys whenever you're
building a large web application you
want to set up this way this is a
standard flask way to do it and well
there you go so that is how not only use
HTML templates but how you
also use static files like CSS and other
in your flask web application so as
always think as for watching don't
forget subscribe I'll see you guys next
