we understand the foundation of link
building the next thing we have to
figure out is well how the heck do we
actually do this how do we get a bunch
of links pointing to our website well
the first thing that I always recommend
is setting up social network or social
media accounts whatever you want to call
them and that includes of course your
github x' your facebook your google+ uh
in some of the lesser known ones that
you may not think of like twitter and by
the way in terms of social networking
sites that i use i never use sites like
Pinterest and Tumblr and I never use
like LinkedIn either but do I have
profiles set up on those social networks
you bet I do why is that it's because
whenever you set up a profile on any of
these sites whether it's Facebook
Twitter or whatever
99% of the time they're going to let you
post the link to your website on their
profile page so it does a couple things
first of all it helps connect with
people your customers so on and so forth
it builds your brand and also gives you
that nice juicy backlink and by the way
if I ever say backlink a backlink and
SEO is just a link on another site
pointing to your site so this is just a
link to somewhere else on my own website
this is a backlink it links back to the
new Boston so again they're all links
just backlink is on another site so I
don't want to confuse you guys so there
you go set up a bunch of social network
accounts another thing that I want to
mention of course most important thing
is just create awesome content so make
sure that you just create something make
sure that your site is actually useful
this is the best way if you create an
awesome site that's either funny or
educational people are just going to
post links to it naturally whether you
want to or not
so the next thing you need to think
about is why would anyone ever link to
my site
besides you know if you just have to pay
them what is the reason that people
naturally link to web page as well just
think about it
I share links with my friends of
something
funny ah you know tweet it to them or I
send it to him through text or maybe if
I think something's real funny then I'll
post it on you know one of my profile
pages Facebook or my website another
thing is if something's useful so I like
using reddit a lot and I'm subscribed
like a bunch of programming subreddits
so if I find you know a really useful
Python tutorial I'm going to post it on
the Python forum so funny useful and
also if something's just a resource that
I'm like um I don't know maybe I thought
that this post was really helpful and I
want to come back to it maybe I'm gonna
post the link somewhere so I just don't
lose it in that way if I ever am like
hey I want to figure out how to do that
one thing in Python again I have that
link somewhere so those are all reasons
that people actually share links so just
don't make a web page but I hope people
share this link you actually need to
think about this so there you go another
thing that you can do is you can
actually email bloggers and website
owners so let's say that you're trying
to set up arm let's say that you're
trying to sell some t-shirts
I'm going to go fashion your view blog
so right here a list of the top 50
fashion blogs so people who make or own
fashion review blogs they actually are
looking for content so if you just
develop these really you know unique and
interesting t-shirts then it actually
helps both of you out so email on back
hey if you can review this site then
they're going to review it post link to
your thing there you go maybe you're
making this new iOS app or Android app
do like Android app review so look at
who reviews Android apps well all of
these people right here so you might
wanna email PCMag or you know whatever
digital trends calm CNET bike hey can
you guys review my Android app and there
you go free links for everyone now
another cool thing that I can recommend
is
if you have a site that you think people
are going to be linking to a lot make it
really easy for them to link to it so
let's say that all right this is my most
popular tutorial in the world people are
probably going to want to link this well
what I can do is I can have some graphic
or logo or you know that Facebook and
Twitter always has these social share
buttons
you basically have to click at once and
it makes a link well if you can do that
make some cool graphic or logo Beck hey
if you want to link to this and put on
your blog just copy it and paste it over
that way you're making it is easy as
possible for them for them to link to
your site now what I need to do now is
talk to you guys about what not to do so
what you definitely don't want to do is
let's say a Android forum say you're
trying to promote some Android app you
just don't want to go sign up at every
single Android forum and copy and paste
the same thing with 50 of your links in
it this is how do I call it I I guess
I'll call it search engine suicide this
is going to absolutely kill your ranking
if you ever do anything that looks like
spam then it's going to absolutely shoot
your website in the face spamming is a
lot different than actually signing up
for this forum participating being part
of the community and just you know
having a link on your profile that's
what you should do just don't go and
spam out or else guys is going to
absolutely kill your website another
thing that you guys are going to be very
tempted to do is go on these sites like
Fiverr or they're a bunch of them like
those and just buy a bunch of backlinks
I'm going to show you what's going to be
tempting so if you just go to this and
type in backlinks there are ads where
you can get like 10,000 links for five
bucks you can probably get like 30,000
backlinks and what these people are
going to do is they're going to go
whatever method they have and just start
plopping your link in this like default
article just posting it around the web
on every forum that they have whatever
their BOTS do
and guys I know that this is incredibly
tempting because there's so many links
you guys may think it just might boost
your website through the roof do not do
this it's incredibly tempting but so is
heroin now the truth is this these
people on these sites they're going to
do exactly what they told you to they
are going to post 10,000 20,000 30,000
links but the thing is you do not want
10,000 links all at once you do not want
10,000 links on pages that are not
popular or completely irrelevant to your
page so what Google is going to see
whenever this happens is hey this person
has like a site it's been grown steadily
and then suddenly they have 10,000 links
and that sudden influx of links is
incredibly unnatural it's unhealthy and
all of these sites are also irrelevant
so this guy is probably doing something
shady so it's better to just let your
links build naturally over time so
follow these tutorials they are watching
right now set it up in a nice non shady
kind of way and that's going to give you
the best results so again you know what
the best analogy I can think of is you
know whenever you're stranded in the
ocean is going to be really tempting
just to drink the salt water it's going
to seem really great at the time but
what drinking salt water actually does
is it's going to kill you faster than if
you never drink it at all because it
dehydrates you so guys don't carry
yourself in an ocean don't kill your
site don't just buy fifty thousand
backlinks now another thing I want to
point out is that these sites like
Fiverr these are actually really cool
websites now if you type SEO there are a
bunch of really awesome people that can
help you out legitimately with SEO and
what they're going to do is they're
basically going to do for your site what
I'm teaching you guys right now all the
proper techniques all of the things that
hey you might want to change this title
around might want to target these
keywords so if you can find those people
then I recommend it these are these guys
are usually pretty cheap compared to
everywhere else and there's some really
quality people on here
again if it sounds too good to be true
guys I'm telling you it is don't commit
suicide for your site
or don't murder your site before even
has a chance so the last thing that I'm
going to point out is this whenever
you're building links to your site
don't just target one single page so you
may think all right I'm going to try to
build a bunch of backlinks and I'm going
to just point them all to the home page
the most important page on my website
what you should do whenever you're
trying to build links is have links to
your relevant pages so maybe if I am
part of some Android forum or Java forum
I'm going to post the link to this my
job videos maybe I am I don't know part
of like another Python community on
reddit so what I'm going to do instead
of just posting it to my home page is
I'm actually going to post the link to
the Python forum right here so again
relevant pages on other web sites should
point to relevant pages on your web
sites whenever Google sees that and sees
that content on both of those pages are
relevant and they're connected via link
you're going to get a huge boost it's
going to be awesome so again a lot of
good advice on how to build links
naturally in guys like I said again if
it sounds too good to be true then it
probably is so make sure to do it
legitimately for the best results thank
you guys for watching I will smell you
