objective-c tutorial and in this
tutorial we're gonna be going over
something called external and global
variables so you know there's your intro
let's go ahead and jump right into it
so we're going to be building a bunch of
stuff in the tune of class so go ahead
and import tuna right now so we have it
when we need it and we don't forget to
put it in later on but anyways let's go
ahead and make a global variable right
now
and say we're gonna build program to
like change the drinking age of I don't
know the you know it really doesn't
matter the variable I just want to name
a variable drunk so I'm gonna set this
equal to 21 so it's something we
remember and everyone can remember the
drinking age so here's what I did in my
main program and I said main program but
it's whatever class has my main method
in it I made this variable called drunk
right at the top of it and what this
does is it makes it global that means
any method inside this file has access
to this variable pretty cool huh
but what I also did is I also made it
external by doing this and when you make
an external variable this means that any
other file if it has some special syntax
in front of it then that other class can
access this variable too so this is
pretty cool because this is something
we've never seen before not only can we
access the variable from in here what
you know it was kind of expected but
also from other classes like this class
- all right that's pretty cool so let's
go ahead and oh another thing I forgot
to say anytime you're making external
variables or global variables you it's
preferred to put this lowercase G in
front of the variable name that way you
can easily identify your global
variables and I didn't make that up
that's not just my personal preference
that's common practice and Objective C
programming but anyway so let's go ahead
and print this out just make sure it
works and hold on I got a Chinmayi
ah there we go I always get itchy in my
left ear when I'm making soils why I
don't know
send me your theories maybe I'll figure
it out so let's go ahead and press % eye
and let's just go ahead and print out G
drunk whoa easy caps there we go that's
a bit better so let's go ahead and build
and run this save all and check it out
we have 21 pronounced screen nothing new
another itch really geez is there like a
piece of hair in my headphones or
something all right
so again obviously we just access to one
variable from inside here printed it out
nothing special but now let's go ahead
and go to the tune the class right here
and in the interface what we're going to
be doing is we don't want to build any
variables we just want to build one
method it's going to be void it's not
going to return anything and let's just
go ahead and name it like change
variable like that and it's not even
going to take any parameters so now
let's copy that
so in our implementation file whenever
you implemented what do we want the body
to do well in order to access outside
global variables and this one's name G
drunk what we need to do is let me call
my implementation what we need to do is
first make an external declaration and
this means alright we're gonna give you
a variable but don't look inside this
file look inside an outside file so
let's go ahead and do that the syntax
for this e xt e r n that's it not
external I know it's weird I mean might
as well write the whole word word but
you know that's how they did it just
right X turn and then go ahead and write
int G drunk and that's all you have to
do in this external declaration means
that all right this variable drunk
it isn't in this file so it's external
global variable so you know you need to
give the declaration before you start
working with it so now that we have
access
to it from an outside file we can go
ahead and drunk and change the drinking
age to thirteen of course so now
whenever we call this method change of
our it goes and gets a variable from an
outside method and changes the variable
in this case at the drinking age so
let's go ahead and where's my main class
right there and we'll keep this one
right here so we make sure we don't mess
anything up and remember that was all
written in the tune of class so tuna
I'll make an object called fish pretty
clever right yeah just thought that
myself no big deal but anyways let's go
ahead and allocate some space the tuna
initialize the fish and let's go ahead
and remember it was called fish change I
think it was called change var but all
I've seen a little but if I get error
message or not and so now with this
method dud dud wth is that what this
method did is change the variable to 13
so now this global variable even though
it was declared in this class is 21 we
can change it to 13 from an outside
class pretty cool so now let's go ahead
and oh we have this little neat little
code we can just copy this and paste it
right there and I mean oh I guess I need
to release my fish-catching release and
uh let's see I think we're good to go so
let's go ahead and build and run this
save it and see what we got we got 21 by
default that's what it was and then from
the outside class it changed it to 13
pretty cool huh
so here's what we did one last time
super quick recap we made a variable in
this class an external variable named G
drunk set it equal to 21 when we made an
external variable we said all right as
long as you give me the declaration you
can use it from any class you want in
this case the tune the class what this
did is it gave the Declaration and it
changed it to thirteen from an outside
class and then when we called it back in
the main method this method was the one
that changed it to thirteen
this is well it just printed it out and
then we really start fish because you
know catch and release so thank you guys
for watching that's all I have for you
for this tutorial I'm gonna be taking
all of this source code and putting it
in the link below if you want to go get
it it's free so thank you for watching
don't forget subscribe and I will see
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
