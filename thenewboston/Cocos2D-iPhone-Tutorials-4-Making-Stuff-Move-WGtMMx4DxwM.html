welcome to your oh man I don't even know
what number torial this is should
probably you know think about that
before I just started talking in my
microphone but oh well anyways welcome
to some numbered store 09 poor and the
important thing is I'm going to teach
you guys about something today and that
is how to move sprites around on their
screen so you see here that we have two
images one of a pig one of a hot chick
and they're just chillin on our screen
but the cool thing about games is we can
actually take these sprites and move
them around so I actually was going to
create this tutorial yesterday or last
night but something really awesome
happened me someone stole my credit card
information and tried to buy sixty seven
hundred dollars worth of modal
motorcycle parts so you know I had
called my credit card company Mike it
wasn't me so anyways they took care of
it are sending me a new credit card so
you know I'm good now so with that being
said I just want to say if the person
who stole my information is listening if
I ever meet you I'm going to drop kick
you in the throat so anyways on with
tutorial in the last tutorial we coded
all this right here so we're going to be
starting our coding inside our if
statements though but after what we
coated last time make sure you keep this
in here because this is the code that
adds the images or sprites to the screen
so go ahead and the first thing you need
type is this self scheduled at selector
and the parameter for this is you can
name your method anything you want can
name on call every frame and it's going
to take a parameter so go ahead and put
a colon and your semicolon n line now
ever saying all right WTF does this all
mean why did I just like that self of
course means look in this class for the
method and the schedule at selector call
every frame first of all call every
frame is a method that we didn't create
yet that's what we're going to be doing
next so
don't worry about this now this schedule
at selector stuff what this means is
scheduled this method call every frame
to be called every frame so yeah that's
why I named it that so for saying re I
don't even know what the heck I frame is
I guess and that was a good time to talk
about it is any so in cocos2d your
project is going to be composed of
scenes in frames now just like in a
movie a frame is basically a still image
or a point in time now check this out in
a movie and in cocos2d once you have a
still image and you have another still
image that's different from it and you
have another still image that's
different from it whenever you play them
one after another after another it
creates the illusion of animation or
motion since this is how you can take a
bunch of still images and put them after
each other and create the illusion of
animation if you ever saw stop animation
that's pretty much what they're doing
here so go ahead in youtube and type in
stop animation in your understand what
i'm talking about it's just a bunch of
frames one after each other or go ahead
and Google frames or anything but
anyways that's all I'm giving you we got
a tutorial to do so go ahead and copy
this make sure we don't type it wrong
and we can go ahead and begin coding
this method so this method is of course
I move my keyboard void why does it do
that whenever I tell you void it puts a
P at the end and go ahead and paste that
right there call every frame and as a
parameter it's going to take the
parameter CC time and just go ahead and
name it DT for a difference in time now
what DT is going to represent is the
difference in time from when this method
was last called and you'll see why we
need this later on so any time you want
to create the illusion of a sprite
moving I guess it won't be illusion i
guess the spray is actually going to
move but anyways
any time you want to move the sprite
what you need to do is simply give it a
new position and then what it's going to
do is it's going to get rid of that old
position a racist freighter it was and
put it in a new position in of course
this is going to you know animate your
straight moving it from the old position
to the new position that's like the
definition animation right there so how
do we give the spray a new position
check this out easiest thing you've ever
done in your life chick position set it
equal to nu CCP which is of course the
point chick dot position X and what we
want to do is plus 100 times that
difference in time and let me finish
this line of code before I start talking
check the position doubt why all right
so what is going to happen here is this
chick image is going to move left and
right but it's not going to move up and
down see we are only changing the
exposition of it not the Y so the Y
remains constant you'll see later on but
anyways why did i write 100 times change
in time well by doing this you really
have to just understand that I can't
really explain this too well but this
ensures that your spray moves a hundred
frames or excuse me 100 pixels a second
regardless of frames rate of frame rate
and that it moves at a constant speed
regardless if your iPhone skips a frame
or isn't running at exactly the right
frame rate so check this out like for
example if this method if the difference
in time is point to it would be point 2
x 100 eccles 20 if it's point 5 it would
be point five times 100 and this equals
50 and again like I said when you use
the difference in time like this it
pretty much ensures that it moves at a
constant speed regardless of frame rate
BAM that's all I'm talking about or else
I'm going to run time if I try to talk
about this more
so now what we want to do is say this
all right we got our chick image and
it's moving from left to right but once
it moves all the way off the screen to
the right we want you to reset to the
left so this is actually going to be
like a big loop so my image my chick
image is 60 pixels by 60 pixels so
remember whenever you create a point
that positioning point it's in the
center of that image it's not like the
bottom left or the top ray it's in the
center so you a lot of times when
working with sprites you want to work
with half of that value which is in this
case 30 you'll see what's going on here
so if the condition is this chick dot
position dot X if it's greater than 480
which is the length of your iphone
screen plus 30 which is half the length
of my image and if you just downloaded
image from google or something yours
might be a little different but you know
you can probably use 30 for this
tutorial and it'll be fine all right so
basically what we're saying is if the
chick moves off the screen to the right
what do we want to do we need to write
code to just reset it to the left easy
chick position set it equal to new point
ccp whoa not CC bracket ccp there we go
negative 30 which pretty much means
reset it to the left because you know
the very left most side of your iphone
screen is 0 so if we set it to negative
30 then it's going to be you know barely
visible actually not visible at all yet
it's gonna be off the screens here you
left enough explaining things I'm a
little flustered because my credit card
got stolen but and i saw this really hot
girl food line today but i was too would
be to talk to her so you know anyways
don't mind me chick dot
position dot why because you know the up
and down values it remains the same so
now let's go ahead and run this in you
might be able to finally understand what
the heck I've been talking about all
this time all right so check this out
the check is moving left to right once
it moves to the right it restarts at the
left and of course the Y position which
is up and down it doesn't change it all
so that's why she's not moving up and
down she's only moving left and right
once she gets there right hand side of
the screen she restarted to the left so
let's quit the iphone stimulator and in
layman's terms here's what's going on we
created this method and it says called
this method pretty much every frame now
this is a you know of course the name
the header what we're doing right here
is we're giving a new position which
we're pretty much saying all right move
it to the right slightly and what this
checks right here is as saying all right
if your chick is off the screen to the
right so we can't see her anymore take
her and put her to the left again so you
know if you're confused at all by what
I'm saying just go ahead and you know
mute this tutorial and just look at the
code and if you look at it for like five
seconds you're understand easier or more
simply what this code is doing so
anyways that is the basics of how you
move sprites and if you ever see code
using CC time in dt that's why they're
doing this rather than you know just
write in code without it because it
ensures that you're moving at a constant
speed regardless of frame rate so I
wanted to teach that because by common
practice it's what every programmer does
so now once you see code like that won't
get lost so um anyways thank you guys
for watching i am going to uh uh no
probably go make some macaroni and
cheese so yeah that's that I have
nothing to say at all go check out my
forum if your boat board and uh yeah I
wish I had something else to say but you
know close out of this tutorial what do
you still listening for I'll see you
next time see it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
