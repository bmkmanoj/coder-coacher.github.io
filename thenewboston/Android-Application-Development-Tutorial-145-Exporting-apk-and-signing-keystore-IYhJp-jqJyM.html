Android tutorial for the new Boston what
we're going to do in this tutorials get
our actual key for when we're developing
for the marketplace because right now
we're working with our debug key so we
need to get our actual key but before we
do that we need to be able to sign our
project and export it so that's what
we're going to do in this tutorial and
then in the next tutorial we'll actually
get the key and all that good stuff so
let's get into it I know it told you
guys we were done with map stuff well I
kind of lied but kind of dent it because
we're going to program anything I'm
going to teach you guys how to export so
what we're going to do is right click on
our package called Maps go to Android
tools in an export signed application
package and we're going to click our
Maps
make sure it's mountain maps hit next so
we don't have a key store yet so we're
going to say create new key store and
we're going to browse for a location now
what I like to do is go into my
documents and create a folder called
Android apps because we want to remember
where this key store is and we want to
remember where apk file is that we're
going to finish at the end of this
tutorial
and we also need to remember all our
passwords we need to remember pretty
much everything when we want to update
our application on it's been on the
market place or just pretty much
anything we do after we sign it to the
market place the first time we need to
remember where all these locations are
even to get our our actual key for a map
application we're going to remember
where this is so just create a folder
called Android apps and we're going to
say Maps save this as Maps alias or not
alias Maps key store hit enter and then
we need to create a password that we're
going to remember I'm going to say
Travis and hit enter so now that's where
we created our key store and we also
have to create a alias so I'm going to
label mine Maps alias
and again you guys have to remember your
alias and your key store and all those
passwords so just try and keep it simple
now I'm going to say from a password
it's Travis again Travis and validity is
for 1000 years and also you might want
to reference your first name or if you
even want to fill out more information
about yourself you can doesn't really
matter I'm going to give my first name
Travis and hit next and then we need to
assign our APK file to destination so
we're going to hit browse and Android
applications and our APK file is called
maps so hit next
once it's in that folder hit finish and
that basically exports our project so
when we try and upload to the
marketplace or for example in the next
tutorial where we get our our key for
Google Maps activity we're going to
remember those locations and I'll kind
of show you guys how to do that in the
next tutorial so I'll catch you guys in
and have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
