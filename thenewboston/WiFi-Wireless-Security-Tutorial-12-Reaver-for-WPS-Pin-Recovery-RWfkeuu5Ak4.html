video I am going to show you how to
perform WPS pin recovery using a tool
called reverb now I'm guessing that like
90% you already know what WPS is but for
those of you who don't
WPS stands for Wi-Fi Protected setup and
what this is is it's a system that
allows people with you know little
computer experience or router knowledge
to easily set up a Wi-Fi network so
let's just say that you want to have
Wi-Fi to your home so you got the Best
Buy you pick up a router you come home
and let's pretend that you know you
aren't very experienced with computers
so you plug in your router and you open
the box and you see that you have this
thing called a WPS pin so what this
allows you to do is if you go to your
network settings all you have to do is
type in your PIN and you're pretty much
in your router so you can access all the
security settings view the password I
mean that's it so you don't have to
worry about you know some complicated
radius server some pre-shared key
none of that complex stuff just type in
this 8 digit pin and you're golden now
what you should do is if you ever set up
your router this way then as soon as
you're done setting up your password
then you should delete this WPS key but
most people they don't because you know
most people who use this key they like I
said aren't very very familiar with
computers or systems like who is like I
don't know like 5% of people probably so
I'm going to show you guys just how
prevalent it is and how to you know see
the networks in your area that have this
available and there's a lot more to it
but I just want to show you guys the
basics of it and by the way we just type
8 random numbers right there if you guys
are looking at this and you're like ok 8
numbers you know I think I'm gonna stick
with password recovery attacks because
that's a still you know a lot of numbers
to be brute-forcing well lucky for the
people who made this system this number
is actually split into two parts so it's
actually four digits and four digits so
I mean it cuts the brute-force time in
like less than half like a
fraction of the time but again this is
just bonus information let's get to the
fun part so the first thing we need to
do is we need to find a network that has
this WPS still enabled so make sure that
your cards in monitor mode and if you go
to arrow dump ng then right before you
put your monitoring interface then throw
in the option - - WPS so this is just a
flag to show on additional WPS
information about the Wi-Fi networks
around you so hit enter and you see that
we now got this nice new column WPS now
you're going to want to look for
networks that have 1.0 and that means
that this has WPS enabled still so look
at all of them like half of them already
I don't have that online obviously you
shouldn't have it on yours if you do
then you want to disable disable it
a.s.a.p but i mean half maybe more so
I'm just going to stop that right now
and now that we found our targets what
we can do is we can start running this
tool called reverb so reaper is
basically a tool that is going to go
through each pin one by one in
brute-force it and like I said you can
have 0 to 9 or 0 0 0 0 to 9999 so 10000
options and usually a brute-force of
this only takes I don't know a couple
hours so in order to use reverb just
target mine right now just type the word
reverb and then after this you just type
your interface on basic settings so W
land 0 month
that's what interface I want to attack
from and now - B pass in the MAC address
or the bssid of the network you wanna
attack so we'll pretend if I had WPS
enabled then that would be mine and you
also want to specify the channel so it
isn't looking at every other channel so
right now my network is broadcasting on
channel 1 you know there's no use
looking at any other channel you're just
going to waste time now 3 flags I want
to show you guys that I'm going to
recommend that you use all the time are
- f - a and -
w so these are just optional parameters
- F means fixed in other words it's
going to disable channel hopping - a
this just means Auto detect the best
options and these are kind of advanced
for um you know whatever your target
access point is all those Advanced
Options in double - W is what you're
going to do is you're going to mimic a
Windows 7 registrar and if you're right
- V then this is verbose in other words
it gives you some details or display
text on the screen as the schools
running VV means very verbose in other
words it's going to give you just some
more information and what I always do is
I run this first so run - k1 so this is
the kind of quick attack it's called a
pixie attack
now if pixie whenever you do this
pretty much pixie WPS if you're familiar
with that tool the mode is enabled so
it's going to run through all the common
pins and if it doesn't hit then you can
run this tool again like this without it
but I always like to run pixie first
just so I can see you know it just helps
speed it up so let me just run through
these real quick I'm not actually going
to get their pin but basically what it's
going to do is is going to try the
common ones first and then it's going to
just start brute-forcing so sometimes
you're going to see retrying last pin if
you don't have that good of a connection
and sometimes you're going to see
timeout now what this means is you some
routers they don't allow you to just
keep pounding them and pounding them
with these pins so you can only hit it
like once every 30 seconds but a lot of
routers they're just like alright you
can just keep trying so then it's going
to you know try it like every one second
but anyways it's going to go through and
it's going to go pin by pin by pin until
it eventually gets the one that works
now I'm going to stop this because I
really don't want to crack their pin but
the thing is whenever it hits it's going
to stop and it's going to say this is
the pin this is the network it's just
going to give you some more information
and it's going to give you your password
so even if they have an incredibly
complicated
password like this that is essentially
impossible to crack with a dictionary
attack then this WPS pin recovery is
going to get it and I'm not just saying
that Oh
we hope it gets it you know like oh this
may work like a dictionary attack no
it's going to get it every single time
no matter how complicated their password
is so there you go if you want to test
this on your own network again don't do
this on anyone elses network that
doesn't belong to you like I said it's
illegal that's the basics of using
reverb for WPS pin recovery if you want
to recover your own WPS pin then guys
for watching I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
