video and in this video now that we're
done with the user interface what we can
do now is hop over to the header file
for fine crap and we actually don't need
to do much to this file we actually only
need to add one line of code and that's
this if you go in your private right
under this UI fine crap UI object what
we want to do is we want to create a
function later on that's going to be
responsible for loading the text file
because of course we need the text file
that we can search through or else this
program would be useless so void and
we'll just call it get text file and
it's not going to take any parameters
and there you go that's it your header
file is now done so even though we are
done coding in the header file what I
want to do is take some time and go
through line by line what all of this is
because even though queue auto-generated
everything for us it's better if we have
a better understanding of what each line
does so the obvious stuff you know these
the include we already know include
means this namespace right here um a lot
of people may not know what a namespace
is namespace is let you group things
like classes together so if you have
multiple classes that you want to group
together in a namespace you can go ahead
and throw them all in here and it just
makes them easier to work with later on
of course this is our class or here what
else do we need to talk about this queue
object this is actually a macro that
queue says it's pretty much a rule that
we have to follow whenever we are
defining signals or slots queue says
that you need to include this macro
again just a rule that you know we have
to follow under public what do we have
this is just the constructor and the
constructor takes parameter as you can
see and what freaking motorcycle
okay good timing with that motorcycle so
basically what it does is it asks for
the parent but what we did is we set the
parent to zero or null now whenever we
set the parent to no it means that no
parent exists or it has no parent so
basically we're saying okay in the
constructor it has no parent of course
under that is the D constructor which is
basically responsible for cleaning
everything up now in our private slots
and scroll down a little bit the private
slot obviously on go button clicked is
just the user action what happens
whenever they click the Go button make
sense and these last two right here this
UI object is it pretty much is going to
represent the overall interface and of
course the last thing we need to talk
about is this function I already told
you guys what it does whenever we're
running our program we're going to load
in a text file and this is going to be
the function that loads in the text file
so anyways that is pretty much all of
the header stuff we need to take care of
what I wanted to do now is actually jump
into fine craft dot CPP and we can go
ahead and start coding everything so the
first thing I actually like to do before
I start coding anything is I just like
to clean all this up because I don't
like how this is laid out this may be
the proper way but it just annoys me so
I'm going to put that right there and
this right here and also just put my
semicolons actually I'll put this down
here so you guys can see it now I know
this is a you know kind of a waste of
time but it really annoys me if I don't
do this oh sorry guys all right so you
see that we how many functions we have
we have the constructor right here and
then the D constructor and then we have
this function right here which is
basically the function that gets called
whenever the user clicks the bun now
what we wanted to do is since we created
one or declared a function right here in
the header file I want to go ahead and
code that function first so this is
called get text file so let's go ahead
and code this baby so void
find crap : : get text flower right
there now of course it didn't take any
parameters and let me go ahead and give
you guys a little bit more space to see
all right so the first thing that we
need to do is we need of course before I
start talking about code remember what
the program does one more time
it loads in a text file and then you
type in a term and then it searches that
text file for that term for example if
it was a story about Bucky you could
search Bucky and it's going to find
every word Bucky in that story so the
first thing that we need to do is we
need to actually say what text file
do we want to load in now it's a queue
file object and I'll just go ahead and
name it my file and as a parameter um
it's actually the name of your file but
a little bit different what you need to
do is put a colon and then a forward
slash and then whatever the name of your
text file is so you can actually find
any text file any anyone's going to work
but I'll just make up a fake text file
later on called craft about Bucky dot
text and okay looking pretty good so now
what we need to do is we actually need
to open up this file so we can use it
because in this line what we did is we
pretty much you know just stored it in
an object now that we have the object
let's go ahead and do something with it
so my file the function is called open
and as a parameter for this you actually
write Q IO device read-only so that is
how we're going to open up our file is
read-only since we don't need to edit it
or write to it or anything else so now
that we have our v opened up we actually
need to arm convert it to a stream so
book you text stream pop it up right
there and what can I name this I'll just
keep a simple text
Stream</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
