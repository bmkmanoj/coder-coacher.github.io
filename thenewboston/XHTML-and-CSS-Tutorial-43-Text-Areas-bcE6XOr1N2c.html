tutorial and in this story I'm going to
be talking about another form element
and this element is actually called a
text area now a text area the most
simple way I can put it is you know
those single line text fields that we
had before it's just a big text field
now what is the point of having you know
a text area then well certain times when
you're making forms you're going to kind
of want to push your user in leaving
more than a single line of text for
example um if they're like on a dating
website and they need to leave a
biography about themselves or maybe
they're posting an ad on eBay and they
need to write a description about their
item this takes more than a single line
of text so whenever you want the user to
enter like one word give them a single
line of text but whenever you want to
have them enter like a couple paragraphs
you're going to need to give them a text
area so that's where we're going to be
doing in this tutorial so the first
thing that I want to teach you guys is
exactly how to add that text area and
you do that by using the tags can you
guys guess text area and you also end it
with can you guys guess this text area
now of course just like every other tag
it and I really talked about every other
form element it takes the name and let's
go ahead and make that dating website
we'll have this area be the biography
and by the way by default it has you can
have text in it like type something here
and whenever you save this and refresh
it that is the text that appears in the
text area but in general you probably
want to put something about it like tell
me about yourself
right there so now woah actually not
right there embarrassing so tell me
about yourself and then go ahead and add
the line break so it doesn't look weird
and refresh it and check it out so this
would be you know the startup of awesome
dating website where you know you
I know up and now you got to fill in
your biography telling them bragging
about yourself and you know how much
money you make and how good your eyes
look so you know you can go ahead and
delete this and start typing but you
know you're the designer of this website
and you say this is not nearly enough
space for me to brag about myself I need
this to be wider and taller well thank
God you got me because I'm going to show
you how to do that
unlike height and width this attribute
is a little bit different it's actually
made up of rows and columns now the
exact size of these rows and columns I'm
not even sure of myself but I think they
differ from browser to browser but
anyways for if you want it to be taller
you nee need to change the height of the
rows I think it must be like 2 by
default so let's go ahead and push up to
8 and now let's save this in refresh and
check it out our text area now gets why
is this little thing right here
whoa I didn't even know you could do
that that must be something new in
Google Chrome that's pretty cool this is
my first time figuring this out anyways
by default you see that the rows get
taller really texting me in the middle
of its toriel let's see who it is
and Bear Singh I'm not even going to
tell you guys who that was because it is
too embarrassing actually
so anyways rows changes the height of it
and change the width of it just go ahead
and put C OLS this stands for columns
but who the heck wants to type out
columns evidently not the people who
made this up so let's go ahead and
change this to 40 or something and save
it and see what we got
refresh it and now it's 40 columns
however long a column is wide so now you
can see that this is probably enough
area for me to give them a good
biography about myself so what can I say
to persuade the ladies to date me um
well my name is Bucky and I have an
overactive bladder that would probably
persuade them and then I'll you know
drawn the punch line want to get dinner
sometime so this is usually when I go
out that's the line I usually use and it
works about 100% of the time so you know
if you ever get stuck you can use my
line so you're welcome for teaching you
about text areas and you're also welcome
about giving you a good pickup line
whenever you go out to clubs and stuff
so anyways that's all I have for you
guys for this tutorial so I thank you
guys for watching now you know about
text areas now you can move on you have
my blessing so yeah don't forget to
check out my website check out my other
videos and I'll see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
