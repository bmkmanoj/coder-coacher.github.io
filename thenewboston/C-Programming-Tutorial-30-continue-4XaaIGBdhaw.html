I'm going to show you guys another cool
keyword that you can put inside your
loops a little bit different from the
break statement this one is called
continue now what this keyword does is
it pretty much tells your program ignore
the rest of the code that's inside this
loop but don't completely break out of
it just go to the top again and restart
from another iteration or a next cycle
kind of hard to just explain by talking
so of course let's look at an example so
just go ahead and set this num equal to
one and let's say that we're the coach
of a hockey team and we have ten people
honored on our team cannot talk today
and we're handing out numbers to every
kid now some numbers have been taken
already so if that's the case we're
pretty much just going to say hey this
number is not available and we're going
to be doing that through the use of
continue now I'm just going to be making
a do-while loop because I'm kind of sick
those stupid for loops and the condition
is while num is less than or equal to
ten so I pretty much have the numbers
one through ten now what I know why
gives me that much space I don't want
that Jesus Louise's spent half of my
tutorial just getting the cursor in the
right spot okay so the first thing we
need is a condition of went to continue
because of course well that's the
tutorial so we'll say let's pretend that
the number six and eight are already
taken so if num equals six or too little
pipe signs num equals eight then what we
want to do is num plus plus because if
we don't have this right here then it's
just going to be stuck on six or eight
forever and it's never going to break or
it's never going to get completed I
should say so num plus plus continue and
I'll talk to you guys in detail exactly
what that does after I run my program
because it's going to be a little easier
to understand
so this right here outside the condition
is what's going to run on by default if
you don't hit this if statement so
printf and let's just go ahead and print
out the number so percent D and put is
available bump it to a new line and of
course the thing we want to add is the
only variable have which is number which
is basically the number of their jersey
and num plus plus so we can go to the
next iteration so again let me run this
right now and you guys are going to see
what's going on so what's going to
happen is it's going to say 1 2 3 4 5
it's going to skip over 6 go to 7 and
it's also going to skip over 8 so why
did it skip over those things well
that's the beauty of the continue
keyword basically what this program is
saying is loop through the number 1
through 10 that's what it does by
default without any of this code right
here however we added this code to
pretty much say check for the number 6
or 8 if you come across that number then
add 1 to it and that's just so the loop
can finish and it doesn't get stuck on
the same number and continue now what
continue means is this whatever's after
this loop whatever code comes after
continue just ignore it as soon as you
hit this continue keyword go right back
to the top and start this loop again
from 7 so again once it got the 6 it
said ok don't even run this at all just
go back to the top of 7 so that's why it
never printed out 6 and it never printed
out 8 because it never got to this line
it just continued which aka means hop
back to the top before this line could
ever be printed now again it's a little
bit different than break because it
doesn't completely break out of your
loop and continue with this line of code
outside of your loop what it does is it
stays in the loop and keeps going and
going it just ignores the rest of the
code so hopefully you guys under
stood and if you didn't then just build
a simple program like I did you guys are
going to get it after like two times
very simple concept so for now thank you
guys for watching check out my website I
guess I don't know what to say it's
always like weird and Torres I'm like
well no like see ya tomorrow or whatever
but anyways see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
