about files and of course we already
know why files are useful because right
now with the knowledge that we have in
our brains what we can do is we can
create a cool program to I don't know
like convert like dollars to euros or
something and we can run it and output
it to the user however whenever the user
closes their programs that data is
deleted forever so it would be nice if
we had a way to store the data that our
program created even not only when they
close a program but even when they shut
up their computer they could come back
to it so that's why files are useful
because we can store data that either
our program creates or just needs to
access so the first thing I want to do
before I start telling the guys about
how to create files how to read them had
a add crap to them is basically this
there are two different types of files
that we're going to be working with or
working the files in two different types
of ways should I say the first one is
called sequential access files and this
is pretty much data that we need to
create in order 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 the other
type of file actually alright this thumb
sequential means in order and we're also
going to be working with random access
files and this pretty much means that we
can store data all over the place it
doesn't need to be in any specific order
doesn't make a lot of sense right now
but it will and like tutorials exactly
what these types of files are so the
first thing I want to do is just show
you guys the easy one a sequential
access file so let's go ahead and create
a basic file in C so the first thing
that we always need is a file pointer
and it's pretty much a way to keep track
of where we are in our file prama saying
do you wanna you know um start writing
text at the beginning the end the middle
well we need a file pointer to keep
track of pretty much where we are like I
said in our file so in order to create
that write the name file all in caps
pointer because it's file pointer and
just name anything you want F pointer so
print image
you always need these two parts and then
you can name your file pointer anything
you want a lot of people name them FB
but you know uh name F point
so you guys can easily see what's going
on so now we need to open a file 2.2 or
pretty much use a file now there are a
bunch of different things that we can do
with files we can write text or create a
file and I'll talk to you guys about the
different modes real quick now whenever
creating a file or writing it for the
first time we use the key word or the
letter W whenever we have a file that
already exists on our computer and we
just want to read information from it we
use R so W for write R for read and
whenever we have a file that's created
and we want to add to the end of the
file so pretty much add more crap to the
file we use a a means a pen or admiral
crap so obviously we didn't have any
files that we created it we can just
read I don't know find a file on my
computer but let's go ahead and create
one first and not you freakin Internet
have it so how do we create a file well
the first thing we need is our file
pointer pretty much anything we're going
to be doing the files we're going to use
this file pointer and set it equal to
this F open and this open arm allows us
to open a file and do something with it
so what we need to do is open a file in
um pretty much right to it in other
words add text to it create it so the
first parameter of the state is what is
the name of the file that you want to
open AKA create i'm just going to name
mine bacon and make this a basic text
file now the reason that I had this
window open was to show you guys this is
where my program is on my computer and
if you just write bacon dot text we're
going to be creating a text file in the
same directory so as you guys can see
there is no bacon text file right now
we're going to create it so open bacon
not text and since it doesn't exist yet
we need to write it in other words W so
what this basically does is it now opens
your file bacon out text and if it
doesn't exist it's fine it's going to
create it for you and it's going to say
okay
I am now ready to write crap in here in
other words add text of the file so in
order to write stuff in a file you need
a different type of a print statement
it's actually F print F and this is
going to look very familiar whenever you
would um just print stuff on your screen
with printf the function f printf prints
it to a file probably the easiest thing
we ever learned in our life now this
actually takes a couple parameters in by
a couple I mean - it's really easy the
first one is your file pointer and right
now this is just at the beginning of
your file so we open notepad so again
what your computer is seeing right now
is pretty much this a blank cursor at
the beginning of a file that it's going
to be bacon dot txt so the next
parameter it takes just like print is
basically what do you want to print or
what do you want to write to your text
file and of course the only thing we can
write I love cheese and then we can put
it on a new line just like before and
end that will give you a little space
you can see what's going on so basically
if we just run both of these lines then
it's going to open a file and since it
isn't created yet it's going to create
it for you we don't need to do it on two
separate lines pretty friggin cool and
once it's open it's just going to write
something in it now this is actually
going to work perfectly but the one
other thing I want to talk to you guys
about is just housekeeping stuff and
that is F close whenever we're done with
a file pointer we're going to close it
and this just frees up any memory it
says we're done with this give that
memory back to computer you can have
your resources it's just good
programming practice so let's run this
and check it out one more time we don't
have any bacon that text file right now
so I'm going to run this okay nothing
displayed but check it out if I reopen
this oh I now have a bacon text file
right there
and it has let's just say 15 bytes in it
so if I open this with notepad it says I
love cheese
boom check it out what we just did is we
created an entire file with see how
awesome is that now I want to point
something else out first of all as you
can see whenever that little console
open we closed it out our files still
exist so this is a way that we can save
data even when we close our program
another thing is this little bit of
information say we run this program
again and we write bacon is good well
with this w mode this right what happens
is it says ok this is pretty much
creating a new file so if you run this
program again since we already have a
bacon that text file I'm going to say ok
delete that old one and create a new one
with this so it runs it again but now
check it out it says ok your file has
been modified you want to reload it yes
it now says bacon is good so remember
with W whenever you run your program
more than once it over writes the old
file since it pretty much is always
creating it from new and if you guys
want to know how to add stuff on to the
end of your file like you might have
expected I'm going to be showing you
guys that in the next couple of
tutorials but for right now this is how
you open aka create a file this is how
you add text to it and this is just
programming practice how to close it
free up some memory and now we're good
to go so in the next couple tutorials
what I want to do is show you guys now
that we have a file created how to read
from it how to add on crap to the end of
it and also how to work with those
things called random access files it's
going to be freaking sweet I'll see you
then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
