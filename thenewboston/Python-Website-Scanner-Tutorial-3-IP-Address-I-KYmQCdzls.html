top-level domain of the target what we
can do now is we need to get the IP
address of that website and I'll show
you guys what I mean now I'm pretty sure
that there is a easier way to do this
but this is how I do it if anyone knows
of a function that you can just write
like gay IP in Python mom is certain
that there is one but I don't know what
it is so this is what I'm going to do so
if you type host the new Boston comm or
any top-level domain and hit enter what
this does is it returns the IP address
so it says the new Boston calm has
address 54 186 250 179 now the thing is
we just can't take this these results in
storm in a text file because we are only
worried about this so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to run this command
through Python and then we're going to
extract this part of it and then it's
going to leave us with only the IP
address again I'm like 99% sure that
there is an easier way to do this
probably just a simple function if
anyone knows let me know but uh yeah
there you go so let's make a new file
and I'll just name it
IP underscore address that pew I and ok
so I'm going to import OS and by the way
this OS allows you to make operating
system calls so it allows you basically
to use the command line or terminal from
within Python if you guys are wondering
all right so I'll just write get IP
address and we're going to pass in a URL
which is going to be the top-level
domain like the New Boston com now the
command that we're going to run as you
guys saw earlier it was just host and
then the top-level domain so in order to
build that right toast with a space
after it and then the URL so host the
new Boston com simple enough now what
we're going to do is in order to
actually run that command and get the
results back we're going to pretty much
open a new
process so operating system and we're
going to write P open and then we just
write our command in here so that's all
you have to do so this is going to run a
new process just think of it like
running or opening a new terminal run
this command and the results that it
gives back which is going to be this
we're going to store in the variable you
guys you can see that again store in the
variable process so now what we need to
do after that is we actually need to
work on removing this part of it so
we're left with only the IP address so
how do we do that so glad you asked
we're going to write the results equal
STR process dot read now all we're doing
right here is we're actually just
converting it to a string and I can just
leave this variable out and run a
command right on here but this makes it
look a little bit cleaner now what I'm
going to do from here now that we have
it as a string and we can work with it
in Python is I want to find the location
of this right here now I just can't
count one two three four five six like
this because this is the thing the
domain names are going to be different
depending on what your site is for
example eBay is for the New Boston which
is this one two three four five six
seven eight nine ten eleven twelve um
you know reddit is six tomato tomahto so
we can't just have a fixed number so
instead what I'm going to do is I'm
going to get okay house I'm gonna copy
this has address because this is going
to be here no matter what and then we're
going to find this and then we're going
to put a marker on it and then we're
just going to say okay wherever this is
delete everything before it it's going
to be pretty sweet so it's actually
pretty simple probably just made it
sound harder than it is
so the marker is just the results let me
move my cursor so you guys can see so
what we're going to do is we're going to
find and what do you want to find
well we just want to find has address so
again what this method does is it looks
at this string which is this entire
thing right here and we're going to find
this right here so whatever location
this is whether it's 2014 or ever and
then from here this is going to mark us
at the beginning so let me just go
alright so it's going to Marcus at the
beginning and then from there we're
going to need to move 12 characters and
then rip out everything before let me
just do it you guys are going to see
what's going on so it has address plus
12 so this is the location that we want
to mark and now should I just show you
guys now now I'll show you guys later
so now all we have to do is return this
so the results which is this entire
thing we only want to return the end of
this and remember we already have a
marker right here so we can use that so
return results marker and then we'll
just write to the end so this is the
beginning and we're just going to return
it to the end and we also want to do
split lines at 0 now the reason that I'm
doing this is because let's say that we
have a domain name and it has multiple
IP addresses like show you guys
Google com you see how this has a bunch
of IP addresses and that's because
Google has a bunch of different servers
well we don't want all of these we only
want the top one so what we're going to
do is we're going to look at these we're
going to get all of these lines split
them up and we're only going to return
the first one which is 0 since computers
start counting and 0 so now just verify
that this works let me just print get
the IP address
the new busting to come alright -
looking good let make sure I don't have
anything messed up and re there is the
New Boston comm now if you want to
double check and make sure that it works
for Google all right boom broasted there
you go so no matter what the results
give us no matter if it's one IP address
or several ones what we did is we
extracted the IP address from it and
boom roasted we are good to go we can
now use this in our other scanning tools
so I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
