your 76th Android tutorial for the new
boss and what we're gonna do is kind of
clean up this little whatever this thing
is right now once we launch it once it's
not gonna launch again and we still need
to get rid of this so first thing we're
gonna do is get rid of this green ball
that's being left behind so let's scroll
down and here we go basically what's
happening is every time our X&amp;amp;Y changes
which happens every time we're pressing
the screen we're creating this green
ball and when we let up this x and y
value still is equal to something so
it's still gonna draw that left behind'
image that we want to get rid of and
then we also draw our shooting ball that
is happening within our if statement
that's handling the motion event when we
release our finger so an easy way to fix
this is as you can see our if-else
statements only going to draw if X and y
is not equal to 0 so what we can do is
within our let's scroll up to our motion
events and within our motion up we can
just change that value to zero because
the only time our x and y is going to
equal something right here is when you
know we have a touch event on our on our
surface so once we release we can set
those values back to zero and nothing's
touching the surface and everything is
gonna be perfect I guess I don't know x
equals y equals zero so there we go we
set up the X and the y value back to
zero so there's no reason for our thread
to actually draw this left-behind image
once we release
so hopefully that concepts sticks in the
only other problem is basically when we
shoot at once our na X and our animate Y
variables right here are went and keep
going up you know they keep going up
according to the scaled value so
we need to reset those values each time
we launch so we can do that every time
we first click the button so when our
first Plus starts so what we're going to
do is when we say go back to our motion
events we're just going to kind of set
some variables back equal to zero and
kind of the easy way to do this is just
to copy this line here so we're gonna
set the DX the dy the Anna X&amp;amp;Y the
scaled X and scale Y all back to zero
within our on down motion event so right
here so we're just gonna paste that and
we're good to go I mean I'm pretty sure
everything's gonna start working now but
hopefully you guys kind of understand
that that concept obviously I said
before you don't want a program whole
game like working with millions of
variables like this you kind of want to
set up your own methods that animate for
you and all that good stuff but I just
wanted to kind of show you guys I don't
know exactly what I wanted to show you
guys but I just wanted to show you that
you know that that nothingness I guess
okay and obviously we're getting a
problem but I already solved it because
I kind of clip the video and checked it
out as you can see it's starting up in
this top left corner for some some
reason every time every time we launch
and the reason that's happening is
actually because we just copied and
pasted this without kind of editing or
looking over it
because you and copied and pasted it
from our you know just our X regular
standard touching the screen but we want
to change this to the FX right here as
you can see when we draw our bitmap test
we're just going to change this to FX
and this to F Y and that that should fix
the problem because again when we every
time we touched our X and our Y value
were set to zero and then it's trying to
draw it from that zero location so that
should that should fix that
hopefully okay and see now we're we're
almost done guys this is just part of
the debugging process here
I'm as as longer you shoot the faster
the ball goes so that's good
everything's working but the only
problem is when we click to start a new
ball launch down here this ball is still
being drawn so we got fixed that problem
real quick see what's going on there
shouldn't be a big deal basically what's
happening is we are drawing we want to
set this our FX equal to zero now when
we start clicking so we're just gonna do
that real quick up yeah I'm so again
within this statement we can just say FX
whoops equals FX equals F Y and now that
will set our FX and F Y values back
equal to zero every time we start a new
down action so therefore it won't draw
and then it won't draw that you know
that bitmap that was being left over
there so hopefully everything's working
now and we can be done with this
animation stuff again if you guys want
to learn more about game development and
more of a well structured kind of a
gaming development system I'm probably
going to create something on my channel
which is youtube.com forward slash my
bring back so you guys can check that
out I haven't created yet so it might
take a while but there we go
I mean it's not that cool but whatever
I'll catch you guys in the next tutorial
