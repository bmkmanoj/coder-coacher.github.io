tutorial and CSS today we're going to be
discussing the basic syntax or structure
of CSS now what CSS is is just a bunch
of rules that tie your website what it's
supposed to look like there are three
parts to every rule the first part is
called the selector and what the
selector does is tell the webpage what
elements the CSS is going to be applied
to and this example it's going to be
applied to the body element and you have
a declaration property and this is what
property CSS is going to change and you
have the declaration value so the value
of this that it's going to change to is
blue so as you see we're changing the
body color the text color and we're
going to change it to blue now to make a
CSS rule you use this format you simply
just type whatever selector you're using
answer a curly brace then you enter your
declaration property in this instance
we'll use color and then you enter a
colon and then directly after the colon
you insert the declaration value and we
will use blue so again selector outside
and this whole thing is called your
declaration
that has the property and the value just
like XHTML now as you know CSS is an
entirely different language it's
actually used in conjunction or the
XHTML as you can see right here to
format a website so where do you put all
these rules well all the rules are gonna
go right in your head section and
they're gonna go in between style tags
now these are just like basic XHTML tags
with your opening style and your basic
ending style tag but there's one
attribute that you need to add to your
opening tag and that's called the type
attribute to do this simply add an
attribute called type and then set it
equal to type excuse me
text slash CSS and then close it
so again you have your opening style tag
and it's type is always going to be text
slash CSS when you're working with CSS
so again those go in between the style
tags which are in between your head tags
and right here is where you're going to
be typing all of your roles so as you
can see if we go ahead and save this
we launch it in Internet Explorer as you
can see our body text has now changed to
blue so say we wanted to add another
rule say we wanted to change the body's
background color again we will type body
and our curly brace type back brown
color
and this is the declaration property and
the value will set it equal to red then
you simply just end it so now we have a
style where it changes the text color to
blue and we have a body rule that
changes the background color to red so
if save this and take a look it will
look like an internet explorer as you
can see we now have our background color
red and our text is blue so now that we
learn the basic syntax of CSS and the
next we're going to be grouping
selectors and learning how to group
declarations and we're also going to be
learning how to include CSS in our
document in some other ways again if you
want a review of this tutorial you can
go to my website the new Boston comm and
I'll give you a step-by-step instruction
on everything I went over today Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
