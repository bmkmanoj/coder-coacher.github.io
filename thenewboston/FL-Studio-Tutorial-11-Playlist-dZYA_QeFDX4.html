to your eleventh video and in this
tutorial what I would like to do is I'm
going to show you guys how to arrange
all of those patterns into your final
song or your final playlist and also if
halftime is probably going to happen in
the next video what I'm going to show
you guys how to include external sound
effects or external sound bites in your
file so let's go ahead and check it out
by first opening the playlist and of
course to do that we click this button
up here and boom our playlist pops up
now before I get adding it all my
patterns I want to show you guys that I
actually created a few new patterns just
because I was getting kind of sick of
the same you know kind of melody over
and over the first pattern I created is
this wobble tenifer then this kick right
here that's my second pattern then I
made a hat and this fourth one is really
simple as just one kick on the very
frisbee alright so easy enough so let me
go ahead and add this wobble to the
playlist first so again this is the
wobble
alright so now how do we get this into
the final song well the easiest way is
just to make sure it's selected from
your playlist or step sequencer and then
there are a couple of different tools we
can use the add it to the playlist which
like I said is your final song the first
one is this draw tool right here and
this is the pencil icon now whenever you
click on your playlist it adds one
measure so we can add one right there of
course anywhere we click it's going to
add and just like before we can move it
around or also right-click it to get rid
of it so go ahead and add that and of
course you want to move it around to
make sure it's at the very beginning but
the reason that I don't like this is
because typically you want to add
multiple measures at once or multiple
patterns at once so I want this to loop
throughout my whole song so if I just
drag that's not going to work so that is
why I like this tool I always prefer the
paintbrush tool this one as you can see
what I'm about to do
if I click down on a track and I drag it
then it's going to allow me to loop that
pattern and it paints it rather having
to click it a million times so now again
make sure you move all the way to the
left and just like the piano roll you
can zoom in to make sure that you're
moved exactly where you want it to be so
now if we go ahead and switch a song
mode right here we can go ahead and play
the song all right sounded pretty
freakin good but around the fifth
measure right here that's where I want
the kick to come in so you can either a
switch to the kick right here and then
you paint your kicks on or the drop down
menu I prefer is just this one right
here this is basically saying what
pattern do you want to paint now we
already did the wobble on track one so
let's go ahead and add that kick pattern
to track two so I'm going to change the
kick and I'm going to paint that on the
fifth measure and also just drag that
out and that looks pretty good so now
let's go ahead and stop so we go to the
beginning and also play it this is our
soft
and it keeps looping like that so now
what I need to do is I want to add that
hat now let me just go ahead and add it
on the seventh measure so now again
let's go ahead and see what we got in I
also want to have this kick to ready
because I want a good place to put that
alright so I want one right there and
the timing was a little off and I
probably want one right here I feel
alright so that is basically how you can
use the paintbrush tool and also the
draw tool to add multiple patterns to
your playlist now remember I prefer to
paint tool and to be honest there isn't
that much to making a very basic song
you just select what pattern you want
and then you add it on whatever track
you want the only thing that I would
recommend for beginners is don't put
multiple even though you can do this
technically don't put multiple patterns
on the same track when you're starting
out for example don't put on wobble on
this track and then don't put the kick
later on on the same track it can be
kind of confusing
um stick with one pattern per track for
right now until you get a little more
experienced because if not it's just
going to confuse you guys and in the
next video what I'm going to show you
guys how to do is something really sweet
how to bring in an external song or an
external sound clip and then we can
either tweak it itself or double over it
to make like remixes and stuff like that
so thank you guys for watching don't
forget to subscribe and I will see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
