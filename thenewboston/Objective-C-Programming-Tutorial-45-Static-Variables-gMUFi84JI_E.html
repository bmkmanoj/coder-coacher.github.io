objective-c tutorial and in this
tutorial we're going to be talking about
something called a static variable now
in the less authorial we learn about
global and external variables and how
they're kind of one in the same but
they're going to come certain times
where you only want to make your
variable global that means that any
method in that file can access it but
not external and that means that files
outside that file cannot access it so in
the last tutorial we learned how to make
it so it was both in this tutorial we're
going to learn to restrict it a little
bit and make sure that it only has
access to that one file so let's go
ahead and in your tuna header I cleared
everything out by the way because we
don't need everything in there and let's
type this where it should be instead of
right there and let's go ahead and make
two methods one is gonna they're both
going to return void actually so add one
just like that and the next one is going
to be void and we will name this one let
me see the time this side all right now
one name this one like print it great
like that so we have two methods right
here looking good so let's go ahead and
copy those in an implementation let's go
ahead and implement those so we don't
forget and now let's go ahead and above
the implementation declaration of the
class tuna go ahead and we'll create
that static variable in the syntax for
this is static and then just go ahead
and put like GX remember you should
always start them with a G to make sure
they're global and now set it equal to
like zero or something and what this
does is I may add a little comment it
only makes it global not external that
means any method we create an
implementation has access to this GX but
if we went to any other class like this
or this they want to have access to it
no matter what even though it's global
variable so let's go ahead and add the
bodies for these what we're going to do
is each time we call add one
we're just going to take that G of X and
add one to it simple enough and don't
forget that the scope is restricted to
this file and that's pretty much why you
use static variables instead of just
instance variables so other users won't
be able to access this so take note that
we never created this variable in the
header you see usually we create
variables for classes right here in the
interface but we didn't do that so it's
just a way of making it more restrictive
and you'll find out later on when we
actually write a program that's useful
but for now this is just demonstration
so and add one all it does is add one
and the print method all it does is NS
log at all this does is the number is
percent I just print it out if you
couldn't tell by my awesome naming
conventions and ever saying all right
I remembered last time you needed the
term X turn on when working with
variables but don't forget you don't
need it in this case because it's not
external okay I can't stress that enough
if you learn one thing learn that so if
these methods look good which I mean
they look at me we'll see you later on
if we get a error or anything we're good
to go so go ahead don't forget to import
tuna and now let's go ahead and make our
tuna object of course you got a name
fish or else it won't work and save some
space for that fish so tuna alik and
initialize that object and now we can go
ahead and use fish to begin calling why
is that capitalized the end it
accidentally capitalized it in it looks
good I must have just hit caps lock or
something but anyways when we call add
one it's going to add one to that a
global variable and print it that looks
good and print it just print it out so
let's go ahead and run this real quick
save it and it says the number is 1 now
check this out if we go ahead and copy
this
copy/paste it doesn't matter the spaces
that was a mistake
oh crap I forgot to release my fish fish
release I got a little caught up in all
the actually let me uh there we go so
what we do is add one printout add one
printout add one printer now and release
it so check it out it says one two three
four you could do this all day catch the
fish about you know we really don't want
to so anyways what I'm trying to stress
is this if we wanted to use that G X
variable in this method we couldn't we
just get error messages or error message
so you know there's really no use what
an external variable is is it's a
variable I mean a global variable it's a
variable that we don't declare in the
interface we only create it in the
implementation or pretty much above any
file we want to use it so this variable
it's only restricted to this file no
other file can even see it or access it
or anything and this is the difference
between a global variable and an
instance variable and it's just one of
those things that if you want to
restrict it a little bit more so other
users can't access it that's the beauty
of it again this is just a real quick
demonstration demonstration you'll see
the usefulness of it when we actually
need it in the create programs later on
but for now I hope you guys learn what
static variable is how to use it put it
above the implementation and what
methods can use it so thank you guys for
watching I'm posting all the source code
in my forum link below thank you for
watching again don't forget to subscribe
and I will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
