believe pygame tutorial and in this
story i'm going to show you guys had
built a really cool application that's
going to drop multiple lines using a
mouse event so it's a little different
than draw line because draw a line just
draws one but with drug lines you can
give it a bunch of different coordinates
and it can draw lines in between those
coordinates so you can either type them
in manually or you can supply them with
clicking your mouse button now I'm going
to show you guys how to do that what
we're going to do is first make an empty
list called points instead of equal to
this and this is going to store all the
points both X and y-axis so in order to
provide it with points we need to
generate an event to every time you
click your mouse button down it adds a
new point to that list and this is
incredibly easy so go ahead and click if
event type is exactly equal to mouse
button down make sure I spelled it right
what you did if every time you click the
mouse button down what we want to do is
take that list called points or whatever
you named it and we want to append and
remember you learn this in your Python
short tutorials this means add something
to the list of points what we want to
add is the event positioning now the
event positioning is the x and y
coordinates so every time that we click
this mouse button down we want to take
whatever those coordinates are and add
it to our list of points so now we have
a list of points every time we click the
mouse button so now let's do something
with that list right under your for make
sure let me tighten this up a little bit
she said right under your for what we
want to do is make a simple if statement
if the length and remember length is
built an attribute of every list if the
length of points is greater than 1 and
this is only because we need to be two
or more you can't draw a line if you
only have one point that doesn't even
make sense you need at least two points
to draw a line so if the length of point
is greater than one then what do we want
to do well what we want to do is PI game
and I think you know is coming here draw
the lines remember lines is plural
screen color and remember I made my
color variable up here I forgot what it
was but anyways false and what false
means is whenever you draw two or more
lines if it's full if it's true it'll
automatically create a line connecting
those two points if it's false then it
doesn't automatically create a line so
this is why you want a false after this
tutorial after you're done with this go
ahead and turn it to true and see what
happens and then you need your list of
points and again you could type these in
manually one left or another but we're
going to generate a list dynamically
using this so it's going to supply it
for us and are the more points we click
the list is going to keep growing and
growing and of course it takes an
optional parameter which is the width of
the line i'm going to make mine like
five or something so you can see easy so
now let's go ahead and save this
everything looks like it's good to go
and run it hopefully I don't have been
airs and let me show you guys how this
works go ahead and click one nothing
pops up because remember it's greater
than one click again and again and bam
look at that every one of these points
generates a list I mean generates
another item on your list and as that
list grows it continues to go from one
point to another to another to another
and the more points you click your list
keeps growing and you supply it with
more and more coordinates so that is why
you're able to add this cool program of
line-drawing 2000 and I just said 2,000
because it sounded cool that's the name
of it so again let me tell you guys how
this works one more time color you make
an empty list of points because list is
one of the parameters because you need
to give it a bunch of points in order
sonos with the drop then you're right
all right every time I click the mouse
button down
get the coordinates of where ever I
click that mouse button and add it to
the list called points if the length of
that list is greater than 1 then what I
want you to do is draw a line from the
point to the previous point and that is
supplied in this parameter right here
and this is just optional with so that's
that for this tutorial I hope you
enjoyed once you're a pro it drunk
points you're ready to move on to my
next tutorial so thank you guys for
watching no kids subscribe and I'll see
you next door</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
