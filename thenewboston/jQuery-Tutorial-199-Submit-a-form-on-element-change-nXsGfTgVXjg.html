with a video tutorial for the new Boston
in this tutorial we are going to look at
submitting forms without a submit button
so we're essentially going to be using
jQuery to allow us to submit a form on a
particular action so why is this useful
well first of all it works really well
with select fields with our different
options inside so for example when you
have something like the Select and
select and then you have options inside
let's just go ahead and put option one
and we'll copy and paste this and option
two you'll see that we've got obviously
an option thing here if we were to go
ahead and say select option one or
option two and we had say a default
option here so choose if we were to go
ahead and select option one that would
be an event change so we could apply the
event change to that and submit a form
that might be around it it also works
really well with input fields with the
type file so when you're using file
selection if I was to go ahead and say
pick tartan jpg here that is classed as
a change of element and therefore we
could go ahead and submit the form that
was associated with it and there'd be no
need to have a submit button so
basically you know gives you use of the
chance to go ahead and quickly submit
content so we're going to be looking at
it with regards to both elements the
file and the select element the Select
elements slightly different because what
we want to do is we want to make sure
that it doesn't equal the default value
remember here we had a default value of
choose we would need to match it against
that and make sure that we didn't submit
a form if it was to equal this so the
first thing we're going to go ahead and
look at is submitting the file without
having to click a button so we'll go
ahead and just build a form as we
usually would with a file so we have an
action
I'm just gonna set this to file dot php'
the method I'm going to go ahead and set
to post and the ink type needs to be a
multi-part form data that's just how we
submit file so it's not really relevant
to the tutorial but you know it's there
and it's done with so we've now got a
form on our page we don't need to go
ahead and give it an ID or a class or
anything like that
because we're going to be using the
parent traversing function in jQuery and
this is going to select the parent
element which in this case anything
inside here would be the form so if that
doesn't make sense you'll see how it
works a bit later so I'm going to go
ahead and create an input type of file
you'd obviously give this a name or
something like that but you know it's
not really relevant in this case so
we've now got a file so we can choose a
file here choose a file from our
computer and that would be changed so
what we need to do is we need to go
ahead and bind an event tag that on to
this input type here and what I'm going
to do is I'm going to select all input
fields with the type file rather than
this particular one so obviously you
could go ahead and type ID equals file
I'll just put a long name just as an
example file to the a file to have form
submitted blah blah blah blah something
like that but you know I mean in this
case we're just going to use a jQuery
selector for all types all input fields
with a type file so you'll notice that
I've included obviously jQuery j/s on my
page this is just the latest version of
jQuery and then I've got my external
javascript file which is ext is inside
the ext ojs obviously nothing's
happening at the moment we're gonna go
ahead and write the code so the first
stage here is to select any element on
the page with the type file over C being
an input field so we'll go ahead and
just set up our document we use document
dot ready to wait for thee and inside of
this ready event handler we want to go
ahead and run a particular function
so when our documents ready we can run
everything inside of here so let's go
ahead and obviously first of all to
select this particular element or the
all elements on the page that match this
so I'm going to go ahead and use the
selector input but this time I'm gonna
or for this in this particular case I'm
going to specify a type and that's file
so what we can do is we can now go ahead
and append on this change event handler
so once the element has changed in
itself so this value has been added so
when we you know for example when we
select Tartan the value of this element
will have changed so once we've changed
we want to go ahead and run a function
and what's going to happen now is we're
just going to alert out changed so we
know that this is working let's go ahead
and refresh and click on an LMP on a
file and you can see that we've got this
dialog changed here that means that
we've successfully tracked the event
once it's changed but now what we want
to do is we want to obviously submit
this form now because this is a parent
element of this input element what we
can do is we can use traversing in
jQuery to select the parent element so
we can go ahead and say this what we
usually use to select a the element that
we have already selected and we're gonna
say parent so dot parent and in brackets
and then we want to go ahead and just
say submit so now that that's happened
what's gonna happen is when any
particular input file has changed or
input type or input field with the type
file has changed the form around it will
always be as parent so what's going to
happen is the parent here is going to be
submitted and that's going to obviously
be submitted to file dot PHP or just
submit this form as we usually would
with a submit button so let's go ahead
and refresh the page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
