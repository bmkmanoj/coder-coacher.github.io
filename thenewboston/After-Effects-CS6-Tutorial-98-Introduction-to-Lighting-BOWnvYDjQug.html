After Effects cs6 tutorial my name is
buddy Blackford and I'm gonna talk about
lights today and I'm gonna do a little
introduction to lighting and a light is
created in 3d space just like the light
I smashed my head off of like four days
ago when I was trying to clean the house
it was one of those fluorescent lights
that are like twirled around and I just
like raised my head up and I guess I was
I don't know why it it's down so low but
I freaking hit my head off of it and
smashed it right up and it was still lit
for a little while but then the next day
I came back and it wasn't light anymore
so the lights I'm talking about are
gonna be found up here in your layer
panel or your layer drop down here and
then you come down to light and there
are a few different lights
there's a parallel light a spot light
point and ambient and I'll go over those
one at a time for you so you can figure
out what they do and how they are used
so I just brought up a picture of a guy
here and it's in 3d space it's this one
right here and then I have a camera and
then I also made a light and if I turn
on the light you can see how now the
after effects original like default
light when you don't have any lights on
is a hundred percent ambient there and
when you turn on a light it turns off
the default after effects light and uses
the light that you have in your scene
now I took a spotlight so if I double
click on my light I can bring up my
properties and I took a spotlight here
and I'll just write spot and I kept the
intensity at a hundred percent I reduced
the cone to 30% to make it like a
spotlight that was like kind of like
dead-on and it just left a feather at 50
so
that's an example of how you can use
your lights in different ways to like
illuminate your scene the brightness of
lights is affected by different
properties and in different ways
depending on what's going on your scene
and the different properties you have
set up for example the angle of your
light is going to affect how bright the
images that you're casting the light on
and what I'm talking about is when you
tilt your light if I tilt this light
down I'll rotate it it's it's not going
to be as bright as you can see here and
if I change like the position or
anything like that the light isn't gonna
be as bright now also the angle between
the camera and the actual layer is going
to have a small effect on your light so
if I turned if I rotated this layer you
can see that the light on it actually
gets dimmer as you can think about it
like if the the lights need to bounce
off the layer and come into the camera
and that's how you get your lighting
there so now when it's back straight on
it's at the maximum value there and when
the light is straight on to the object
it's going to be the brightest the
material properties of your object also
depend on or also affect how bright your
lighting is so if I bring down the
picture here I don't wrong picture you
grab this one and come down and to
material options you get some options
going on here now
this option here called defuse that is
how much light that your object will
accept so if I turn this all the way up
you can see that the brightness of the
light changed so if I turn it back down
to down lower to zero now there is a lot
less light being accepted by the object
so put that back on 50</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
