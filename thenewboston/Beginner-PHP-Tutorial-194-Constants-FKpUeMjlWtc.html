and this is a PHP video tutorial for the
new Boston in this tutorial we're going
to relook at looking at constants in
cluck within classes so within
object-oriented programming so first of
all let's talk about what a constant is
now a constant is not actually a
variable it's a value that's assigned
almost like in the same way as a
variable but it will always remain the
same so you're not going to be able to
change the value of this constant hence
the name constant is constantly the same
value so let's have a look at a few
examples we've got PI for example is
3.14 1 so this would be a constant
because PI the value of pi is never
going to change we could also have
something like someone's name for
example if you are specifying a page
with just a single name that you knew
would never change could be a constant
so anything can really be a constant but
we're looking at more literal constants
like the value of Pi which will never
change so what we're going to do in this
tutorial is we're going to create a
class that's going to calculate the area
of a circle so we're going to create a
circle class we're going to have a
constant in there called pi I'm going to
show you how to how to use this constant
because we don't we can't use constants
in the same way that we can use
variables and then we're going to create
a method that's going to calculate the
area and then outside of our class we'll
create a new instance of our class and
we will we will find the area with a
given radius so the first thing we need
to do is is create our class so I'm
going to call this class circle so let's
bring down with our curly brackets we
need to now create our constant so I'm
going to first of all demonstrate how we
access access this constant outside of
our class and then we can use a method
within to use this constant value so
we're going to use the Const keyword and
then we're going to say pi equals three
point one four one and that's it we've
created our constant the name of our
constant is pi/4 pi and our constant
keyword let's listen
it's a constant now outside of our
circle class what happens if we were to
say circle equals new circle so let's
just talk without the parentheses let's
just double check that that works yeah
that's fine to refresh the page in no
errors now what I want to do is say
circle and usually to reference a
variable or a property within now in our
class we would use the hyphen and the
greater than sign to say within and then
we could say PI so this is just going to
return the value of pi also we think it
may not do let's echo it out and see
what we get okay so we've got undefined
property circle P I and with it we think
we'll why I mean the key is in this
dollar sign here this denotes a variable
in PHP or a property in inside of a
class so you can see that it's trying to
look for this for this pi variable and
it can't find it so how do we how do we
you know echo out this value of pi if we
can't use this method well what we do is
we use something with a with a double
colon so we say circle double colon P I
now let's refresh oh okay so we've got
this error so let's go ahead and change
this what we need to do is we need to
say echo circle then our two colons then
P I so now we're getting the value of pi
from the circle class so now we've got
the constant value displayed to us so
what we can do is we can make use of
this inside of our class as well as as
well as outside our class we're not
going to be echoing and the pi constant
outside of our class but we're going to
be creating a method now inside of our
class that's going to going to calculate
the area so this is going to be a public
function and it's going to be called
area remember to create your own
parentheses here for your arguments and
your curly brackets curly parentheses
we're going to take in a value inside
our area method and this is going to be
radius so this is the argument that
we're going to
taken process okay so now what we want
to do is we want to return the value of
the area so the formula for the area of
a circle is PI R squared so what we're
going to do is we're simply going to
return pi times radius times radius so
what we're doing here is we're
multiplying radius by itself so we're
squaring radius and then we're
multiplying it by pi now this isn't
going to work as it stands up that I've
written this like this on purpose
because you know that we need some way
to access remember before we use this
like this so this and then - and a
greater than sign PI so we're getting
the value of pi from this class as a
whole however this isn't going to work
so let's demonstrate it first without
this and then we'll add that in and see
that it doesn't work as well so we've
got nothing here so if I told them let's
come down and we'll create a new
instance of our class so let's go circle
equals new circle and then we'll say
circle and we'll say area and we'll give
it a value so we'll say 100 it's coming
and refresh now we can see use of
undefined constant P I assumed P I so
here we have use of an undefined
constant P I now we have to find it up
here
however we need to access it in a
slightly different way now usually we'd
write this like this so I would do this
and a hyphen and a greater than sign and
this would usually work let's refresh
you can see we've got undefined property
again the same error as we were getting
up before so it's slightly different now
remember I said you can use the double
colon to access the properties or
constants outside of your class you can
do that within as well but this time
instead of writing this you need to
write itself and this is this is without
a this is without a dollar sign the
reason for this without a dollar sign is
that we're not actually dealing with a
variable we're dealing with a constant
so itself just on its side
two colons p.i the the name of your
constant which in our case is P I and
then you can perform the rest of the
operation so we've got returned self P I
so now let's refresh and you'll see that
we've got no errors we haven't got any
output yet because we haven't echoed out
the value that this method has returned
so we have a return value here from this
method so let's go ahead and echo that
out and see if that works
okay so we've got a value return of
thirty one thousand four hundred and ten
this is right the reason we can tell the
calculations have worked is because
obviously our value of pi is three one
four one three points are e three point
one four one and we've multiplied that
essentially by a hundred squared so we
know this is correct this value is
correct okay so that is constants with
in object-oriented programming with PHP
and how to access them outside your
class how to access them inside your
class using this self and the two colons
and also a little program that we've
created here to calculate the area of a
circle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
