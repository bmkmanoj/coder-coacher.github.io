video in this video I want to talk to
you guys about the two different types
of chemical reactions that can happen
inside your cell now by that I mean
anabolic and catabolic now these are
actually really easy to understand and
once you understand one you're going to
understand the other because they're
actually complete opposites of one
another so let's go ahead and first talk
about anabolic so in an anabolic
chemical reaction what happens is it's
pretty much a reaction that builds
larger molecules so anytime we want to
build a larger molecule we need two or
more smaller molecules to come together
so so we have two smaller molecules a
and B they're going to come together and
form a larger molecule we'll call this
molecule a B so that's what happens in
an anabolic chemical reaction now of
course you can kind of see where this is
going let's go ahead and talk about
catabolic chemical reaction now a
catabolic chemical reaction is when you
have a larger molecule such as a B and
after the chemical reaction you end up
with two or more smaller molecules we'll
say in this instance it's a and B now
that's easy enough to understand but
what okay this is let me draw out okay
good enough all right so as I saying
this is pretty much easy to understand
anabolic two or more smaller molecules
coming together to form a larger
molecule and catabolic is just the
opposite but we also know that it takes
energy to bond together molecules so
that's interesting so why am I saying
that well this is the key that we need
to take away whenever I'm talking about
anabolic and catabolic chemical
reactions a and B in order to bond
together they require energy so this in
addition to having this arrow you need
additional energy so whenever you have
an anabolic chemical reaction energy is
consumed and why does it need energy and
these energy so it can bond together
these molecules
here make the bond right there now in a
catabolic chemical reaction what happens
is whenever two molecules break apart
energy is released so released so what
happens here is when a breaks apart from
B energy is going to be released in the
form usually of heat now I'm saying this
because later on we're going to be
talking about a process called cellular
respiration and ATP and all this good
stuff and this energy right here isn't
just wasted your cells can actually use
this energy to do things like grow
repair move around or just store the
energy for later on so that's the basics
of an anabolic and catabolic reaction
just remember anabolic is two or more
smaller molecules coming together to
form a larger molecule and whenever you
have an anabolic reaction it takes
energy you need to get energy from
somewhere else
in order to bond together those
molecules now in the catabolic chemical
reaction what happens is two or more
molecules or a larger molecule breaks
apart and whenever it breaks apart it
releases energy that your cell can use
and it breaks apart into two or more
smaller molecules as we can see right
here so later on we're going to be
talking about what the cell uses this
energy for and you guys are going to
understand you know the basics of
cellular respiration but right now I'm
going to be talking about this and I
just don't want to say that you know
that energy comes from a magical place
this is where it comes from the bonds
that bond molecules together so thank
you guys for watching and don't forget
