thirty second I think it is physics
tutorial and in this tutorial I want to
talk to you guys about a dude named
Kepler because Kepler was a pretty smart
scientist not to be confused with
Keebler who was the guy who invented the
cookie but Kepler was a scientist who
before Newton figured out some
calculations that he used to predict the
orbits of the planets around the Sun so
contrary to a lot of people believe back
then and actually a lot of people still
believe this today but the planets don't
work the Sun in a perfect circle
according to Kepler what he said is the
planets orbit the Sun in basically an
oval shape or this is kind of like a
potato shape right here but he said that
they orbit the Sun and shape called an
ellipse now I want to show you guys a
cool experiment in order to draw an
ellipse the first thing that you need to
do is go grab two nails from your dad's
workbench and nail them right into your
computer desk guys it's okay I already
talked to him he said you can nail them
if you want now second what you need to
do is go grab your dad's boot and take
the shoelace from it or the bootlace now
tie it in a circle he won't mind
guys it's okay trust me and tie it
loosely around two nails on your
computer desk just like that so what you
have to do after this is go grab your
dad's permanent marker this experiment
is going to work unless you have a
permanent marker and start drawing a
path using that shoelace is your guide
so no longer that shoelace is going to
be you know floppy shoelace but it's
going to start making the shape of a
triangle like that so go ahead and start
drawing a path all around your table and
once you do you're going to start to
notice that it doesn't make a perfect
circle like you make you may think if
there's only one nail then it wouldn't
make a perfect circle but since you have
two nails right here or two points it's
going to make a shape that looks like
this an ellipse basically an oval now
the reason that I use ellipse is because
these two points right here you know
aside from nailing them into your table
and it was kind of fun
why did I have you do that well I wanted
to demonstrate Kepler's first law which
he says first of all not only is that
elliptical shape important but those
points were you nailed that nail into
your desk are also important why is that
because he said the Sun exists at one of
these points in the ellipse so just
remember that that is basically excuse
me what Kepler said in his first law
it's kind of like a two-part law first
of all whenever the planets orbit the
Sun they orbit it in an elliptical shape
which basically looks like an oval now
if you wanted to drive the shape on a
piece of paper or something you would
need two points one right here and one
right here now the significance of these
points is that the Sun exists at one of
these points so Kepler's first law one
more time got a beat in your head
planets orbit in an ellipse not circles
and the Sun is at one of these points
right here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
