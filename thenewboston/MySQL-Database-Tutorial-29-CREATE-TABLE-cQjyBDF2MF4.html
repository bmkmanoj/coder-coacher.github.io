your 29th my SQL tutorial and this is
it's ro that some of you have been
waiting for the lesson where I finally
teach you guys how to create tables now
if you already played around with PHP
myadmin you can of probably guess that
if you want to create a table on your
database just go ahead and click the
database name and then you can create a
table just name your table say how many
columns but we're not here to learn PHP
myadmin we're friend we are here to
learn MySQL so I'm going to teach you
guys how to create a table through
command line so go ahead and wherever
you can type in your SQL statements the
syntax to create a table is this you
guys are going to think this is totally
confusing and baffling but it's actually
create table amazing huh so now that we
want to create a table what we want to
name it say we were making a website I
don't know we'll just make like a very
simple website where we can have user
sign up so I'll just name this table
users now after this go ahead and write
parenthesis now I'm going to show you
guys how I create a table and I just
think it's the easiest way but each
column I like to put on a new line so
every time you create a new column I'm
going to put on a new line and every
time you create a column it's going to
need information about that column the
first piece of information is the column
name what do you want your name or
column you want to name ID bid seller ID
what is it I'm just going to name this
ID this is going to be the primary key
next is what type of data do you want to
store in this well I just want to store
numbers just regular integers now I
don't want to talk to you guys about all
the different types of data because
there's like I don't know probably like
50 different types of data and a lot of
them are kind of redundant so I'm just
going to tell you guys about the
different types as we go along but the
first type is int int and what this
means is integer basically whole numbers
numbers without a decimal point so now I
want to create a column that's going to
hold integers and I'm going to name it
ID that's how I do that
now on my next one I want to create
another column for as well I'm going to
create another column on this table
named username where users can pick your
username you should pick the New Boston
because it's a pretty good one and now
the type of that for this you can use
text character but I like to use var
char what this means is is pretty much
strings or if you don't know what a
string is if you're not very familiar
with programming just think of it as
like text so now I probably should
mention this some data types okay back
up even more
whenever you specify that you want to
create a column on your table I told you
guys that it needs a couple pieces of
information the name of the column the
type of data that is going to be storing
for example integers it also needs a
maximum stored size so basically how big
of integers can you put in here how big
of strings or how many characters of
text can you put in here well every
datatype needs a maximum sword size some
datatypes already have default sizes so
that's why I didn't explicitly need to
write how many bytes of memory or
whatever we're going to be storing in
here but for varchar' we need to
explicitly tell it in parentheses how
many characters is the maximum basically
how big can a person's username be well
whenever we write 30 here this means
that their username can be no longer
than 30 characters and again this is
kind of confusing because some data
types like int they have a default
maximum size so you don't need to
specify it but other ones like varchar'
you do need to specifies and in order to
determine does my data type or doesn't
it have a default size you can just look
on the mysql website it's probably
changing all the time anyways but now we
have a primary key a user name and we
also want a password form so go ahead
and type password and this of course is
just text to letters and numbers var
chart and I'll just give a maximum size
of 20 so their password can be no longer
than 20 characters now you know how I
said that
every table you create should have a
primary key now in this table it was
obviously the ID the first one we
created not the username not the
password however our MySQL our database
doesn't know that already it's not smart
I just can't say hey this is my primary
key we need to say that the primary key
for this table is going to be ID now
whenever we do that we need to go ahead
and type on a new line
well it doesn't need to be on a new line
but I like to type it on a new line
primary key now in order to specify your
primary key inside parenthesis you go
ahead and write the name of the column
that's the primary key in this ID so
basically to create a table you go ahead
and write create table and then you give
it a table name now once you're done
with that you need to say what columns
are going to be in your table now every
time you make a column you need the name
of the column which is username the type
of data that column is going to store
which is this text or varchar' and the
maximum data size or the maximum storage
size so in this case it's 30 and again
the reason why we don't have to use it
whenever we create tables that hold
floats or int is because insin floats in
a bunch of numerical datatypes they
already have default sizes so now just
go ahead and hit go or run your query
and we now have our table so check it
out if you go ahead and click on left
hand side users we can now browse it so
again the column name ID username and
password and whenever something is
underlined in PHP myadmin it means it's
the primary key now the type of data the
ID is just going to be integers
1 2 3 4 5 so on and so forth use your
name and password is just going to be
text and again these are the maximum
storage size 30 characters 20 characters
or 11 bytes which is basically it's or
it's not like 0 to 11 it's 11 it's a
really big number I just want to mention
this I don't know it off the top of my
head but it's a really big number
so now we got all this other stuff like
attributes null but the hex null default
what the heck is this crap in the next
tutorial I'm going to show you guys some
other settings that whenever you're
making the table that they're going to
come in handy such as null Auto
increment all that good stuff as well so
that is the basics of how to create a
simple table but in the next lesson I'm
going to show you guys how to create a
more advanced stable so trust me guys
it's going to be probably the best store
ever trust me so thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and I'll
see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
