c-sharp tutorial that I'm making for the
New Boston and in this tutorial we're
going to continue working on our capture
generator and basically what we're going
to be doing is getting a string for the
name of each captcha image and you're
probably thinking well that's stupid
we're just going to name the image
whatever the text is in the image well
not we can't do that because then box or
any other computer program could just
read the name of the image and then
input the name of the image add the text
and it would always be right so we're
going to want it to be the md5 hash of
the string that's in the image that way
the program that uses a CAPTCHA and
generate the md5 hash of whatever the
user inputs and if those are different
than you know that whatever the user
inputted is wrong all right so what
we're going to be doing here is like I
said just generating an md5 hash of this
random string regenerated and in order
to generate md5 hash we're gonna have to
be using the system dot security doctor
photography namespace let me say using
system security cryptography right up
there and in order to generate md5 we
have to create a new instance of the md5
crypto service provider class we say md5
crypto service provider md5 before the
new md5 crypto service provider and then
we're just gonna set a string equal to
the md5 hash of this random string so
it's gonna say string md5 string equals
m5 dot Q cap and in order to compute a
hash we're gonna have to put inside here
a byte array so we're basically gonna
have to convert this random string right
here into a byte array so we're going to
say white array I'll just call it buffer
equals a new byte array and the length
of this byte array will be the same
length as this string so I can just do a
random string dot length all right and
then we're just gonna want to use it for
each statement to loop through each
character inside of this random string
and convert each character individually
into a by E and then we're going to
store that byte inside of this fireEye
right here and in order for us to know
which index of the biker I want to use
we're just have to create a new integer
here called Y and we'll say equal to
zero and then each time we loop through
on the for each statement we can just
increment Y by one that way we'll be
filling each element of the byte array
with a body so I'm going to say for each
characters see inside of that random
string and since the string I have to
convert it into a character right now
we're just going to say for each
character inside that random string we
just want to fill this buffer with
another fighter they still this fighter
right with another bite so I'm going to
say buffer and then you know the index
would be y equals C but we want to
convert this into a bike or a or a bike
so it's going to say it's gonna cast it
as a bite and like I said we just find
increment Y by one right here so that
we're actually filling every element of
that byte array up there all right
so now we have a byte array that is
equal to this string we can just get the
md5 hash of this play area called popper
right here they're just safe popper
all right so now we successfully will
calculate the md5 hash of that random
string up there but we need this to be
in a string so to convert a byte array
into a string we're gonna have to use
the fit converter class since this md5
dr. kute hash method returns a bug or a
so this looks a bit too doc to string
and we basically just wanted to convert
the byte array that that md5 compute a
sh method returns now the bit converter
class when it converts on a byte array
into a string it will separate each byte
by a hyphen and we don't want it to do
that so we're just gonna want to replace
that with nothing so we're just going to
use a replace method to place that - or
that pipe and
so we're going on a place - with nothing
all right so now that we have this md5
string right here we need to store it
somewhere and we're gonna store it in a
list up here and in order to use lists
you're gonna have to be using the system
collection generics namespace so we're
going to go up here and say using system
collections in there and now we can use
lists so we're gonna say a list and I'm
just gonna make it a string list
obviously since we're gonna be storing
streams in here and I'm just going to
call this list strings and obviously set
equal to a new list of strings and then
we're just gonna want to add another
string to this string list and that will
be this md5 string right here that we
generated so we're just going to say
strings dot add and then we're just
going to want to add this string right
here so add em by strength all right so
now we have successfully generated the
md5 of this random string that we create
and in the next tutorial we're actually
going to be saving the images and now
that we have the name we don't have to
worry about getting that later
all right so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
