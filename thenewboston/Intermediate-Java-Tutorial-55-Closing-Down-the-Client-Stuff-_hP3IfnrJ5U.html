tutorials let's see what we did we
connect it to the server once we were
connected we set up the streams and now
we took care of the wild chatting method
so you know aside from you know showing
the messages and stuff what we need to
do is once we're done chatting we need
to go ahead and cleanly close everything
down and we made a method called close
crap for that and what this does is
close the streams and sockets
and private void
close crap there we go and this doesn't
throw anything or take any parameters or
anything so the first thing we need to
do is just put give a user a nice little
prompt that says tell them what we're
doing and what are we doing well we were
just closing crap down so once we do
that we can go ahead and first of all
before I even run any of the code we
want to change able to type equal to
false because as we're closing anything
down of course that means the connection
is no longer going to be there so we
don't want to let the user it we don't
want to give them the functionality to
type anything or else is going to mess
things up so now to close everything
down throw in a try-catch statement so
catch IO exception IO exception and now
let's just go ahead and save me some
time print stack trace which pretty much
means show our error messages or
exceptions rather so now of course just
like last time the first thing we need
to do is close down both of our stream
so output ok crapples popping up scare
me output close which closes our output
stream input close which closes our
input stream and the main socket which
was connection which is basically the
connection close that down so now that
we have everything closed again we have
a couple of housekeeping things to take
care of we have three more methods send
message what sends
a message to the person on the server
show message which pretty much a rumor
updates that chat window through a
thread and allows us to see you know all
the messages that we send back and forth
and able to type which lets the user or
gives the user permission to type into
that text field or not type into it so
that's what we have to look forward to
thanks for watching I'll see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
