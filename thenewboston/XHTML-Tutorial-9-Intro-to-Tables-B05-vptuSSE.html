tutorial on XHTML the last time we
learned how to create links to our
websites and this time I'm going to be
teaching you how to add a table to your
website and the table is very useful you
can do a lot of things with it it's
mainly for organizing information but
you can also format the entire layout of
a website with a table and to begin a
table the tag is simply table and to end
it you just need an end table tag and in
every table you have two things you have
rows and inside your rows you have TV
tags for table data so let's create a
first row in our table and the symbol
for oh is TR and that ends with a
closing TR tag so anything we put in
between it is going to go in the first
row of our table and to do this we need
to add data and the tag for that is TD
stands for table data and let's just
type this is data and we end it with a
closing TD tag so remember your table
data goes inside your table rows in your
table rows go inside your table
now let's just add a attribute to this
table card called border and let's set
it equal to one this will just show the
outline of the border now let's say that
and take a look at what it looks like as
you can see we have a table with one row
and one piece of data in it but let's
say we wanted to add another row how do
we do that well it's simple right under
your closing table row tag you add a
another beginning table row and let's
add two pieces of data in this
so you add TD data one let's close that
and then you add another piece right
underneath it we'll call it data two and
make a closing tag and now we have to
close up this row so now we should have
two rows one right here one right here
with two pieces of data in this second
row so let's save that and take a look
at what it looks like
as you can see we have one piece of data
on top in our table and two pieces on
the bottom so we're out of time for
right now but in the next topic I'm
gonna be telling you how to add a
caption and some more attributes to our
table to make it look better and if
you're not already there you can go to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
