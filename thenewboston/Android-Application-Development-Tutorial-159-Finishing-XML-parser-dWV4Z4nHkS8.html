Android tutorial for the new boss in
we're gonna finish our weather app or
our XML parsing activity here and just
to do a quick review I'll talk about
some of the things and then at the end
of this tutorial kind of talk about
everything that we've done so what we
did is we set up an XML parser for these
three lines code and then we also set up
a handling stuff you know instance
called doing work we set a Content
handler to look for the things that we
actually want to do and all that stuff
and then we also set up a parser to read
the actual information from the website
so we set up this instance called doing
work which is basically our handle it's
telling our XML reader what to look for
all that good stuff and then we're gonna
parse it from this website or this input
source which is our website that we were
referring to and then what we're going
to do is we need to still set up a
string to set our text value guys so
what we're going to do is we're going to
relate to our handler or you know
basically this class called the handling
XML stuff so we're going to do is we're
going to set up a string and we're going
to call this information we're going to
all we're gonna do is refer to this
handling XML stuff instance we call
doing work we're going to set up a
method in that class to return a string
so we're just gonna say doing work which
is getting our variable name we're just
gonna say get information or whatever
you guys want to make this method be
called that's going to return a string
for us and then all we're gonna do is
say textview set text to information so
again all we really need to do is return
some sort of a string within our doing
work or within our handling XML stuff
class so we're gonna jump over to that
class real quickly and again we just
need to create a method that returns a
string so we're just gonna save public
string because we have to tell it what
we're returning it's gonna be a string
variable and we're just gonna call this
method again get information
and now we need to return some sort of a
string so we're just gonna say return
and then we're gonna refer to our data
collected variable which we called info
and we're just going to say data to
string and that's what we're returning
again within this handling class we set
up a data collected variable called info
and then once the element starts reading
our XML Reader starts reading it's going
to you know set the information set our
city if there is you know a reference to
the city with the attribute called data
it's gonna set us set the city again
just going over to that class the
setting the city is just creating you
know these variables we set up within
this class to equal whatever is being
passed in and then this string method
basically uses those variables to write
our sentence and that's all we're
returning is basically the information
and then we're using that method that
returns that sentence that we want now
when we save everything it's basically
going to interpret all that I believe
our activities should be done let's just
run it real quickly and I'll do a quick
overview of everything that we did again
I know I kind of been explaining it but
whoops right on the emulator here and
again this is the class that we put
within the manifest we don't need to put
those other classes in the manifest but
we do need to have our weather XML
parsing class within the manifest then
we start up our activity we scroll down
to the weather XML parsing class we
click that enter again let's just test
link in and you know if Google accepts
Lincoln it's like hey I know what you're
talking about we don't even have to
enter the state because it's like oh
there's pretty much only one Lincoln
most likely there's a probably one in
Illinois's or something as well but then
we go and then it basically parses all
of our data and we use that return
method to get this straightened down
here so let's quickly talk about about
everything that we have done and again
our main class all we do is we set up
onclicklistener
and we create a string builder to refer
to the actual city and state
and upend you know the right format
because according to the google weather
api 1 the right format so it looks at
the right website then we just create a
string or a URL that we're going to read
and we set up an XML reader just through
the sax parser Factory through the sax
parser and then finally the XML reader
then what we do is we set up handling
and since that's going to kind of
interpret the data or look for the
things that we want to look for and also
we have that method within that class
called get information that's going to
return a string so now that we have you
know our reader is going to do the work
that we want it to do and we're going to
parse it from this website which again
is just the google weather api we're and
then we're just going to create a string
that gets information inside the
textview
but again this getting information from
our handler so let's go into our handle
handler class talk about that real
quickly again we just set up a new
instance of the data collected object
and then all we're gonna do is define
what we want the city and the state to
be according to you know the values off
the website that we're looking for and
then it's going to just return that data
process that data into our info object
or info instance and then all we're
gonna do is use that instance and use
the method from our xml data collected
class - you know return the actual
string that we want to display and
that's pretty much it I mean this last
class is pretty basic we just set up our
variables and then we return those same
variables once they're set up through
this method so hopefully you guys kind
of understand a little bit more about
parsing and I know in Jason we didn't
really get into too much depth but
hopefully this was in-depth enough for
you and I'll catch you guys in the next
tutorial have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
