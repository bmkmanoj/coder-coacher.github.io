to your very first Python tutorial now
in this tutorial I'm going to be showing
you guys how to download Python and this
is the program that you use to write all
your Python code that I'm going to be
teaching you from now on so go ahead and
the first thing that you need to do is
go ahead and open up an internet browser
I'm going to open up Firefox but it
doesn't matter what when you open then
you need to go to WWII on P Y th o n org
not calm org go ahead and go to that and
you're going to see a link on the left
hand side called download click that
download link now depending on when you
watch this tutorial you're going to want
to download the most recent Python
version and make sure that you're going
to download the windows installer and
not any of these other ones go ahead and
die in a download Python 2.6 they might
have a later version if you're watching
this tutorial later but right now it's
Python two point six point two windows
installer so go ahead and click that and
it's going to give you a MSI installer
package and this is just like a wizard
so go ahead and save that file I already
have this program download so I'm not
going to go ahead and save it but once
you save that file go ahead and double
click on it and it's going to take you
through the whole process so if you ever
use the computer you're going to be able
to how to figure out figure this out
just keep clicking next and next until
you got python so after you go and you
click all those next things you're going
to have python on your computer and to
get to it go ahead it's going to be in
your Start menu go ahead and click all
programs and you're going to have
something called Python now you're going
to have a couple things in here Idol
model command line Python manuals
uninstall the first thing you want to
click on the first thing that we're
going to be using is called Idol and
this is the Python interface so go ahead
and click this twice and remember that's
Idol the Python GUI and that stands for
a graphical user interface
now this thing is going to pop up and
this is the first thing I'm going to be
teaching you guys how to use Python so
um just to make sure that this is
working right and I know you guys would
be ready to start programming right now
to test it go ahead and type print print
and then go ahead and in double quotes
type whatever you want to print on the
screen I'm going to go with basics and
not do anything new and go ahead and
type hello world now after you typed
print and in double quotations hello
world no semicolon go ahead and press
Enter and if on the next line it experts
or outputs hello world then you know you
downloaded it correctly so that is your
very first tutorial and how to download
Python so hopefully you watch my next
tutorials and I'm going to be making a
ton of tutorials showing guys have
program in Python it's one of my
favorite languages so follow these
instructions get this program and
hopefully I'll see you next tutorial so
