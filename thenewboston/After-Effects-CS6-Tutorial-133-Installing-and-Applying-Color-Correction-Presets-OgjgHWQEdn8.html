welcome to another After Effects cs6
tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and today
I want to go over how to install presets
so that we can color correct the easy
way we're going to be using a presets
that we just find on YouTube pretty much
and they're basically things that other
people have already made for us and
they're free so why not use them so I'm
going to come up into YouTube here and I
know you guys can see my name so
whenever you see me commenting
I'm lunch box ten I have the picture of
my hot dog cat as my profile picture
there you know that's actually me
responding back to your comments and
things like that
so let's come into YouTube and type in
After Effects color correction presets
and up comes a whole bunch of different
free color correction presets and things
like that so just a comment into any of
these and then you can watch the you can
watch the video turn that volume down
sorry you can watch the videos of how
the different presets are and how they
look and then there's usually download
links in there so you just click on this
and bring it into a folder and what I
like to do is keep my color correction
presets in a folder and they're already
there for me so I can just copy and
paste them later into After Effects so
once you have downloaded your effect or
your preset I mean then we're going to
go into the after effects folder let me
bring that up we got the after effects
folder here
it's a wherever your After Effects has
been installed and then go to the
support files folder and then go to
presets
so in your presets folder you'll already
see a few folders if you uh I think
that's correct if you have the like the
real version and you didn't really
pirate it so you'll have these other
you'll have all these different effects
presets in there already you want to
take your folder so I'll go back you
want to take your folder here and copy
it and then paste it down here into the
presets folder so I have already done
that and I had my color correction
presets already in there so let's open
up after-effects now and since you guys
need to start it and I already have
everything in I'm already going to hop
into after-effects here I'm going to
open up my projects and bring up some
video footage that we can throw this
stuff onto now I know that the this
video footage here hasn't been color
corrected so I'm going to bring it in
and here we go we've got some video
footage here that we can add a color
correction presets to so your color
correction peak presets are going to be
over here in your effects and presets
section so click on this down this arrow
on animation presets and come down to
wherever your folder was named mine was
named color correction presets twirl
that down and then you've got all your
presets here so I can come and drag on
top of this footage and it automatically
adds a color correction preset now it
looks like some of mine are in German
probably but by knowing what the
different by seeing the different types
of effects I know what these ones are
like this one's brightness and contrast
this one I think is a rain
and this one is I'm not too sure I think
is exposure and then this one's the
curves obviously so you can take the you
can just end up deleting these off
basically what a preset is is pretty
much just a collection of effects
already made and set to what the person
wants it to look like so I can bring in
clean and that's how that one looks and
then you can just kind of like go
through and figure out what you want to
have on there see if I can old dream
let's see if that looks any good so I
mean then you got to come in and like
figure out what you want and everything
and just adjust all your different
presets trying to find one that actually
looks halfway decent so this one might
look a little halfway decent see he's
used the the exposure here the chant the
curves and the hue and saturation just
all in everything's already adjusted so
he's got negative 20 on the saturation
he had the curves way down which made it
too dark for this scene but you can go
in and tweak everything you can figure
out what they're using if you have a
different language like I do on these I
don't speak German so I don't know how
to even say these but if you come over
here to the about and you click on it
it's going to tell you what the effect
is exposure version 1.0 so we know that
that effect is exposure now if I come
down to this one hue/saturation so
that's how you figure out what your
effect is you don't need to know the
name and you can also change the name if
you even wanted to but the same way you
change a layer so hue / saturation if
you really want if you really need it
too if someone else is coming to use
your project later on you probably want
to change the names of these so curves
and then exposure oops
press ENTER to change the name I can
type on the right thing here so there
it's already fixed so that's how you add
presets and color correct easily so just
add that stuff and turn them off if you
don't want them on our certain effects
on adjust them to your liking and it's
so much quicker than adjusting
everything by hand so thanks for
watching this one as a kind of a quick
tip and I showed you how to install
presets also so thanks for watching have
a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
