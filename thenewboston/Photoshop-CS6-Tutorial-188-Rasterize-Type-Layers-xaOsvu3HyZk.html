another Photoshop cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and today
we're going to learn how to rasterize
type in order to use different kinds of
tools and filters and commands on tight
on the text so when you go ahead and
type in text it is not rasterized it's
an actual text layer and when you want
to use something like a paintbrush tool
on it you'll get this pop-up here this
type layer must be rasterized before
proceeding it's text will no longer be
editable rasterize to type and I'm just
going to hit cancel and then this pops
up could not use the brush tool because
the pixels in the type layer cannot be
edited without first rasterizing the
layer so that it pretty much explains
the problem that we have so when you
rasterize a layer it actually turns it
into pixels and it converts it to that
and once you do that the text within the
layer is an edible anymore so we're
going to go ahead and start learn how to
rasterize this and then we can use
things other image editing tools on our
text so let's right click on it and what
we want to do is go to rasterize type it
and i hit that and you can see the icon
changes and it's now more like an image
now I can draw on it if I want to try my
go back have you go back I was just
undoing a few times
you can also rasterize it by clicking
and then this pop-up comes up just hit
OK and a rasterize it for you and now
you can write on it again so there's
other filters that you can't use some
commands you can't use when the image is
not rasterized so those are things that
you want to do so that's pretty much all
that I wanted to show you here you need
to rasterize your type before you are
able to apply some of the filters and
commands
only reserved for editing images with so
that's all I wanted to show you in this
tutorial be sure to subscribe for more
tutorials and other videos of the sort
and be sure to check out Bucky's room
down org that also contains a bunch of
videos and has a cool is a cool social
social networking site for programmers
and designers and everything it's pretty
cool go out there and hang out with us
so see you guys later and have a good
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
