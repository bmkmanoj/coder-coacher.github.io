with a video tutorial for the new Boston
in this video we're going to take a look
at installing jQuery UI now if you
haven't already gone ahead and click the
build custom download button I mentioned
in the previous tutorial the
introduction to the jQuery UI go ahead
and click build custom download now
you'll be presented with a page where
you can actually customize the package
that you download and this will be
provided to you in a zip file now let's
go ahead and just select everything for
now so we have access to absolutely all
the effects and interactions etc that
jQuery UI provides and we're going to be
downloading the latest version which is
compatible with jQuery one point 3.2
onwards so let's go ahead and click
download now that file will be
downloaded as a zip file as I mentioned
it's about one megabyte so we're going
to go ahead and wait for it to download
okay so once it's downloaded let's take
a look at the files that we would
receive with the package now we've got
inside a J's folder we have a actual
jQuery download you know the original
jQuery library and we also have the
jQuery UI package as well now this is
the one file that we want to put in our
directory so we can use it so I've
placed this inside my J's folder and
let's go back to the root directory so
this is inside the J's folder and I've
called it jQuery - UI J s so that's in
there
I've also copied this development bundle
go back up this development bundle
folder which contains a lot here over to
my dirt directory as well
and inside CSS I've copied UI lightness
folder over as well so let's take a look
at that inside CSS we've got this UI
lightness folder as well so we've got
these files copied over now what we can
do is actually go ahead and
actually run this so now that we have it
downloaded and and you know we have
copied the files over we want to go
ahead and include the jQuery UI file now
this is the only file we're going to
need to include at least for now anyway
so we do exactly the same thing as we
did with jQuery
however we include jQuery UI JX remember
this is located in the jas folder okay
so now that we've done that jQuery UI is
ready to use and we can actually start
to use it so what I'm going to go ahead
and do is that just test this out and we
want to test it by well I've created UI
J S which is also located in the J's
folder so I'm going to go ahead and just
include this as well so the source of
this will be J s /u IJ s this is a file
that I've created myself it's nothing to
do with jQuery UI and we're going to
start writing some code in here in just
a moment to test it now for the example
for the purpose of this tutorial I'm
going to create some spam tags and I'm
going to give this span an ID of drag
and inside here I'm just going to write
drag me now let's go over to our browser
and let's refresh the page and you can
see that we've got this dragony text
here now obviously we can't drag this at
the moment because we haven't applied
anything to it but essentially what
we're going to be doing is quickly
implementing the draggable interaction
to this span element so we'll be able to
drag this around the page so let's go
ahead into context or whichever text
editor you're using and let's apply this
in UI J s which we've included and
remember as well as the jQuery UI file
so I'm going to just say document
. ready so this is when the document has
loaded and is ready and inside this
create a function as we've seen before
and inside here i'm going to just select
user selector to select this drag span
here so hash and drag so i provided an
ID and i'm just going to say dot
draggable so this now has applied a
particular CSS set to this element this
span element and this will allow this
element to now be draggable so if we
refresh the page you can see that we can
now drag it around the page so as well
as being extremely effective it's also
extremely easy to implement all we've
really done is downloaded some files or
downloaded this file along with the rest
of the package and we've then used the
draggable function which creates the
relative in interaction in jQuery UI UI
sorry and we've applied this to the drag
element now this can obviously be
applied to a variety of different
elements however in the next tutorial
we're going to be looking at this
draggable interaction in a lot more
detail so as long as you have this
working and you're actually able to drag
this element around the page you'll know
that jQuery UI has been successfully
installed and we can continue with the
rest of the tutorials</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
