some more about Photoshop cs6 because
I'm your host a buddy Blackford and I'm
going to be teaching you about working
with the Photoshop tools and the tools
are these things over here on the left
now there's a whole slew of these that
the Photoshop like made about like 70 of
them I think and I know that there's
just 11 selection tools alone and it's
pretty sweet so we're going to go over
these and there's so many of them I'm
not going to go through them all in this
tutorial I'm just going to give you a
good indication of the different kind of
groups that you have there so sometimes
when you start up your Photoshop your
tool selection panel might look like
this or if you click on this double
arrow here it'll be this like a long way
so whatever whatever you like better I
like it more condensed like this because
I can get to the tools faster so if you
go up to one of your tools and click on
it you can select that certain tool now
if the tool has an arrow down here in
the corner as you can see on this
rectangle one here and this one with the
lasso they got little arrows down in the
bottom right corner if you click and
hold you can bring up a few more extra
tools that are within that set so that's
pretty cool now if you look at some of
the tools if you hold down on them they
have these letters next one those are
the hotkeys so the hotkey for
rectangular marquee tool is M so you're
getting to know the hotkeys while you're
using photoshop will speed up your
workflow tremendously and you'll be
ahead of anybody else that doesn't know
how to use the hotkeys in terms of speed
now once you get like your hotkeys down
and you're good with a knowing which
goes to what then you start learning how
to use the tools effectively and then
you can be a really great at Photoshop
so let's start going over some of these
things this tool here is just the move
tool and this is one of the main tools
that you'll use and the hotkey for the
move tool is V so if you press V on your
keyboard that's will make the move tool
and that pretty much just moves stuff
around so if I come to this welcome to
photoshop sign and I just move that
around that's what the move tool does
now on the next section here is the
marquee tool and what this does is take
some like selections and whatever is
within this selection you can edit with
some of the other tools so maybe I want
to press Delete here we go if I press
Delete well didn't work on that one
because it's a smart object let's bring
it down here and it will delete out a
section there you can add color to these
if you if you wanted to with like a
paint bucket tool such as that so that's
just a tool for selecting things now
also below it this is the lasso tool and
it comes with the polygonal lasso tool
and the magnetic lasso tool and these
are for also selecting things you can
draw a selection with the lasso tool and
it will create a selection for you same
thing with like the political but the
political one does it in like straight
lines like that such as now I'm not
going to go over every single tool but
keep in keep in mind what these tools
are used for now if I come up here to
select and I go to deselect
it'll get rid of the selection for us in
case you're messing around with the
different selection tools we've got our
magic wand tool here and within this we
have the quick selection tool and the
magic wand tool and these are used for
selecting things quickly so they usually
select something over on the same color
so you can try like I'll try to select
this woman's shirt that didn't work and
it tried to select as much of it as the
shirt as it could based on color but
there's too much of a color difference
within that so it's a lot easier to
select things with the magic wand tool
and then come through with the quick
selection tool and add to the selection
so I could add like this and now I've
got decent amount of our shirt added so
I mean that's a little bit of how to use
those tools we've got the crop tool here
which we've got a prospective crop which
is new we've got slice and slice select
tool so these are for cutting things out
so I if I select her face and press
ENTER it will crop out everything else
and just have that so I'm going to go to
edit I'm going to go to undo to undo
what I just did last time so when you're
messing around with your tools here and
checking them out the way to undo what
you just did is go to edit undo or edit
step backward so we
and go on to the next one we have this
as our color selector tool so this is
actually called the eyedropper but
pretty much is just used for selecting
colors so if I want to go select like
this pink color here and I click on it
with this eyedropper tool it's going to
change our color here and over here to
the pic that pink color now these other
tools here we've got a ruler tool which
can be used to create a ruler lines oops
I just hit the wrong one and then we've
got our note tool that we can use to
like right like little notes and then
you can use those to come over here into
the note panel to open up little notes
that you leave around for like other
people that might have been using art
that might use this after you or if
you're coming back to it later let's get
that out of there we don't want that on
that
now let's move down to the next set of
tools we've got our Spot Healing Brush
tool here and this these tools here are
used to work on actual photos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
