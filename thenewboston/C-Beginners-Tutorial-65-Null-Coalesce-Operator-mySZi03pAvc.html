tutorial but I'm making for in Boston
and in this tutorial I'm going to be
showing you how to use a question mark
question mark operator so all you're
going to need for this tutorial is a
button and this code right here so right
here we just have a string called my
string and it's set equal to null and we
also have an if statement second to see
if it's training people to null and if
the string is null then you will have a
message box displayed say the Stern is
normal but otherwise we get a message
box saying string so since this is equal
to null appear we'll just get a message
box and straighten all now open strings
you know but if we were to set the
string equal to anything besides a null
even make an empty string then we would
get a message box saying the text of the
string you have to get out of and the
question mark question mark operator
basically allows you to do the same
thing as this only way quicker you need
to type out will eyes now you could also
use a ternary operator in this case but
the question of our question mark
operator is even easier than yet so all
we're going to do here is in a second
can melt and we want to have a message
box display this string unless it's
equal to no so what's going to do about
message box that show my string
unless it's equal to no so I'll just do
question mark question mark and then
whatever we want to be displayed in the
message box if this is null so we'll
just say this string is no if if this is
equal to null so this should be the
exact same thing as before only as you
can see it's now on one line and it's
even easier than a ternary operator yep
we get the string is known because it is
not but if we set the string equal to
anything resides in all such as Adam you
should just get Adam in the mess
yep now a domestic box and you can do
this with integers as well for example
if you wanted to set in time no and
let's do this but as you can see right
here you get an error saying cannot
convert null to int because it is a non
knowable value type and in order to
solve this error you're just going to
want to put a question mark right after
the type so this is an integer source to
put a question mark right after that and
now we can set it equal to null and this
will work with all non nullable types so
I view integers and stuff of that so now
we set I don't know and you want to step
into X equal to i if it's null we want
to set it equal to Tom
8 then we're just going to spoil that a
message box to make sure that our
question mark question mark operators
work so now we should get a message box
saying 8 because I is equal to null yep
but if we set I equal to anything beside
null by 0 then we should get a message
box saying 0 yep
so that pretty much covers it on the
question mark question mark operator I'm
pretty sure it's called like no
coalescing or something like that but I
didn't really say that because there's
no way that's how you say it but anyways
see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
