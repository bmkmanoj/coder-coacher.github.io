Android tutorial for the new boss what
we're going to do in this tutorial just
add that jar add those resources that we
downloaded in the last tutorial so again
we can add ads to our application and
you know just get things going having
the permissions that we're gonna need to
you know to produce the ads and we
actually obviously print have access to
the internet and also the network state
so we can keep track of you know the
clicks and all that good stuff but if
you guys don't like watching videos you
know this is probably the worst time to
tell you this since that's basically at
the end of the series but you know if
you would rather like reading you can
click this link here and this is
basically what we're gonna go through is
all this stuff but if you just like
watching videos like myself instead of
you know reading and you know just
follow along but if you ever get lost
just double check with you know this
site here but again we downloaded at
least I downloaded the SDK through
eclipse so all we have to do is access
that and add that jar to our project so
we're gonna right click on the new
Boston package that or whatever package
you guys are adding AdMob to and we're
gonna go down to properties once we open
the properties we get something like
this we're gonna go to Java build path
and we're going to go into our project
or our libraries I mean and we're gonna
say add external jar because again we
downloaded the SDK which has a jar that
we need so we're just gonna say add
external jar and we're gonna refer back
to wherever we downloaded the SDK or if
you guys downloaded AdMob off their
website you know find that download and
open that there but again I download the
SDK within my hard drive so I'm just
going to open that up and find the
Android SDK for Mac or wherever you guys
again downloaded the SDK
we're gonna go to extras and then we're
gonna go to the google tab or the Google
folder and we have admob's
Add
SDK right here we're gonna open that up
and here's our jar that we want to look
for so we're just gonna add this chart
or application again so we can use the
methods and all the great stuffs all the
great stuff it has the offer so we're
just going to click that and hit open
and now as you can see it added it to a
project we're just going to hit OK
and over here we have this new reference
libraries that we you know have our
AdMob SDK located within and we have all
these classes that we can use now all
this new great stuff so there we go
we've added our jar to our application
now all we do now what we need to do is
add the permission so we're gonna go
into the manifest and we already have
the Internet but just to emphasize you
guys need the Internet one so if you
don't have an internet application you
haven't been following this project
exactly make sure you add the permission
for the Internet and I'm just gonna go
down to the permissions tab as well as
you can see the Internet's there is also
but what we're gonna do is we're gonna
say add and we're gonna say uses
permission and then we're gonna go down
we're gonna find access network state
that's another permission we're going to
need for AdMob so we're just gonna click
that and save our project
and then just maybe double check go back
to the XML make sure that new permission
is in there as well so we need the
access network state and the internet so
those are the two permissions we need
for AdMob and we've set up our jar in
the next tutorial I'm gonna show you how
to reference those methods and how to
set up and add within your application
so I'll catch you guys in and have a
good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
