to your 14th intermediate Java tutorial
and in this is order we're going to be
going over a data structure called a
stack now well a stack is is it pretty
much can be closely related to a stack
of dishes now you know whenever you're
doing dishes and you put a new dish on
the pile of old dishes it's always
placed on the top of the pile or the
stack and in Java terms we refer to this
as pushing a dish on the stack so what
pushing means is putting something on
top of the stack and whenever you take a
dish off of the stack what Java calls
this is popping a dish off the stack so
you always have pretty much a stack of
methods or collection calls or anything
you have and whenever you put something
on it
it's called pushing and whenever you
take something off it it's called
popping so the easiest way to pretty
much to learn this is through
demonstrations so that's what I'm going
to do in order to create a stack just go
ahead and we import this in Java util
but just go ahead and press the stack
and then go ahead and we're going to
make our data string because it's the
easiest and you can name it anything you
want I'm going to name my stack how well
creative and then go ahead and put a new
stack and then go ahead and put string
in here now go ahead and put your empty
parameters because it doesn't take any
parameters in this constructor and then
go ahead and the first thing we need to
do we have an empty stack right now so
we need to push something or put
something on a stack so go ahead and put
stack and then we can call methods right
from here so let's go ahead and put push
and as our first item we want to add is
a string I'll just name my bottom you
can name anything you want so now after
this let's just go ahead and print out
the stack after everything we push or
pop from it and this can allow you to
see what's going on so go ahead and put
print stack and this is a method that
we're going to be building later and for
the parameter it's going to take what
collection of course our stack so let's
go ahead and we'll push three items on
this
and print it out each time so just copy
this two more times and we'll paste it
we'll name the first one bottom the
second one second and the third one
third so this is going to be really easy
to see what's going on so now we have a
stack with three items on it or three
dishes the first one is named bottom and
that's on the bottom the second one is
named second and third one's named third
so now whenever we pop elements we don't
need to pass at anything we pretty much
don't need to tell it which one it needs
to take off because it automatically
always takes the top one off so instead
of passing it in an element we just name
pop and automatically pops off the first
element off the top so go ahead and put
stack top pop and we're going to go
ahead and call this three times because
we have three methods or excuse me three
items in our stack right now so go ahead
and call pop then go ahead and print
stack just copy that and paste it and
let's go ahead and do this three times
and what this will do is what we did
here is populate the stack with three
items and then by popping it three times
we removed all three so now outside your
main method we're going to want to go
ahead and build a new method called
print stack so let's go ahead and put
we'll make it private because we're only
using it in this class
grab it static void not return anything
print stack and as your parameter of
course you have to pass it in a stack
that is string data and we'll just name
it s for simplicity and let's go ahead
and write a simple if statement that's
the only thing we need put in here first
we need to check if the stack is empty
so if s dot and is empty is built in
method that returns either true or false
it of course returns true if it's empty
and if it's not a returns false so
that's why we are able to use that so
first of all check if the stack is empty
if it is system.out.print line and we'll
just write like you have nothing in your
stack
and now we can go else so this else code
is going to run as long as there is
anything in our stack so let's go ahead
and put system.out.print format will
probably be the breast print for this
and for the format go ahead and put % s
and this is going to be the stack and
just go ahead and put top in the new
line so whenever we see top we know that
this is the top of the stack and for
your arguments just pass it s so you can
actually pass an entire stack is a
single string variable so that's a cool
thing in this so let's go ahead and run
this and see what it looks like as you
can see the first thing we did is we
populated it and print it out after
three times so we populated it with
bottom bottom second and here's the top
of the stack bottom second third here's
the top and then we popped it three
times we popped the third off we pop
second off and then whenever we pop
bottom off our stack was empty so that's
why we got the code you have nothing in
your stack so that's pretty much how to
use the push and pop in what stack is
and this is one data structure it's not
the most common but we'll be going over
some more in this tutorials to come so
thank you guys for watching don't forget
to subscribe and I'm out of time for
this tutorial but I will see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
