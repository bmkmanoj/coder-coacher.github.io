layout in a couple different ways we
know how to organize our widgets around
the screen now let's get to the good
stuff let's learn how to make that GUI
or the widgets actually interact with
our computer program so the first thing
I want to show you guys is how you can
its called binding a function to a
widget in other words how you can do
something like click a button and it can
call a function in your computer program
so let's go ahead and make a very simple
function first I'll just make something
called like a print name so of course
the only thing that this is going to do
is it's just going to print something
out on the screen right here
so just like before whenever we just use
print and we'll pass something like
hello my name is Bucky that's all the
function does so how do we indeed call
this through the GUI well of course what
I want to do is I want to call this
whenever I click a button on the screen
so the first thing we need of course is
a button I'll call it button 1 and in
order to make a button use the button
object where do you want to put it well
we just put it in our main window
that'll be the parent next what text do
you want to appear on the button and
I'll just say uh I don't know like print
name go print my name might as well now
the last thing the less parameter that
this button is going to take is this
it's a new parameter called command now
what you can do is you can add this
parameter and it says whenever I click
this run a certain function well what
function we only have one in scope print
name so I'm going to throw print name in
there so basically this says build a
button with these properties and also
whenever you click it call the function
print name and another thing I want to
point out is whenever you use this make
sure not to have those parentheses right
there so that's another thing
that I know you just have to keep it in
mind so now what we have to do is
actually have this display on the screen
so button one we're just keeping simple
pack it in and check it out so I'm going
to run this of course we just have a
very basic button and if I can there we
go
so now I'm going to click it and keep an
eye down here so whenever I click it all
it does is it calls print name which
just prints something very simple out in
the command line now of course
eventually I'm going to be showing you
guys how to actually make text appear on
your GUI and just a little preview it
involves just changing I don't one way
is just changing a label you can um you
know change it to like cello my name is
Bucky or whatever you want to do but
that is the very basics and this is
called binding a function to a widget in
other words connecting this function to
this widget in other words a button
click now since we have actually a lot
of time left I'll show you guys um I
don't want to say that it's a better way
but it's definitely another way that we
can bind functions to widgets and that's
this so inside actually let me do this
first we don't need this command anymore
because I'm going to be showing you guys
another technique that you can use and
in this print name right here what we're
going to do is we're going to pass it in
an event now an event to your computer
is just something that occurs well what
can occur well you can have a button
click from the user you can have a
scroll you can have I don't know a mouse
movement you can have a button clicked
on the keyboard all of these things are
called events basically something that
the user can do so what we want to say
is whenever a specific event occurs then
call some function accordingly so you
may have an event or a function that
gets called whenever you left-click a
button you may be on have a different
function that gets called whenever you
right click on a button for right now
I'll just say pretty much the same thing
we just said but in a different kind of
way we'll say this unbuttoned one what
we want to do is we want to call this
function called bind now bind takes two
parameters what event are you waiting
for it to occur and what function do you
want to call whenever that event does
occur well the event name for left
clicking your mouse button is this
button - 1 or button 1 and make sure you
put them in between this less than sign
and greater than sign so the events they
look kind of weird but this button one
is the left mouse button so that's the
event whenever you click it and what
function do we want to occur well print
name just before and also another thing
whenever you call a function make sure
not to have this right here in this is
pretty much think of it like this
whenever we click a button that's all
we're doing we're just doing something
really simple we're not passing it in
any additional information we can't like
or like click three times and pass it in
the number three so that's why we don't
need those parentheses
right now so again this binds a button
click to the function so whenever you
run it just like before you click it and
it says okay
well I clicked it and what do you want
me to do whenever I click it just print
the name so those are two different
techniques of how we can pretty much
make our computer program or GUI
interactive by binding functions to
widgets so in the next couple tutorials
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
show you guys about different kinds of
events and also how we can have our GUI
change dynamically so we don't need
everything to appear in this little
console right there so for now thank
guys for watching as always and well
check out my forum and I'll see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
