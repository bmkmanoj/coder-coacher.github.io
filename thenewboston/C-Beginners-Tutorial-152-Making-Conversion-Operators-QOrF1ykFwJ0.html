fifty seconds c-sharp tutorial that I'm
making for the new boston and in this
tutorial I'm going to be showing you how
to create your own conversion operators
so all you need for this tutorial is a
button and item class and inside of your
item class just make sure you have a
public into your property mine is called
price so before we can look at creating
our own conversion operator we first
have to understand what explicit and
implicit means explicit basically means
that the user has to do something to
tell the compiler and implicit basically
means that does it automatically so the
first thing that we're going to be
looking at an explicit conversion so to
do an explicit conversion you basically
have to tell the compiler that you want
to be converted one way of doing that is
cast of it so we're going to say item i
equals and then we could cast on an
integer as an item so if you cast this 3
into an item but since we haven't set up
a conversion operator for yet we can't
do that I mr. Marcus as X Alyssa now if
we wanted to make it implicit meaning we
don't have to tell the compiler to
divert it that would just be item i'll
call this item equals three and then
this would be implicit meaning that we
didn't have to do anything it just
automatically converts it and since we
haven't set up an implicit conversion
operator you can't do this yet either
alright so the first thing we're going
to be looking at is creating our own
explicit conversion operator so just
like well we're working with all
operators you're gonna have to make it
both public and Static going to type
public static next we have to specify if
we want it to be explicit or implicit
like I said before we're going to be
looking at explosive person's life
explicit then we're going to have to say
operator so since the operator because
you're going to be creating your own
conversion operator and after all that
we finally get to choose what we want to
cast as or convert it into and it's
going to be an item and it must be the
same name as your classf else it won't
work so it's going to save item and then
in here we're going to say what we want
to turn into an item in this case we're
going to be turning an integer into an
item we're going to say enter it here
and all this college item price alright
so inside of here is where we want to
convert this into here into an item and
since we specify that it must be an item
or going after we be returning an item
so we're going to create a new item here
I almost call it I and study you can do
a new item and then I'll say the item's
price equals whatever integer the user
passes through here there is a item
price and then we're just going to
return this new item that we've created
so its return I so as you can see now
this explicit conversion is perfectly
fine because you created a conversion
operator for it now let's take a look at
creating an implicit one and it's just
the exact same thing only market as
implicit so we're just going to copy
this right here basically just say
impulsive implicit however we cannot
have both an explicit and implicit on
conversion operator or converting the
same thing into an item so we're going
to choose between what you one you want
to do so first let's just take a look at
this explicit so we're just going to
comment this out we're not looking at
this animal alright so this explicit
conversion is perfectly legal so let's
have a message box display this item's
price so we're just going to say I price
to string we should get three in a
message box because we converted on this
3 into an item so now I need to bug here
you get three yep alright and now let's
make sure that our implicit conversion
work on fine and since this is implicit
we didn't have to specify that we want
to convert it into on items so I'm going
to comment this explicit conversion
operator and uncomment out with
impulsive one so we can implicitly
deserve it so now let's display this
items Christ in a message box and we
should get three as well since
this item equal three missing
messagebox.show item price to string
sends it's an integer all right so now
any bug we should get three yeah perfect
all right so that's pretty much it for
this tutorial on creating your own
conversion operators so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
