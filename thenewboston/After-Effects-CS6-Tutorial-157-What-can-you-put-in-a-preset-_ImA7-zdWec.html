Blackford here with another After
Effects cs6 tutorial and we're gonna
keep on talking about animation presets
and the different ways you can use them
so in the last tutorial I basically
showed you how to save your presets and
how to apply them onto your text so I'll
go over really quick to how to apply
them on your text again really fast in
case you didn't watch the last one so
just really quick and rough come over
here to your extant presets panel twirl
down you got your presets here your the
presets that come with Adobe or under
the presets folder and the ones that you
have created are under the user presets
folder just click and drag onto your
layer just like you would drag an effect
so I saved this one last time it's just
a blur and a bulge effect on to the
layer so I'm gonna delete them off and
now you know that you can save effects
into your animation presets so just add
any effects that you want and I don't
even know what I'm picking let's
pasteurize whatever so I mean we've got
a couple effects here like this blur
this back are a radial blur and all that
stuff so you can apply effects to
animation presets so I'll just save this
one and this will be radial blur and
posterize
so we've got the ability to save effects
let's delete those off now if I want to
save animation I can do that also so
let's let's animate the scale first
we'll start it here and we'll bring the
scale down something like this and then
I'll animate some position properties
maybe I'll have it fly in scale down
like that or something like that
what's easy ease this one keyframe here
and then I'm gonna press you to bring up
the every Popat property that I have
animated I want to select my position
pull control select my scale and we have
both of these selected make sure that
your key frames are selected and also
make sure you don't have anything
selected that you don't want to be a
preset let's click on our preset button
here to make the preset and I've got
what a scale and a position from the top
left so I could say fly in scale down
top left or something like that flying
in scale down top left our from top left
if maybe I should say but it's it's good
to have a descript descriptive name for
your preset so let's delete these off
and see if we can apply a preset and see
if it looks the same so we're gonna come
to our user presets
we've got fly in scale from top left
drag that on and look at that we've got
it in here it kept our easy ease
keyframe in there
that I created and it keeps it on the
exact time in seconds that you put it in
there as so if I move this back and I
saved it earlier then that's a basically
if I moved around the keyframes to like
5 seconds it would have pasted the
preset on at five seconds instead of at
three so that if you understand what
that means so now we know that we can
save effects and we can save animation
properties like the position and scale
and all that stuff so if I twirl down
and I've got our transformation
properties here any of these I can
create a an animation preset with so let
me take that off I'm just gonna delete
these out so I don't have to worry about
them later now one thing when you're
creating animation presets say I'll put
those back on real quick say I put on an
effect right now and I just want it to
be like some kind of distort effect and
I'll do ripple
and we'll just make it so that it does
something so now I've got my animation
preset here if I I accidentally have the
selected somehow and then go to drag
this and create an animation preset
let's do rip and I think I'm just gonna
I just want to save Ripple alright so
let me delete this
you're gonna accidentally bring in the
keyframes of the property you
accidentally had selected so let's show
you that so you want to make sure that
everything isn't selected as you can see
here now I've got the ripple on there
and I accidentally had my position
keyframe selected so it pastes it those
in also and you can see that I had my
current time indicator at this point
right here
that's where it pasted the position
keyframes from so keep that in mind it's
going to paste the position keyframes at
the time of your current indicator and
go from there how many seconds you had
when you first saved it so I want to
delete this one so we're gonna have to
let's go back in and we can come back in
and just delete this out so that's how
you delete your animation presets now
another thing you can save is masks so
let me delete all this stuff out and
let's just create some masks let's bring
this in the middle
and I'll create another mask here this
is shape by accident
you can tell when it's a mask are shaped
by the color make sure I have my layer
selected what I'm doing this so I've got
two masks there that's invert these so I
could see more what's going on
actually subtract
well there we go so now we've got our
two masks just cutting things out we can
select our masks here and create a new
preset and this one I'm not going to go
too crazy with the name because I'm
never gonna use it but goofy masks save
now I'll delete out my masks and bring
them on to just make sure that it works
if you masks bring it on and there we've
got our master safe so that's helpful if
you don't want to draw masks all the
time or twirl down and always have to
copy and paste the different masks one
thing that you should be aware of is
that if you create an animation preset
and you put it on to a layer if you go
to try to edit that animation preset and
save it over top so you say that over
the top of the one that you already had
it's not going to update all the layers
that have it on it you're gonna have to
reapply that to the different layers so
that's just like a gotcha kind of thing
or something to keep in mind while
you're doing this and also just like
what I showed you when I accidentally
selected those keyframes make sure you
press you hold shift and press f12 I
think it is
no no Shift + f2 and that will deselect
all like the keyframes and stuff like
that that you had so push press shift F
2 and then go ahead and select your
whatever you want to actually put into
your animation preset that'll deselect
anything else so you don't bring
anything in by accident so those are
those are a few tips and stuff like that
about presets and the different things
that you can use there's probably some
more things that you can put into preset
animation presets so basically the rule
of thumb is anything that you can copy
and paste
and after-effects you can pretty much
make an animation preset out of it so
just keep that in mind as your general
rule of thumb so thanks for watching
this one and I'm gonna make another
tutorial about how to use how to apply
animation presets because there's about
six different ways and I guess that
warrants another tutorial so thanks for
watching this one and keep an eye out
for the next tutorials see you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
