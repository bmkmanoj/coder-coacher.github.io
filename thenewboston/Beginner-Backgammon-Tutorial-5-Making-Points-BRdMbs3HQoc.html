to another backgammon tutorial in this
tutorial what I'm going to be doing is
beginning to talk about strategy and
give you guys some tips that are going
to give you the competitive advantage
over your opponent so check so the first
thing that I want to talk about is
making a new point so a new point again
is taking two or more checkers and
putting me on an empty point now a new
point is good for a couple of reasons
first of all when you're traveling
around the board with their checkers it
gives you a safe space to land because
remember one checker alone is vulnerable
to be hit so you often want to make new
points for that reason also as you can
see one of your opponent's checkers
can't land on point that's occupied by
two or more of your checkers so that's
why another reason that making a new
point is good because it gives your
opponent more problems and it makes it
more difficult for them to move around
the board so there you go so let's go
ahead and take a look at some common
opening plays and let me just tell you
guys this here's a little quick rule you
can remember as soon as you start out on
your opening play anytime you roll the
dice and the numbers on it are separated
by two spaces for example one and three
that's separated by two spaces um two
and four three and five or four and six
anytime your dice are separated by two
numbers you can go ahead and make a new
point in your home board and this is
going to be a great advantage of start
up so let's go ahead and take a look at
those points right now see your roll
this one and your three to start here's
what you typically want to do you want
to move this six point to a five to get
a check on your five point and move this
one on your eight point one two three to
move this one one move this one three
and check it out you know that you now
got your new five point and what's the
benefit of this first of all when you're
traveling around you now have a safe
spot Blin and also it makes these two
checkers harder to escape from there
excuse me go pass your home board
so now that they can land on one two
three or four
they now have four and five blocked off
as well as seven right there so it's
going to make it a lot more difficult
for them to move around to get those
last checkers out so another thing to
and for your two and your four is going
to give you your new four point your
three and your five is going to give you
your mid 3 point and where you roll a
four and six that's going to give you
your new two point that is it really
useful because it's a I mean if you roll
it you roll it but it's going to be real
easy for your opponent to roll anything
to hop right our view but anyways still
a good play nonetheless so that is your
basics of why making a new point is good
and remember your little tip when
starting out anytime you have a roll
separated by two numbers you can always
make a new point in your home port so
don't forget it
alright guys the next scenario I want to
point out is whenever you have the
option of making a point in your home
board versus making a point in your
outer board now let's say you've been
playing for a little bit and the board
looks like this remember you're brown
right now so you just rolled a 6-1 and
remember from my last tutorial I told
you it's always a good idea to make a
new point so you're looking at the board
looking at make a new point and you see
that you have two options you can go
ahead and play your six one like this
one two three four five six and move
this one to one which will give you a
new point in your home board or what you
can do is make your new seven point by
playing this one two three four five six
and moving your eight to seven for your
one now this will give you a new point
on your seven right here so saying all
right should I have a new point on my
five or a new point on my seven which
one is more beneficial and why well
typically when you have the option of
making a new point on your home board
versus new making a new point on your
outer board you typically want to make a
new point on your home board now this
exists for a couple of reasons first
reason is this these checkers on your
six point are kind of hard to play
because if you look at these checkers
back here
here all the options you can move it to
all of these points but these checkers
on your six point right here you only
have four options right now so whenever
you have opportunity to make a good play
with these checkers you typically want
to do so another thing is if you go
ahead and play your six one right now
you see that not only does it make it
harder for these chips to escape but
whenever you capture any checkers that
are coming off the bar remember they got
a roll off and they got to land on one
of these spots right here so whenever
you can block more spots for them it's
going to make it harder for them to come
off the bar and remember if they're not
able to come off the bar and the roll
then they have to pass their turn so if
you fall from behind but you got a good
block setup right here then this leads
the potential for a huge comeback or if
you're in the lead then you can pull a
in secure your win
so anyways anytime you can make a point
in your home board you typically want to
do so and this is a perfect example of
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
