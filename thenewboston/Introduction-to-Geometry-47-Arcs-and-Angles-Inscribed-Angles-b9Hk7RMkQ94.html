angles we're going to talk about a
special kind of angle called an
inscribed angle and then scribed angle
has its vertex on the circle so this
angles vertex is P and it's on the
circle and its sides form chords of the
circle so it's other points have to form
chords of the circle which this does so
angle vpe intercepts ve this arc right
here such that the measure of this angle
is half the measure of this arc so if we
know that the measure of angle vpe is 40
degrees the length of Arc ve has to
equal 80 degrees because this is twice
the length of this or this is one half
the length of this so now we're going to
do an example so we know we have these
three angles which form a triangle each
one of these angles in it is an
inscribed angle because its vertex is on
the circle and its sides form chords of
the circle so first they want the
measure of Arc J be JB ok so JB is
captured by the angle G so that means
that this angle is half the length of JB
so 65 is equal to half the length we're
just going to call this arc x
so we're going to multiply both sides by
2 to find what x equals and x equals 130
degrees so like that is 130 degrees now
they want the measure of Arc gb so gb is
captured by this angle j so that means
that this length we're going to call it
Y is twice the size of J or J which is
53 is equal to half the length of this
which is why so you could set it up that
way or you could say that or you could
say that y is equal to x the measure of
this angle which is 53 either way you
have to multiply by 2 and you'll get a
hundred and six for the measure of y so
gb has a measure of 106 degrees now
finally they want the measure of gjg so
jg is captured by this angle X but we
don't know the measure of angle X so
we're going to use our rules of in the
interior angles of a triangle to solve
for x so we know that the measures of it
of the angles of on the inside of a
triangle has to be 180 so we're going to
take 53 + 65 + X and set it equal to 180
if you add these two up you get 118 is e
+ + x is equal to 180 if you subtract
118 over you'll get x is equal to 62
degrees
so now that we've finished that we're
done for the day but make sure you come
back and watch the next video where we
talk is about arcs and chords and their
relationship to one another</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
