ingles we're going to talk about a
special kind of angle called an
inscribed angle and then scribed angle
has its vertex on the circle so this
angle is vertex is P and it's on the
circle and its sides form chords of the
circle so it's other points have to form
chords of the circle which this does so
angle vpe intercepts ve this arc right
here such that the measure of this angle
is half the measure of this arc so if we
know that the measure of angle vpe
is forty degrees the length of Arc Vee
has to equal eighty degrees because this
is twice the length of this or this is
1/2 the length of this so now we're
going to do an example so we know we
have these three angles which form a
triangle each one of these angles in it
is an inscribed angle because it's
vertex is on the circle and its sides
form chords of the circle so first they
want the measure of Arc J be JB okay so
JB is captured by the angle G so that
means that this angle is half the length
of JB so 65 is equal to half the length
we're just gonna call this arc at
so we're going to multiply both sides by
two to find what x equals and x equals
130 degrees so length that is 130
degrees now they want the measure of Arc
GB so GB is captured by this angle J so
that means that this length we're gonna
call it Y is twice the size of J or J
which is 53 is equal to half the length
of this which is y so you could set it
up that way or you could say that or you
could say that y is equal to x the
measure of this angle which is 53 either
way you have to multiply by two and
you'll get a hundred and six for the
measure of Y so GB has a measure of 106
degrees now finally they want the
measure of g jg so JG is captured by
this angle X but we don't know the
measure of angle X so we're going to use
our rules of in the interior angles of a
triangle to solve for X so we know that
the measures of it of the angles of on
the inside of a triangle has to be 180
so we're going to take 53 plus 65 plus X
and set it equal to 180 if you add these
two up you get 118 is plus plus X is
equal to 180 if you subtract 118 over
you'll get X
is equal to 62 degrees so now that we've
finished that we're done for today but
make sure you come back and watch the
next video where we talk is about arcs
and chords and their relationship to one
another</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
