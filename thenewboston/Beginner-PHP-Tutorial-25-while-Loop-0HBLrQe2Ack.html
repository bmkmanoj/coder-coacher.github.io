and this video created for the new
Boston is going to talk you through PHP
while loops now why do we use loops in
the first place as programmers now we
may need to repeat a certain amount of
actions a specified amount of times and
in a couple of these videos I'm going to
be talking about while loops and then
do-while loop and then we're going to go
into four loops as well so what do we
mean by a loop a loop let me just show
you the syntax first of all is for a
while loop anyway is while a certain
condition is true so we're sort you know
if you if you understand if statements
you should really understand this we're
saying while something is true do
something in here so for example at the
moment I'm going to say echo hello and
I'm going to break down a line so while
a certain condition is true now if I was
to just pop a one in here it would be a
pretty bad idea because one is always
going to be true as we've discussed in
previous videos zero is always going to
be false so we can run this one if we
refresh that's fine nothing's happened
the page hasn't crashed however if we do
y equals a while one this is always
going to equal true so probably going to
crash the page in writing hello over and
over again basically until infinity so
it's an infinity amount of times or
infinite amount of times rather however
if we create a statement in here that
allows at some point for to evaluate to
false but while we want it to evaluates
to true we can sensibly echo this an
amount of times so let's say I want to
echo hello at ten times I can create a
counter up here and I'm going to start
that at one now what I want to do is I
want this loop tête echo or I want this
loop to execute so run this block of
code until one equals 10 so we're
echoing once
twice three four five all the way up to
ten times and then once this counter
equals ten we stop the loop therefore
breaking this this block of code here
and we continue to the rest of our code
down here so if this doesn't make sense
follow along my example and hopefully it
will do soon so we'll get rid of the the
condition first of all and what I want
to do is I want to say counter plus plus
remember this is incrementing this value
each time so now we've the first time
probably you may have found a use for
incrementing obviously we can do counter
equals counter plus one but for
shorthand counter plus plus now the
condition will be when counter is a
while counter is is smaller than or
equal to ten so what we want to do is
say while counter is smaller than or
equal to ten okay and this is basically
saying if counter equals one run the
loop now counter is going to equal two
on this line so counter will then equal
two and then we'll run this again it's
still smaller than ten so say hello and
now counter equals three so three this
still is blah blah blah all the way up
to nine now nine is still smaller than
ten we echo hello we increment the
counter it's 10:00 now counter equals
ten so we run this this will equal 11 so
11 now this condition is now rendered
false it's it evaluates to false so
we're not going to execute this code in
here so hopefully that way is a way of
making sense to it for you we're going
to reset this counter back to 1 I'm
going to refresh the page and see what
happens so now you can see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
8 9 10 times with echoed hello and to
prove this sort of counter method inside
I'm going to append the variable count
on to the start of this hello so this
will actually say one hello and then it
will say - hello
and it will say three because we're in
current increment in this value each
time so it's basic logic so let's
refresh the page and see how that's
worked there we are so we've got 1 2 3 4
5 6 7 all the way up to 10 and you can
now see just by that example that we're
incrementing the value so the while loop
will always have a condition at the
start of it that will need to be
evaluated before we even begin to
process the block</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
