a circle comes in this form with with
one little stipulation this is usually y
minus a squared plus y minus B squared
equals R squared with a B this Center so
for this equation it's centered about 0
0 because we're not subtracting any
numbers and then our radius is R so we
would take the square root of both sides
to solve for R and this isn't an action
we don't have an actual number for our
but what if I told you that x squared
plus y squared is equal to 4 we would
take the square root of 4 to find out
what R equals so R equals 2 so our
Center is at 0 0 I'm just gonna put that
so you know but you remember a circle
doesn't intersect its center so if we
have a radius of 2 that means that every
point is 2 away from the center so
that's what our circle would look like
okay so x squared plus y squared equals
4 this is what we just did so we're
gonna skip this one X minus 1 squared
plus y plus 1 squared equals 9 so first
we're going to find out what our radius
is our radius is equal to the square
root of 9 so R is equal to positive and
minus 3 now in this case our plus and
minus tells us direction so it says our
radius goes 3 to the right and it also
goes 3 to the left so our center if you
remember it
comes in this form a B so our a is
positive one our B is negative one so
that's our Center so I'm going to plot
that one negative one so this is our
Center and our radius goes three in each
direction so up three left three and
down three so there's our circle and I
know it's not perfectly a circle I don't
have a compass with me right now and
that's all actually for our equations of
circles but make sure you come back
where we're going to talk about a third
nonlinear equation called an ellipse</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
