128 Android tutorial for the new boss
and we're gonna do in this three we're
basically gonna check if our sensor is
updating forgetting these values and all
that good stuff so what we're gonna do
we're gonna scroll up to or you know my
bring back class here and in the run
method this is where we created our
canvas and we created the background of
the canvas what we're gonna do is just
draw our ball to the screen so or to our
canvas I should say when it's unlocked
so again this kind of a quick review of
drawing stuff so again I'm just gonna
say canvas draw bitmap and and then we
have our parameters what we're gonna
draw is our ball that we set up and the
left value we're gonna start everything
in the center of the screen so what we
can do is we can say float Center center
X is equal to again our canvas dot get
width divided by two and we can just
copy this just copy this and let's
change it for a while you and get the
height divided by two that's going to
give us our center in height now what
we're gonna do is we're gonna say Center
X here so we're gonna say here is Center
X which is that float we just set up and
maybe like plus our sensor X and then
what we're gonna do for our you know
height we're going to just say Center y
plus sensor X or I'm sorry sensor Y and
for paint we're just gonna say null so
that's basically gonna somewhat paint
our bitmap in the center of the screen
and it's not going to be the center of
the actual bitmap itself so it's gonna
be a little bit off but as you can see
we ever since her X and our sensor Y
added to that but basically the problem
is this sensor is only you know it
varies from like 0 to believe 40
is the amount of force that you can
apply to it so we're gonna just kind of
amplify the amount of pixels that's
going to gonna be able to move by like
let's say 250 something like that for
both of our sensor Y and our sensor X so
250 and we're pretty much done with this
tutorial just one other quick thing is
since we registered our listener we want
to maybe create a onpause method and
unregister it so it's not always plain
so i'm just gonna go to source override
and then just on pause method here and
we're going to unregister it right here
but again we have to allow all of our
other classes to access the sensor
manager so i'm just going to cut that
and put SM here and then scroll up to
the top of our class and paste it there
so now we can refer to that SM within
our paws math paws method so we're just
gonna say unregister listener and we're
going to say this for the context or for
the listener that we're unregistering I
realized that after I tried testing it
it wasn't working and that's because I
realize basically our surface view or
let me back up what I did is I created a
new bring back surface called our
surface for you again because again my
bring back surface won't run until we
have this because everything is set to
false to start with until it hits the
resume method so what I did is and
that's when it's going to create a new
thread that we're gonna draw to so what
I did is created a my bring back surface
called our surface and then within our
on create method which I moved down to
the bottom or set content view I moved
down to the bottom I just created our
service to equal new bring back this and
then I just called the resume method
which would you know set all of our
variables to be true and create that new
thread so if you guys are following
along you will make sure you want to do
that and then we set our content view
after we called this resume method and
I'll show you guys what looks like oh
and also you guys want to probably go up
to this
go up to this drawbitmap and instead of
saying 250 you probably just want to do
20 so alright I'll see you guys in a
second all right let me try and get more
in focus in this one all right there we
go so now let's go down to our
accelerate class I just want to quickly
show you some of the problems or one of
the problems which you guys can probably
figure out how to solve yourself but as
you can see as I tilt the ball back it
goes up the screen and as a tilt back it
goes down the screen tilt to the right
or to the left it goes to the right of
the screen and vice versa so I mean it's
not that great but at least you guys can
see a little bit of the accelerometer
and one of the problems that we're gonna
have is if we tilt it all the way over
it's gonna try and readjust our screen
and it's not going to like that and
force close our program so you can
either set the screen orientation be
fixed or whatever you guys want to do to
solve that problem but I'm not gonna
probably show a tutorial on it because I
bet you guys can figure it out yourself
and I'll catch you guys the next one how
good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
