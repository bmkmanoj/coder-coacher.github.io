sixth dreamweaver tutorial today we'll
be looking a little more on links last
time we learn the basics but now i'm
going to be teaching you how to change
remove and style links and some other
things as well so the first thing i
didn't teach you guys is how to open a
link in a new window say you have a link
to website such as YouTube as we have
right here but when the viewer clicks
the link you don't want them to go to a
whole new window you want them to stay
on your page and open up a separate
window this allows the viewer to stay on
your website while viewing a new webpage
that you have a link to so to do this we
already have this link hyperlink to
YouTube highlight the link and click
target down here and select blank now
whenever the viewer clicks the link
it'll open up a new window and not
navigate away from your page so as you
see I open up the browser and let's go
ahead and click a link and as you can
see instead of changing this page right
here it allows the viewer to stay on
that page and up YouTube and whole
separate window never leaving your
website the next thing I want to teach
you guys how to do is change links let's
say we have a link right here to youtube
but we want it to go to a new web site
like ebay so all you have to do is quite
simple just highlight the link and under
the link text box right here just change
the youtube to ebay
and changing the link is actually that
simple now to remove a link entirely is
a little different say we have this
email link and we want to remove the
link entirely but keep the text go over
to your link drop-down list and you'll
see all the web pages that you have
linked on your site and then you'll see
this blank space at the bottom click the
bit blank space and deselect your text
as you can see the text no longer has a
hyperlink or underline underneath it now
when you click the text nothing will
happen in the last thing I want to talk
to you guys about is styling your text
for hyperlinks under the page properties
button go ahead and click links this
will show you all the styles that you
can use for all of your links on your
website so let's say we want to change
all of the links to rage italic and we
want to make it so none of none of the
links are ever underlined you can also
change the size bold or change the
colors of different states of links the
visited links will show the links they
already went to the rollover links will
show it when you place your cursor over
it and the active links will show
whenever you're currently clicking down
on the link and you can change the
colors all of those but I'll leave them
like it just like now and click OK
as you can see our links are now rage
italic and they do not have an
underlying underneath them this is how
you can format links for an entire
website and one simple click again just
go to the page properties and click the
link types to format the links for your
entire website that's all the time we
have for right now but next time we'll
be diving into images for your website
and some more advanced topics as well
and if you're not already there you can
go to my website www mile cover
