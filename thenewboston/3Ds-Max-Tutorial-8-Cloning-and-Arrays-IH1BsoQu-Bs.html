studio max tutorial in this tutorial I'm
going to be going over cloning really
quick and I'm also going to be going
over something called arrays now I'm
just going to do a real quick tutorial
because I'm actually trying to hurry up
and get in some advanced modeling
because I want to start doing some you
know UFOs and people but before I do
that you got to understand what cloning
is so I'm a got to make a tutorial real
quick so in order to clone an object we
first need an object so I'm going to go
ahead and make a little box and it's
pretty good-looking bugs so in order to
clone it and it pretty much means copy
and paste it but you can't just copy and
paste that you can't just you know works
copy and paste I'm not seeing it
anywhere but what I do see is that I can
go ahead and select this object and I
can go to edit and clone now what clone
means is pretty much just create a copy
of it so let's go ahead and create copy
and go ahead and click OK now as you see
nothing changes and that's because with
3d studio max does is they put the copy
on top of the other copy why I don't
know but it's there if you move one
around you can see that it's actually
there in another way that you can copy
this is go ahead and select it hold down
the shift key and do any transformation
like move and then just let the Shift
key go and your mouse button go and now
your clone options button pops up and
this brings me to another thing what we
have here is copy instance and reference
what copy means is it makes an entirely
different copy that you can do anything
to and it doesn't affect the thing that
you copied it from an instance if we
select this as an instance let me show
you what happens it becomes an instance
of this object so if we go ahead and
change this object right here let's go
ahead and modify one of the properties
you can see that they both change
because even though they're two
different copies so to say they're each
instances of the other so whenever you
change one they both change and that's
different than this
one right here this one was a regular
copy so that's totally separate so when
you put a regular copy you can modify
this in the original one doesn't change
but whenever you have an instance and
you modify it they both think change so
remember an instance is pretty much the
same thing two different locations and a
copy is two totally different things
so with that being said let's go ahead
and delete all of these just select them
press Delete and let's go ahead and
create another box let's create this a
skinny one and make it pretty tall like
that like a big ol slit so now I'm going
to show you guys how to create an array
now what an array is is pretty much a
bunch of duplications of an object so
instead of having to copy that and copy
it and copy it if we just prick pick
like a button have a copy like ten times
that would be awesome so for example
let's say we're making like a wall with
like spaces in it I don't know I really
don't know or Domino's or something say
we wanted to copy this a bunch of times
well copying it could get a little
repetitive so let's go up to a new tool
and that's tools and probably should
select that first tools select objects
again eventually tools array there we go
and what this does is bring up your
array panel and what an array is it's
pretty much allows you multiple copies
of this so the first thing you need to
do is go ahead and click reset all
parameters so that way if you have some
numbers in here in there and in there
just go ahead and click reset and I'll
change it all to default again and
another cool thing which I'll show you
later is the preview but like I said
I'll show you later so what we want to
do is we want to copy a bunch of these
along the x axis and the x axis is the
long ways right here so let's go ahead
and say all right how many or what this
is is incremental what's spacing do you
want in between your objects and I want
mine space like ten ten spaces apart and
this array dimensions account is how
many objects you want well I only want
now let's say seven so now we have seven
object objects spaced 10 units apart so
what this totals mean is pretty much
whatever how far apart they're spread
times how many they are that's a total I
really don't know why they give you the
total I guess if you want to change a
total distance I mean I don't know just
the only two parameters you need are
what axis how far apart you want it and
how many elements and another cool thing
like I said I promised I'll tell you you
can preview this without having to you
know go in the without having to set it
firm and press ok so I preview this and
I see our a I got my seven elements but
I need them spaced out a little more so
I'm going to go and raise this baby up
like that and look at that oh yeah
that's the effect I'm on so now that I
previewed that I can go ahead and click
OK and set it so that's where preview
comes in handy a whole lot so that is
the basics of how to create an array so
now you see instead of just one element
I got seven elements or objects so that
is the basics of cloning an object and
again an array is pretty much a bunch of
a bunch of clones but you do it all at
once
and again to get to that that's tools
array so that's a for this tutorial like
I said I'm trying to just give you the
basics now because I want to get into
some pretty advanced modeling so thank
you guys for watching hopefully you
check out my next tutorial and hopefully
you subscribe so again thank you and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
