stuff on the screen and this command
line is just getting a little bit
cluttered so a very useful command that
you can use is CLS now you can run this
from any directory and all this is going
to do is is just going to clear your
screen so it doesn't like you know
delete any folder or file or anything it
pretty much is just like opening up a
new command line but you don't have to
actually close it and open it again so
again that's CLS and that means clear
screen very useful so now let me show
you guys this let me navigate over to my
desktop in file called Eric and I'll
show you guys what's in this right now
so right now in this file and by the way
erica is my main developer on my website
so that's why I have a random directory
called Eric and I have a bunch of images
inside here because whenever I find a
bug for my website I take a screenshot
of it and I'm like hey you might want to
check this out so you know that's my
background story that was embarrassing
um okay moving on alright so the reason
I told you guys that is because let's
say that I only wanted to list the pings
in here or maybe JPEGs or maybe any
specific type of document maybe just in
text files but what I can do is I can
write dir and so for example there are a
couple pings in here let's say if I just
wanted to view those I can write star
dot PNG so star is basically like a
wildcard character so this means list
any file it doesn't really matter it
doesn't matter what the name is but as
long as it ends in dot PNG then check it
out
so what it's going to do in this case is
going to go through and list all the
contents but only the ones that end in
PNG so all my pings pretty sweet now
another thing I want to point out is
this let me write CLS you clear the
screen a lot of the time you're going to
find yourself typing on a certain
command over and over and over again
now if the command is kind of long then
it can be
kind of a pain in the butt just to type
in the whole thing over and over so we
can actually do is you can access your
command history by pressing the up arrow
so if you just press your up arrow it's
going to take you through all of the
previous commands that you typed so look
at that now if you press the down arrow
then what's going to do is going to take
you back to the most recent one so
pretty much pressing the up arrow is
going back through your history and
pressing the down arrow is kind of like
pressing forward in a browser so let's
see say that I want to do a CD to go up
or directory well I want to go up
another directory but I'm too lazy to
type it again I can just hit up arrow
and type again up arrow boom look at
that let's go back to Bucky clear screen
in art actually let me go to a desktop
and Eric again I'll show you guys
something else cool and let's see what's
in here
alright so one other thing I want to
mention is this if you just type the
name of a file without any special
command before it what it does is it
just opens it in the default program so
I'm just going to type O to progress
part ping now I'm just typing the file
name and that's it so whenever I hit
enter what it's going to do is going to
look for whatever program I use to view
images and it's going to open in that so
if it's a text file it's going to open
it in notepad um you can actually open
executables and basically any file like
um I don't know even a Photoshop file
and it would open it in Photoshop if you
have Photoshop but there you go just
typing the name of file opens it in the
default program and the last thing I'm
going to talk to you guys about before
you go is this let's say that there's a
command that you're looking at online
and I don't know maybe your friend told
you about it if you guys talked about
come hands a lot and you want to find
out some more information about it so
I'll tell you guys now there's a command
called IB I P config but there's kind of
a lot of things that you can do with it
so to access the help and options menu
after any command
if you write forward slash question mark
this is pretty much going to bring up
the help or options menu so it's going
to give you a brief overview of what it
does and it says okay displays
networking information
it's basically what it does and it's
going to show you all of the optional
optional things or flags that you can
use with it in buy options I mean
remember I showed you guys that there's
the dirt command and then dir slash a so
that slash a is an option and there's
also a bunch of options for other
commands as well many ways we're getting
kind of ahead of ourselves and you know
I'm sure you guys are overwhelmed so for
now thing goes for watching don't forget
subscribe I will see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
