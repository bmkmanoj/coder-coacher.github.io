Android tutorial for the new Boston get
my name's Travis what we're going to do
in this tutorial is basically work with
this menu class which is the list
activity and will probably take this
tutorial in the next tutorial to finish
this up again I know this is probably
really confusing and it's kind of more
advanced but I just wanted to show you
guys that we can set something up in
Java and instead of the XML as well as
it's a great like little menu that we
can use throughout the rest of this
series so I wanted to get set up now but
if you guys confused please don't stop
with this series because this will make
I mean you guys will look back at this
and go I understand everything that's
going on but as for now I do realize
that is probably pretty confusing for
you guys I just wanted you guys to get
this set up for the most part but what I
want to introduce you guys to in this
tutorial at least is starting an
activity and you're like what we've
already done that I know how to start an
activity for the most part we do that
with an intent well basically I want to
show you guys a different way to start
an activity and what once you guys to do
is go within this on list item clicked
method and in the next tutorial I'll
kind of break down everything that we've
done or we'll finish our application
that'll break it down I just don't have
time to do it in one tutorial for the
most part so I'll show you guys how to
start a new activity again it's pretty
simple we're going to say start activity
and again this will take an intent so we
need to create an intent and we're going
to call this intent our intent
and what we're going to set this equal
to is again a new intent and before we
say our action name like calmed are
basically a comm dot you know the New
Boston dot starting point all in
uppercase or whatever our action name
was within the manifest now I'm going to
show you guys a different way that we
can set up an intent again we have to
import it but we're going to set up an
intent based off a class variable so
what we need to do now is set up a class
variable so again above our intent line
we're going to set up a class variable
called class or I'm sorry we're going to
call it our class or whatever you guys
want to define this as and when we can
set this variable equal to is something
we can use a method from the class
called class so we can say type class
and we can use this method for the name
and it gives us a string with it or we
need to put a string within here so
basically what we can do now is say calm
dot the New Boston dot Travis dot
starting point instead of you know our
action name was all uppercase this is an
actual class or basically the path a
string for the path of the class
starting point you can see that up here
here's our package name comm dot the New
Boston dot Travis and then we have it
looks through here and here's our
starting point class so it's kind of a
reference to that and basically it's
going to create a class variable for the
string name or for the path name of this
and then what we can do is we can set up
an intent based off that class but this
intent is going to take two things
within its parameters a context and a
class variable so we're going to say
again R this current classes context so
it's called menu so class name dot this
and then we're going to comma and in the
second parameter we're going to type our
class which is our class variable we
just set up
and then we can type our intent here so
there we go that's basically we'll get
into this this error why we're getting
an error here but in the next tutorial I
just wanted to show you guys that we can
set up kind of an start an activity in
this manner where we set up class and
then we set our intent and it uses a
class variable and then we can start our
intent that's basically the end of this
tutorial
obviously we're getting errors but we're
going to finish that up I'm going to
talk through everything in this
application kind of hopefully get you
guys to understand what we've built and
then we're going to get into something
really simple so again don't get
discouraged and feel like wow he's
moving too fast such a douche because I
will go back and we'll kind of cover
some easy stuff here but thanks again
for watching guys and I'll catch you
then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
