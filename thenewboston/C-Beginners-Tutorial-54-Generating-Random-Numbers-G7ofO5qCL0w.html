tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to easily random
class and the random class will just
allow you to generate random numbers so
all you're going to need for this
tutorial is a button and once you have
that on your form just double click on
it
so the first step in using the random
class is just creating a new instance of
the random class like random we're just
going to want to name our instance I'm
just going to call it R and then we'll
study equal to a new random class new
random class all right so now that we
have that we can just type out the name
of our instance of a random class and
then you get dot operator to access all
the methods inside of it and as you can
see right here we have a few different
methods but the first one that I'm going
to show you how to use is the next
method and the next method without
passing any parameters through we'll
just return a random number that is not
negative so now we're just going to
display this number in a message box to
make sure that it worked all right so
now we should just get a message box
with a random number inside of it yeah
and as you can see you're all different
numbers there's no rubies so those
numbers are fairly high those were how
you know maybe in the billions but
anyways if you wanted to like have a
number that was in between 0 and 100 or
something well you can do that you can
just pass parameters through here and
the first one you're going to pass
through would be the minimum value you
want to generate so we're gonna put 0
and 1 and then the maximum value and
we're just want the maximum value to be
a hundred
so we'll generate a number in between 0
and 100 so now we debug you should just
get a random number between 0 and 100 if
we got 50 to 80 954 yeah
sarandon the next method that I'm going
to showing you how to use is the arm
next bytes method and the next lights
method will basically just fill up light
array up with random bytes and as you
can see right here it calls for a byte
array to fill so in order to use that
method we're first map pacify Turing
through so we're just going to create a
new fighter area here I'm just going to
call it buffer and we'll study equal to
a new byte array that has five null
elements so now it's going to pass by
two right here if you call buffer and it
should return a byte array that is
filled with lights so now we're just
going to convert this into a string so
they can make sure that acts build we've
byte array with bytes so all we're going
to do here is we're gonna create message
box and we're just going to use the bit
converter class to convert our byte
array into a string bit converter dot
two strength we're just going to put our
byte array in there which is called a
buffer and basically this will just load
it into a string so right up here we
have a byte array called buffer that has
five null elements that are then raising
the our next bytes method to build that
byte array off with random bytes and
then we're using the fit converter class
to divert our byte array into a string
and then we're displaying that string in
a message box so every time you click
the button you should get random bytes
inside the message box yep they're all
different and the final method inside of
the random class I'm going to be showing
you how to use is the next double method
and the next double method will
basically just return a random number in
between 1 and 0 so it will be like zero
point something so we're going to do our
next double and I'll just
turn says right there returns a random
number between zero point zero and one
point zero so we're just going to
display this in a message box to make
sure that it actually does do it says
mark this little string all right so now
let me click this button we should just
get a random number between 0 1 0 and 1
point 0 so we should get like point
something now if you have
3 5 whatever 0.1 whatever so we know
it's generating a random number so
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
on generating random numbers so see you
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
