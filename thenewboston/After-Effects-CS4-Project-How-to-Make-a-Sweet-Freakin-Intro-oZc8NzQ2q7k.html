to another After Effects project now
today if you're watching my channel you
saw that I posted a video of a little
short intro I made and I actually got a
bunch of comments saying to make a
tutorial for it so here's my Soria for
it what it is is pretty much if I ever
make a movie or something this is going
to be the intro before it but anyways I
already have a couple of things here
from andrew kerry andrew kramer's riot
gear and you can get these from Video
Copilot on that and I know he actually
didn't pay me to say that I'm just
giving them a free plug so anyways I got
this cool background right here and a
cool little thing to take note of
anytime you're like moving around and
you can't get it to exactly level up
with the edge all you have to do is
select layer and go to layer transform
fit the comp and it'll fit exactly on
the edges just how you want it so I'm
gonna have like white and a red text on
this so what I'm gonna do is I want to
darken this first of all so I'm gonna go
ahead and put effect color correction
and I'm probably just gonna mix with the
levels you can mess with curves if you
want but this is fine so let's go ahead
and darken this and also bring down the
whites not all the way
probably like somewhere around there so
this is good for now so now instead of a
lighter gray background we have a nice
grungy kind of black background nice a
little bit darker so after this I want
to add my new text layer so I'm gonna go
layer new text and I'm gonna put the new
Boston Productions and the first thing I
wanted to do is I want to make this
white so I'll go ahead and select your
color and change the white and I'm gonna
change your new to red so make that red
and I'm also gonna want to bold the New
Boston alright like that and I'm gonna
want to unbold
production so I want to emphasize the
new Boston so that's what I'm gonna bold
that so now we have this nice text
that's bolded on the new Boston and also
red where I want new standout just
because I think it looks cool so after
this I want I just don't want this to
appear on the screen plain simple I want
reveal in kind of a cool way so in my
project I have this video clip right
here from andrew kramer's there we go I
can't concentrate and look at the same
time andrew kramer's uh what's called
riot gear and what it is is it kind of
is like a white creeping in and then
expanding well I want this to apply to
my text layer so here's what I'm gonna
do
the first thing I need to do is put luma
matte reveal and here's another thing if
you don't see this go ahead and press
columns and make sure you have your
modes on but anyways
put this movie right above your text
layer and then change your track mat of
your text layer to luma matte reveal and
this will put the matte on the text
layer and now whenever you play your
movie you see it kind of reveals like it
was before
pretty cool huh but a thing I wanna do
is actually let's go ahead and view this
layer again clicking this little eyeball
actually wanted to reveal you see is
revealing in the middle first I also
want that to be right on mine the new
Boston so that's right in the middle of
this movie so I'm gonna have to do is
hide this select my track mint hit my
arrow and just move it up until it
centers in the new Boston again before
it was right in the middle and I want
that right because I want the new Boston
to show first so now as you can see if I
move that matte the New Boston fades in
and then Productions gets revealed right
like that
so that's how you can use the luma matte
to reveal your title in cool ways so now
after this there's a couple more things
I wanted to do and I know I'm going fast
but there's a lot of things I want to do
in this tutorial i also got this cool
little brush stroke from yeah you
guessed it right gear right like that
and all it is is a white brushstroke on
black and this is perfect for transfer
modes now in order to get all the black
taken away we can use
any of these add lighten classic color
dodge what we wanted to do a cool one
you can pick any one you want
I think classic color dodge is a really
cool one and as you can see one problem
we have with this is it's kind of fading
in productions and it's just a little
too big so just go ahead and shrink that
and let's see just move it over here a
little bit and I kind of want to expand
this the entire blink right like that so
that looks pretty good right there maybe
I'll just sign it up just a tidbit
that's what she said and see that looks
pretty good right here but again I just
don't want this to appear on the screen
right like that I wonder this kind of
swooshing so here's what I'm gonna do
first I want my text fade in gradually
and when that's all faded in in about
three seconds then I want the Swiss to
come in so let's go ahead and select
your Swiss layer right here brush 26 I'm
gonna go ahead do effect transition
linear wipe and now what I'm gonna do is
change the angle of this because if you
change it well I guess you could have
either one but changing the angle shows
what direction you want the wipe to come
in from so let's go ahead and change is
somewhere around 102 degrees since as I
kind of tilt it in this direction again
if you set it up like this it will tilt
in or come in up and down I want it to
fade and left to right so now go ahead
and go ahead down the effects linear
wipe and we're gonna adjust wipe angle
so go ahead and add a keyframe right
here and we're gonna wanna oh I mean uh
transition completeness that's
embarrassing so go ahead and add
keyframe right here and change your
transition completeness to about 100
right like that then about let's say
close to a second and a half later go
ahead and add another keyframe and set
it equal to zero right like that so now
you see if you minimize this
your linear wipe comes in the transition
fades from left to right right after
everything fades in so the last thing I
want to do if I have time is probably
just add a quick grammar layer new
camera 35 is good and what I want to do
is transform the position so add a
keyframe right here at the position then
at the very end just move it a little
bit closer so let's see what's going on
here this keyframe is right there and my
camera oh by the way they all need to be
3d so now you see my camera kind of
moves in slightly the whole time so
there we go so this is your final
animation first it fades in and then you
get the nice little swoosh in the whole
time your camera is moving in and I know
I went quick but I only got 10 minutes
in this tutorial and I got time to spare
so uh thank you guys for watching don't

more questions just leave me a comment
