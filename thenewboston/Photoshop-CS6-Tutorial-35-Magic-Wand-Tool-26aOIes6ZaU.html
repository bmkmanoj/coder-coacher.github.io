Blackford here with another Photoshop
cs6 tutorial and in this tutorial I want
to show you how to use the magic wand
tool to select things quickly and easily
within Photoshop now the magic wand tool
has been around for a while within
photoshop and one one of its most iconic
tools and it's called the magic wand
tool because the icon just looks like a
magic wand so what it does is it selects
based on the shift in brightness ranges
within within an image so one things are
contrasting a lot it's going to be good
for those types of images where you need
to just select now the magic wand tool
isn't a super precise tool but it does
do the job nicely and quickly and is
very useful so we'll just gonna get on
with it so I have this image here where
it's just this logo or this I guess its
logo a logo on top of just a white
background and I don't want this white
background I want it to be transparent
so I could put this logo on top of
anything else so what we're going to do
is remove the white background with the
magic wand tool all we need to do is
click on the white background and it has
selected the entire everything that is
the white background
the only things it's going to miss are
the spots that are in between the
letters like the inside of this a it
says R and the inside of this a so I'm
going to hit delete to delete out any
white that has been selected and we get
that so that's really nice now all I
need to do is take the zoom tool zoom in
and I take our magic wand tool selected
here if you hold shift you can add to
your selection so all we're just going
to do is select the
spots and hit delete and now we're good
now everything has all the white has
been out clipped out so that's awesome
for us and now we can just take this
entire logo here and put it on anything
that we want so there's a couple things
with the with the magic wand tool that I
want to go for up here and the options
we've got our basic options that we have
with all the rest we've got our normal
selection add subtract and intersect if
you need more info on those check out
the marquee square marquee and
elliptical marquee tutorial which is
just a couple back we've got the sample
size here and then you can select the
number of pixels by which to sample from
so right now it's just going to select
one pixel but you can select an average
amount there five pixels by 5 pixels and
you get the average color of it and
that's how those work for the sample
size we've got our tolerance next door
and the tolerance goes from 0 to 255 and
the higher the value the more
information the magic wand tool selects
so the higher so if this is up at 255
it's going to select a wider range of
whites then if it was down here at 32 at
32 is just going to pretty much select
the white that you picked
you've got anti ant alias checked for
smooth edges contiguous here selects
adjacent pixels within the document so I
usually keep that checked and then we
got the sample all layers in case we
want to take something from every single
layer and select it
or select multiple layers at once so the
magic wand tool is helpful at getting
big chunks of objects out of you
or image so if you have something like
take this bike at sunset or something
like that and maybe we want to try to
select out this bike and then go ahead
and select in the select the sky so we
can delete that out but when I try to
select the sky since there's so many
different colors in here Photoshop is
going to have a hard time figuring out
what you want selected and everything
like that but it tries to do its best
you could increase the tolerance go to
100 and then try selecting in here and
you can see that it has selected more
and we've got some contrasting in the
tree and everything like that but it did
the best that it could and if we try to
delete that out we've got a section a
big section that's been deleted out for
us now it'd probably be easier to use
your lasso tool and cut out the bike
first and then maybe use like the magic
wand tool to get like sections in here
delete those out and things like that so
that's how you can use the magic wand
tool in conjunction with other tools so
that's it for the magic wand tool here
so thanks for your support and watching
the video subscribe if you want to see
some more Photoshop videos because a
bunch more are coming up so see you guys
at the next tutorial have a good one
