to my fifth video of left 4 dead 2 and
this one is my first video of the
highway mission and in this mission it's
right after you take the car from the
mall and drive it and you get trapped
behind this huge road and you pretty
much can't go any further because
there's way too many cars so let's go
ahead and it's not really confusing
mission as far as where to go until you
get to hotel so what I like to do is
stay on top of these cars and just pick
people off like a sniper even though I
have the worst gun ever for sniping
which is a shotgun but you know for this
game it works so go ahead yeah destroy
you and you have to stand over there
might as well blow your head off and
then just go ahead and I like the hop on
this car next and now you can pick off
the next set people if they are called
people or infected a very bound so there
we go destroy these people are right
here and I'm good so now what I need to
do is go ahead and this side of the road
is blocked so I need to get over to the
other side of the road so clear path
over there and where are my teammates to
help me seriously so let's go ahead and
this why I like playing with real people
because they just scatter around like a
old leaves have no strategy whatsoever
much more exciting these people
organized and smart in oh okay charger I
obviously moved out of the way but he
obviously bashed my head in anyways what
kind of crap is that and I I just
thought he'd probably be a really good
football player but instead he has to
get infected and charged me really
flipping annoying so anyways go ahead
and buy this plus this is where a cut
over and over there by that big ol on a
white truck is offering that we have to
go down let's go ahead
and pick up these people because they
don't mind you shooting them in the head
and that guy right there and now go
ahead and kill these last few people and
should shoot that gas tank yes never
miss opportunity to shoot against them
and I hear a Boomer somewhere so go
ahead and find them and I better get
this killed because I love shooting
boomers and Nick always kills them let's
see if I can find oh yeah nikodem kill
that one did you go ahead and kill these
people and their charger right there
evidently he can't figure out to get
over the guardrail so go ahead and just
pick them off right there same to pick
them off a lot in this sorrow I don't
know why maybe because a super bowl
yesterday and I was talking about pigs
anyways and look at all these people and
slaughter to these people I don't know
definitely not me or anyone on my team
you're like 800 people just lying in the
off ramp oh well so go ahead and pick up
this needle and ammo you know what
another thing I'm sauce why do you
always have to pick up like noodles and
pills and like moltov cocktails this is
a not very good game makes you think
that you're all crackheads and
alcoholics but you know what finally as
long as they don't have you pick up bags
of cocaine and on bowls then you should
be good so there's a hunter right there
and I probably want to kill him and I
will trust me so there is right there
BAM new boston kill hunter thank you
very much and just go ahead over here
and you're gonna find the hotel to your
right and this is the only part that may
be kind of confusing this hotel so don't
forget to check out my next video but
for now I better start wrapping it up
let me just kill these few people right
here and let me just reload and just
pick them off make sure you get them on
their hill or they're gonna give you
some problems later so go ahead kill
these people and the next disorder I'll
show you guys how to get to
the hotel which may be kind of confusing
but for now thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
