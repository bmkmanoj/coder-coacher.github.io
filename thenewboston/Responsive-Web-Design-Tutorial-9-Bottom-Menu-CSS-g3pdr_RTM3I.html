video what I want to do is I want to
start making this little menu bar at the
bottom and first thing I notice is you
see this little status bar that tells
you where the links pointing to that's
not an issue because remember this
website is only going to display on
mobile devices
first of all mobile devices they can't
tell whenever you're hovering over a
link like your phone can't tell whenever
you're hovering your finger over the
screen and also even if they could
mobile browsers don't have that little
status bar on bottom so that's never
going to display it's just because we're
testing on a browser now of course as
you can see it's made up of five
different buttons kind of like an
Instagram II um menu and you probably
can't tell right now because the
background is kind of dark but this is
also semi-transparent so whenever you
stroll like through your stream or just
look at some text you're going to see a
cool effect that this is
semi-transparent looks like it's kind of
built in and there's also an indicator
of the current page that you're on so
since we're on the home page that button
would be completely um opaque and
there's also this thin red line on the
bottom that is just an indicator of what
page you're on pretty cool feature so
now that we dissect it let's go ahead
and start building it so the first thing
I want to do is actually add which is
comment bottom menu and I like to do
that for all the core features and
that's just so when I'm scrolling
through I can easily say okay look for
the green stuff in I don't know it just
helps me now I guess I might as well
talk to you guys about this this bottom
menu right here is actually an unordered
list so normally you think a list like
um a grocery list with text a bunch on
top of each other but this is actually a
list and it has five list items inside
it so just remember that because this
bottom menu class is going to be applied
to the entire list the entire menu on
the bottom so the first thing we want to
do is we want to give it a font size now
even though we don't have any fun
displaying on it just images right now
some of you guys may want some I don't
know you may want like a back button or
um I don't know fall on it or whatever
the whatever fight you want to put on it
so it's always good to have font just in
case you decide that change things up
later now also another thing we want to
do is whenever we have long web pages
like a stream we don't want to scroll up
in this menu Scrolls up with it we want
it to stay on bottom even if we're
scrolling through our website so how do
we make this menu stick to the bottom
it's actually really easy the first
thing we need to do is set bottom zero
and also I'll show you guys this this
has nothing to do with the tutorial but
I saw on the internet someone they made
a class called
Titanic and they called they said float
num or none and they put bottom zero and
again I just thought was pretty funny
because the timox float don't flow
bottom zero I don't know anyways moving
on
alright so to make something stick to
the bottom give it a position of bottom
zero that means words this element going
to be zero from zero pixels from the
bottom now also the position is fixed
since we don't want to move it around
and also the width of this entire menu
is going to be 100% now this is a
responsive element it pretty much means
no matter how much you shrink or you
grow the screen the entire width of the
menu takes up the entire width the
entire width takes up the entire width
now you guys know what I mean alright so
those are the properties for the entire
menu so now what I want to do is I want
to start applying the styling for each
individual button now each individual
button is of course a list item since
this is indeed an unordered list but
it's also a link and we need to make it
a link because when we click it for
example when we click this button it
takes you to your profile so that's why
we need to make it a link so what I'm
going to do whenever I this
so I want to say okay in the bottom menu
whenever we have an unordered list which
is actually the menu and we have a link
a list item this is how we refer to a
button so if anything has the class
bottom menu and it's a link in the list
item which is pretty much a bun these
are the styles that we want to apply to
it
first of all color white and what this
means is any text on it is going to be
white since the menus dark white shows
up the easiest text-decoration:none and
this is just so by default on every link
gets underlined and we don't want our
links underlined just because they look
weird float:left and that is pretty much
so every button can appear stacked to
the left of each other instead of having
a menu that's stacked on top of each
other which will look also weird
list-style:none and again by default an
order list has a bullet on the left-hand
side of each item so we just want to
make sure that we don't have those
bullets so that's why let style none
means no weird symbols now the width
this is where things get kind of we have
to use our math skills a little bit now
the entire width of this is 100% we
already know that now we have five
buttons one two three four five so this
means that the width of each button has
to be 20 percent 20 40 60 80 100 now as
you can see I have this width at 16.8%
now this would look weird but instead
what we're going to do is we're going to
give a padding of 1.6% so of course the
padding means this space on the left and
the right hand side also the top and
bottom but when we have a padding of 1.6
on the left and the right that means we
have a total x padding of 3.2 so 3.2
Plus 16.8 that gives us 20% for each
individual button so whenever we do this
again this is the total width of 20% and
that way we can have five buttons that
fer fit perfectly in our unordered list
or the menu on bottom now also what I
want to do is I want to give a height of
100 percent and this is just so the ax
buttons um I don't know appear correctly
I guess that's the easiest way to
explain it now for the background Wow
mess that up for the background color
I'm just going to set it as black and I
also want to give it an opacity of we
just give this one 0.5 for my real
website it would be like 0.75 properly
but I want to demonstrate that by
default they're transparent so kind of
want to make that a little more than
normal so the last thing I want to do is
this for the border bottom by default
I'm just going to give it a border of
two pixels solid black now the reason
that I want to give it a default border
of black is because whenever we have an
active button which means that's the
page you're on we're going to give it a
bottom border of red now if we just
didn't apply any border to these other
buttons what would happen is this button
would be a different size than these
ones so I need to give them some border
so they're all the same size is the
active one so again give a default
border of black and we can change that
to red whenever um one of them is active
so now what I want to do is is I want to
make another CSS element just like this
but this one is going to have the class
selected so whenever we apply the class
selected to one of these buttons it
means that this button should be active
in other words we're just going to say
make it completely opaque so
transparency or opacity at all and add
that red border on bottom so this is
going to be like the easiest thing we
ever did
just set opacity to one so it changes
from fifty to one and also let me just
copy this to pixels solid and this is
actually the red color that I use on my
website give myself some space to work
with so now whenever we have anything
with a class selected those are the
styles that apply to it now the only
other thing that I want to do is this
actually let me just copy this right
here as you can see we have images
inside every button so we need to add
styling to make sure that those images
appear correctly so what we're going to
do is for each list item whenever you
have an image inside it this is how we
want to display the image I want to
display as a max height of 1 point 6 cm
and again this is all just personal
preference how big you want the buttons
to appear on the bottom I know that 1.6
M means that the image is going to be
about one and a half times higher one
point six to be exactly as tall is
normal font so that way it makes your
buttons clickable considering all the
padding and everything else now aside
from that I also want to give it a pet
leather padding top of 0.15 p.m. now
again this is just personal preference
if you ever are testing this on a mobile
device in your like ok my buttons are
way too small this is one of the things
that you can change to make them a
little more clickable but for right now
um you know I don't want them too big or
else they'll be button up against the
edges I don't want too small or else the
user isn't going to be the to be able to
distinguish what the heck they are so
that's a nice little median so for right
now this is our bottom menu
and of course it won't display whenever
refresh it because we don't have any
HTML so in the next Sorel what I'm going
to do is we're going to start typing in
the HTML but for now we got all our CSS
taken care of thank you guys for
watching and well I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
