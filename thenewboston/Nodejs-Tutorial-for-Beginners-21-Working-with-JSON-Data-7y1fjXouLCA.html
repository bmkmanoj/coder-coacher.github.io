show you how to use JSON data now of
course the first thing we need is JSON
data so if you already are using API
then go ahead grab some that from that
any debt is going to work fine however
if you don't and you just are you know
watching this video wanting to learn
then I already uploaded a little sample
file right on my github page so github
calm slash Bucky Roberts go to source
code from tutorials and inside nodejs of
course this tutorial is 21 you're going
to see a file called video data jason
and you can actually just copy all this
short little chunk 50 lines of code and
go back in IntelliJ and of course we
need to add this to our project so where
we want to edit is actually just in the
main directory so if you right click and
Meagan or whatever your file name is new
file I'm just going to name it video
data dot Jason and paste this in there
and boom look at that actually what I do
want to do is make sure this is all
formatted neatly so anytime you want to
or if you ever copy code from the
internet for I don't know maybe some
example code you want to include and you
paste it in and it's all weird like the
tabs are messed up and the spacings
looks funny and stuff we can do is you
can hit ctrl a to select everything then
ctrl alt L and what this does it
reformat your code it doesn't like
change your variables or anything it
just pretty much spaces it exactly like
it should be so this is already good so
that's why that didn't change beautiful
so now that we have some kind of JSON
data let's figure out how to use it if
you let me rearrange these steps so it's
a little bit easier to understand and by
the way before I continue I should
probably explain what the heck does that
is this is just data from the API that
we're working on for my site and is just
data about this appetizer section
I don't know why I picked this why the
heck not but basically it just has
information about these videos um like
the playlist titles how many videos are
in each and uh you know the name of each
playlist a little description about it
how many videos again just real quick
JSON data that was the first thing to
pop in so uh yeah there you go alright
so in order to learn how to include JSON
data or even how to use it at all we
first need to understand something
called local variables now this is a
kind of confusing name because
essentially what a local variable does
is it allows you to make a variable that
you can use anywhere in your program so
in other words we can make a variable
right here actually let me show you real
quick so what does our website look like
now alright so this is the home page
this is the about page looks pretty cool
and let's say that we had some kind of
point system and we wanted to display my
points on every single page well of
course we don't want to make a bunch of
variables that are just going to point
to the same thing because it will be
kind of a waste so what we can do is we
can make one variable and we can display
it anywhere we want in our entire
project so I'll show you guys how to do
that so in your app j/s right under this
line of code right here you can actually
stick it anywhere it doesn't matter as
long as it's after app do this app dot
locals right there and now after this
you give it a variable name and I'm just
going to name my points name it whatever
you want and set it equal to however
many points you think you deserve I am
pretty cool so I think I deserve eight
thousand seven hundred and thirteen and
doesn't have to be a number it can be a
name just make any variable that you
want well what this does is it makes a
variable local to your app and that's
the kind of confusing thing whenever a
variable is local to your app it pretty
much means a global variable that you
can use anywhere in your entire program
so say that we wanted to display these
points on the homepage well all we would
do is make a new paragraph here so let
me just copy this all we would do just
like before is just type points right
there and that's it so there you go
probably the easiest thing that you have
ever been taught anytime you want to use
something across any file then what you
do is you store it in a local variable
you have a name and you can use it
anywhere so why am i teaching the guys
this when we're supposed to be learning
about Jason well that's what we're going
to do with this Jason file
now remember adjacent file all it is is
pretty much a JavaScript object so what
we're going to do is we're going to take
this data this Jason file and we're
going to store it inside a local
variable and actually do that right now
so app dot locals and it doesn't need to
be a variable such as a string or a
number it can actually be in entire file
so I'm just going to name mine video
data and set this equal to require video
data dot jason and of course since it is
not the core module we have to reference
it properly and at our semicolon so now
what we can do is we can actually use
this video data object anywhere in any
of our templates and it's essentially
just equal to this right here which is
essentially just a JavaScript object
print the awesome so let's say that on
Oh No we'll just uh mess with my
homepage right now so on my home page
we'll say that we wanted to display some
info from this arm JSON file so we'll
just say we'll display the names of the
playlist just to keep things really
really easy so we can get rid of this
right here they're slow I didn't really
like that anyways alright so get rid of
this and actually let me get rid of
those the points as well now that you
know how to use them all right now
remember our entire
Jasin file it can be referenced through
the variable video data so now we can
just use it like any other variable so
video data and what do we want to print
out so for the header we'll just print
out category name category name and
actually let me change this to like
heading 3 so hopefully this will print
out appetizers insides
there you go appetizers and sides so now
what we can do in our unordered list is
we can just make a real quick loop loop
through the JSON data and for each piece
of information we can just print it out
as a list item so video data dot
categories dots for each and by the way
you're going to use the for each loop a
lot whenever you're working with JSON
data there's no point in making a
regular for loop because then you got to
count all the objects and then somehow
use that as the value to determine how
much to loop through just use it for
each loop it's a lot easier and it works
perfectly so inside here actually let me
and my semicolon first so inside here
we're just going to throw in a function
and the parameter for that function we
give a temporary variable now this
variable is going to represent each of
these objects so pretty much each
category so from there we can just say
arm print out like the category name or
you can print out the view count
whatever we want to do so just make sure
everything is in the right place Wow
sometimes autocomplete is a pain in the
butt
all right looks good make sure my tabs
are good clean up that and I'm going
alright so now like I said what we can
do is just print a list element or a
list item for each one and since this is
variable percent equals item dot what
was a category name alright so hopefully
that autocomplete then it mess anything
up too bad and it ran my incorrect thing
one around been www all right looking
good so again here is the main category
the parent and for each of these
playlists app side and dishes side
dishes whatever whatever whatever loop
through the JSON data and put out each
bit of information correctly so there
you go as easy as that pretty much we
import some JSON data we don't have to
convert it to an object because it's
already an object the only thing we have
to do is set it equal to some variable
that we can use anywhere in our program
and we can just use it accordingly this
is like the easiest thing we have ever
learned and the only problem that we
have right now is that this is actually
a little bit too easy
so since that's the case in the next
tutorial I'll show you guys in
alternative way of working with JSON
data and you guys might prefer it so
thank guys for watching see you next
