hour and a half I finally caught
something this is embarrassing
this right here I don't even know if you
guys can see it a little minnow yep
that's what took me a freaking hour and
a half a cop and whenever I try to grab
these they'll move away so quick they
have like the fastest reflexes ever but
I finally found a cool way to catch them
you dig a little trench and then you
kind of trick them to go into there and
then you can just splash up the water
and they go up on shore so
hmm
tastes sandy and gritty and tastes like
cold fish so uh anyways I thought my
first meal in the wild would be a little
bit better but let me go catch more now
all right so I now know how to catch
minnows what I did is you see this
little indentation right here it's not
much of one but what you do is they're a
bunch of if I quit if I quit stepping in
the water then a bunch of minnows will
be swimming by and what I did is I scare
them all into this little indentation in
sand and once they're in there you just
hold your hands and block them out and
then you splash the water up in the
minnows go up on the shore with it
so anyways um that's how you catch
minnows or that's how I catch minnows
I'm pretty sure there's easier way but
uh that's the best way I know so far
so I 5min oh so far which has to be like
frickin 13 calories but uh I don't know
I really don't feel like fishing for
anymore I'm really thirsty I haven't had
anything to drink in over 24 hours and
I've been walking and I'm starting to
get cottonmouth really bad so I think
what I'm going to try to do is build a
fire on the beach is probably the safest
area and then probably go get some water
in my little pot and try to boil it so
we'll see how that goes
all right fire-making attempt one I
think what I'm gonna do is all right
shave it off in here
and then when I have enough of it I can
go ahead and dump it on a leaf and try
to ignite it I wanted to uh keep it with
the back of the knife but it's not sharp
enough
as soon as I start there's a breeze
oh yeah right there
now let's see if I can get spurt
my name's get one first
are you kidding me
all right I had to rearrange the leaves
I was getting a spark but I couldn't hit
the magnesium let's see how this works
out
still can't hit it
the sparks are going everywhere but
where I need them - there we go there we
go
come on oh come on
any more leaves any more leaves
mm okay not enough leaks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
