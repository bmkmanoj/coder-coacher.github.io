this video I'm going to show you how to
use template literals so you know before
whenever we had some variable and we
wanted to include it in a string what we
would have to do is something like this
so let me just go ahead and log
something out so I'll say console.log
all right so I'm trying to say um like
my favorite person is Bucky because he
smells good so my favorite person is Ari
so then I need like a space and then I
need a name is that right yep all right
so there's no space here so I had to
have another space you know sage because
he smells good
all right now hopefully whenever I run
this Ari everything is looking good well
this is kind of a pain in the butt
because I mean shouldn't there be an
easier way to use variables inside a
string well that's what the developers
of es6 thought too so they gave you one
and it's called template literals so the
first thing that you need to do is
instead of using single quotes or double
quotes anytime you want to use this new
syntax you actually use backticks
now this is to the left of the one on
your keyboard right above the tab if you
have the same keyboard as me so again I
know you guys probably can't see the
difference between a single quote in
these back ticks on YouTube but make
sure that you are indeed using back
ticks so just like before you write my
Eddie I Giada all your other stuff just
like this but whenever you want to use a
bit of JavaScript instead of having Plus
whatever that all you do is this use
dollar sign curly braces and then
whatever variable name you want right
here so isn't this a much more beautiful
syntax I think so
so same outcome but your code is a
little bit cleaner a little bit more
condensed now another thing I want to
point out and I don't even know if I
probably should but say this
so I'm going to say let's a equals five
and let's B equals seven now you can
actually use JavaScript expressions in
here they aren't only limited to um you
know variables like a B and name you can
actually do something like this
my favorite person is a plus B and it
would calculate 212 so in other words it
would find the result of this expression
and then output it into your string now
I say you really don't want to do this
because most of the time you want to
separate out your logic from your
formatting in other words you would want
to make some variable called a result
and set this equal to a plus B and then
just output result right here but for
the demo I'll keep that in there just to
show you guys that any valid JavaScript
you can indeed have in there even though
I wouldn't recommend it so anyways that
is template literals basically a way
that you can include snippets of
JavaScript inside strings all right so
let me start my recording because I
forgot to mention something I actually
stopped the video and that was like aw
crap I forgot to mention something kind
of important so before if you ever tried
to kind of make a string and have across
multiple lines in JavaScript it would be
a real pain in the butt but now all you
have to do is this whenever you write a
new line in your code in JavaScript if I
go ahead and run this little example
it'll actually interpret that as a new
line so instead of just having like plus
and then adding a new line character and
then writing the rest of your code and
trying to concatenate them in some kind
of weird way whenever you write a new
line using template literals it's going
to interpret that is the new line
character so you see that this little
string and this little string we're
indeed on separate lines so there you go
that's what a template literal is then
guys for watching I'll see you guys next
