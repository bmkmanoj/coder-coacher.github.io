FL studio tutorial and in this video I
want to give you guys a really brief
overview of the interface now as you
guys can see there are a crapload of
buttons and you know drop-down menus and
sliders if I go ahead and explain every
single button then this tutorial is
going to be like an hour and a half long
and we're going to have to learn all
that before we even make a simple beat
so instead what I'm going to do is I'm
going to give you guys a really pretty
much a really brief overview the really
important pieces and then whenever we
want to look at you know an advanced
tool or button when the time comes to
learn it I'll talk about it then but for
right now let me go ahead and shut up
and get you know started teaching so you
open your program in one of the first
things you probably notice is that okay
let me go ahead to close this oh sweet
Jesus there's no close button there's no
maximize there's no minimize you're like
what the heck what to be honest I have
no idea why the software company didn't
put them in the top right corner
maybe they save space or something but
they actually put them over here so this
is the close button this is maximized
and this is the minimize so they do have
the buttons they just put it in a really
weird spot for whatever reason probably
save space maybe it just looks cool I
don't know but another thing I want to
point out is that if you notice that
these icons in these weird buttons have
no description next to them you're like
alright how the heck am I supposed to
know what this W plus means am I just
supposed to you know look up every
little icon well actually under the file
edit and channel section you see an
empty gray area now this isn't just you
know a gray rectangle because they
thought it was cool to put there
whenever you hover over a button a brief
description appears for example this is
the master volume now we know that this
slider is for the master pitch in this
w+ is actually for blend recording
overdub so even though we don't know
what a lot of these buttons do yet i
just want to mention that if you ever
are wondering what a certain slider or
button does just hover over it with your
mouse and then a description appears in
this area right here now another thing
that you're going to want to do
eventually is you're going to want to
customize
is your interface so even though when
you're beginning you're probably not
going to want to do this trust me
whenever you start making beat you're
going to want to rearrange your
workspace pretty much depending on what
kind of beat you make or just you know
personal taste so I want to give you
guys a quick overview of how to do that
if you look at any of these panels right
here or toolbars I guess they're more
technically called on the left-hand side
you see a bunch of little dots and also
when you hover over it
check this out your cursor changes to a
little uh normal finger with a square
next to it whenever you click you can go
ahead and drag and drop these toolbars
around in the top section wherever you
want so maybe you want this over here
and you want this CPU panel over in the
top right nice there we go so you can
drag and drop and it's a lot like Adobe
if you ever use you know Photoshop or
anything same thing with those panels
now another thing that you can do is you
can actually take some of these panels
out or any of them I say some of them
but and you can actually drag them and
drop them in the middle and this makes
kind of a floating panel so you can
either rearrange them in the top section
right here or just make them floating
panels again mostly it's personal
preference but also depends maybe if
you're making a specific beat it helps
as well now you're like alright look at
this what I did is I pretty much was
following this dumb tutorial now I got
all my panels all over the place and Wow
my program is ruined well actually any
time you want to reset this workspace to
get it back to default all you need to
do is this view arrange windows default
and when you click that everything goes
back to normal so if you want to play
around with it but you don't want to
mess up your interface again just go
ahead and drag everything around and
then go to view arrange windows default
and everything will pop back to normal
now the last thing I want to mention
before I get to all this crap down here
is that whenever I'm working in these
tutorials and I'm talking about
something that you guys don't see for
example you see where my mouse is this
is called the CPU panel or CPU monitor
whatever you want to call it and if I'm
like alright guys go ahead and look at
your CPU
you're like oh sweet mother Mary I don't
see it anywhere it's invisible well all
you need to do to make it display is go
to view toolbars and these are all of
your toolbars whenever there's a check
next to him it means that it's showing
on the screen so of course we can see
the CPU panel it's displaying if it's
ever hidden for example if you click it
notice that it disappears so if I'm like
alright guys go ahead and look at your
CPU panel all you need to do if you
can't see it one more time is view
toolbars and make sure that it has a
check next to it by default I like to
have every toolbar visible because you
know even if you aren't using it it's
nice to you know have up there anyways
but anyways that's all I have for you
guys in this tutorial in the next video
what I'm going to do is I'm going to be
talking about the rest of the interface
which is the it's pretty much the really
good stuff because this is where you
make your B this is where you put your
song together this down here is where
the magic happens so now that we got
that boring stuff out of the way make
sure to check out the next tutorial and
well make sure to subscribe too so thank
you guys for watching and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
