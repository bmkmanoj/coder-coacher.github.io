hostile right there Prosser you said
you'd let me handle this wait Shepherd
I'm not taking any chances with Cerberus
operatives put those weapons down
Shepard is that your ally Cerberus
rebuilt me tally in return they asked me
to investigate these attacks on human
colonies your pardon us for not thinking
you at your work serving us we're well
within our rights to investigate attacks
on a human colony I'd like to know what
the quarians are doing here weapons down
Raza whatever is going on here I don't
think we need another fight
one of our people was here on pilgrimage
his name was Vito we came to find him
isn't that a little strange aquarium
visiting a remote human colony quarians
can choose whether they go on pilgrimage
vitor liked the idea of helping a small
settlement he was always nervous in
crowds she means that he was unstable
combine that with damage to his suit co2
scrubbers and an infection from an
open-air exposure and he's likely
delirious when he saw us landing he hid
in a warehouse on the far side of town
we suspect he also programmed the max to
attack anything that moved be drawers
the only one who can tell us what
happened here we should work together to
find good idea you'll need two teams to
get past the drones anyway now we're
working with service no process you're
working for me if you can't follow
orders go wait on the ship head for the
warehouse through the center of the
colony will circle around the far side
and throw off some of the drones to
clear you a path make sure to keep in
radio contact will do good luck Shepherd
see you on the far side
be careful there's a lot of security
throws a bad
Scott
Shepard rose and his brother rust on the
head I told them to wait but they
wouldn't listen they want to friend me
touristique him away before you get here
