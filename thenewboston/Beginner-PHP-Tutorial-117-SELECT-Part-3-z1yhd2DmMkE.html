first the same if we is if we were to
say ascending but obviously you can see
that this is automatically ascending by
default so now what happens what we know
what happens if we want to select only a
certain food type so let's say we are
producing a list of healthy food let's
just go in and add some more records so
we can get a better idea of what's
happening so healthy food might be pasta
for example so we can say pasta calories
might say 600 we might say this is
healthy so we'll give this a value of H
and down here we can say another
unhealthy food will say ice cream
calories let's just give it say 700 and
we'll say this is unhealthy we'll denote
that with au so let's click go and we'll
just double check that everything is
there now we've automatically put these
values in so when we come back to our
PHP page this will automatically update
so I've refreshed and that's been
updated and you can see that it's still
in descending on we've got ice cream
pasta salad and pizza so now what I want
to do is I want to modify my query to
work with only healthy food so I'm going
to say select food calories from food
where so before this order ID we're
healthy underscore unhealthy which is
our column name remember let's just go
back and have a look at that
we're healthy unhealthy and we need to
say is equal to H so equals H remember
this time using single quotation marks
rather than apostrophes
so now let's refresh our page and you
can see that that's been updated with
just the healthy food and then the same
again with unhealthy we could choose you
and then we could list just the
unhealthy food so you can see that just
by selecting data from our database
we're choosing exactly the data we want
to sell
remember you can also use things like
the and keyword as well and you can
pretty much change this query to however
you need to select your data and how you
need to apply conditions to it now
there's also a function in in PHP that
allows you to return an integer with the
amount of rows that have been returned
so for example if we return no values so
we've got healthy unhealthy equals you I
could say and let's just pick something
out healthy unhealthy equals are you and
calories equal 100 so what we're doing
now in our query is we're selecting
where the food is unhealthy and the
calories are equal to 100 now if you
look in our table let's look at the
unhealthy so we've got unhealthy Pizza
which is a thousand we've got unhealthy
ice-cream which is 700 no record exists
where the value is U for unhealthy and
the calories match 100 so what's going
to happen is when we refresh our page
we've returned nothing so what happens
if we want to display a message to the
user saying nothing's been found so no
results has been have been returned from
this query it's been run here so what we
do in is we use the MySQL num rows
function so if we rerun equals MySQL
query now inside what we can do is say
just above the while loop and then we'll
close that just before that we can say
if MySQL underscore num underscore Rives
we need to reference the query run so
the query that has actually been run
equals equals zero or null
then say something otherwise we can loop
through the data there's no point
I'm just going to increment that or
indent that sorry there's no actual
point in looping in running this while
loop here if the data returned here is
equal to zero so we can put an error
message in here saying no results found
okay and let's make this a larger so I
can understand what's going on so we've
run the query now we're running an if
statement and we're saying if the number
of rows returned from this query are
equal to zero say no results found
otherwise we're looping through the data
that has been found because if it
doesn't equal zero it must we must have
at least one row then we loop through
and got the data so let's just let's
just refresh our page and see what
happens
so you can see no results found now what
happens if we change our query around
let's just go up to our query and I say
ten calories equals 700 now let's go
back to our database we can see that an
unhealthy food with the calorie amount
of 700 is ice cream
so therefore this query will have
returned one row therefore this if
statement will evaluate to false and
we'll run this block here so let's just
test that we should just get ice-cream
displayed on our page and we have so
ice-cream has 700 calories so using
these few simple functions and using a
while loop you can see that we can
select all rows in our database that
have been returned with a specific query
now we don't always need to use this
while loop to return specific
information for example if we know that
we're only going to return one row for
example the example I've already used
with the username and password if if we
say return one row we know we're only
ever going to return one row we can do
this slightly differently and that will
be demonstrated in the next
video in this series so for now that was
selecting data from our database using a
loop and the small but very useful
functions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
