in in this video I want to talk to you
guys about bacon one of the most
important concepts in physics one of the
most delicious concepts in physics do
and you know maybe I'll talk about
potential energy a little bit but mostly
this tutorial is about bacon so let's
start out and talk about potential
energy we already know from the last
video that potential energy is equal to
the weight of an object times the height
or pretty much the distance off the
ground as you saw in the case with Apple
however this is indeed physics so
whenever we're talking about physics we
don't really use weight a lot because
for reasons that I explained we're never
talking about gravity fluctuations in
weight make measuring things really
difficult so that's why scientists
prefer to use mass however there's the
problem that we need to figure out
potential energy of objects often so in
order to do that we need the weight of
an object so what if someone gave us the
mass and the distance or height and they
wanted us to figure out the potential
energy well then what we need to do is
we need to take the mass and use that to
figure out the weight of an object so
since this is such a common problem in
physics I'm going to explain you guys
how to do that so say that we have a
piece of bacon actually this B right
here kind of looks like a piece of bacon
the weights wavy and greasy and
delicious but anyways we have a piece of
bacon and this piece of bacon is would
you say it's four it has mass of four
kilograms so it's probably you know good
sized piece of bacon and it's also eight
meters off the ground we'll say that
it's sitting on a pole and we're trying
to knock it down so we can of course get
it in our mouths so what is the
potential energy of a piece of bacon
that has a mass of four gorilla
kilograms and is eight meters off the
ground well of course this is mass not
weight and we need to convert mass to
weight so how do we do that well first
let's figure out how to calculate the
weight of an object using only its mass
now the weight of an
is equal to the mass of the object times
the force of gravity and that is
actually why you weigh less on the moon
because since gravity is the factor on
earth it's greater than on the moon so
gravity on earth like I said has a force
of 9.8 m/s^2
let me just throw those in the
parentheses so weight equals mass times
gravity aka mass times 9.8 meters per
second squared so the weight of this
bacon on earth four because that's how
much mass it has four kilograms and a
gravity which is always 9.8 meters per
second squared on earth therefore when
we add these two together the weight of
a four kilogram piece of bacon is 32 or
excuse me 39.2 Newtons now remember one
Newton equals one kilogram times meter
per second squared so if you guys were
still confused in the last tutorial how
you can have Newtons and I said that
Newton's in weight were interchangeable
well this is why because weight is
actually a force how strong is gravity
pulling you towards the center of the
earth so that is why force Newtons and
weight you can both use Newton's 4 but
anyways that's you know what not where
we're talking about in this tutorial so
now we have the weight of the bacon 39.2
we can now figure out the potential
energy when this bacon falls down from
that pole how much energy is it kind of
reduce so the potential energy when it's
sitting on top of the Bohr pole is of
course equal to weight times height so
the potential energy equals the weight
which is thirty nine point two and four
I'm just going to leave out my units for
right now and for what was the height 8
meters right there so I'll put eight so
if we multiply these two numbers 39.2
times a we figure out that when abating
a piece of bacon is sitting up on a pole
eight meters high
and the bacon has a mass of four
kilograms then it has a potential energy
of three hundred and thirteen point six
joules so there you go that is how much
energy is stored in that bacon and
whenever you bite into it it's going to
be delicious that's the key of this
tutorial that bacon is delicious and all
of this potential energy weight stuff
that's really not important but anyways
thank you guys for watching and I'm
going to go for apps and bacon now so I
guess I'll see you guys in the next
