we combine like terms and when I say
combining like terms what I mean is
we're going to collect each term which
is each one of these things right here
so that the similar ones we add and
subtract to each other so for this first
one I have 8x plus 5y minus 17 X well
since each one of these has an X in it I
can add this one and this one together
so 8x minus 17 X is negative 9 X plus 5y
well since Y this one has X and this one
has Y we can't combine those because
they're not like terms so this is all we
can do with this particular one we're
going to do the same thing with this one
this has an X this has an X this is just
a constant so we're going to combine
these 7x - night or excuse me 7 X plus
negative 11 gives me negative 4x and
then minus 8 so sometimes when you start
combining like terms you might want to
circle it so you see which one's you add
together especially when you have more
than one term so we have 3 a negative 9
a 2 a 5c and negative C so now we're
going to add these together 3 a minus 9
a gives me negative 6
a plus 2 a gives me negative 4a plus 5 C
minus C gives me 4 C
okay now this one is a little bit more
difficult than any of the ones we've
done before because we have terms that
have a squared in them so first we're
going to look for all the similar terms
so this is three X Y this is four X Y
and this one has x squared Y and Y and X
Y squared
well these this one is not similar to
the other three because this one has x
squared Y this one's just X Y XY XY
squared and this one is not similar for
the exact same reason so we're going to
add these two together we're going at 7
X Y and then we just have to recopy this
second part because we don't have any
terms similar to those okay now this one
is a little more tricky so I'm going to
just going to circle all the like ones
in the same color so this is 5y squared
X this is x squared Y this is oh look
this is another y squared X here and
that's all we have for y squared X's
okay look this one is negative 2x
squared Y and this is negative x squared
Y and then we have 2 XY + 3 X Y so now
we're going to add these all each term
together so we're going to add these two
those two and those two so 5y squared X
plus 8y squared X gives me 13 Y squared
X negative 2 x squared y minus x squared
Y gives me negative 3x squared y
and 2xy plus 3xy gives me positive 5x y
now this one's a lot simpler each one of
these terms has an A in it so we're just
going to add them together 11 plus 30 a
gives you 41 a minus 18 gives us 23 a so
that's how we're doing with combining
like terms but make sure you come back
and we're going to talk about solving
equations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
