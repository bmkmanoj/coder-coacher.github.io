in this video I'm going to talk to you
guys about handling the form and
checking if the user made any errors but
before I do I just want to mention one
little quick thing and that is i went
ahead and i created the footer are ready
now eventually when we make our website
the footer is going to be things like
terms of use and frequently asked
questions and i don't know maybe website
information and probably a link to all
the developers names but right now just
you know have something in there i added
three links and of course the code for
the footer is I included that right
under the form and I also made this
little a footer coder right here in the
HTML codes that PHP file so I know I
didn't you know take you guys through
this and that is because this isn't the
footer that we're actually going to use
I just wanted to make something real
quick but in case you guys were looking
you're like what the heck is this you
know I thought I ought to mention it so
now that we have the form created what
we need to do now is we actually need to
handle it now by handling a form let's
think for a second what we need to do
with that information what we need to do
is the very first thing we need to do is
check for errors make sure that they
entered a valid username instead of a
bunch of dollar signs make sure they
entered a valid email instead of just
the number you know 69 or something
stupid we need to validate that they
enter the correct information and then
once we confirm that they did what we're
going to do is we're going to test to
make sure no other users has that
username or no other user has signed up
with that email if they did then we say
hey dude someone already has this
username or someone already has the
email but if they didn't in the username
is still available then we go ahead and
register them for the website simple
enough good so in order to go ahead and
handle the form information we just go
ahead and make it if statement now what
I want to do is I want to check
basically did they submit the form so in
order to do that go ahead and type is
set and this is basically how you do it
post
submit now you have to spell submit
right it's key and what this is going to
do is basically see if they hit the
submit button and if they did what do we
want to happen well the very first thing
we want to do is we want to create an
array called air and this is how you
create wow I'm like don't have like
sausage fingers or something tonight I'm
in every run button possible on my
keyboard so basically we're creating an
empty array called Aires now what this
array is going to be responsible for is
storing all of the airs now at the end
of our script what's going to happen is
any error message that we store in here
for example um user name is already
taken or your email address is invalid
we're just going to output to them so
hopefully if things go smoothly this
array is still going to be empty at the
end which means that they didn't make
any mistakes but just in case that's
where we're going to storm now i'm going
to go ahead and pretty much right
username email and password because just
for validating purposes is going to be
easy to see with the comment so I'm
going to validate each of these inputs
one by one so the very first thing we
need to do is we need to test if the
user name is empty so go ahead and
there's a built-in function called empty
where we can pass it in a variable now
since our form used posts we can just go
ahead and steal that and the first one
was username so if username is empty
then what we want to do is of course
this would generate an error you can't
have nothing for our username so in
order to add something to that array go
ahead and type the name of the array
which is air and set it equal to please
enter a username so that of course would
generate an error message now the next
thing we want to test for is else if
else if what we're going to check for is
we want to make sure that the user name
they entered if it isn't empty we want
to make sure it only consists of letters
and numbers now um the good thing is
there is already a built-in function and
CSS c-type underscore out num and what
this function does is you basically pass
it in a variable this baby right here
and if this variable which would be
their username only consists of letters
which would be alpha and numbers which
would be numb then it's going to go
ahead and return true so if their
username only consists of letters and
numbers then let's go ahead and say
username equal to post username so what
I'm trying to say is this is the bit of
code that I want to happen that's
hopefully the goal if wow I think I just
messed something up else the last thing
we're going to check for is if this
didn't test positive and this stead it
tests positive then we can only have
then that can only mean one thing that
what they did is they didn't have a
blank username they indeed did fill it
out but it wasn't letters and numbers so
what I'm going to do is if this is the
case then we just need to alert them
that hey user name must be letters and
numbers so let's go ahead and do that
right now use your name mas consists of
letters and numbers only pretty cool way
so basically one last time and I want to
repeat this because I'm going to be
running through email and password
rather quickly and I don't want to
stress this again so I'm going to stress
it right now we first test if the user
name is empty if it is then we give them
an error message if it's not then we
want to test if it's only letters
numbers now hopefully that's the case
and we set this user name variable equal
to something but if it's not then we
just go ahead and say
hey dude you must only use letters and
numbers only that's our rule</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
