let's see what Zorro does night I think
it's our ninth physics toriel and in
this story oh now that we know the
importance and how we understand the
need for sigfigs
we can go ahead and start using them in
our scientific notation problems so what
I did is I went and grabbed a couple of
problems from tutorial five in tutorial
six and back then whenever we were
working with scientific notation we
didn't know about significant figures
and by the way I don't know if I
mentioned this but sometimes I call
significant figures sig figs just
because it sounds cool
so anyways now that we know about sig
figs we can go ahead and solve these
problems again and we're gonna solve
them correctly this time so what we need
to do is go ahead and solve these
problems again so six point seven one
times ten to the three times two point
three times ten to the fifth power
equals six point seven one times two
point three times and I might skip a
whole steps here ten to the three plus
five which is eight so basically what we
have is fifteen point four three three
times ten to the eighth so in our last
tutorial or nonetheless disorder
disorder number five I think it was our
final answer was one point five four
three three times ten to the ninth power
now you're saying all right that answer
it looks pretty correct to me but we
need to consider the rules of sig figs
so in order to do that when working with
scientific notation we need to look at
how many digits are in the least
accurate number or coefficient as
they're preferably called the
coefficient is the number that's not the
one with exponent so basically what
we're going to be doing is saying all
right this number has one two three and
this number has one two so remember in
the last tutorial when I was talking
about how our scale
had different accuracies well pretend
that we're measuring these with scales
right here this scale would only go to
the tenths place and I just changed my
color to red and my text is red this
scale only goes to the tenths and this
scales goes to the hundredths so
basically we can only use an answer that
goes to the tenths so basically our
correct answer would be 1.5 and I got
1.5 from rounding 1.5 four times ten to
the ninth and again the reason for that
is because we can't just go ahead and
include these numbers because we don't
know for a fact that this is two point
three zero zero zero so we can't claim
to have more information than you know
we just can't make up information like
that because our equipment wasn't that
accurate whenever we got this data right
there so let me go ahead and give you
guys one more example and I need to
change my color again so actually let me
go ahead and get out my piece of paper
right here from my tutorial make sure
I'm working with the right Prohm so 7.62
yeah that's gonna pop up and by the way
I think whenever I make my youtube
videos they always try to let me see if
I can get it oh it won't even do it now
but they always put the thumbnail as
whatever I'm whenever that box pops up
and it's really annoying because like it
looks like I'm making a mistake on all
my videos which I kind of am but do you
guys know what I'm talking about went
long nevermind again I'm just rambling
off stop doing that so let's go ahead
and solve this bra mouth shut up 7.62
again we're dividing so we have to put
divided by two point one and then we go
ahead and multiply that by ten to the
third divided by ten
to the fifth so let's go ahead and solve
both sides of these equations seven
point six two divided by two point one
equals three point six two nine and we
need to go ahead and multiply that and
I'm just gonna go ahead and skip a step
here three minus five equals negative
two so that's 10 to the negative two so
we go ahead and basically in our sixth
physics tutorial we said that this was
the final answer right there however now
that we know about significant figures
let's go ahead and take a look at this
data up here this one only goes to the
tenth of one place and this one goes to
the hundredth so basically our answer
can only go to the tenth because that's
our least accurate piece of information
right there so what we need to do is we
need to round this answer to the nearest
tenth so three point six times ten to
the negative two is our correct answer
that's what we should have had because
again like I said this data right here
we don't know for certain how accurate
that is we only have the equipment to
measure to the tenth so that's what our
answer should be right here
so now that you know the importance of
significant figures and also basically
saw those examples in real-life examples
saw those examples in real-life examples
what the heck am I talking about
well anyways now that we saw that in
practice we can begin to move on to
something else however there are a
couple different rules that I think I
better tell you guys before you know
jump in math and physics and atoms and
electricity and stuff like that
so definitely check out the next
tutorial and um if you guys have any
questions about sig figs or physics at
all I should probably mention this in
last couple tutorials make sure to check
out my forum at the New Boston comm
slash forum and you can ask me questions
there and I will be happy to answer them
for you guys so anyways thank you guys
for watching and don't forget to
subscribe and I will see you in the next
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
