their PI OpenGL tutorial video what were
anytime about now is how we define the
vertices or nodes of whatever object we
happen to be drawing in pi opengl so I
have lost my mouse over there is okay so
I've got four monitors so sometimes my
mouse just goes missing anyway so
vertices vertices vertices is gonna
equal a big ol list of all of our nodes
and it's important that the vertices are
in proper order I'll show you later on
down the road why that is important um
but if you go back when we go back
you'll see that like these have to be in
perfect order because what pi OpenGL is
gonna do is it's gonna draw like each
one it's gonna connect the dots and it's
kind of like drawing the polygons in PI
game or we drew the polygon and we might
think oh we drew a Pentagon but nobody
did not we drew I don't know some
crisscross thing so keep that in mind so
for now we'll just leave this like this
but think of it like you got your X Y or
Y and your Z so you have to like
visualize it in your head and be like
okay well how might we do it so like
here's our cube from before let's go
ahead and delete this it's gonna drive
me nuts
oh my gosh I can't even delete it
where's my razor and then we got a line
here so consider that you have you've
got an axes that looks like this you
know
and in the new z-axis and so you have to
kind of think to yourself and we're
going to be talking about in units so
you have to think to yourself like okay
well this would be you know basically at
the front so we would call this a1 let's
say so this would be one and then in
relation to the rest it would be kind of
like a one negative one negative one and
so on it's just depending covet in your
head as just in relation to the other
one so just draw one node and then do
the math for the rest of the nodes so
well that's
this and so our first node so this will
be a tuple of tuples so we'll put the
first one here and in fact hitch let's
put it right here so we've got two pole
and because it's a queue
how many closed out of it already how
many vertices might we have good answer
group eight let's go ahead and highlight
this so copy two three four five six
seven eight it's like dora the explorer'
right I talked to you guys even though I
can't give you so now we specify the
coordinates but we're gonna treat this
like like uh like units so just just
think of it as like a unit but I guess
you could think of it as like ones and
coordinates do so anyways this will be
one negative one negative one the next
one will be one one negative one the
next one will be negative 1 1 negative 1
the next one will just be all negative 1
so negative 1 negative 1 right so what
are we modified there we've moved our Y
here what did we modify what we moved
our our Y as well so just keep that in
mind try to visualize where these
coordinates would be negative 1 negative
1 negative 1 then we've got 1 negative 1
1 then 1 1 1 then negative 1 negative 1
1 and then finally you've got negative 1
1 and 1 so these are all of the vertices
and again they have to be in order and
I'll show you why later on then after
vertices you've got the edges and so
here again edges slut can be slightly
more confusing so I would just suggest
that you simply follow
probably here and then we'll come back
to that but again let's let's open up
good old paint here I really should've
just left this open since we're drawing
a bunch of Q's I'll try to be fast paint
should just have like a cube option
that'd be kind of cool happened yeah or
yeah yeah they really should have like a
cube option of their as well as
specified cube and then size and be done
with it okay so how many edges do we
actually have here right we've got a one
edge to edge three edge four edge
five-inch six seven eight nine ten
eleven twelve edges okay so we're gonna
need twelve edges to this square or this
cube rather otherwise really in trouble
so let's create the edges so zero one
it's gonna be kind of long list though
that's okay comma so that was one this
is two three four five six seven eight
nine ten eleven and twelve zero one zero
three zero two four then you've got two
two one then you would have two two
three then you'd up to two seven then
you'd have six two three then you'd have
six two four and then finally six to
seven they need to have 5 to 1 5 2 4 and
5 to 7 and what these are is basically
your edges between nodes or vertices so
these you could sort of get away with on
ordering them but generally you would do
the smallest to the smallest to the
largest right and then the next one up
and the next one up just to make it
understandable to anybody who might be
reading this so those are your edges so
now we've got our our nodes and our
edges and for the most part once you
have that down that's the most like
seriously taxing mental work you'll have
to do as far as visualizing how your
cube should be oriented and then drawing
the lines to all the from like all the
points are all the nodes
once you've done that then you just need
to know how to code the OpenGL code and
you'll have yourself a lovely cube or
whatever the heck you happen to want to
draw so anyways
stay tuned the next video will actually
start writing the code that is required
to make this come out so stay tuned for
that and thanks watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
