Photoshop cs6 tutorial my name is buddy
Blandford today we're gonna go over
using the quick mask mode and you can
find the quick mask mode button over
here on the left underneath your colors
that you're picking from your foreground
and background color so it's this little
button here with the square with a
dotted circle in between now what a
quick mask is is it it's a mode that
gives you the ability to create a
selection using painting and drawing
tools and you can do it without creating
a channel mask so let's get in into it
and I'll show you how it works so go
ahead and load up any picture and let me
zoom in a little bit on here for you
there we go
that's good enough and we're going to
click on the Edit in quick mask mode
button you can see that the hotkey is Q
so click on that and then you can see
that the colors change from to black and
white here now black is going to paint
in the mask and white is going to erase
the mask so go ahead and select your
brush tool because remember that you're
going to be using painting and drawing
tools to create these new masks and I'll
make this a little smaller but once I
start painting on here you can see it
comes in as red and just go ahead and
paint out something doesn't matter what
it is and the area that you have created
here or the area that haven't read here
that is going to be where you have
masked if you go into your channels
panel you can see that there is a quick
mask that has been made so if you need
to check and see if it's working
correctly just open up the channels and
then open up and then look into the
quick mask section here now if I switch
the colors here over here on the left
and start painting you can see that the
paint are the mask has disappeared from
the areas I painted in the white and if
you look in your quick mask over here on
your
your channels panel you can see that
there is white in the area that I just
painted in and this is basically just
how you erase your quick mask so let's
paint in some black here to give us some
type of a mask looking thing so that's
good enough and then we can click on
this again to go back to standard mode
and you can see that a selection has now
been made and there is no Channel mask
anymore but we do have a selection now
if you really wanted to make this a
channel mask all you have to do is come
back down and convert it into a channel
mask by clicking this button down here
the same selection as channel button and
it'll bring it back up for you as a
channel mask but the pretty much the
whole thing about editing in quick mask
mode is they it's like a one-time
selection and you didn't really want to
have a chat or need a channel mask but
every once in a while you maybe your
client want is like hey I really want a
channel mask with this so I can use it
for something else then you have the
ability to do that easily
so that's all you need to know about
using the quick mask for now and then in
the next tutorial I'll go over the
options you can use using a quick mask
so be sure to check out that tutorial
see you later everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
