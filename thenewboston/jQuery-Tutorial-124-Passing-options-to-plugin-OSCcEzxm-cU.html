if options are available so if the user
has specified options and then we extend
which is essentially just merging two
objects or arrays in this case together
and we want to merge or extend settings
to options so now what we've done is
we've just basically taken values and
then combine them with the pre default
settings that we've created here that's
really all there is to it so when I
whenever I'm creating a jQuery plug-in
and I'm using this notation I always go
ahead and alert out one of my settings
so I know that it's actually working so
we're going to go ahead and alert how to
settings and because of course this is
an array we're gonna alert out color
so inside ext doc jeaious let's just go
ahead and apply this plug-in to the
document so it's a highlight and then
inside let's not specify anything at all
and let's refresh you can see that we've
got null returned here that's obviously
because like I said this is the default
value
I haven't supplied any sort of options
or settings inside of here therefore
null is the correct is the predefined or
default value if it was yellow and I
refreshed we get the value yellow up so
now what we want to do is I'm going to
go ahead and change that back to null
and I'm gonna actually supply some you
know
options to this plug-in so let's go
ahead and type in color which is the
name of my option remember over here my
name the name of my option here and
color is going to be yellow so now that
I've actually supplied it we have this
if option so this equals true we extend
it in and then this takes over this
value so now when i refresh you see we
get yellow if I was to go ahead and
inside of here specify this as a red or
red rather not read and refresh you can
see we've got red so we've now
successfully passed this you know
parameter or this setting to our plugin
so now what we can go ahead and do is
use this CSS and we can set the
background color to settings color
because we've already echoed this
setting out so we know that it works so
we can go ahead and use CSS to set the
background color in this case so let's
go ahead and refresh or let's go ahead
and specify color and change that there
a natural fact note we don't need that
sorry I forgot to actually go ahead and
apply it to something relevant we use
this without leave dollar sign and
whatever else because we've used this
notation here we're not required to
inside of our plugin we're setting the
background color to the setting
specified as we've already talked about
here so in this case it's red let's go
ahead and actually apply this to
something relevant and in this case it's
the strong tags or in this case every
strong tag on the page so now when we
refresh you see that the background is
highlighted with red we can go ahead and
then specify something like yellow for
example and refresh and you can see that
it does exactly the same thing now let's
go ahead and look at what we want to do
if we want to add a second option into
here so essentially what we do is we
might say foreground black or foreground
white for example so what this would do
is we're supplying the first which is
the highlight color and then the
foreground color we can do as well so
let's go ahead and modify our plug-in
I'm gonna go ahead and pull this down
here and I'm gonna comment on to the end
of here and I'm gonna say for ground
null so by default it's nothing let's
just pull that down a little bit more if
options this line we don't need to
change because we're still extending the
options given to our predefined setting
array so we're extending them settings
to our options
we're then saying this dot CSS
background color is settings color but
now we can again say this dot CSS or
this dot CSS
color which is obviously the foreground
color in CSS and we can supply
foreground from our settings so we've
quite easily added in another option
here which is foreground and this won't
take effect just at the moment but if we
go ahead and specify foreground they'll
say red in here you'll see that that's
transferred through to our plug-in using
the foreground option there we merge and
then we use this settings array to
change the color using CSS in jQuery so
in this tutorial we've learnt how we can
obviously create our function which you
should have already known I guess if
you're watching this from the other
videos we predefined our settings in my
case I always choose them as null
however if you wanted the default for
background color to be yellow and the
default foreground to black or hash
known or not you would do that and then
we merge the settings with the options
that are given so we can then use them
use the user settings and we use this
array to access each one so we've
created more or less a pointless plug-in
but it has demonstrated how that we how
we pass options to our plug-in and
actually make use of them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
