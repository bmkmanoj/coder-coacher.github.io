and fortieth Android tutorial for the
new boss in what we're gonna do in this
tutorial 'if inish up our custom
pinpoint class and basically the setup
for the what we have left in this in
this class is going to be pretty simple
and pretty quick so this might be a
short tutorial but let's work with this
overlay item create item and we get
passed in a int int value so what we
want to return is basically the value
and our ArrayList that we set up so we
call that ArrayList called pin points
and what we're going to do is say dot
get and we're basically going to refer
to the index within our ArrayList so
we're gonna say the index and we're
going to call the index I which is again
being passed in so now it's just going
to return the value of whatever position
in our ArrayList at position I or
whatever is being passed in that's the
value of this class and what it's going
to do and basically when we use this
size method all we're gonna do is return
the size of our ArrayList so again it's
going to be simple so pinpoints dot size
and that's gonna be the size of our
ArrayList so that's just going to return
how big our ArrayList is and you know
that's what the size method is gonna be
used for now what we need to do is we
need to add some sort of method that's
gonna you know insert some stuff into
our ArrayList so what I'm gonna do is
create a method called insert pin point
or something like that so you can just
say public void and we're gonna say
insert oops
insert endpoint or something and we want
an overlay item
we're just gonna call this item maybe
something like that
so we get passed in an overlay item and
what we want to do is basically add to
again our our overlay type or overlay
item type ArrayList so again we have our
ArrayList called pin points and we're
just gonna use a method called add
pretty simple right and we're gonna add
the overlay item into our overlay item
list or array so we're just going to
refer to the item that's being passed in
called an item and add it to our
ArrayList we also want to populate so
we're just gonna say this and populate
and all this does is it's a utility
method to perform all the processing on
a new itemized overlay so it's really
just gonna get everything set up for the
most part and we're good to go I mean
we've pretty much set up this whole
class again it has two constructors and
everything is ready to be used so let's
save it and close it for now hopefully
we won't have to come back to this and
change anything but who knows we might
but there we go
we're pretty much done with that custom
pinpoint class and now we can actually
refer to it within our main class or
actually within our touchy overlay class
which is within our main class and we're
gonna do that within the oncreate method
so again we have a remember we have a
constructor for that custom pinpoint
class that takes in a drawable and it
also takes in a context so what we're
gonna do is we're going to scroll up to
our on create method of our main class
and create a drawable drawable item so
what I'm gonna do is just simply create
a drawable that we're going to use for a
whole class so let's define it above and
we're going to say a drawable D and
we're gonna set D which again is our
drawable object and we're just gonna say
equal to get resources
dot get drawable refer to maybe well a
drawable folder if you guys put in and
in a drawable for this again you want to
make sure like if you're doing like a
bull's-eye or something like that
because it's gonna be adjusted or bound
to the center of our drawable object I'm
just gonna use the icon that comes with
the default package for now doesn't
really feel like busting out my you know
Photoshop or whatever and creating some
bullseye that's gonna turn out terribly
so I'm just gonna use it again just the
default icon that comes with a project
when we set it up and now we have a
drawable setup so we're gonna go back
into our button place pen point give us
some space to work with and just as for
this tutorial we don't have a lot of
time but let's create a custom pin point
and we're just gonna say custom
something like that we're going to set
this equal to new custom pin point and
we're gonna pass in that D variable
which is our drawable and also the
context of our main class so we're gonna
say our main dot this which is referring
to the context of remain class and now
we've set up a custom object which we'll
get into more because right now it's not
gonna really do anything so we need to
do some more stuff and we'll finish off
you know this and the next tutorial and
we'll get we're going to be able to draw
to our map so I'll catch you guys then
and have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
