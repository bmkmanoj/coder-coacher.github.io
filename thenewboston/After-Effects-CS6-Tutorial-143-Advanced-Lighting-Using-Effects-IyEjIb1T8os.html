After Effects cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and today
I'm going to go over a couple extra
effects dealing with lighting with you
that can help add a little bit more to
your scene and add to your repertoire of
tools to get things done faster and make
things look a little better so you want
your client wants you to add a little
bit more lighting effects to this logo
into the scene right here so that they
can put it into some put into their
video for their business or something
like that whatever so I'm gonna show you
a couple more lighting effects that will
kind of spice this up a little and I
showed you the CC light burst to help
like show like an intense light effect
now I'm gonna show us a couple more
subtle lighting effects we're gonna use
CC light sweep and the lens flare now
I'm gonna put both of these on an
adjustment layer so that we can affect
everything in the scene so right now all
I have is a picture and then I've got a
couple shapes that I transferred
transform from vectors but they could
also just be vectors too and text so
that's all that there is in this scene
so we can I turn the camera off in the
key light and fill light I'm just using
those for other tutorials that I'm doing
and I just don't want to delete them out
because I need them so what I'm gonna do
is add an adjustment layer and now the
way you do that is go to layer new
adjustment layer and the adjustment
layer affects everything that is below
it so we're gonna keep that up here at
the top the effects we're gonna add I'll
delete these out so we can see where
they are and add them right in the first
one we're gonna add is called
a lens flare and what a lens flare is is
pretty much when you're using a real
camera it's sometimes it creates a an
image
of like circles kind of that are like
faded out based on the Sun the Sun
creates them so I'm gonna go to layer or
effect generate and then lens flare or
you could search for it over here and
the effects and presets I'll do that for
the next one so we've got our lens flare
here and you can see what it has done
added some type of a flare looking thing
here now there's a couple of different
flares that come native to After Effects
and that's under the lens type right
here so this is the 50 to 300 millimeter
zoom one and you can see it's got some
red color in there and this one's kind
of like rainbow ish you got some yellow
we got the 35 millimeter Prime now
that's a little bit different we got the
big green ish blueish lens flare there
and then we got the red circle with the
like the hot spot in the middle and then
we've got the 105 millimeter Prime and I
like this one a lot because it's a lot
less subtle so I think we're gonna use
this one for this scene right for this
copy right here so so that the main
focus will be on the logo instead of
being on the on the tight or on the lens
flare I mean so we've got our flare
Center here which is the same as using
the crosshairs on anything else we can
adjust where we want it to be or we can
grab this little crosshairs here and
just drag it around now the farther you
drag out the farther apart the lens
flare is going to be and the closer you
drag it in the brighter and the closer
the Lunsford flares gonna be so now if
you want to study how lens flares work
just look up on Google and see how
something a scene like this would
interact in real life with a real camera
or you can go out on a day like this if
you're lucky if you get a day like this
and use your camera and see how things
really work like that so this is how
we're going to set it up I put the flare
Center up here by the
where this light is coming out of to
give it like a downward effect because
we're gonna be looking up at the camera
now you can adjust your brightness here
if you would like and as you can see it
kind of like brightens the whole scene
you can go crazy with it
or just make a little subtle and then we
got the blend with original and with a
lens flare you don't really want to
blend with original too much because it
fades away quite fast so something like
maybe like 10 percent or something like
that maybe 20 so there we got the lens
flare going on now as we can see in the
picture here there's a couple light
themes coming out of the sky now your
client wants you to have a nice hard one
coming down through the middle and and
you just he just wants you to make a
beam that way so there's a couple of
ways you could do it by if you watch the
other tutorials you could take a like a
white solid or something like that and
take down the opacity and make a mask
and feather it out to make your own beam
or you could just add the effect CC
light beam so if I come over here and
type in CC light sweep is what I'm at
not like being CC light sweep and bring
that over it gives you a beam actually
and this beam can be moved around like
this with using the light Center and it
will go from left to right across the
edges here and you can see it interacts
with the color here in the scene to make
it which is pretty cool I think it makes
it more realistic looking you can change
the direction it's going like this using
this direction button obviously so let's
get it right here in the middle
and we got changer will change our
direction up so maybe it'll go straight
up and down and this is what we set the
client wants a beam that goes right down
the middle here now it's pretty subtle
and it's going over top of the logo and
because it's over top on the adjustment
layer now there's a couple other things
that we can switch here the shape
there's a couple different ones here
we got sharp which is pretty tightly
packed in and that's basically it's been
packed in and I guess it's a kind of
like a sharp looking one and then we got
smooth which is a little bit more faded
out and thicker and then we've got
linear which is kind of like a sharp and
smooth combined in my opinion so I think
I'm gonna stick with smooth because it
gives us like an aura feel you got your
width here that you can adjust now it
doesn't even look like a light beam
anymore well it added some light into
the scene let's go back to whatever it
was 50 we got our sweep intensity now as
you can see it just increases the
intensity of the light so right now it's
pretty good I think we got the edge
intensity so if I I'm gonna bring this
out so we can see what edge intensity is
just click on my effect bring it over
now if you look at the top up here you
can see that the edge has is pretty
bright going on here
now if we mess with this edge intensity
it's gonna go away
so probably don't want that in this and
this type of scene so we'll leave the
engine intensity down to zero
we got the edge thickness also which let
me turn that edge intensity back up and
then you can see how the thickness works
there
we can obviously change the light color
if we want whoops there goes my effect
just grab the crosshairs and dragon not
just the whole effect we can change our
color now if we really wanted to make it
like the color of the actual light rays
that are coming out just click on your
eyedropper tool and then maybe just
click on the light that's coming out
there and then we've got our light
reception here which is kind of like our
blending mode of the light so there's
the composite which puts it over top and
it doesn't make it affect interact with
the lights in the back so much like the
brights
then we got our cutout here what's kind
of just like cuts it out which is not
too useful sometimes but have you were
putting it on a solid and you just want
it to be cut out that way
and add it over the top you can use cut
out in that effect so there's your two
extra lighting effects that I like to
show you will put this onto composite so
it looks like the other ones and we have
added another beam and then we've added
a little bit more effect with our lens
flare here so this is what it looked
like before and this is what it looks
like now so that's how you can add a
little bit more effect with other
lighting lighting effects
and I'll show you a couple more in the
next tutorial so be sure to stay tuned
for that one thanks for watching this
one and I hope you guys have a good day
see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
