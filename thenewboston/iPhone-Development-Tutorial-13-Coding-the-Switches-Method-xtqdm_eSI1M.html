lucky number 13 and in this story we're
going to be finishing up our coding for
this sweet program we got going on here
so I know enough with an intro let's go
ahead and get right into it so we're
going to be building this switch change
method right now and this is the method
to gets called whenever you click one of
them switches pretty cool huh so let's
go ahead and build this right now
alright so let me give myself some space
in the body right there and the first
thing we need to do is well let's go
ahead and rename that Center go you I
switch and just name it uh my switch
again guys don't name it a switch
because look at that whenever you click
it it turns pink that means built-in
because that I think it's trying to use
a switch statement so yeah definitely
don't want to do that and now I just
ruined my coat alright so go ahead and
name it my switch or anything but switch
and what you want to do now is set this
equal to UI switch pointer to sender all
right now i have to tell you guys
something well i guess i can tell you in
the next line of code alright the next
thing we need to do is make a bulleen
and just name it like get YN for yes no
or something and now go ahead my switch
and go ahead and put is on now let me
tell you guys about this little a little
tip whenever you hold down option and
double click any method it gives you
this nice little pop up and you can do
this for any method and what this is on
method is built and method that returns
a boolean either yes or no this yn
variable is going to return yes if the
switch is on and it's going to return
know if the switch is off so this is a
built-in method attribute to any switch
you have on your program so now why is
that informative Bucky why did you just
tell me that whoa remember whenever well
let's go ahead and finish this coating
vente left switch set on
y/n so again let me go ahead and finish
getting way too excited here so animated
and yes so now let's go ahead and copy
this for a right switch right there we
go sit on yes or no and amended yes
alright a couple things I need to talk
with you guys about so here's what's
happened in here all we did is we rename
the center to my switch so we don't have
to use this every time it's a lot easier
to see right here we're seeing all right
is your switch on or off if it's on I'm
going to store this boom lean-to yes if
it's off I'm going to set this equal to
no so then it takes that bulleen takes
those settings and either changes both
the switches to yes or no and pretty
much turns them on or off so uh yeah I
mean that way we can use this one method
to handle both of the switches no matter
what the center is the other switch gets
changed along with it so again if you
think you're done coding not yet go
ahead and you need to release all your
objects left switch release right switch
release and of course that button we
retained not button pressed the one
really said it's a method button release
in guys if you're wondering about this
method I didn't forget about a button
press we're going to be a handling that
in the next couple tutorials but anyways
we got stuff doing this tutorial so you
know and I don't know how much time I
have so you know I might be running out
of time here so go ahead and quit this
iphone similar and go ahead and build
and build this and see if we got any
errors fail to so let's go ahead and
debug this right now and what we did is
we forgot a semicolon so yeah didn't I
do that in like the last story so let's
go ahead and why did I say I got two
errors so go ahead and build this and I
probably got another one nope succeeded
alright so we are good to go with this
tutorial and uh yeah
you know what I thought we were going to
hop in interface builder right now but I
don't know how much time I have on my
tutorial because of you know this
version of camtasia it doesn't tell you
how long one the feature that people at
Camtasia you should definitely add that
so yeah I'm going to save the interface
builder for the next tutorial and uh
well it's going to be awesome that's all
I can tell you guys so thank you for
watching I don't forget to subscribe in
hopefully I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
