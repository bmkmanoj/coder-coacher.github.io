lesson and in this lesson obviously what
we need to do is we need to add some
code to make these buttons work because
this game right now they click the
button nothing happens
not a very fun game so let's go ahead
and hop over into update and this is
where we add all the functionality
whenever we want something to update in
the game in this case we want to go to
either a different state the place state
or we want to exit the game so obviously
whenever they go click one of those
buttons they click it with the mouse so
the first thing we need to do is we need
to steal some information from the mouse
to see where they're clicking basically
we're going to grab the X&amp;amp;Y position and
determine are you clicking on the Play
Now button or are you clicking on the
exit game button or are you just
clicking randomly in the black area so
again let me make sure my cursor is in
the right place int cost X is going to
be the x position of the mouse and in
order to do that it's just Mouse get X
same thing with Y and position Y is
going to store the Y location or Y
coordinates of the mouse mouse gets Y
there you go so we now have the mouse x
and y coordinates stored in two
variables plus X and pause why so now we
can say ok if your mouse is inside the
Play Now button then go to the play
state over here so let me code that if
statement right now and my button size
is I already figured out all these sizes
but typically whenever you make your own
custom button then you need to just go
ahead and think of the math or make sure
that you have the size of the button
length and width and it makes it a whole
lot easier
so I already figured all this out so you
know I'm not going to take guys through
that but if position X actually we need
two cases in here one for the x
coordinates and one for the Y
coordinates and let me separate this
like that I might be a little bit easier
okay
if position X is greater than 100
because that's where we started at 100
and position X is less than 3 11 and
that's why I said it's so important to
UM figure out the length and width of
your button image because it makes this
a whole lot easier I know that the
length of this is 211 pixels so it makes
the math really easy okay so that takes
care of X now for the y if position Y is
greater than 209 and I'm sure position Y
is less than 260 then what you want to
do is basically I guess I might as well
say this basically what we're doing is
we're checking say okay are the
coordinates of your mouse inside this
play now button this is only going to be
true if the cursor is inside it's going
to be false if it's anywhere outside so
what what do we want to check for if the
mouse is inside the coordinates
basically hovering over the mouse or
excuse me play now button well the first
thing we want to do is we only want to
go to the play now state if they click
down the mouse if they click that button
so therefore we need a separate if
statement if Mouse is button down now
for here you type the ID number of the
button in the left button is 0 remember
the right button is 1 and inside here
now this pretty much means if you click
down inside the button what do you want
to do well all we want to do is we want
to take them to the play state so they
can play the game so SVG enter state
what state do you want to enter well we
want to enter the play state which has
the ID of 1 so now whenever they click
the play button right here it should
take them to the play state and there's
a frigging dot can you guys hear that
Wow right in the middle my freaking
video so go ahead and click this awesome
it takes us to the place state but we
still got one problem and that is the
exit game button still won't work
in these friggin dogs I swear I'm about
to get my friggin potato gun and shoot
them right in the frickin tail
okay I'm not really going to do that
guys but basically let me just go ahead
and copy this because it's basically the
same code and let me add a little
comment so this is the Play Now button
and this is the exit button so obviously
obviously the first thing we need to do
is we need to change these coordinates
right here so for this one remember it
starts at 100 still it's the same
distance over so 102 311 the only thing
that really changes is the Y coordinates
so the Y coordinates for this one is 109
and 160 and if this confuses you guys
remember whenever you're getting Mouse
information remember that the Y
coordinates get bigger as you go up it's
kind of a you know counterintuitive if
you ever work with graphics before but
now basically the same button we only
want to run this code if they're
clicking down so what do we want to do
if they're clicking down well we want to
exit the game so the first thing we need
to do is check for the mouse is button
down basically did they left click over
the exit Now button if they did system
exit and whenever you exit with the
status of zero it means that you know it
didn't crash it exited properly so now
hopefully our exit button should work so
cross your fingers and we'll see first
thing notice that if I click anywhere
outside the button like I am right now
can you hear me clicking nothing is
happening we already determined that
play now button works and whenever I
click the exit game the program as it
exits successfully just like we planned
so that's basically it for the main menu
now we can go ahead and hop over to the
play area because right now whenever
they say okay welcome to bucket land I
want to play this game nothing so you
know I think it would be a good idea to
change that so in the next tutorial
we're going to be working on the play
area or basically the cool stuff the
game itself so I thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and I'll
see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
