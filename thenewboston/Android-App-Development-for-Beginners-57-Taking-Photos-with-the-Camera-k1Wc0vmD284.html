called has camera but for right now I'm
just going to call has camera and it's
just going to be a boolean so it's
either going to return true if they have
our camera or false
if they don't and we actually don't even
need these and that's why it's giving me
this error because I didn't create it
yet but I will in just a sec and to
disabled that button what I can do is I
can call Bucky's button set enabled
equal to false now it's true by default
so that's why you don't have to turn it
on or anything like that so now let's go
ahead and make that has camera method
right here so again all this is going to
do it is check if the user has a camera
and remember it's just going to return
true or far false true or false true or
false
up up up a mummy may be much many M&amp;amp;Ms
okay got my tongue exercises taken care
of so again it's not going to take any
parameters don't need any extra
information but actually limbing now I
don't need to write a comment it's only
one line of code so all this is going to
do is it's going to return this.get
package manager I'll explain this in a
second has just the feature and in here
I'm going to write package manager
feature camera Annie there you are
alright so again this package manager
and all of this right here is pretty
much saying okay if your device on your
device we're going to check if it has a
feature what feature do you want to
check for we just want to check for any
camera now there are different types of
cameras that you can check for you can
check for only a front-facing one only a
back facing one but this is going to say
okay as long as the user has any camera
on their device then we're going to
return true and as long as you return
true that buttons still going to be
enabled if they don't have any camera on
their device then it's going to disable
the button so that's all that does right
there now another thing I want to do is
remember
whenever we click this button it calls
where's the button on click it calls a
method called launched camera so now we
need to build that method right here and
this is going to be responsible for
launching the camera all right so public
void launch camera now inside here we
need to pass through our views and
myself so a little bit more space to
work all right
so in order to launch the camera what
you need to do is you need to make a
camera launching intent and we can just
name it intent and set it equal to new
intent and this means we intend to do
something and to launch the camera it's
meatiest or dot action image capture so
this is the intent to actually capture
an image in other words launch your
camera so after we take an image what we
want to do is want to take a picture and
pass results and by results I mean the
image information itself on whatever you
took an image of we're going to pass the
results along to something called on
activity results and I'll talk to you
guys through that in a second all right
might as well just finish typing this
all right so again this is what we
intend to do take a picture and this
right here it pretty much kicks off that
intent so as soon as you start this
activity it's going to launch your
camera now the reason we said
startactivityforresult is because we
want some information back after this is
done happening what information do we
want back well just information about
the image that we took so then we can do
something like save it print it out add
some cool photo filter to it whatever we
want to do but we need essentially that
image so we'll say
um I don't know if you alright so if you
ever want to do something if you ever
want to return same thing I don't know
so just go ahead and hit alt insert and
we're going to override this method and
it is called an activity result I'm
dependent on there we go okay all right
so this tighten this up a little bit so
this on activity result is a method
that's going to be called automatically
after this method right here start
activity for result so
startactivityforresult like I said is we
intend to capture an image after we do
send the results along to on activity
for result so this is pretty much going
to take on the data and we'll just do
whatever we say we want it to do so the
first thing that I want to do is I want
to just make sure that we indeed did
take an image and also that we didn't
have any errors or anything like that
and we can check those with these two
variables right here and just a real
quick if statement so you can say if
requestcode
is equal to request image capture and
result code is equal to results okay so
again like I just said this R is request
code pretty much ensures that you took
an image and result code if it's result
okay it means that you didn't have any
errors or anything like that so if
that's true then that means that you did
take an image so now let's go ahead and
get the data from it so get the fro
for photo all right so if you go to
bundle extras and set this equal to data
which is this that got passed in and
that's the data of the photo now if you
just call get extras then what you can
do from here is
bits map in I'm just going to name the
photo itself photo or you can name it
pic or anything like that well what this
is what the heck did I just press all
right okay this is taking me off so
bitmap extras that get data so again
this is essentially returning the photo
information and we're converting it to a
bitmap and we're just storing it in the
variable photo so now this photo is
essentially a photo that you can use to
stick right in here and in order to do
that you just get your image view which
is that area that can display photo
bitmap right here since we have a bitmap
we want to set image bitmap to photo all
right so this let me make sure
everything looks good all right that
looks pretty good right there now
obviously if I run this in the emulator
it's not going to work because the
emulator is on my computer and it
doesn't have a camera so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to test this on my
device and I'll post some screenshots of
it so you guys can see what's going on
let me do this let me take a screenshot
of the screen I'm looking at right now
you guys could probably hear me take a
screenshot so that's what I'm looking at
right now now I'm going to tap the take
photo button and after I tap it this
pops up so you guys are going to see a
picture of my computer let me take
another screenshot all right so that's
what I'm looking at right now and now
let me actually take the photo alright
so I just took a photo of my computer
and I'm going to hit save and if after I
do that this is the final app and you
guys well you guys can't see it but um
alright nevermind I'm like trying to
talk to myself here alright so hopefully
if you coded everything the same as me
then your should work too if you have
any other bugs or issues or anything
then you can go to my forum just copy
the source code and well if you have
questions you can ask them there as well
so thank you guys for watching don't
forget subscribe and I'll see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
