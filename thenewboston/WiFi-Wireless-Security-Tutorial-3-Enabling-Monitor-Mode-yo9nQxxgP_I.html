can learn about sniffing and figure out
how to put our card in monitor mode so
sniffing is basically looking at other
people's traffic or spying on so that's
all it is just spying on it looking at
their traffic and the problem that we
have whenever you try to do this is
actually the way that our cards are set
up by default so just to review what I
talked about in the first video whenever
you first open your laptop and your card
is just working like normal you know
you're just at some coffee shop getting
online your card is in something called
managed mode and if you type IW config
you can see that both of my cards the
one that is built in and the one even
the cool one that I bought of Amazon
it's in managed mode so what this means
is any data that's coming in my card if
that data is not meant for me then I'm
going to ignore it now 99% of time
that's awesome because I really don't
care about anyone's traffic I don't care
what all these other people are looking
at all their selfies I don't want it to
clutter up my computer I'm just worried
about my own traffic however in these
tutorials this is probably the only
exception we actually do care about
their traffic so instead of ignoring it
we need to tell our wireless card hey um
actually keep that listen to it and uh
let's uh let's scope it out see what's
going on there so what we need to do
like I said is switch these over to a
monitor mode so how do we do that
well we actually use a tool called let
me clear this out we use a tool called
airmon-ng so a lot of these tools
they're air something ng so this is
monitor and what it allows you to do is
enable and disable monitor mode for a
wireless card so we're going to be using
that tool but before even get started
just make sure first that your arm
interface card is up whatever one you
want to switch so I have config I'm
going to be using W LAN one and I'm just
going to make sure that's up so now it's
up and running and good to go
so after this before you try to swap it
over we should probably make sure
that airmon-ng can just detect our card
so if you just write Ehrmann - ng and
hit enter as long as your card pops up
then it says okay I'm aware that this
card exists I can identify it and now
you know we can tweak it however we want
so we're about to switch it over but
here's the thing and here's a problem
that you guys may have a lot of people
they switch over the card and it's fine
and then after a while it turns back
into managed normal mode and they're
like what the heck I didn't press
anything what's going on and that's
because there are a lot of other
services or processes running on your
computer and they're always monitoring
your hardware your network settings so
they're going to look and say oh you
know what this card's in monitor mode
spy mode it shouldn't be we're going to
swap it back now you know like I said
it's good to have these processes
monitoring make sure you can connect all
that stuff but in this case we actually
don't want them so what we need to do is
if we go airmon-ng check we can check
for the processes that may cause us some
trouble and it says okay you got these
things it may interfere with you know
what we're trying to do so
run this command again and if you write
Ehrmann - ng check kill so harsh kill
wow so it kills off these processes so
now they are done with over with and
they're not going to swap our monitor
mode back into managed mode and we can
continue with whatever we're trying to
do so now we actually have to swap it
over them on our mode so airmon-ng and
all we do is we are start at two spaces
there W LAN one so whatever card you're
trying to put in monitor mode airmon-ng
start and then the name of that card now
hit enter and look at that it says
monitor mode enabled for W LAN one on W
LAN one Mon so pretty much took that
card and swapped it over so every iw
config
you can see okay this is my old one
management into anything of that but now
we have this new one wln one mon that is
in monitor mode now take note that WLAN
one it doesn't exist anymore because
they pretty much converted it in to
monitor mode so it has a new name now so
reference it WLAN one from here on out
and yeah there you go so we can now look
at other people's traffic using this
card pretty awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
