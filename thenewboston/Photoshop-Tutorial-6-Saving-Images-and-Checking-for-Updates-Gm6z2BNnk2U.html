sixth Photoshop tutorial and in this
lesson it's going to be awesome I got a
ton of stuff to cover I'm going to be
Jam packing your guy's brains full of
valuable information and well let's go
ahead and get started
so the first thing I want to talk about
is saving your image or saving your
document now of course you guys probably
already know how to save it file um for
the first time you want to do save as
and once you have it saved you can just
press save but to save a Photoshop file
what you want to do is you want to first
of all navigate to where you want to
save it and you want to make sure the
format is PSD now this is a Photoshop
format specific to this program and the
reason that you always want to save a
Photoshop specific file
is because it includes all the
information like different layers
um different channels paths and you guys
will understand what all this means
whenever we talk about but this is the
best format whenever you're working in
Photoshop now we'll go ahead and save
one called apples or what's this so guys
face
save it is a Photoshop so now we have a
Photoshop file that we can edit all the
layers um you know do all the cool
things that are built in Photoshop
however whenever you're ready to post
the image to Facebook or a website or to
print it out well it doesn't really
matter if you print it out but to post
it on the web
you can't just post a Photoshop file on
the web Google Chrome and Internet
Explorer and Firefox they're not going
to understand what a Photoshop file is
supposed to look like so in order to do
that you need to export it as a JPEG or
ping or a gif now in order to save this
image as a final JPEG or gif or you know
ping or anything go to file save as and
instead of Photoshop format change this
to something like a ping so then you can
go ahead and save this and it says okay
it usually gives you settings at the end
and just press ok so that ping file is
now something that you can use for you
know your websites your blog Twitter
whatever
you want so aside from that I want to
talk to you guys about two more things
the first thing is how to find updates
and patches in Photoshop now just so I
clear things up I want to tell you guys
that updates and patches aren't the same
thing
this is just you know site information
about an update whenever you hear about
an Adobe updating a product it means
that added new features such as I don't
know maybe another tool or maybe you
have more options in a drop-down list or
something
that's what an update is a patch on the
other hand is a bug fix if there's maybe
a memory leak in the program or it
freezes whenever you click a certain
button that's what a patch is going to
fix so patches are more important but
updates are pretty freaking cool too now
the cool thing is unlike you know Call
of Duty matte packs all of the updates
are 100% free so in order to check for
updates go to help updates and then it's
going to give you this little thing it
says checking for updates and okay so
evidently I have a lot of stuff to
update and I'll do that later because
you know um you know I don't want to
waste your time just showing me
downloading and updating stuff but
whenever you want to update it just go
ahead and click that I'll probably do it
after this tutorial and the cool thing
about it is you click that button and it
downloads all the updates for you and it
installs everything automatically
incredibly easy almost as easy as well I
won't even get in that but uh the last
thing I want to talk to you guys about
is how to deactivate Photoshop now in
case you didn't know Photoshop only
allows you to install its program on two
different computers they say like your
main computer your desktop in your
laptop and that's just so people can't
pirate the software and buy one copy and
give it out to you know 600 friends so
what if you already installed Photoshop
on two computers but then I don't know
one of your computers is starting to
mess up so you bought another one well
do you have to go buy Photoshop again
and install it on that computer no
actually you can deactivate one of these
copies so
you install it on a new computer instead
so in order to I don't know let's say
that this computer I'm working on right
now is starting to mess up and I want to
move this photoshop over to another one
we have to deactivate this one first by
going to help deactivate and once you're
in here it's going to say okay do you
want to deactivate it and then you press
that and that's how you do that so you
know this was a tutorial not really on
let me just do you want to quit yes not
really on you know how to edit images
but it's a really important information
that you need to know if you want to
become an expert Photoshop user so in
the next story we're going to be jumping
back into editing images learning how to
do some cool stuff but for now thanks
