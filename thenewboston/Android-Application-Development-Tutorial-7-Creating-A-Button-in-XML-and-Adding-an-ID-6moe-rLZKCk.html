Android tutorial for the new Boston what
we're going to do this in this tutorial
is basically set up our linear layout
for our first application that we're
going to build it's not going to be too
pretty or too complex but I'll get you
guys familiar with the XML again so what
we're going to do is we're going to
delete this textview the second textview
and basically what this application is
going to be is adding and subtracting to
a number according to which button is
pressed so we're going to add some
buttons and we're going to also change
some other things within this textview
the first thing I want you guys to do is
change or linear layout back to vertical
just because horizontal freaks me out so
there we go
and now what we want is uh there's no
title be from the last tutorial we're
going to change our text to something
like your total is and then zero
something like that and then save it and
we're going to check that out looks
pretty good but that text is pretty
small so let's see what we can do about
that again within our text setup part we
can say Android if you spell it right
and then colon and you can see some of
the methods that we can use there's
quite a few for a textview there's one
called text size so we're going to
select that one and what you can do is
set up like 45 pixels and it's a little
bit bigger so that's cool but the thing
is we don't want to use pixels because
because like I said before different
Android phones have different resolution
for their screen and some have a pretty
high resolution which will make forty
five pixels really small so we're going
to kind of use a ratio by using the
density pixels so this is going to keep
it kind of consents consistent oops I'm
sorry DP for density pixels that's going
to keep it kind of consistent for all
the devices that we're going to be
working with because it's going to be
sized according to the density now as
you can see it's a big text it looks
pretty nice but now what we want to do
is kind of Center this text so we can
say let's see if we have any methods for
that we can do or actually this one
not very self-explanatory less of you
guys do other programming we're going to
say Android layout gravity and again
another nice thing about Eclipse is if
you guys forget what you want to set
this equal to you can just delete that
and hit equal and it'll pull up some
choices for you such as center so we're
going to click Center and then check
that out so centers our layout or
centers are textview and since our
textview wraps the content it's going to
it's basically going to Center a text as
well but let's say our text is fill
parent or a text width I should say I'm
sorry fill parent and let's see how that
looks as you can see it's sent what it's
doing is it's centering basically our
our parameters or our size of our layout
for the textview and since the textview
takes up the whole screen it's not
really centering the text because all
the center method does is Center that
layout or the gravity of the layout so
now what we can do is actually just
Center the text within whatever our text
size is so we can also do a method
called and this is just to show you guys
some more methods you could have just
done the wrap content and the layout
gravity equal the center but you can
also do Android gravity instead of
layout gravity and set that equal to
Center as well and that'll Center our
text within whatever width and height
this that we set for a textview so there
you go just kind of give you guys an
idea of some methods they can use on a
textview the other thing we want for
application is basically to add two
buttons to it so we're going to add a
button well it's actually pretty simple
again thanks to eclipse we can hit the
greater than sign and it gives us a lot
of choices that we can choose from such
as a textview but we're going to look
for one called
a button pretty awesome it's right there
now we need to set up what this button
is going to do so we're just going to
say Android layout width and we're going
to say something like you can also do
250 DP for density pixels
and Android layout height we're going to
have it wrap the content context so
hopefully you guys are kind of getting
familiar with with XML even though it's
brand new to you to a lot of you guys at
least I hope you know what's going on
here
for the most part even though we just
started with this so we're just setting
up some ID or some stuff for the button
and again we're going to set a text for
the button and we're going to say add
one so let's see how that looks and I
don't really like using that type of
method so I'm just going to hit it or
close it like that
so that looks kind of strange not
exactly what we want
because the height I'm sorry without
supposed to be wrap content again this
will just wrap the content of our text
so let's check that out
looks pretty good we might want to
Center it as well so we're just going to
say Android layout gravity equals Center
and also you might want to change the
text size up just to kind of get you
guys familiar with the methods that we
have used so far we're probably going to
change this one to like maybe 20 DP see
how that looks looks pretty good and now
we're going to do is copy this button
and paste it down there again within our
linear layout and all we're going to do
is say subtract one
sorry if I'm going fast I mean hopefully
you guys pick up on this the most part
XML is pretty easy and once you guys
start with it and work with it a little
bit you'd be like why did I ever
struggle with that because it's pretty
simple and it's not too bad but
basically you guys can copy this code
I'll leave the screen right here but the
only other thing we need to do is we
need to have a reference because when we
start working in Java that's where we're
going to let these buttons and this
textview actually do something so we
need to set up a reference so we can
refer to it in Java instead of XML so
what we're going to do is set up a not
something called an ID we're going to
set this equal to within quotations at
plus ID basically saying we're setting
up an ID because when I told you that
means a reference of some sort we're
setting up a reference out so why we
have the plus at plus ID and then we're
going to set this to TV for textview and
we're going to call this one display
because this is the one that's being
displayed or the only textview for the
most part then we're also going to set
up a couple references for each button
so I'm going to just copy this and paste
it within our button and change it to
button for B and then we're going to
call this one B add button add and then
we're going to set up a reference for
the subtract as well this is just
something I like to do so I know it's a
button so B sub for B subtract and there
we go we basically have our linear
layout set up for our first little
application we built and hopefully you
guys kind of understand XML a little bit
better now and I'll catch you guys in
the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
