second video in this video I want to
talk to you guys about collisions
specifically how the conservation of
momentum will predict what's going to
happen after two objects collide into
each other so in physics people love
talking about collisions and probably if
you talk to a high school student and he
says that he wants to go to school for
physics and you say okay what are you
going to do once you graduate he's like
oh I'm going to watch cars crash into
each other I don't know if something
about them they love watching things
crash into each other kind of weird
freaks me out but anyways before we get
started with my example let me go ahead
and define momentum because I want to
pound this in your brain one more time
momentum is defined as mass times
velocity you got it I think I think I
told you guys enough where you probably
remember it right now so now here is the
example say you have two balls ha ha ha
two balls laugh it up guys ball a and
ball B now both balls have the same mass
so pretty much identical except for ball
a is moving through the air maybe you
hit it with a tennis racket or something
I don't know so I guess it will probably
be better to make a little chart before
and after the events now the event is of
course whenever ball a smacks into ball
B now let me go ahead and might as well
finish this chart if I got this far
already now before the event as ball a
is traveling through the air it has a
momentum of let's just say 20 and the
units would be something like kilograms
times meters per second but what you say
it has a momentum of 20 right now now
ball B has a momentum of 0 how do we
know that well ball B isn't moving at
all it's still in one place right now
now of course like I said in the last
video whenever something an object has a
velocity of 0 it doesn't matter what the
mass is because whatever you times by 0
the momentum must be 0 as well so ball a
has momentum of 20 before the crash
and ball B has a momentum of zero now
the moment these two balls collide
what's going to happen is ball B is
going to go flying because it just got
crashed into an ball a is going to stand
still now let me go ahead and should I
explain you guys or okay I'll explain
this first whenever you're playing the
game of pool this is exactly what
happens like whenever you hit the eight
ball
we'll say instead of ball B that this is
the eight ball when you hit the eight
ball with the cue ball
aka a the eight ball starts to move
hopefully it goes into a pocket and the
cue ball stays in the same location
hopefully doesn't go into a pocket so
that's basically what the conservation
of momentum is in this instance as soon
as you hit ball B with ball a ball B is
going to start moving and therefore have
a momentum of twenty kilograms per meter
per second meter open whatever you want
to call it and ball a is going to stay
in the same location not move because it
transferred all of its momentum to ball
B therefore maintaining the law of
momentum or conservation of momentum
saying that the total momentum of the
system must be the exact same before and
after the event so before this event
ball a had all the momentum which is 20
and the total system had a momentum of
20 and after even though that the
momentum shifted from ball B from ball a
it still had the same amount of momentum
all the momentum was conserved so I
think you guys finally understand the
conservation of momentum if not it's not
my fault because I pounded it in your
brain as hard as I could so in the next
tutorial we're going to continue talking
about momentum but we're gonna move to
some more advanced examples so anyways
thank you guys for watching and thank
you guys for watching my videos by the
way I got a Twitter now I'll put a link
below and yeah do I need to plug
anything else my website maybe and you
know follow me on Google+ and send me a
donation of like two thousand dollars if
you wanna anyways I'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
