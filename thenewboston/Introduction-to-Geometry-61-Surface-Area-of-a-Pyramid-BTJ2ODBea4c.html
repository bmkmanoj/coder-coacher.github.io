surface area of a pyramid so a pyramid
is a three-dimensional object with four
triangular faces that and one
rectangular base now for the formula
we're going to use this rectangular base
is always going to be a square so this
is congruent to this side so to find the
surface area of a pyramid you're going
to find the surface area of each face
and add them together so we're going to
write our own little formula right here
surface area equals first we're going to
find the area of the base which is going
to be like times with or because it's a
square side squared plus the area of
this triangle which if they have this
height drawn in for you remember it has
to be to prepare this perpendicular
height which is perpendicular to the
base and I know it's kind of hard to see
because I can't show you a pyramid but
this side when you draw in your height
it's going to be perpendicular to the
base so to find the area of one triangle
we're going to take one half base times
height and since each one of these
triangles is going to be congruent
because the only way this pyramid will
compete completely closed up top is if
each one of them are congruent we're
going to multiply this by four so now
let's do an example so surface area is
what we're trying to find so first we're
going to find the area of the base which
is a
x 8 plus 4 1 half times base times
height and they do our height in until
the zoo is equal to 5 now if you
remember since this is a square that
means that every one of these sides has
to be congruent that's why every one of
these triangles is going to have the
same area because if I try to find the
area for this triangle it's also going
to be one-half base times height every
single triangle is going to have that so
you don't have to worry about not
getting the right area so 8 times 8 is
64 plus one-half times 8 is 4 4 times 5
is 20 20 times 4 is 80 so we get 64 plus
80 so surface area is equal to 144 and
protect us they told that this this was
in inches so we have 144 inches squared
because remember area is always a two
dimensional measurement so we have to
have units that show that we are
two-dimensionally two-dimensionally
measuring it let's do one more example
so we have a square base 6 by 6 and a
height of 10 now what we're going to do
is we're going to find the area of the
square so 6 times 6 plus 4 1 half times
base times height surface area is equal
to 6 times 6 is 36 plus one-half times 6
is 3 times 10 is 30 times 4 is 120 so if
you add these two together you'll get
156 and pretend these were in
centimeters it be 156 centimeters
squared now if you don't have units you
can always write 156 units squared which
just shows that you know that you have
to have a one-dimensional unit even
though they didn't give you any that
just shows that yeah you know what
you're talking about so that's our last
example and that's all we're doing with
surface area today but make sure you
come back and watch the next video
because we're going to go into volume of
a pyramid and that's a little bit
different</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
