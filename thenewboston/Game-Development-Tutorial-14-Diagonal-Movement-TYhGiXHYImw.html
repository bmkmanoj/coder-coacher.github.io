pygame tutorial and in this tutorial I'm
going to show you guys how to move
objects on your screen diagonally so
let's go ahead and the first thing we
need to be a boo boo boo build is
starting points for object so let's give
it a X of zero and also might as well
give it a Y of zero and after that we
need to build our clock object again and
set it equal to clock
tie game time clock with a capital C at
the end and this will allow us to use
the clock next we need to set speeds for
both the y-axis and the x-axis so let's
go ahead and put speed X sounds like a
drug
150 and speed Y which is also speed in
case you didn't know let's set equal to
log 170 or something so this is all the
variables and objects we're going to be
working with so now that we got that
taken care of let's go ahead and build
our well what we need to build so right
under your forward loop go ahead and
first thing we want to do is book back
around the screen so screen blitt
background and of course put a zero zero
so it fits nicely the next thing we want
to do is flip the ball to the screen so
let's go ahead and type screen blit ball
and instead of coordinates such as
numbers we want to give it an x and y
because um this ball is going to be
moving around so we want to give a
dynamic coordinates so the coordinates
will change so after this we can begin
working with our clock
so let's first get that millisecond i
talked about and this will give the
clock tick and this will make um a
millisecond equal to one milah or excuse
me milli equal to one millisecond so
regardless of how fast your loop goes um
milli is going to be equal to one
millisecond on every computer so let's
go ahead and convert that to seconds by
taking the millisecond milli in
line it by a thousand dot to get that
floating-point number I talked about
that last time so now we got one
millisecond stored in that seconds so
let's go ahead and find the distance
moved for coordinate X so put DMX sounds
like a rap group because it is seconds
spell it right
seconds x speed X and what this will do
is take that one millisecond and times
it by however fast is going and that's
how what the distance your ball moves X
direction and DM Y and set it equal to
seconds again
times speed y aka speedy and this will
take um the speed it moves times one
millisecond in the in the distance it
moves in that month second is stored in
distance of Y so now we can go ahead and
after we calculated the distance we can
go ahead and change that variable so X
plus equals DMX and y plus equals to be
my but now the last thing we have to do
is this is going to move our ball across
the screen but once it gets to the edge
of the screen um it's going to keep
going so we want to say all right when
you get to the edge of screen start back
again so we have something nice to look
at so if X and remember this is the
width if it's greater than 640 because
my window is a 640 by 360 what do you
want you to do we want you to reset to
zero or go back and let me scroll down
if Y is greater than 360 so if it goes
off the screen in the Y direction we
want you to reset so we can look at you
again so let me go ahead and run this
hopefully I don't have in here
then looking good and here is our
finished program right here as you see
whenever a ball goes back in either the
x-direction goes back off the screen
this way it starts over here and
whenever it gets to the bottom of the
screen it starts back at the top again
so that is the basics of how you can
change both the X&amp;amp;Y coordinate at the
same time to get diagonal movement and a
couple things you probably want to
remember don't forget that decimal point
right there and also don't forget that
you're using separate variables for x
and y all across your program and as
long as you remember those two things
you should be good to go so that is that
for diagonal movement I hope you guys
learned a little something but not too
much I thank you guys for watching and
don't forget to subscribe and now see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
