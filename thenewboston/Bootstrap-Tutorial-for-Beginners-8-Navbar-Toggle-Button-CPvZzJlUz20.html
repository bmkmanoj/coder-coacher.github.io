video I'm going to show you how to add a
toggle button so your menu doesn't look
horrible on mobile devices so just right
now looking at it on a desktop or a
laptop the menu looks pretty sweet but
if you were to look at this on a phone
this is what it would look like the menu
would take up 1/3 of the entire screen
and let's say that you had you know a
items well then you have to scroll way
down before you see any part of the
webpage so I'm going to show you guys
how to add a button just like this where
you can click it and it can either
collapse or expand your menu so make
this big again hop back in our code and
check it out now I reverted back to I
think it was tutorial number 6 two
tutorials go in other words I took out
all the extra stuff like on the
drop-down menu in the right align like a
pond so this is just a really simple
menu I just wanted to use this as a
starting point but essentially what
we're going to do is we're going to say
okay here are the main menu items again
this is just the logo now we're going to
add functionality to say whenever we
click this button that we're going to be
making in just a second hide this
section right here and whenever we click
it again expand it so we're essentially
just going to be expanding and
collapsing this now in order to do that
we need to change the div slightly the
first thing we need to do is for the
class we need to give it collapse so
it's able to be collapsed in navbar
collapse now another thing we want to do
is this just gives it the functionality
to be expanded and collapsed we want to
give it an ID so we can actually say
okay this button is trying to collapse
this essentially just so we can target
it so main navbar so whenever we click
the button we're going to say collapse
what do you want to collapse main nav
bar and you put your button right inside
the net bar header above
your navbar brand your logo whatever you
want to call it and of course it's a
button and it has four different
attributes that we have to make the
first one is the type and this is just
button yes this button is a button the
second one is the class and this is
navbar toggle now the third one is data
toggle are you popping up nope
data toggle and this is collapse and the
last one is data target so you know that
this button is trying to clap something
and we type this so I don't get confused
all right so okay this button is going
to collapse something what are you
trying to target well we are trying to
target this div right here so hash tag
for the ID and main navbar or whatever
the ID of your div is now inside your
bun we need to say okay what icon or
text you want to go on here so what
people usually do is if I pull this up
you see that these toggle buttons some
people call these the hamburger icons
where they're just like three lines and
these are just um I was kind of like the
universal symbol form but for some
reason bootstrap thought it was would be
funny to um you know not include the
ability to have that icon easily so you
have to make it in kind of a weird way
and I'll show you how so we we have to
make each line individually kind of
weird but you know it's what we got to
do and this is icon bar so this is going
to give us the top bun this is going to
give us the bottom or excuse me the meat
and this is going to give us the bottom
button so this is just the design of the
button this is the overall button in the
functionality and whenever we click it
it's going to target this right there so
now if I run it everything looks normal
by default but whenever we shrink it on
a mobile device look at that we now get
our button so we can click it expand it
click it again and collapse it and now
our menu
to take up the entire screen and just to
show you guys what I was talking about
say that we removed one of these you see
how this button looks normal right now
let me refresh it we only have two lines
on it so I don't know why they just
didn't make an easier way of doing this
but hey you know I'm not making
bootstrap I'm just teaching it so there
you go hopefully you guys understand how
to make navigation bars in toggle
buttons and yeah pretty simple see you
