Android tutorial for the new boss in
what we're gonna do is basically you
know polish up this cube class because
again we worked with 2d previously and
now we have to change everything to 3d
which isn't gonna be difficult and we're
also going to talk about why we winded
our faces counterclockwise and what
purpose that has so cover a few things
in this tutorial it's going to be pretty
quick and pretty simple all we're gonna
do is just kind of double check
everything so we're putting all of our
vertices even though we have you know
more vertices so that's good and we're
also taking all of our floats from our
list x 4 as well so it's not gonna be 24
anymore if you guys put 24 right here
the last time you make you want to
change it so it you know updates and it
locates all that all those bytes of data
that we're gonna be using and it's the
same for our Enda c or index list here
so again we're just x in that by 2 bytes
for short and we're putting all those
values within our buffer and now what we
have to do is we have to double check
everything down here yeah everything
looks pretty good except for this vertex
pointer because again we were working
with 2d before so we just want to change
that to three dimensions we just want to
change that to three dimensions again we
aren't skipping in things or strides
gonna be zero I'm still working with
floats in the same buffer and then also
yeah we're working with triangles so
that's good and we're also inputting the
length of our indices so that's good as
well and you know everything else looks
pretty good so it looks like our cube is
updated and we'll be able to draw this
cube in 3d but let's just quickly talk
about why we winded those surfaces
clockwise because again all the inside
faces of that cube are never going to be
seen unless of our cameras inside the
cube obviously but why would we even try
and render the inside surface of each
triangle when we aren't even going to
look at it so that's what that's what
we're going to use colon for and
basically we're gonna say hey don't even
worry about the backside of
face because we establish what's which
side is the front side by the clockwise
that's why we were so tedious and
setting up our triangles so now what we
can do is we can set up kollene so we're
gonna say GL dot GL enable DL dot GL
enable and we're just gonna refer to the
GL 10 class dot GL underscore Col face
that's just going to allow us to be able
to kind of remove the back of the face
and not worry about that so how we do
that now that we've enabled it is we're
just going to say GL GL coalface and we
have to refer to which face we want to
ignore for the most part so we're just
gonna say GL 10 dot GL back now what
we're going to do is we're going to go
down to the bottom and just disable that
as well so GL GL disabled and again the
GL 10 class dot GL coalface so there we
go that's what cooling does is we can
remove or not worry about one face if
it's never going to be seen and you know
this basic setup there we just had to
enable it and then tell it what face we
wanted to ignore and then disable it so
let's render it check that out see what
what's going on make sure a square looks
good or cube why do I keep saying that
oh man just editing that last video I'm
like I need to go back to like third
grade geometry it goes because Kip's
calling cube squares and triangles cubes
and all that stuff all right it looks
like something's messed up I must have
messed up on one of our triangles but as
you can see for the most part we're
getting some sort of a cube and as you
can see here this we're going in the
next tutorials learning about rotation
and it's gonna be pretty simple pretty
easy but I'll see you guys then and have
a good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
