slash on live gamer for the New Boston
in this tutorial we're gonna start a new
project now what we're gonna be doing in
this new project is creating an FTP
downloader so that we can connect to FTP
servers see what files are on there
download upload delete files whatever
you want so let's go ahead and create a
new project if you don't know what FTP
is then you may want to do a little bit
of research on that
it's File Transfer Protocol and you can
set up an FTP server of your own and it
can host files and people can connect to
it so we'll select a windows forms
application we'll call it FTP downloader
and I'll just add YouTube at the end of
this so we'll go ahead and click OK and
we'll wait for that to load ok so once
that's done loading let's go ahead and
create our form so let's set the text to
FTP downloader and now I need to do is
let's add some labels and some text
boxes so you can see here I've already
created these and we've got a label and
this is label two so let's call it label
server we got label user name and let's
use label password and for each one of
these text boxes we've got text FTP
server which you can see right there txt
FDP and text ftp password now whenever
you're connecting to an FTP server you
need a username and a password so here's
our server this comes I have it set to
default to have this server in there
which is the one that we're going to be
using and there's no use trying to
connect to this yourself because you
cannot connect to a local FTP server
this can only be connected to you if
you're on my network at home if you try
to connect to this site on your computer
it won't work so now we need to do is
let's add some buttons and a
phox to show all the files so underneath
our server text boxes with the username
of the password let's add some buttons
so we've got update server open folder
home directory and download so for
update server what this is gonna do is
it's gonna let us change the values in
these fields now you may be saying well
you can change them anyway well we're
gonna set it to where you cannot change
the values of these fields while you're
browsing through the server and then you
have to click update server to change
the credentials so we can open folders
so if there are folders on our server we
can open those we can go back to the
home directory and we can download a
file ok so now let's add two more
buttons so we have an upload end a
delete so when we use the upload it's
going to upload to the current directory
that we are in so it'll open up a file
browser dialog and it'll let us upload
to that directory
and delete will simply delete a file or
a folder now you may be thinking how it
was I'm how's it going to do this stuff
well we haven't actually added the code
yet and that's what we're gonna be doing
in the upcoming tutorials so let's just
go ahead and add some more controls that
we're going to need to use okay so I'm
going to go ahead and paste these in and
now you guys are gonna have to create
these controls I have already made this
program so it will make it easier for me
to teach you guys because I already know
what's going to happen and how to do
everything
so we had three buttons load files clear
and start checking for new files so load
files will load all the files in the FTP
server clear will clear our list box of
all the files and then start checking
for new files will start running a
background process that will check to
see if new files have been added and
when it does it will notify if new files
are found it will notify us so let's go
ahead
and we'll make everything just look a
little bit neater in here so now let's
go ahead and add the list box that will
show all the files so I'll just go ahead
and paste this in so here is on this box
and it has a label that says name and
it's got a list of SFTP files now you
can set these buttons to whatever you
want but we're gonna be using them with
these names later on we've got button
clear list button check for new files
button start check timer button delete
button upload button download button
home directory button change directory
button update settings and so now let's
just go ahead and let the user know what
directory they're in so we'll add a
label that will show this so I'll go
ahead and add a label here and you can
see it says current directory now if you
don't know what this is a directory is
just pretty much a folder path so the
main directory of your FTP server is
going to be just a forward slash because
you're not inside of any folders so go
ahead and create this a user interface
and make sure you name everything
something easier for you to remember and
then once you've done that go ahead and
move on to the next tutorial where we
will start adding code that will make
this work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
