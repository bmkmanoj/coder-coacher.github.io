31st physics video in this video I want
to talk to you guys about gravity G Rav
ity
now what graph D in case you haven't
heard of it before is that little thing
that keeps you on the ground in the
planets orbiting around the Sun so it's
actually pretty important now Isaac
Newton and my guess is he was a dude
that looked a little bit like this
he came up with the first reasoning of
how gravity works now he made a big long
law and I guess I might as well read it
to you guys so people don't yell me his
law goes something like this
every object in the universe attracts
every other object in the universe with
a force proportional to the object's
masses and inversely proportional to the
square of the distance between their
centers you got that can you remember
that
well I can't either so hopefully or
excuse me thankfully he came up with a
formula to represent the force or
attraction of gravity between two
objects he says that the force or
attraction of gravity is equal to the
mass of object 1 multiplied by the mass
of object 2 and I guess I probably don't
need to do that mass of object 2 all
over the distance from their centers
squared now I want to emphasize centers
because it's very important
say you were trying to find the
attraction or force of gravity between
the Earth and the Sun now typically
whenever you measure the distance
between two things you measure it like
this point A to point B but whenever
you're figuring out gravity that's not
the case what you need to do is you need
to figure out the distance between their
centers so the ruler would go from there
to there if you had a ruler that big so
remember that is how you calculate the
distance from their centers moving on to
the next topic which is this basically
the weird thing Newton's saying is that
gravity exists between any two objects
with a mass so he's pretty much saying
that every object on earth with a mass
is attracted to you are you telling me
that
this meatball sitting in my room right
now it is attracted to me
are you also telling me that my computer
is like sucking into me right now like
me and the earth are you also telling me
more importantly and probably the most
important thing of all that the cute
girl that was always in my science class
and she's like Oh Bucky you're kind of
weird secretly and noticeably she is
attracted to me
thanks to moutains law well even though
she won't admit it then yes she is still
attracted to you according to the law of
physics now the reason that you don't
notice objects and you don't feel their
attraction is because compared to the
universe you are almost nothing at all
you are so you have such a little mass
that there is basically no attraction at
all even though there is m got like a
freaking cat here in my mouth even
though oh there it is that's disgusting
anyways back on track even though there
is indeed a small attraction between you
and every other object it's so
unnoticeable whenever you compare it to
you and the mass of the earth why is
that because of course whenever you're
dealing with gravity mass is a factor
and the bigger things have a stronger
attraction so that is why the mass of
the objects is so important so important
when calculating the force of gravity
but even more important is the distance
between the two objects and let me show
you guys why that's the case
whenever distance is quadrupled for
example say you calculated something in
it had a mass of 1 combined mass
whenever you multiplied it and also a
distance of 1 will keep things simple
well that would mean that the gravity
equals 1 and I know that these are you
know kind of fake numbers but the
gravity will say is equal to 1 well say
we had the same two objects however now
the distance is quadrupled so this is 4
well what we need to do is the formula
for gravity is distance squared so when
distance is quadrupled the force of
gravity would actually be 1
sixteen because four squared is sixteen
so that is how important gravity is or
excuse me distances when calculating
gravity now check this out say that I
weigh a hundred and fifty pounds now I'm
chilling here right here standing on
earth so let's go ahead and figure out
the force of gravity well the center of
the earth from the surface of the earth
will say it's a nice even draw my arrow
4000 miles so right now when I'm
standing on the surface of the earth I
weigh 150 pounds
why that's how hard gravity is pulling
on me now say over here I'll draw
another earth however on this earth I am
twice the distance away from the center
so instead of 4,000 miles I am now 8,000
miles away from the center of the earth
so according to Newton's law instead of
weighing 150 pounds like I did right
here we say that okay my mass is the
same so we can keep that at a constant
one however my distance from the center
has doubled so put that two squared so I
would now have an attraction of 1/4 as
much as the original so when I double my
distance away from the center I better
label this center of the earth I don't
weigh 150 pounds like I did on the
surface I weigh 37 point 5 pounds so
that is basically the formula for
gravity and also that is why the masses
of both the objects as well as the
distance are extremely important so you
know how I said that acceleration due to
gravity is 9.8 meters per second squared
well that's the case near the surface of
the earth however up here when you get
further away from the earth the
acceleration or the force or pull of
gravity on any object is smaller so just
remember that the force or attraction of
gravity on any object is going to
be less and less or in other words
weaker the farther away you get from
that object so hopefully you understand
a little bit more about gravity now and
we're going to be using these formulas
to apply them to not only earthly
objects but objects such as planets
stars all that good stuff so thank you
guys for watching and forget subscribe
now see you guys the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
