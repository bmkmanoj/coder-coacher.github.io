that I'm making for the new Boston and
in this tutorial I'm going to be showing
you how to loop through everything in
your class treating it like a collection
so for this tutorial you're going to
need to have a button selection class
and inside of your collection class just
have a list of some sort and have it
pass something through your constructor
or whatever type your list is and then
just add that to your list so I just
have it be a string and the list is a
bunch of names of people and through the
constructor here it is pass atom so
let's say we wanted to loop through all
these people inside this collection we
couldn't do for each string ass in my
collection because it doesn't know what
we're trying to loop through we have to
tell the c-sharp compiler that we want
to loop through this collection right
here so the first thing that we're going
to want to do is inherit from two
interfaces the first is the ienumerable
interface and the second is the I
enumerator and we have to inherit from
these because we have to provide
implementation for a few methods inside
of both of these so that the for each
statement we'll be able to use those
methods to loop through our collection
successfully so the first thing that we
have to do right here is create a
variable I'm just going to make it an
integer for our the index of our
collection so on the state int position
equals negative one so that'll be the
default value or the position in our
collection and now we're gonna have to
provide an implementation for the move
next method and all of these methods and
properties love to be public so going to
save public who will move next and this
will basically tell the c-sharp compiler
whether or not it's reached the end of
the collection so we're going to say
return
position if it's less than arm the
amount of elements in name so names
count
alright and before we do that we're just
going to have to increase position by
one so that it will move up the position
will move alright and the next one we
have to do is reset and just just a void
and basically we'll reset the position
to zero not negative one so and
basically this will just reset the
position to negative one so public void
reset and we're just going to say
position equals negative one so it just
goes back to the default position then
we are going to say current and current
will basically just return an object at
the current position so object current
and we're just going to the proper year
so it's going to say get returned names
and then at the current position so
position all right there and one last
one we have to do here it's an eye
enumerators so I enumerator get
enumerator and this will basically just
return on the enumerator for this class
so we're just going to say return right
here and we're going to basically cast
this class as an enumerator so this to
refer to the class that we're in alright
so all these methods that we just
provide implementation for you're
probably like while this is stupid why
would ever need to use any of these
methods well all these methods right
here are going to be used by the for
each statement so we actually can loop
through this right here and notice how
we said like names here and name dot
count and stuff like that so this will
tell the c-sharp compiler what
actually were actually trying to loop
through in this for each statement right
here alright so now if we say for each
string in my collection then we're just
gonna have a message box to show that
name so say show s and it should
basically just show a message box of
every person's name in this collection
oops
oh this just has to be public yeah like
I said all the methods have to be public
or else it won't work
alright and yep we get Adam and yep so
usually when you're doing this you're
going to want to have an indexer or
something so you can treat it more like
an array but we already learned how do
you thin DEXA so it shouldn't be a
problem adding that to your class so
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
