Android tutorial for the new boss and
we're actually going to get a program
working hopefully get our last tweet or
whatever we want for the most part so
before we actually set up a read class
let's show you I just want to show you
guys how we can execute this we're
basically going to do is just say new
read and then we're just going to say
dot execute and we can give it a
parameter for example what we're looking
for again we're looking for a text so
we're going to refer to that again just
to show you guys this is what we're
looking for a text or we can do look
through this code and see what else we
might need like the date it was posted
or the time is posted not sure exactly
let's see here we can find it so then we
could also see what time this tweet was
posted if we go over here to like the
create create at so we could throw that
command in as well or whatever command
you guys want to do but for this one
we're just going to get you know the
actual tweet so we're going to say text
then it's going to call this this class
so what we need to do is we need to
create also a JSON object that we're
going to create through this last tweet
method well this JSON object is going to
be something we're going to refer to in
our whole class so just set this up JSON
object called jason and there we go so
now what we're going to do is wall you
know this is running in the background
in the background what we're going to do
is setup basically again our JSON object
so we call the object Jason we're just
going to set this equal to
you know our method that we created
called last tweet then we're just going
to give it again a string name which is
the user name so we're just going to say
my bring back and that's going to create
us a JSON object then all we're going to
do is we're going to surround this with
a trying catch and we're going to return
basically you know the text or whatever
we're looking for so all we're going to
do is going to say return within our try
we're going to say return
you know or JSON dot get string and we
can say like text here but again we're
passing in some information when we call
this run which is our prams so what
we're going to do is we're going to just
say put Rams and then refer to the
position zero and finish off our
statement so now it's going to look for
params at position zero again when we
call their method that would be our text
so that's it's pretty much the same
thing to just put text down there as
well but now it's going to return this
once it returns it's going to call this
method on post execute again giving us
whatever returning and it's named result
so all we're going to do is change your
textview that we set up which was called
HTTP stuff i believe we're just going to
say set text to result again that's
what's being returned from our json
object we're getting the text from you
know our first object so let's run it
make sure it works
oops and we're just going to scroll down
hit HTTP example and then it loads our
last tweet so that's pretty sweet but
again you can do so much with this for
example if we didn't want to look for
the text we wanted to try that
you know the time is created we can copy
this and you know paste it here which
again is our key reference and it's just
called created at and we could run it
you know you can do all sorts of stuff
with this kind of parsing and JSON
objects makes it very easy for us to
read some of the data that you know
Twitter provides or whatever service
that you're working with and then we can
go to HTTP example and now loads the
time when that tweet occurred so there
you go it's kind of a quick overview of
jason and how to parse and all that good
stuff so probably catching the next
tutorial i was going to do a kind of an
overview but for the most part i think
we covered covered most of this stuff so
okay
you guys in the next tutorial we're
we're probably going to do something
else and I'll see you then have a good
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
