Android tutorial for the new Boston and
like I said we're going to get into some
pretty simple stuff now now that you
guys seem kind of the framework of how
Android works with manifest that intense
opening up activities what an activity
is what the lifecycle is so now we're
going to kind of break it down into
simple applications we're going to build
a ton of those simple applications that
you guys can kind of familiarize
yourself with the Android and what it
can do so the first little application
we're going to build is just messing
with some text within a Java class so
what we want to do is we want to set up
a new layout and that's all we're going
to do in this tutorial just define a new
layout so again you right-click on your
layout and go to other and then under
the Android folder click Android XML
file we're going to call this one text
again every time you label the layout a
has to be lowercase
XML make sure it's a layout and finish
what we're going to do is we're going to
set up an edit text this is how we're
going to get some user input and so I'm
just kind of introducing you to some new
stuff within the XML so what we're going
to do is say edit text and then we
define it as always so we're going to
give us some room here to work with and
we're going to say the Android layout
width is equal to your mom which will be
fill parent I'm just kidding just
kidding I fill parent for the width and
Android layout height but you know
that's a good that's a good your mom
joke if you guys ever get schooled in
that game just say your mom is so big
she fills the parent and everyone's
gonna be like oh man that was a sick
burn but there we go we kind of have the
setup for textview or I'm sorry I edit
text and that's kind of what ed attacks
looks like you can put some input in
there some text or whatever and we're
just going to give it an ID because we
want to reference it in Java so Android
ID equals again within quotations at
plus ID forward slash and then et for
texts so we got we can kind of remember
it and we're going to say commands yeah
that's fine
commands and we're also going to just to
show you guys some other stuff that you
can do we're going to say Android
there's a function called hint and then
you just hit equals and we're going to
say like type a command and then end
quotations and as we look at it kind of
has this type of command thing within
there and then when you click or when
you run the application click on it that
hint is going to go away and you can
type so that's pretty cool you can also
add text but if you like we said text
here just like when we use with our
button there will be text in there
called type of command but when they
click on it they're going to have to
delete that text that's in there so
hence just kind of gives them a hint and
then when they start typing it's going
to go away so there we go that's what
hint is and then what we can also do is
something kind of cool Android password
and what this is going to do is there's
two commands true and full or invisible
what is it true and false so we say true
that's going to basically start out
their input so we're just going to go
with that and there we go we have our
edit text for the most part set up what
we also want to do is set up a button
and we're going to say button and then
Android actually we're just going to
drag and drop a button in there and then
edit it then we're also going to drag
and drop a text protects you there we go
command shift format or control shift
format if you guys are in Windows and
let's just check this out we might want
to change the label the button results
and we're going to change the text for a
textview to
and valid to start with and we're going
to say T for text TV results that looks
pretty good maybe maybe we should do for
the width before the text view we were
going to say fill parent as well and
Android gravity to be sinner nothing too
new basically we got introduced to the
text or the edit text for the most part
that's all this tutorial is so far also
going to teach you guys about weight
here in a second so just make sure it
kind of looks the way I want it will
fill the parent for the button as well
there you go that looks pretty good for
the most part actually we're gonna
finish up this in the next tutorial just
cuz the time for the most part but again
just a simple XML layout introduce this
edit text nothing too special yet but
again this is kind of kind of going back
and doing the easy stuff so thanks again
for watching I'll catch you guys in the
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
