put up a picture and basically it'll
have the names of each of the tools and
with the hotkey next to it I'll put it
on right up and then I'll add just talk
about them a little bit and then there
will be tutorials for each of the tools
later on so here's the picture and we've
got the selection tool what you use to
pretty much just select points select
your picture you'll use that to move
things around the planes the next one
over is the hand tool oh by the way the
selection tool is V that's a you always
want you want to you but you want to
know this because it makes your project
go by so faster and you can work a lot
faster when you can work faster and get
things done you're automatically better
than the person or you're automatically
a little bit more ahead of the person
that doesn't know their hotkeys I found
this to be true a lot of times when I've
been working in studios and even on my
own then the next one over is the hand
tool use that to move your view around
let me import a picture here you can
kind of see what this stuff does so
hand tool you can move your viewer
basically around here's the hand tool
you see you can move your picture around
if you move it around and you need to if
you want it to go back control Z does
undo or you can do edit and then undo
right here at the top you can see the
hotkey is control Z that's another one
you want to remember to memorize the
hacky you'll get you'll you'll figure it
out easily the next one is zoom which is
Z and you can just use that to zoom in
or hold alt and it zooms out if you
click but I'll get more into the zooming
and all that stuff in different tutorial
rotate is the next one that's a W basis
rotate for here's your camera tools you
you can add cameras interior into your
video and then use those to look through
to look at different things in 3d space
and this is what you use to help control
them this is the the Pan behind tool
I'll get into that more often you don't
use that a whole a whole lot but you do
use it a decent amount the square here
that's the mask tool and down some of
these if you click and hold you'll get
more tools that pop up but these are a
different kind of masks that you can
have cube is the hotkey the pen tool is
good for rotoscoping or cutting out or
making masks that aren't in the mask
tool that is hockey G you have the text
tool here and
it bring when you click on the text tool
it actually brings up the text box over
here and then you'll want to use that
with the paragraph box here to create
text so the there I don't think there is
a hotkey for that one the next one is
the brush tool use that for doing paint
strokes and stuff like that I will get
to that later
the next one is the clone stamp tool and
this is kind of like the clone stamp
tool in Photoshop it will get again
we'll get into more of those this is the
eraser tool and these three tools that
we just went over those are paint tools
and you use them when you're painting
out for like com copying and stuff like
that visual effects this tool over here
is the rotor brush tool and then you've
got the puppet tool so it's about time
that I guess we end this tutorial are to
the tutorial it's been 10 minutes so I
like to keep them a little bit shorter
that way you can let go through and pick
different tutorials and I have to sit
through a long tutorial to figure out
just one thing so maybe you just wanted
to see the preferences or whatever or
maybe you just want to see what the
tools work so you can I'll try to keep
them shorter and different and it's
shorter smaller videos so you can just
go to parts that you need and then you
can also watch them in order so well
thanks for watching and see you on the
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
