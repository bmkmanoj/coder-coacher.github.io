a GUI application with a couple things
including a drop-down menu so now what I
want to do is show you guys how to
create that toolbar at the top because
commonly as I showed you guys are
notepad there are often buttons up here
like cut copy paste print and a bunch of
common tools that you can use and also
since that isn't going to take a lot of
time I'm also going to be showing you
guys how to create a status bar on the
bottom to say I don't know maybe you're
hovering over something or maybe you
just saved your project it's going to
give you a nice little indicator to tell
you guys the current status of your
application so I'm going to keep this
all right here and right under actually
let me add a comment um I'll say
something like creating actually I'll
say the toolbar alright just so we can
get everything organized and actually
money so I'll add that from the main
menu main menu and I'll just say toolbar
not the tool bar toolbar because it's
not that cool alright so the first thing
we need to do is create the toolbar and
all we're going to do is we're not going
to put anything in it at first we're
just going to create a frame and that
frame is going to sit in our main one
dough the root and even though you
typically don't want to do this this is
going to be really easy to demonstrate
if I give it a nice blue background so
um again this is just for demonstration
purposes just so you can see how it's
laid out so what this is going to be is
a frame that stretches across right
under your main menu and we're going to
put a bunch of tools in there so hold on
I'm like trying to slide my chair I have
a chair and it has like five wheels on
the bottom in a star shape and for some
stupid reason the wheel always turns
itself tube up against my computer like
in the absolute wrong spot stuff to like
kick it and adjust it
my foot it's kind of annoying but
whatever story in my life who cares
all right so later on I'm going to show
you guys how to insert images like gifts
in pings and little icons that you can
use for your buttons but for right now
since all we know how to do is create
buttons that's what I'm going to be
putting in our toolbar so I'm going to
name this first one insert but because I
don't know I just think it's funny like
insert something in your boat or
something I don't know I have I got
pretty immature sense of humor and
that's just giving myself some space to
insert stuff minima but alright now set
this equal to button and this is going
to be feet pretty much be the first
thing that we're going to insert into
our toolbar so of course the first
parameter whenever you're adding items
to your GUI is saying where do you want
to put it well we want to put it right
in our toolbar which is the frame that's
going to be at the top of our
application next thing
all right Bucky what text you want to
appear on your button well for text arm
what's like a common button I don't know
like the insert image so of course when
we click this it's not going to insert
an image but um we'll say that this is
the button you click if you ever want to
I don't know what kind of program do you
insert images for like a Photoshop or
something and the command for this is
just do nothing and of course it doesn't
take those parenthesis so we can get rid
of those so now we have a blank button
and our toolbar so now let's go ahead
and actually display on the screen so
insert but pack it in which we're doing
means display it or make it show up in
our GUI now also what I want to do is I
want to pack this right to the left hand
side and this is actually pretty much
the equivalent of float:left if were
ever doing web design and another cool
thing i want to show you guys is this
you can also have padding just like you
can in web design so if you put pad x
it's going to give you um however many
pixels i'll just put 2 so this gives you
two
pixels of padding and what padding means
if you aren't familiar Web Design it's
just extra space for your button just so
everything isn't butted up against each
other so I also want to pad some pixels
in the y-direction
might as well pad to pixels so what we
did is we created a basic toolbar and we
put a button in it simple enough let's
go ahead and just add one more real
quick um I'll name it print but and I'll
set this equal to do this a quick way
button of course it's also going in the
toolbar pretty much the only thing
that's different is this button is going
to say print so we're going to have two
buttons at the top of our window North
toolbar one's going to say insert image
the other is going to say print and I
might as well copy this too because I'm
feeling extra lazy today and this line
right here will just display on the
screen simple enough so check this out
we made a toolbar we made two buttons in
it and we also display those buttons
however we didn't actually display the
actual tool tool bar yet tongue-twister
so toolbar pack aka display it well
where do you want to split it what we
want to do is we want to display this on
the top now since we already have this
main menu right here by default kinter
always makes this main menu at the very
top whenever we position this at the top
it's going to be positioned right
underneath it and another thing I want
to do is just I want to fill this in the
x-direction meaning however wide your
window is this is going to take up the
entire width so of course that's the
same thing with pretty much every
application so I'll run this and check
it so of course it doesn't fill in the
y-direction so that's why it's not
growing whenever I expand it downwards
however however wide our application is
since I fill 2x it takes up the entire
width so this is our main menu so and
this is our
Toolbar with a bunch of crap in it and
of course whenever we click any of these
buttons they just called the do nothing
which prints this out on the screen but
typically again these are going to be
icons like I don't know like a little
icon up a printer or a little icon like
of a camera or something and these are
going to be the common tools that you
use but now we have the basic knowledge
of how to create a toolbar and also how
to lay them out so for now that's all
you guys get and actually I'll wait to
another video to show you guys how to
make the status bar because this one's
already like seven minutes long so thank
you guys for watching don't forget
subscribe and I will see you in the next
