17th tutorial on electronics and
robotics now in the last tutorial I
talked to you guys about resistors and
how they had fixed values when giving a
resistance or in other words their
resistance stayed the same all the time
and the circuits we built the LEDs
brightness was based on the value of
your resistor where the more it resists
the dimmer it was in the lesser resists
therefore the brighter it was but people
started thinking and they thought
wouldn't be nice if they could value the
resistance in a circuit without having
to rip out the resistors or change it
because it's a real pain in the butt and
that's why they came up with something
called potentiometer let me show you
guys if I could zoom in I don't know if
you guys can see that or not but that's
what a potentiometer is right there and
pretty much unlike a resistor this is
pretty much a resistor it is but instead
of having a fixed value you change the
value of it by turning the knob on it
that little white knob right there you
turn that and it changes the value of
resistance now a thing that you need to
take note of all of these potentiometers
are uh potentiometers your ever you will
ever work with it can be set to zero all
these can give zero or resistance and
allow electricity to pass right through
there's a value printed on the top of
them
this one is 50 thousand come on zoom in
see 50 K right there that is the max
value for the potentiometer so all can
be set some are going to range from zero
ohms to 50 thousand ohms in this case
the max value is the only thing that
differs so today I'm going to be working
with a trim pop potentiometer and this
is short for a trimmer potentiometer so
um let me zoom up and show you guys how
this works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
