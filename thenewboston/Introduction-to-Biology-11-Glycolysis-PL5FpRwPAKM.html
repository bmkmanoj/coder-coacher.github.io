this video I'm going to be covering
glycolysis this is about the tenth time
I've tried recording this so hopefully
this time I'll get it right I had to
stop a couple of times because I noticed
I made some mistakes blah blah blah blah
I haven't had any caffeine today so I'm
struggling i'm a i-i-i i'm addicted to
energy drinks it's bad but i'm a normal
college student 22 i mean i'm taking 18
hours and I'm double majoring in
biochemistry and microbiology so my days
are not easy but anyways enough about me
let's get started on some cellular
respiration the respiration is how cells
produce energy energy is normally stored
in I a molecule called adenosine
triphosphate I can't even talk today
anyways ATP adenosine triphosphate this
energy is stored in a phosphate bond at
the end of this molecule you've got
these three negative charges here some
normally these two are stabilized by
magnesium ion you don't need to know
that but these three negative charges
here don't like being next to each other
so it's it's a very high energy bond in
as soon as this last phosphate group can
get kicked off its going to get kicked
off another molecule important for
cellular respiration is called
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide it
carries electrons it is a redox molecule
which means it redox means
oxidation-reduction oxidized the
molecules have less electrons reduce
molecules have more electrons you might
see me write this as NADH this is the
reduced form which means it has two more
electrons nad is the oxidized form which
means it has two less electrons
glycolysis is a form of anaerobic
respiration meaning that this does not
require the presence of oxygen you can
do it without oxygen
so it occurs at a heck of a lot of
organisms occurs in the cytoplasm it can
happen in bacteria who live in like Hot
Springs and swaps places where there's
little to no oxygen or it can happen in
animals plants fungi protists what have
you it happens to pretty much everything
the first step of glycolysis is when the
molecule glucose is converted to glucose
6-phosphate using the enzyme hexokinase
and this is going to use one molecule of
ATP produce one molecule of adp this
enzyme is going to take that last
high-energy phosphate bond from ATP and
it's going to stick it on the sixth
carbon here of glucose as you can see
glucose 6-phosphate is converted to
fructose 6-phosphate by a enzyme called
phosphor glucose isomerase glucose is a
six membered ring you can see here
fructose is a five-member ring so this
enzyme is just going to switch one of
these bonds over the first carbon kind
of kicks out doing its own little thing
but the phosphate is still attached to
the six carbon of the molecule
phosphofructokinase is going to take
another phosphate group off of an
adenosine triphosphate and stick it on
the food fructose 6-phosphate to produce
fructose 1 6 bisphosphate so unlike
fructose 6-phosphate you can see here
fructose 1 6 bisphosphate has this extra
phosphate group sitting on the first
carbon of the molecule fructose 1 6
bisphosphate is broken down into two
three carbon substituents by the end
zone enzyme aldolase these two three
carbon substituents are
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and
dihydroxyacetone phosphate and these two
molecules can be interconverted by the
enzyme triose phosphate isomerase
so from here on out all the rest of the
steps in glycolysis you're going to have
two molecules being reacted instead of
one so you're going to get double the
product but anyways you can see your
glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate phosphate
stuck on the third carbon here and you
also have dihydroxyacetone phosphate
right here you can have your
glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate molecules
remember you have two of them now
because your dihydroxyacetone phosphate
is converted into
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate so you're
going to have your 32
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate converted to
13 biswas focal iterates using the
enzyme glyceraldehyde phosphate
dehydrogenase for each molecule you have
for each molecule of glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate you have one inorganic
phosphate and one oxidized form of
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide this
is going to be converted into the
reduced form of nad + 13 bisphosphate
the inorganic phosphate is going to be
stuck onto the first carbon here of this
phosphoglycerate your two molecules of
this phosphorous rate are going to be
converted into two molecules of three
phosphoglycerate the extra phosphorus
our excuse me phosphate group from
carbon one is going to be stuck on to
adenosine diphosphate ADP to produce ATP
this is what you want the cell wants
energy the cell needs energy here's your
energy so you can see here you got your
13 biswas felissa rate with phosphate
groups on both carbons 1 and 3
3-phosphoglycerate is only going to have
the phosphate group on the third carbon
your two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate
are going to be converted into two
phosphoglycerate by the enzyme
phosphoglycerate mutase this just means
that the phosphate group from
third carbon is going to be switched
over to the second carbon and this
hydroxide ion here or hydroxyl group
rather here is going to be switched over
to the third carbon so you got your
phosphate group on the second the
hydroxyl group on the third quick switch
your two phosphoglycerate Tsar converted
into a molecule called
phosphoenolpyruvate by the molecule
enolase it's going to remove some water
from your second and third carbons here
you got the hydroxyl repair this
hydrogen here it's going to stick in a
double bond right there and the last
step of glycolysis is going to be the
conversion of your fossil you know
pyruvates two pyruvates using the
molecule excuse me enzyme pyruvate
kinase you're going to have one ATP per
molecule phosphine of pyruvate converted
to one ATP giving you two more ATP s
also makes it so happy you want energy
you got energy but yeah this phosphate
group is going to be taken off the
double bond disappears actually goes
back up to this oxygen get another
hydrogen on there everybody's happy so
the overall process is for every one
molecule of glucose two molecules of nad
two molecules of adp and to inorganic
phosphates you get two molecules of
pyruvate to reduced versions of nad two
protons or hydrogen ions two molecules
of water and two molecules of ATP the
biggest thing you need to remember from
this is glycolysis produces two ATP and
I know some of you might be asking why
only two you're supposed to get four
because you get to from each molecule
this is true but you have to use two ATP
to get the 480p so the net yield is only
280
but that's all i have for glycolysis
i'll do my next videos on oxidative
phosphorylation or anaerobic excuse me
aerobic respiration and probably
photosynthesis sometime soon after that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
