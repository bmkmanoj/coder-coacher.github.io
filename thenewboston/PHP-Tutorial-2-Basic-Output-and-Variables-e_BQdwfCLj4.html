and PHP this time I'm going to be
teaching you guys how to actually write
some PHP finally so now that you got
your little notepad set up and your
browser I'm using Firefox and you got
everything running you're ready to go
you're ready start writing some PHP and
if you don't know how I got all the
setup or you don't have a passion
installed then what are you been doing
watching this video go watch my first
one sorry anyways to write PHP you need
to start with PHP tags now if you start
writing HTML tags and started typing
some PHP code in here it's not going to
work you need a special PHP tag and
that's this a less sign question mark
PHP and for the end you put question
mark greater than sign and any code
anything we're going to be learning is
going to go in between here we say oh
can i type something out here maybe
maybe down here no you can't don't even
think about it
type all we're going to be learning in
between the beginning and the end PHP
tag now I know you guys are just itching
to write something your first PHP code
so first thing I'm going to teach you is
how to output some basic text just write
text on the screen
and to do that inside your PHP tags
here's what your right echo quotation
marks write whatever you want
I wrote this is text then a semicolon
you always end your lines in PHP with
semicolon now if you save it refresh
your page you can see that it outputted
this is text that's what the echo does
just outputs whatever it is to the
screen now anytime you have text you
want to put it in between quotation
marks but anytime you have a number say
you wanted to write the number 3232 you
don't put it in quotation marks
so again text goes in quotation marks
numbers don't put them in quotation
marks now if you same yeah that's pretty
my trying to think of a word that isn't
going to offend people but it's pretty
dumb why would I just write 32 32 right
on the screen I'm not that stupid
so I know this is kind of a basic
function in PHP but I needed idiots to
learn this first once you get this done
we can begin moving on to something a
little more complicated and this is
called a variable and this is actually a
huge part of PHP in the case you forgot
from 7th grade algebra or biology class
or whatever a variable is just anything
that holds the place of something else
for example we could use this to store
information or value or something else
but it's easier just if I just started
showing you guys what it was so
all variables in PHP start with a dollar
sign so you put the dollar sign and then
you type in your variables name I'll
type some text now after you have your
variable you have to set it equal to
something so you use the equal sign and
we'll set this equal to Harry Potter
again its text put in quotation marks
end up with a semicolon so now I have a
variable some text that has the value
Harry Potter Potter oh man that was
embarrassing so now if we save this
nothing will show up on the screen
because we were telling PHP not to do
anything yet we just said that we have
this variable name some text and it has
Harry Potter that's what that's what the
value is so now if we wanted to actually
display this we would just type echo
dollar sign some text now if we saved it
and refreshed it we can see Harry Potter
now showed up on the screen so again we
said hey PHP we got this variable and
its name is Harry Potter and now we want
to echo it on-screen
why it's named echo instead of just say
or display I don't know but it's called
echo for some reason
now now that we know how to use a basic
variable but say we had another variable
that we wanted to combine so we have
Harry Potter and then we have another
variable named some number we'll set
this equal to 32 again why not end with
a semicolon and say you wanted to
combine these two variables so to do
this you need to use a dot anytime you
use a period it joins the two variables
so right now we'll type echo some text
period
I mean join this with the variable some
number now what we're telling print on
the screen Harry Potter because that's
what the value of this is plus 30 to
save it as you can see we now have Harry
Potter 32 now if you're still thinking
all right this all is pretty useless I
could have just done this just by typing
it into Microsoft Word all right I met
this is pretty basic right now but
you're going to be learning how to use
this and how to use variables store
stuff
that is pretty useful so again pay
attention go over this tutorial until
you actually figure it out how to use
variables words or in quotations numbers
aren't and you join it with dot now
watch my next tutorial see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
