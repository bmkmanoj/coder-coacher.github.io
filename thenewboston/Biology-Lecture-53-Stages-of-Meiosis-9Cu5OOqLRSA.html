broken up into two main stages and
that's meiosis one and meiosis 2 now
meiosis one can furthermore be broken up
into four sub phases and that's prophase
one so the very first stage that this
cell enters this prophase one and then
it moves on the metaphase one and you
guys can probably see where this is
going from you know the mitosis
tutorials anaphase one and telophase one
so once it's done experiencing telophase
one what it does is it hops over to
meiosis two and then it kind of goes
through the cycle again but in a
different kind of way so it goes the
prophase to metaphase to anaphase two
and telophase to
so if anyone has any really good
mnemonic devices for remembering PMA to
go ahead and let me know in the comment
section below please marry a tuna
I don't know hopefully you guys have
something a little bit better than that
the winner gets I don't know a free
piece of chicken or something
so PMA t remember that so basically
whenever you have a show and it wants to
undergo the process of meiosis it hops
over to meiosis 1 which begins with
prophase 1 so prophase 1 is the first
phase that we're going to be talking
about and it goes through the entire
process of meiosis 1 and once it's done
with telophase 1 hops over to meiosis 2
and it ends with telophase 2 so in the
next story what we're gonna do is we're
gonna start with prophase 1 and we're
gonna be talking about each of these
stages phase by phase</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
