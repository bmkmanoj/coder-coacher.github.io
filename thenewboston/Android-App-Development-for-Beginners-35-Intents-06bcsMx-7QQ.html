video and in this tutorial I'm going to
start teaching you guys about something
called intense now an intent is
essentially how you can have one
activity launched another activity in
other words what I'm trying to say is
it's how you can have your app switch
screens because most of the apps you
design it's going to be more than one
screen or more than one activity and the
way you switch between them is called an
intent and there are different types of
intents but I'll cover everything in
just a few tutorials so for this
advocation name uh name like intent
example or not do that so intent example
next and I'm switching back the API
eight make sure we have all the devices
covered since this is actually on one of
the core things that you know you need
every single phone to be compatible with
it and we'll just start with a blank
activity but of course we're eventually
going to be creating another one because
you know that's the point of this
tutorial to learn how to transition
between the two so click Next and I'm
going to make one activity named apples
and I'm going to make another activity
named bacon and we're going to be
switching between the two so just I kind
of like naming that because a and B I
know it's kind of easy it's better than
just naming something a alright so I'm
going to name the first one apples and
finish this up all right today nice very
nice alright so the first thing I want
to do is get rid of that text view and
actually go ahead and select your
relative layout and let's make sure that
this screen looks a lot different than
the bacon screen so I will say that this
is a green apple so I'm going to change
the background my relative layout to 0 0
9 9 0 0 make sure you have that pound
sign in front of and hit enter I
actually like this color green I use on
my website a lot so we'll say that this
is the green apple activity just so we
are clear drag a large text out front
there and just set the text of this
two apples and hit enter now of course
we need something that the user can do
to say okay whenever I do this I'm going
to switch to another activity and for
this we might as well just use a real
quick button because it's the easiest
thing to do you just position the stuff
a little bit prettier all right so this
button will change the text of it to arm
go to bacon all right and actually let
me get rid of this extra crap so we have
some more room all right so now what I
should probably do is change the IDs of
this alright so the idea of this can
just be like apples text and the button
will just give it an ID of apples button
so pretty simple we made a real quick
activity just has some text saying what
activity we're on and eventually
whenever we click this what's going to
happen is the user is going to switch
activities however for that to be
possible we actually need to hop over to
our source code view and instead of just
going in our class and making a huge big
listener what I'm going to do is I'm
just going to add one more element to
this um or one more attribute to this
button element so if I go to Android on
click then remember you can write
something on here like on click and then
you just make an on click method right
here and you don't have to make a
listener or anything like that so now we
can just make this method eventually and
easily listen for button clicks I don't
know it's like the really lazy way but
it works so this activity is looking
good right now so let's go ahead and
make that bacon activity and if you want
you can fix your little string resource
little warnings but I'm not really
worried about it alright so now we need
a bacon
activity so in order to do that remember
just go to your Java folder right here
and in that main package where your
apples Java file is just right click it
and select new activity blank activity
very much adding another activity to our
project so I'm just going to name this
one bacon and make sure that you don't
have the launcher activity selected
because remember our apples one is the
very first one that we want to appear
this is just going to be an extra one so
hit finish and let me organize
everything alright so now we have the
apples Java bacon Java apples activity
are designed now let's go ahead and
design the bacon activity so delete that
text view right there and for the
background of bacon I happen to know
that the color of bacon is 7 2 to 3 1 F
so that ladies and gentlemen is the
color of bacon this is actually the
first thing I learned about computers
before I even learn to turn on my
computer I learned the hex color of
bacon so now you do too
alright so let's drag just some text on
the screen now let's change this text to
bacon just so we know what activity
we're on in case I don't know maybe
someone's colorblind or something now
just so I don't forget I'm going to
change the ID to Bacon text and of
course what we can do is we can add a
button as well plot that baby in the
center and change the ID to Bacon button
and our let me change the text with that
button to actually I would just leave
the same since I'm going to be teaching
you guys how to click this button and
open up the bacon activity and it's
going to be the same you can click this
button and go back but once you guys
know how to do one you know I'm not
going to reteach the same thing over and
over again so all right now that we got
that taken care of what we can do is
just so you guys don't forget let me go
to my Apple design source code or the
XML file and I'm just going to add that
on click to that bacon button too and
that's just so if you guys ever want to
be able to click this and switch back
you can alright so looking good we have
two activities just those both to design
view make sure you have an ID apple text
and Apple button bacon text and bacon
button and once you have your designs
ready you're ready to start writing code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
