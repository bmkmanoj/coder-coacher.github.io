tutorial and operating systems and in
these tutorials I'm going to be going
over some of the basics of command line
operating systems now if you think that
these tutorials are going to show you
how to use the operating system and save
files and move files around and how to
get on the internet and play games and
think again because we're not going to
be doing that this time and what I'm
gonna be teaching you is how to build
programs that you can run right on your
operating system now if you watch my
tutorials before a lot of the programs
that I wrote you can only use with the
internet and if you were wondering how
to use these right on your operating
system then that's what I'm going to be
showing you guys today
so let's go ahead and get started just
click the start button all programs
briefs and command prompt and I know you
guys have seen this thing before and
maybe you never really knew what it was
for well we're gonna be working with
this a lot so we're gonna get used to it
and this is what we're gonna be going
over today now as you see the first
thing that you see is the Microsoft
Windows this is your version of whatever
operating system but the more important
thing what we're looking at is right
here see documents the Settings
administrator if you're wondering what
this is
then what this is is basically click on
my computer if you don't have a shortcut
it's in the Start menu and what these
are this see documents the setting these
are all separate directories so this C
is our hard drive so let's click on C
and this document since setting is
another folder and now these folders are
just called directories it's the same
thing so click on documents and setting
and click on as you see administrator
and every time you see slash it means a
new folder so click on that and as you
see that's where we are what this
command prompt is is pretty much a
window looking into our computer so when
you're running programs and you want to
make a program that says alright go to
the documents and settings and see you
can't actually tell the mouse to move
and click it so you have to use a
language that the computer can
understand and that's what we're going
to be doing with this so let's exit out
of this because this is for just for a
user but we want to talk to the computer
itself so we got to use this language so
as you can see right now we're looking
into the hard drive documents and
settings folder and the administrator
folder just for our basics we don't want
to be right here because there's nothing
really that we can use our ear so the
first thing we want to do is change our
directory just to the main basic hard
drive so to do this type CD for change
directory
and then after that press a space and
press backslash now this is a slash
under the backspace now once you got CB
space backslash press enter and as you
can see this long C documents and
settings change to a normal see this
means we're looking right in our hard
drive now and again your hard drive
should be the C Drive unless you mess
something up now just to get started and
get our feet wet let's just change a
basic command there are a lot of things
you can do from here but in this story
we're just going to be changing the date
and time and looking at a version of
whatever operating system we have so to
change the date just type in date right
after your hard drive and press Enter
what this is going to do is show you the
current date now it says enter the new
date in this format month/day/year and
if you wanted to do that you just press
oh nine and then you know whatever in
that format but I really don't want to
change this right now since it's right
so I'm gonna
let's change something that we can so
just press ENTER and it'll take you
right back to your hard drive and let's
change the time so just go ahead and
type time and press Enter
and it says the current time is 2040 for
an exhibit theater in a military time
this enter the new time let's just
change that by minute so we don't get
too confused I'm gonna go with 2045 and
ii don't really matter
25:43 and as you see right here down at
my 44 when i press enter a change of 45
that's when i press enter so this is
useful whenever let's say your battery
fails on your motherboard and it forgets
the time or when someone was setting up
the computer and they enter the wrong
time you can use simple commands like
this and also when you're writing a
program for Windows to change the time
this is the command you use so let's
just look at one more thing our commands
we use so far aren't always you have to
change things but if you want to get
information
so if you want to get information about
what kind of operating system type ve
are and this stands for version and
press ENTER and now you see Microsoft
Windows XP and this is the version so in
this tutorial we learn three basic
commands
date time and version but before you go
out starting the right programs yet you
might want to check out my other
tutorials but study this and it will
give you a basic idea of how you can
work with the computer and actually talk
to the computer without using your mouse
and actually from this command prompt
you can do pretty much anything you can
or the mouse so study this and get to
know a little better and keep watching
my tutorials and we're going to be able
to learn some amazing things thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
