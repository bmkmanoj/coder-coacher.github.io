tutorial believe it is and what we're
going to do in this tutorial is access
this edit text and also our list
preference so what I want you guys to do
now is open up our data leave no open
classes activity this again is where we
kind of set up our question for the most
part and we commented out some stuff so
we're going to add some additional
information from our preferences in this
class since we had to kind of you know
edit comment out some of these other
lines from previous tutorials so we're
going to do is basically set up again
our shared preference little object for
the most prep for the most part so we're
going to say shared preferences we're
going to call this get data as well just
like the last tutorial so you may be
equal the same thing again we're just
going to access the preference manager
dot get default shared and then again
get base context finish off our
application and now we're going to get
some information as well from from our
preferences again we have to import that
and we're going to set up an edit text
around so we're going to set up a string
basically two string variables gonna
call first string edit text or et phone
home and what we're going to do with
with et here is we're going to again sit
say get data dot get string this time
and again we need to access our key
reference so let's open up our
preference XML here and as for our edit
text we use name but that's what we're
going to use I guess basically we're
going to change our question from our
preferences and also for the default
default value we're going to say
Travis's
again that was our default question for
the most part all right so now what we
need to also do is set up our values
which will or get our values from the
most part we're going to say string
values because again even though we have
the values equal to 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 which seem
like they're integers we set it up with
as a string array within our array XML
so again it's going to be string for the
most part so we're gonna set our value
is equal to get data dot get string
because we're looking for a string as
well and then let's check out what our
key was or Q is called lists so we're
going to say list kind of shut off and
then default value we're going to set up
as a because if you look at this
basically our default value we're going
to say for something like that again
because it takes two strings within its
parameters for the most part a key
string and a default value again a case
if our preferences doesn't have anything
set it's going to have a default value
of 4 now what we're going to do is we're
going to set up our if we're going to
say values again you can't compare
strings like string called values equals
1 even though basically our string
reference could equal the value I mean
the string value of 1 we have to use
methods such as content equals and then
we can say equals within parentheses 1
so basically if our option 1 has been
selected our string will value will
equal 1 and we compare that string value
to the string value of 1 right here if
that's the case we can set up something
within these parentheses so what we're
going to do is we're going to say our
question which is row textview the ex
asked the question within this activity
we're going to say question equals or
set text to et which will again be our
edit text from our preferences so let's
test this out make sure it works but
again
that's kind of how we can pull from our
preferences kind of just the overview or
review of our last tutorial but let's
just make sure it works all right so
let's open up our menu go to preferences
set the edit text to something like
preferences are that's why I set it up
too so we're just going to say
preferences are that's basically going
to be our question if our list activity
has the first option selected which does
at the moment but just to make sure it
works we're going to say option two is
selected so basically that question
won't be asked so let's go into our data
hit start
Travis's and now let's go back menu
preferences change your list to option
one which will set our value equal to
one which again is a string so we have
to use a contains or is equal to or
whatever method we use cotton content
equals one so that's going to be the
case because their value is set to one
right now so let's open up our data hit
start activity as you can see now it
says preferences are because that again
our value is equal to one so it's going
to allow us to use that edit text which
we convert it into a string for the most
part and then we use that string to set
the text of this question so hopefully
that kind of makes sense again using the
preferences and how to access them if
again we close the activity everything
is going to be set for the most part and
it's going to save and then kind of open
up that saved data the next time we run
our application and so again our value
is set to one and so it's going to be
preferences are so hope you guys kind of
enjoyed that understand preferences and
how they can be useful for the most part
and I'll catch you guys in the next
