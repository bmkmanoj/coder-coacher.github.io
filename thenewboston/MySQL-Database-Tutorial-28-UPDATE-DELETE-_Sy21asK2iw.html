MySQL tutorial I have no idea why you
guys are still watching these total
waste of time I'm just kidding but
anyways welcome to your 20th tutorial
and now that we know how to do all those
cool stuff insert rows into our table we
know how to do a whole bunch of query
select statements I think it's time we
learn how to edit rows so check it out
let's say that we just inserted an item
into this website so I'm selling some I
don't know a sack of ham or something
but then I was like oh wait a minute mom
you said pudding hammock I thought you
said sack a ham now I have to sell a
frickin sack a ham well we need a way to
edit items that are already in the
database now we can do this in one of
two ways the first way is that we can
just go ahead and delete this row and
rewrite it but there's an easier more
simple way and I'm going to show you
that right now
so in order to edit a row you use the
term update I think they should have
chose edit but they chose update instead
it means the same thing now you're
saying okay what table do you want to
update well I want to update a row from
the items table so there you go go ahead
and hit items now after this you need to
say okay which piece of information did
you want to update did you want to
update the ID the name of it maybe you
wanted to change the price or the number
of bits well in order to do that we
first need to use the set keyword now
set means change basically now after
this rewrite the name of the column or
the piece of information that we want to
change so of course what was I say a
sack of ham or something I forgot what
it was by anyways we want to change it
so we want to change the name well what
you want to change it to just go ahead
and give it a new value using equals and
then type the new value we want to sell
a pudding hammock and if you don't know
what that is I would recommend that you
open dictionary that shiz we wanted to
actually sell a pudding hammock instead
of a Sega ham so we can't just go ahead
and run this baby right now because look
what happens whenever we would run this
it would update the items table and it
would set the name
of all of your items to pudding hammock
now unless you're running your website
in your selling 300 pudding hammocks I
don't recommend you do this so whenever
you use the upstate excuse me I can't
talk
whenever you use update to edit rows it
is critical that you use a where clause
now the where Clause is saying okay what
row do you want to edit well we only
want to edit where ID is equal to 106 we
only want to edit this item we don't
want to change the name of all of the
rows in our table so now let's go ahead
and run this and check it out it now
says one row affected and if we go look
at items in a sort find 106 it now
changed the name of 106 - pudding
hammock
now how awesome is that so check this
out say that we I don't know we were
maybe editing this in maybe we had to
take it down because we're not allowed
to sell pudding hammocks but then we
talked to the owner of the website and
he allowed us to put it back up well
that's nice and all but why the heck did
you reset my bids to 0 these are hot
items they're selling like hotcakes this
thing had like 66 bids on it well of
course we need to edit that too so if
you're saying ok
not only do I want to edit one column
but I want to edit multiple columns we
can do that as well now I'm not going to
have to type the whole thing let me just
well I might as well change this again
so let's say you know what instead of
selling pudding hammocks I'm going to
sell armed fraud paste it's the best
pace trust me guys now whenever you want
to edit more than one columns again this
is pretty self-explanatory but you just
separate it with a comma now you go
ahead and write the other name of the
column for example the bids and you can
edit these two so again just like before
separate your columns with a comma and
just write the new value of each so now
we're changing the item 106 again we're
changing the name to fraud paste and
we're going to add 66 bids because I
don't know why not it's just an example
give me a break guys so now we go ahead
and hit go and it says one row effect
it but of course you can never trust
computers did you ever see Eagle Eye so
um we're going to make sure fried paste
and bids 66 so that is not only how you
update items but also how you update an
item with multiple well you know I can't
even explain it multiple columns at once
so now I want to teach you guys about
the league and you guys are thinking
okay next tutorial but I'm not going to
teach you in the next story because
delete in how to delete rows of items
for example if we no longer want to sell
this fried paste or we know and longer
want this beef on a stick on the website
I'm going to show you guys how to delete
this in the reason I'm not waiting for
another tutorial is because this is the
easiest thing I have ever taught anyone
in my life so in order to delete rows
just go ahead and hit delete from and
write what table do you want to delete a
row from well I want to delete from
items where ID equals 106 you guys
probably think I'm going to type
something else after this but I'm not
that's it the only thing you're right is
what row do you want to delete and what
table are you deleting that row from now
again the where clause is very important
because if you just say delete from
items they might delete your entire
table so let me go ahead and delete the
item I'll go ahead and delete 104 so it
says do you really want to delete okay
yes I do
and it says okay I freaking delete it
before you you said okay you even
verified it so now we got to go ahead
and check we got 106 105 104 is now
deleted from our table 103 1 2 2 1 1 so
on and so forth so I can't remember what
that item was but that is how you delete
items from a database and again I know a
lot of you guys are just going to be so
tempted to not use that where clause and
it's going to delete your whole table
but hey there you go so another thing I
want to mention this is the last thing I
promise before you know you guys can go
out weird cat videos or something but
that's why primary keys and ID numbers
are so important because you know how in
our where clause I said delete items
where ID equals 106 well say that you
just
not to use primary keys or ID numbers
because you know you just don't take my
advice well then you started this
website and a bunch of people were
selling DVDs well you wanted to leave
this item right here because this is a
spammer who posted this so you said
delete where name equals DVD so yes you
ran that query in it would delete this
row too but it would delete all those
other people who also named their items
DVDs so whenever you use primary Keys
instead of giving a general name that
may delete ten or twenty other rows
accidentally you say delete item 99
because that's the primary key no other
row can have that primary key and you
give it an ID so that way it knows which
specific want to delete so that is the
beauty of primary keys and again that's
one little gem of information plenty
more to come in the next story what I'm
going to be doing is I'm going to be
showing you guys how to create entire
tables it's going to be awesome it's
going to be amazing so thank you guys
for watching it over you subscribe and
add me on Google+ and I will see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
