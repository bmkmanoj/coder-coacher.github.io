and welcome to your 12th get tutorial
and in this video as you can see what
we're going to be doing is I'm going to
be teaching you guys how to use git
when working with the actual project I
think it's a lot easier um and I think
we're ready to start working with the
actual project in this case a website
instead of just covering like basic
commands it's going to make get a lot
more useful and make everything else
from here on out make a lot more sense
so the first thing I want to mention is
this is the website I'm going to be
working with I paid some guy $20 to make
this website so it only has four pages
home about pictures and contact really
simple and also if you guys want these
files and I recommend you download them
so you can follow along I'll put this
link on in the description below the
video but you guys can download download
this entire zip folder and if you go to
file download you can get it for free
and you can follow along all these files
one-click boom you got it for free so
anyways this is the website right here I
don't know why it even says gonzo at the
top check this out I think it's his name
or something but uh let's go ahead and
let me guys
go ahead and show you guys let me go
ahead and show you guys well what am I
talking about this is what we're going
to be doing so we have this folder
called dogs and if we double click it we
can see that it has all these files and
this is basically a website it has CSS
files images some JavaScript and of
course your main HTML files right there
but the thing is that right now this is
just a folder and also whenever you guys
download this it isn't going to be a git
project get isn't going to be tracking
it it's just a regular folder on your
desktop so again if you forgot the first
thing we needed to get is hey we want to
turn this into a git project we want to
track changes in this folder so how do
we do that we open git bash and we first
have to navigate to the folder
mind let me just move this slightly
there we go
so right now um we have to change to the
desktop and it also depends where yours
is but mine is on the desktop so desktop
and I name that folder dogs so hit enter
and as you can see we are now inside
this dog's folder so if we type get
status and hit enter it said alright
this stocks folder is not even a
repository yet so we're going to keeping
track of any changes so you know nothing
to display here so in order to turn this
into a repository the command is get in
it which means initialize four paws
repository kind of a tongue twister and
then I said initialize empty git
repository lalalalala get pretty much I
turn that folder into a git project now
keeping track of changes so now when we
do get status and hit enter it says ok
right now this folder is a git project
but you have all these files that you
didn't add yet so whenever you
initialize a repository remember it just
says ok you're now working with git but
we still need to add all the files and
of course the easiest way to do that is
get add and instead of typing every
filename just hit period which means all
and hit enter LF a group all right so
what this is saying is pretty much just
the line endings there are different
style line endings but it doesn't really
matter so it's pretty much means one
style line ending is going to be
replaced with another cell line ending
not really that big a deal it's just you
know different operating systems so now
that we added all the files to the git
repository what we have to do is or
excuse me
now that we added them to staging area
we have to commit them so if we type git
commit now summit git commit - M we can
just put a message like uhm this is the
very first commit and good enough so go
ahead and hit enter and boom look at
that
we now have all of our files added to
the repository and every single file in
the stocks folder is now being tracked
by git
so remember download the stocks file
initialize your repository add
everything to the staging area and then
commit everything and once you do that
you guys are ready to go we're ready to
start working with the actual project so
I'm excited and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
