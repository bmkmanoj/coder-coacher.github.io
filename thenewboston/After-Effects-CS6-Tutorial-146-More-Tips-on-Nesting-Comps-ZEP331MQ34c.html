nesting comps tutorials and After
Effects cs6 I'm your host
buddy Blackford and we're gonna keep on
going on about pre comps and show you a
little bit more about what's going on
besides just an intro now if you watch
the previous tutorial about the
introduction to nesting comes you'll see
that I took three or four of my layers
which were in my logo and moved them
around and put them into a pre comp now
what we're gonna do now is show you a
little bit how you can move the pre comp
around and everything like that now you
may have noticed that when you have a
pre comp it will it will keep the
transparency that has been made in the
composition in your pre comp and it'll
be it'll show up in your composition
here so if I go and add another
different kind of background you can see
that the transparency is kept the campus
of the pre comp is going to be the same
as the it's going to be the same as how
big your pre comp
actually was created so if I wanted to
change the composition settings here I
could change the size of the pre comp
and let's change it down a little bit
see what happens so there we go you can
see that the canvas is actually getting
smaller while the actual objects in the
pre comp are not so I have made it a
little bit smaller in resolution and now
the actual canvas size for the pre comp
is smaller and not the whole entire size
now you can see that I would be able to
animate the position of the pre comp
here with everything as if they were
parented all parented together so I
could just key frame here
yes you're on a stopwatch and then just
move down here and you can animate the
position of your pre comps so if you
don't feel like parenting everything and
having like a big mess then that's a
good reason for pre comp and like I just
said pre comps help lower or help reduce
the amount of clutter that are in your
scene here now one thing with pre comps
is is that sometimes when you pre
compose something and bring it in the
collapse transformation tool will be
turned off now you want to you may need
to turn that on sometimes to keep the
different like rasterization x' and
vector properties of whatever is within
your pre comp so you may want to turn
that on sometimes and in our case here
it is the same because the scale is the
same so if i zoom in here for you guys
we're at a hundred percent so everything
should be everything should be the way
we want it to look and I take off the
transformation collapse transformation
tool and go to scale this up we can see
that the edges of the words are blurry
the edges of our logos are blurry so we
want to make sure that we check the
collapse transformation tool and then
everything will be in its position that
we want and everything will be crisp
around the edges just like our vectors
and shape players should be sometimes
when you create a pre comp everything
that you have animated within may not be
in the right spot that you want it to be
in so you want to also make sure that
you have this checked on and that will
bring everything into the right areas
that it needs to be now I'm just going
to bring this back to its original scale
so we don't need to mess with it I want
to point you up here to the top of the
composition panel
where
can switch between the different
compositions and pre comps here I click
on logo it's going to bring me quickly
to the logo composition if I go to text
it's going to quickly bring me to the
text and then we have these drop-down
arrows - to see how our text and logo
are combined so we got our text here
which is the main comp and the logo with
the arrow showing here that it's going
into the text comp we've got our
different ways of setting this up here
in our sort mode so if you don't like
going from right to left you want it to
go left to right there we go and I mean
to me that seems a little easier most
people read from left to right so I
usually switch that over you can also
switch between your comps down here well
if you don't have this one open you can
easily go to open it up here so we'll
switch to our logo up here by clicking
on logo and it'll bring it up quickly
instead of having to search through your
project menu to go and find it which
reminds me I should put these in the
cops folder so I don't get myself all
confused so I mean if you don't want to
be switching between your effects and
your project pandal as much just use
these up here to switch back and forth
just a little handy thing to save you
some time another thing that I want to
let you guys know about nesting comps is
you want to keep some of the attributes
the same and the attributes I mean by in
the composition settings so if we go to
composition composition settings and
we're in the wrong one here let's go
into our logo and then go into
composition composition settings we want
to make sure that the settings here are
the same frame rate as in pixel aspect
ratio as the settings in the text so 24
and square pixels are what we want there
and our resolution at full let's see if
they're the same in our text square
pixels 24 and resolution at full if you
don't you're gonna have some errors when
you're rendering and things are going to
be choppy
they may not look the same and something
will be off and you'll know because I
mean it's happened to me a few times
trying to throw something into another
composition that doesn't have the same
frame rate it looks weird
so those are pretty much just a bunch of
tips for you to remember when you're
using nested comps and I'll stop this
part of the tutorial here we'll get onto
some more tips in the next tutorial
so thanks for watching this one and I'll
see you guys in the next tutorial where
like I just said we're gonna be doing
some nested comps and watch out for
those stupid wasps so see you guys later
and stay safe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
