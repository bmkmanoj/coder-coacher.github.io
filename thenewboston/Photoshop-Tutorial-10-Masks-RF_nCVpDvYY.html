tutorial today I'm gonna be teaching you
guys how to use a mask now a mask is is
it allows you to hide or show any
portion of your image that you like so I
got a picture of my friend passed out on
the couch right here and we're gonna be
working with this today and let's say I
wanted only to show him and not the
background at all he's like ah this is a
really good picture but this couch is in
the way you got to get it out of here so
I'm gonna do that for him as now we
learned of two main ways of doing this
the quick selection tool which you can
see go ahead and tried to select up then
his head would be alright but his hand
wouldn't get all the way and the couch
kind of blends into the blue so that
would select too so you need to do a lot
of thing and it would just be a big pain
in the butt so you might be thinking
alright just use your background eraser
tool alright we can do that so say we're
racing along here erasing the background
and we've done that we've been erasing
for a while we accidentally oh go into
his body to undo that you would have to
undo the whole thing and just a huge
pain in the butt to do so I got one more
technique that is the best technique
we've learned so far and that is called
a mask
now what a mask does is allow you to
erase the background but if you mess up
you can get any section if you want
again
so to do that go ahead down here to your
layers palette and highlight the layer
you want to work on then click this
little tool called add mask layer now
that we've added it you can see this box
pops up next year image right here this
is your mask layer make sure that you're
not around the image a white square will
pop up around it to let you know so you
want you want to be on this little white
rectangle that shows that you're on the
mask and you don't want to be painting
on the image so select your mask and
then go over to your brushes and select
just a typical paintbrush and what this
does is allow you to paint with black
and white
anytime you paint with black it'll hide
the section of the image you don't want
to see and anytime you paint with white
it'll make it appear again so let's say
we're painting with black right now and
as you can see what it's doing is hiding
the section of the image we don't want
so we'll probably come over here and go
along the edges and if you're doing this
a real for real then you might go a lot
slower but say we're just going around
the edges take enough background get rid
of this up here and say we're taking out
the background and whoops we
automatically went into a shirt well
here's all you need to do
go down here instead of black just click
white and then it allows you to fix any
part of the image you accidentally went
over or want to show again and as you
see as I'm painting them with white it's
allowing me to bring back that section
of the image that we want to see again
and this is a way where you can get real
fine detail and it's a tool that you can
bring back your image layer something
you can never do with the background
eraser tool and since we're working with
black and white we can also apply
grayscale gradients for special effects
so let's go to our gradient now let's
click let's just pick any gradient and
I'll show you how the layer works but
let me get rid of this mask just drag it
and drop it down in your recycling bin
and I'll get a whole new mask show you
guys how this works
so again click add layer mask make sure
you're on the layer mask go ahead pick a
gradient
and as you see whoops
when we apply this gradient it also
blocks out any of the image that we
don't want to see using greyscale now
this is a way where you can apply
greyscale to your image for some special
effects now that we've learned one of
the best ways to extract part of our
image we're gonna be talking next about
how to use the extract filter and if you
missed anything I went over today you
can go to my website the New Boston comm
now I have a step-by-step tutorial of
everything we learned thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
