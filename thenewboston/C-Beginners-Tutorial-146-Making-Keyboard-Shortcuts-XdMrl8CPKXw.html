tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to use keyboard
shortcuts so all you're going to need
for this tutorial really is just a blank
form and the first thing that we're
going to have to do is that the key
preview property equal to true so just
go over to your properties panel over
here and set key preview to true the
next thing that we're going to want to
do is create a new event and lurk when
the user actually like presses a key so
we're going to go to the keydown event
and this occurs first when the key is
pressed this occurs before this key
press event we're going to want to click
on this alright so we're going to want
to be checking to see if user pressed
ctrl a so we're going to be using these
key event arguments to get the data
about on the t press we're going to say
if e dot control and the control
property basically just returns a bool
indicating whether the control key was
pressed and even if there are multiple
keys pressed it will still return true
of controls in there and we're also
going to say and e dot key code dot two
string equals a and basically we're just
checking to see if user presses a as
well so this will only return true right
here if the user presses on ctrl and if
they press a and obviously if you wanted
to check to see if they press like app
or something else like that you could
just pull a cap in here instead of a so
if the user presses a we're just a
message box be shown thing Adam alright
so now let me go over here to our form
debug and press control a we should see
a message box that says Adam yep and if
you press any other key combination it
won't work only if you press ctrl a all
right now what if you wanted to make it
so that it will only happen if the user
has like their cursor in a text box so
what you're going to want to do is just
drag a text box over to your form
and what's different between a text box
and like your actual form is there's no
key preview property so you don't worry
about setting anything to true then just
like before you're going to want to go
over to the events tab over here and go
down to key down all right and then we
can just use these key event arguments
just like or to see user type something
so we're going to say if Y dot ctrl + y
dot our key code to string and we're
going to see this time to see if it's a
ctrl F and then if they did we're just
going to have a message for our show
sang you thrust control well I'll say
ctrl roll and and I'll say from box all
right so now maybe bug here and since
our cursor is in the text box right here
you just press ctrl F we should get a
message box saying you press ctrl F from
the text box yep perfect
all right and you can also do things
from other keys like there's not only
control inside of this key event arts
class that you can also check to see if
they press like shift or alt as well so
if you wanted to see if they pressed alt
and B then I'll say alt here and B so
now we're just going to check to see if
you user press alt and B so if they
press alt B then you have to press alt +
B from the text box and if you want to
check to see if they press like II I
mean alt and ctrl we could do that as
well so if they press E and PR alt and
ctrl alt and ctrl yep all right so
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
on setting up keyboard shortcuts so see
you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
