welcome to a new video now I decided to
make this video because there is one
question that I get asked above any
other question more commonly through my
youtube message in in on my forum and
that's Bucky how can I make money online
now I know there's a bunch of different
ways that you heard about before how to
make money online and none of them
usually work so I decided to make a
guide showing you how to do it correctly
and I you know some of these ideas might
help you so my guess is that you want to
make money online because you want to
make money just like everyone else but
you don't really want to do anything
that involves moving your legs you want
to do something easy sit behind your
computer make some money now the cool
thing is that this is America and at
this day and age that's actually
possible so what I did is I went through
in divides the top 5 ways that anyone
can make money online now let's start
with number 5 and this is probably the
most common way the thing you heard of
many times for and that's make a website
now the most common and easiest thing
you can probably do is set up a blog
through you know Google blogger blogspot
anything like that it's really easy and
you know probably the easiest way you
can make money online so here's a couple
tips whenever you setup your blog guys
no one wants to hear about that you're
going dirtbike with your friends in the
Yosemite mountains or on the Grand
Canyon or anything like that people
don't really care about your life I know
it sounds mean but it's the truth and
girls no one wants to hear about how hot
you think Ben Affleck is with your shirt
off people want to see something that
they can relate to and they just don't
want insight in a one person's life
because well quite frankly it's not the
entertaining so when people go on
internet they go on for mostly two
reasons well three reasons mostly but we
can't do porn
but one is they want to be humored they
want to laugh at something so whenever
you're making your blog try to make it
somewhat humorous it'll help you out a
lot and if you have no funny bone
however then you at least know what can
entertain people so check out this
photoshopped apple this is entertaining
so as long as you meet these two key
aspects humor and entertainment people
are going to want to read your blog a
lot more than you know what you did at
McDonald's the other day some things
people care about some things they don't
just a helpful hint now if you want to
take a step up from blog you can also
start creating a forum now the cool
thing about forum is if you don't know
any programming languages or anything
like that the software for this is free
so you can go to sites say go ahead and
google and type in free forum software
or anything like that you're going to
have a bunch of free templates to set up
a forum this is a lot more engaging with
your users and it's just a lot more
promising than blog never saying all
right I got my blog or my forum set up
now what the heck am I supposed to do
how do I make money off it
well Google Adsense is a way that you
can take ads and put them on your
website now here's how it works
Google handles all the business aspects
of it hold on I gotta swallow and what
they do is they take a company who wants
to pay for advertisements they put them
on your website and they share a
percentage of the profit with you and
it's actually very even how they do they
give you like eighty percent of the
money if not more so that's how you can
make money from a blog or forum now
these next couple things unlike a
website or blog they probably are things
that you haven't heard it before so
let's go if the number four way to make
money online Agra computer online
gambling again this may be the worst
advice or the best advice you ever got
but I'm willing to take that chance now
the three most common types of online
gambling you can do and actually make
money is poker betting on sports and
playing backgammon now anything you're
good at you can probably make money off
of so if you're really good at any of
these you will win now you can also you
know play slot machines and bingo on the
computer and make money off that but I'm
saying there must be some skill involved
if you want to make money consistently
unlike
bingo or you know anything like that if
you're going to do that just go ahead
and play the Powerball or Mega Millions
or something now here is a little hint
that's going to save you a lot of
headaches now let's go ahead and take
poker very example you usually don't
want to go the most popular poker sites
because these are going to be sites that
poker players have heard about and
they're going to test their skills
against other poker players we want to
do is go to sites what is generally like
a casino but have side poker rooms to it
and you're saying all right why they're
going to be a bunch more people at Party
Poker than this bet us well it's because
people at casino sites aren't looking to
play poker for competition they're just
looking to gamble for entertainment so
whenever you play poker against them
they're pretty much just going to be out
here some money take it from me I don't
even know what the heck poker is I just
sat down at the stabled press few
buttons and give you a few money so
that's pretty much my tips for playing
poker online or you know playing
backgammon online for money or anything
like that now number three how to make
money online I know you heard of this
before too but I had to put it in here
and that's eBay my friend now look
around your room your apartment your
house anything like that you know those
old boots and half eating Donuts well
you know how you think they're garbage
you're about to throw them away but
trust me there's people out there who
actually want this stuff why I have no
idea but pretty much put anything on
eBay and people are going to bid on it
so it may take a little effort to list
it I know a couple clicks of the button
but trust me there are going to be some
people who actually want this stuff now
I sold a bunch of stuff on eBay and be
doing it for years and here is the two
most important things I can give you one
you pretty much want to bold every
single thing you can without going to
too much detail it is severely helpful
and aside from that you want to get free
shipping with free shipping you're going
to make up for it when people bid
because they're going to take that into
account and also it's just you know
anything for free people are gonna you
know just trust me without going in my
eBay tutorial these two things are going
to help you out a ton
now number two way to make money online
you're watching it right now and that's
open up a youtube account and start
making tutorials and you know it doesn't
even have to be tutorials it just has to
be a video about anything now hot chicks
have the advantage here because they can
take out a camera start talking into it
and pretty much a tongue of guys are
going to watch subscribe say oh my god
you're the greatest thing ever I love
your videos no matter what they talk
about but guys see they have it a little
bit differently it's a little bit harder
for them they talk in the camera people
like your douche get out of here so they
need to be a little bit more creative so
some of the common things that you can
make videos about if your dude instead
of just talking about a camera are cats
can be a popular subject babies any fire
anything you sound fire or explodes but
the thing is you don't want to put all
of these three together or something
very bad is going to happen now the
number one way you can make money by
sitting at your computer or making money
online and I'm giving this number one
not because it's the easiest thing to do
but by far this can be the most
profitable if you do it right
by far by far by far and that is selling
iPhone apps online you're saying alright
Bucky I'm going to quit this video right
here I have no idea how to sell iPhone
apps where to even begin we'll check
this out here's a quick little guide if
you have any idea for an iPhone app what
you can do is you can go to sites like
oDesk and Elance and here is where you
can find people all over the world to
build your iPhone apps for you
what you do is you give them your idea
give them a couple bucks and they create
the iPhone app for you and then you can
take the app and you can sell it under
your own self and then you can money
from it over and over again and here's
the best thing like any of these things
you pay for it once and you make money
for the rest of your life so pay some
guy once to make an iPhone app for you
and that's income for the rest of your
life and this is by far more profitable
actually the most profitable way
I know of how to make money online this
has the biggest potential so please do
not overlook this I know at first it may
seem kind of out of range at touch but
trust me it's worth looking into and the
only advice I have to give you for
making iPhone apps is this one good app
is better than a bunch of crappy apps so
if you have one good idea then you want
to concentrate on this and try to
instead of just trying to make a bunch
of crappy apps to put on the iTunes
Store so that's the only advice I have
to give you I hope you guys got
something from this tutorial I know a
lot of people were requesting it so I
think you guys for watching um that's
all I have for you don't forget to
subscribe and now see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
