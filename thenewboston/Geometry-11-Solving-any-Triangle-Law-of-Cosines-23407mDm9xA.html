solve the sides of a triangle or the
angle of a triangle using what's called
the law of cosines so in any triangle
ABC a squared which is the length of
this side equals b squared plus c
squared minus 2bc cosine of a remember
cosine is a trig function so we're gonna
have to use our graphing calculator that
has a cosine function on it it looks
like it just it looks like this and
you're gonna put an answer in here and
you're gonna close the parentheses when
we're solving for that B squared equals
a squared plus C squared minus 2 AC
cosine of B C squared equals a squared
plus B squared minus 2 a B cosine of C
so basically the length of a side is
equal to the sum of that side is equal
to the sum of the other two sides minus
2 side 1 times side 2 cosine of the
angle across from that side and it's
kind of confusing but it's really
actually pretty easy so we're gonna do
some examples now okay so we're trying
to find out what x equals
so x squared is gonna equal a squared
plus B squared minus 2 a times B cosine
of the angle opposite the one we're
talking up a set the side we're talking
about so cosine of 75
x squared is equal to and this is where
we're gonna have to start using the
calculator so 15 squared is 225 plus 11
squared is 121 minus 215 times 11 is 165
and we're not gonna plug in cosine yet
okay
so 25 to 25 plus 121 is 346 minus 2
times 165 330 cosine of 75 okay so this
is where we have to plug stuff into the
calculator so this is how it's gonna
look when you plug it into the
calculator you're gonna plug 346 minus
330 cosine of 75 just like this except
there'll be a parenthesis here and you
want to close that parenthesis 2 so
let's go ahead and type that into the
calculator 346 minus 330 cosine of 75
close the parentheses and rounding to
the second decimal place we're gonna get
x squared is equal to two hundred and
sixty point five nine so now we want the
length of X so we're going to take this
square root of it and in your calculator
if you hit second square the squared
button you'll get the square root and
then if you hit second answer it'll plug
that answer that you just got right back
into it so it's more exact so then you
you want to round at the very end so you
get about 16 point one four two seven
nine we're gonna round that to 16 point
one four three it's always good to run
to the third decimal place
okay we're gonna do one more example
except this time we're gonna find what
that angle is so we're gonna have to use
some stuff called arc cosine and arc
cosine is just like the opposite of
doing cosine I'll show you what I mean
in a minute so we're trying to solve for
X so we have to take the side opposite X
11 squared equals the two sides squared
minus two side times side cosine of X so
I'm gonna get 121 equals 5 squared is 25
plus 5 squared is 25 50 minus 2 times 5
is 10 times 5 is 50 cosine of x squared
I know it should just be cosine of X so
now what we're gonna do is we're trying
to solve for this so we're gonna
subtract 50 over and you'll get 71 is
equal to negative 50 cosine of X we're
gonna divide the 50 over and we're just
gonna leave it as a fraction for now
equals cosine of X okay so when we don't
know the value of an angle we're gonna
use the inverse we're going to use an
inverse function so in order to find out
what x equals we say X is equal to
cosine inverse of 71 over 50 so
basically it's saying that this angle
this side of the equation is basically
just saying whose angle has a cosine of
50 1 over negative 50 so when we do this
we're solving for the angle so when you
type it into your calculator you're
gonna hit 2nd cosine
when it when you do that this will pop
up this is what it should look like look
like and then you're gonna plug in 71
divided by negative 50 close the
parentheses and and if you type that
into a calculator you'll get about 63
degrees so that's how we're doing with
law of cosines make sure you come back
watch the next video where we're going
to talk about law of sines which is
another way to solve problems about
triangles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
