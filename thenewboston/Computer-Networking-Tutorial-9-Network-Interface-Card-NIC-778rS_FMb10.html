to your ninth computer networking
tutorial and in this video I want to
talk to you guys about Nicks and I see
no not people named Nick or anything
like that I want to talk to you guys
about network interface cards now first
of all what the heck is a network
interface card well it's the part of
your computer that allows you to connect
to the internet so basically if you're
wondering all right can any computer you
know you buy from a pawn shop or
anything connect to the Internet
well no every computer can't connect to
the internet in order to do so it needs
one of these things a network interface
card so what the heck is this other than
you know it's the part of the computer
that allows you to connect to the
internet well basically what it does is
part of this and this would be on this
one this part right here is going to
connect to your computer in by your
computer I mean your motherboard another
part of it on this one it's this part
right here this little outlet is going
to connect to an Ethernet cable and they
have different network interface cards
but this is a three net one it's going
to connect to some kind of
communications media and allow you to
connect to a network so basically
remember a network interface card is
made up of kind of two halves
one that connects to your computer and
one that connects to a communications
media in this case this is an Ethernet
plug
now in this example right here we see a
computer and this is actually your
motherboard this big blue thing that
says gigabyte on it and where your
network interface card would go on a
desktop is right here there are a bunch
of little slots on your motherboard and
your network interface card would plug
into one of those and that will leave
the ethernet plug or whatever you know
maybe it's a transmitter of some sort it
will leave it exposed on the outside so
you can plug a ethernet cords into it or
it would be able to accept Wi-Fi so this
is where they go if you're looking in
the inside of your computer you can
easily identify because it's a big long
thing that looks like this and it's
going to be plugged into one of the
slots on your motherboard
now again if you guys don't even know
Ethernet is this is what I mean by
Ethernet it pretty much looks like a
really thick telephone wire and it plugs
into a plug that looks like pretty much
a big on telephone outlet so that's what
I'm talking about when I say Ethernet
and I want to stress that because the
ethernet port or the ethernet card is
not the only card that you can have you
can also have a Wi-Fi card and this is a
desktop Wi-Fi card of course if you guys
are like alright my laptop connects to
Wi-Fi but it certainly doesn't have one
of these big antennas right here well
for laptops they typically don't have
these anymore this is just for a desktop
to get you know a better connection but
I just want to give you guys this quick
example because I want to stress that
yes there are indeed Ethernet network
interface cards in there are also
wireless internet or excuse me
Wow once you talk for like 2000
tutorials sometimes you mess up your
words there are wireless network
interface cards and as you go on these
tutorials we're going to be learning a
little bit more about different types of
network interface cards and how some are
faster than others and the benefits of
some over others and we'll be talking
about that more in detail later on but
for now let me go ahead and show you
guys something really cool if you're on
Windows right now you can go ahead and
click the start button and whenever it
says search button right here if you
type de Vie mg M T dot M s see what this
is going to do is this is pretty much
the program that opens your device
manager so this is pretty much your
device management system just go ahead
and press enter and this device manager
is going to pop up now if you're like
what the crap is all this stuff well
what this is is pretty much all of the
pieces of your computer from your
keyboards your motherboard to your
memory your processor and if you look
under the section that says network
adapters you might see one option if you
have your um if you didn't like by a
network interface card separately if you
one option that means that you have
already built into your motherboard
which typically most desktops do
nowadays most motherboards at least and
the one I have right now is a real tech
PCIe GBE family controller
it's just a long name and that's what
network interface card I have so if
you're bored and you want to check out
you you know network interface card and
you're too lazy to actually look behind
your desktop like I am then this is how
you do it and also if you ever need
yours replace or it breaks or anything
in the guys wants to know I don't know
maybe at the computer repair shop what
kind is um you know compatible with your
motherboard you can just look in here
and you can see it so again whenever
we're troubleshooting you we can't
connect to the internet this is one of
the places we go and make sure that
everything is working out correctly but
for now I just wanted to show it to you
guys in case you were interested
so anyways thing guys for watching don't
forget to subscribe and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
