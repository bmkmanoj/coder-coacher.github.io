another Photoshop cs6 tutorial today
we're gonna learn how to apply an inner
glow layer style and basically the inner
glow creates the appearance of a glow on
the inside of an object I guess that's
the best way to describe it it's
self-explanatory I guess so let's go
ahead and get started go ahead and get
your object out here and go ahead and
apply the inner glow which is right here
and now you can kind of see around the
edges of the object there is a glow and
this is what we wanted let me put a
different kind of object in here that we
can see the inner glow a little bit
better and then if we increase it and
decrease it's not gonna be so so crazy
looking there we go this will be easy
alright now I'm gonna apply the inner
glow to this all right now we can see
around the edges that there is an inner
glow if I uncheck could check the
preview you can see the difference
alright so the first thing we're gonna
go over we've got our blending modes
here and you want to probably stay in
the lightening blending modes which are
these ones in this little section right
here with lightning screen in it opacity
is transparency and the next thing we've
got is noise and if you add more noise
it becomes a little more dotty or
blotchy err so I honestly you don't
really want a lot of noise and this
section down here you can either you can
choose your colors and you can choose
basically any color you want and it's
going to blend with the actual image
because you have a blending mode put on
it's not gonna be the actual color that
you pick it's going to be the color
that's blended with the color behind the
next next to this we've got a gradient
that we can pick and you can select any
of these gradients that you want as you
can see here
and I'm just gonna stick with the solid
color below this we have our technique
we've got softer and it says technique
used to soften the mask and then we've
got precise now precise gives the the
glow a more realistic look but it's a
more complex look so if I do that and
change it you can see that it's a little
more complex and nicer so we've got edge
which is going to mean that the down
here on our source it's going to mean
that the glow is gonna come from the
edge and if I hit center you can see
that it's coming to come from the center
out and then end at the edge so most of
the time you're gonna want an edge you
can increase the choke here to get a
like a more a sharper edge and then
we've got the size here we can increase
the size of the glow or something like
that so then if I increase the choke you
can see that's a sharper edge and then
you get like a little outline so that's
a little technique that you can use if
you ever wanted to use that or if you
just use a stroke but there's two
techniques we've got our quality here
which is going to do the the brightness
and we've got some presets here that we
can use to check out the different
techniques so here's some different
techniques that you can use most of the
time you're going to want to use linear
because that's pretty much the way that
everybody thinks of using inner glow
we've got anti aliased here and it makes
the edges a lot more smooth I don't know
if you can tell on my screen on the
tutorial but it's actually making the
edges a little bit nicer range here it
determines the how the contour is
applied so it's like a like a value
meter kind of thing and as you can see
as I go left it's a sharper edge kind of
like increasing the choke and then if I
go farther it's a softer softer inner
glow and then jitter down here increases
like Oh Randa it's like a random value
kind of thing
doesn't really do a whole lot so that's
all the things that you can use to
pretty much use your inner glow mess
with the core mess with the contours if
you want to create some cool looking
things mess with the different colors to
get some cool-looking colors it's all up
to you basically and be creative and
make some cool stuff so thanks for
watching the tutorial and I look forward
to seeing you guys in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
