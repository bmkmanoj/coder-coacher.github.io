you guys is an effect that has more
advanced options in it to basically
control your stroke so I'm going to take
the stroke off of this text here by
clicking on this no stroke color button
here so now we have no stroke and I'm
going to space out the letters a bit
more let's put it back to zero so there
we go for that now what I need to do
here is create some masks to use the
stroke on so I'm going to right click on
the text layer and create masks from
text now what happens is we create a
layer here that is outlines and effect
enabled my masks on here
we can see that it has created masks of
our text for us now the text layer here
has been turned off just so you know so
the next thing we need to do is have our
text outlines layer selected go into
effect and then we're going to go to
generate stroke and you can pick the
each individual letter if you want or
you can pick all masks and it will do
all of them now we can also just delete
out the regular text here
go now you can change your color the
stroke oops let's do let's do a light
blue cuz I like that color turn off our
master so we can see what's going on you
can adjust the size with the brush size
here you can adjust the hardness now
I'll zoom in so you can see what it's
doing wrong there we go
I'm at 400% there so but there you can
see what the hardness does I'm gonna
zoom back out now we've got the opacity
here you can see what that does it
creates kind of like some kind of like
trippy effect if you don't have it all
the way up maybe if you're on like
mushrooms or something like that you can
go like this all day and see what
happens to your mind now we've got start
and end here now you can see that it'll
right on the the stroke and you can
keyframe this if you would like we got
our start here which is going to go from
the left now as you can see it kind of
it kind of puts them on in some like
weird order so
it's not always the best we've got our
spacing here which you can see what that
does sometimes I don't know when you
might want to use that maybe if you just
make like a dotted line you want to make
like a dotted cutout line you can use
this spacing here see that's why it's
good to like mess around with your
effects every once in a while while
you're when you're when you're using an
effect just check out what all the
parameters do and then you can see how
they affect how you can make cool
effects just think in your mind what can
I do with this now we've got our paint
styles here we're on original image is
just like a regular stroke around if we
go on transparent it's going to cut out
the middle and then if we go to reveal
original image we're gonna be able to
reveal it using art and and starts here
so that's how the the stroke works now I
want to show you how to make this a
little bit better because when we use
the end in start here it kind of sucks
it doesn't go in like a way that we want
it want it to so let me show you what it
looks like real quick I'm gonna keyframe
it and I'm gonna go like three let's go
three seconds and then set it to 100 and
then we'll do I'll do a Ram preview so
you can see what it looks like let's do
it like that
all right
now it's kind of like it's writing on
the letters in a weird way so there is
there is a way to fix this and I'll
pause the RAM preview and let's bring
our and to a hundred and I want to bring
my text back actually so I want to go to
there what's just I guess I just have to
write it again bring this back in back
to where it was
I'm gonna turn off my outlines here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
