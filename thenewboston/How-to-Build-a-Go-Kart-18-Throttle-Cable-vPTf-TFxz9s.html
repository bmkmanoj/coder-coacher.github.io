we can now install the throttle cable
now the throttle cable is pretty much a
long piece of water that connects to
your gas pedal all the way back to the
carburetor now the point on this wire is
what this does in the carburetor is it
controls a little door and that door
determines how much fuel is allowed into
the engine so what happens is the harder
you press this gas pedal the more the
door is going to be open in the
carburetor and the more fuel is going to
be allowed into your engine
the faster your engine is going to run
so let me go ahead and show you guys
what happens when I press down on this
gas pedal so go ahead and look at this
little number right here you see how I
move down that pretty much the basis for
I'll show you guys one more time as I
press down this wire is going to move
and of course right now it's just moving
in my hand but once it's attached to the
cob carburetor throttle it's going to
open that valve more allow more fuel to
the engine so I'm going to show you guys
how to install this right now now the
first thing we have to concentrate on is
routing the cable to the carburetor so
of course it starts here this is the gas
pedal right here and I routed this cable
it's that black cable right there all
the way along the side of the frame see
if you guys can keep an eye on that the
whole time and there's actually these
clamps on the side of the frame that you
can use for your brake lines I also use
them for my throttle cable two for one
kill two birds with one stone so my
throttle cable goes right along there
and it ends up right here so as you can
see when you get to the end of your
throttle cable cable it has a little I
don't know kind of gold-copper looking
bracket on it now this bracket my camera
doesn't want to focus today this bracket
has two holes in it and these holes are
for the screws that attach it to the
carburetor so these two holes right here
and we need to try to get a good angle
without banging on my camera are going
to attach right here one right here and
one right here and that's going to
secure it to the carburetor which is
this thing right here now this little
nub on
the end of it is going to be tied to
your throttle on the carburetor which is
right here so this is pretty much the
door I was talking about the more this
uh throttle opens or twist the more gas
is going to be delivered to your engine
inside here there's a little door that
you can't see and the more you twist
this the more that door is opening so
now let me go ahead and show you guys
how to mount it on the carburetor and
also how to attach the throttle cable to
the throttle valve on the carburetor so
like I said now what you want to do is
take the bracket from your throttle
cable and use those two screws that came
from the carburetor to mount it on see
if I can do this so now it's nice and
secure on the carburetor but it doesn't
do anything in if this cable wants to
pull because you stepped on the gas
pedal
it would just pull and it wouldn't do
anything what you need to do is you need
to hook it up to the throttle valve on
your carburetor now like I said before
right now this just looks like a boring
thing that spins but inside your
carburetor all of the fuel and air
mixture all the combustible stuff is in
here
now in order to get to your engine it
has to pass through a door now the door
is actually this spring-loaded thing
right here the more twist the more that
door is going to open therefore the more
fuel is going to get to your engine so
how do you put this on it's really easy
go ahead and stick this little nub in
first right on the top and then go ahead
and wrap it around just like that now
whenever you step on the gas this cable
is going to tighten and pull and it's
going to spin just like that
letting fuel mixture into the engine so
let me go ahead and step on the gas
pedal right now and see if it works now
here I am stuffing on the gas pedal and
it looks like we did a pretty good job
now again if you want to adjust the
tension on the wire again if it's too
loose where it isn't
at all or if it's too tight works like
right here by default and you can only
get that much claimant what you can do
is you can adjust it at the gas pedal or
right here and obviously this is pretty
easy to adjust I don't need the
you guys through heaven just that now
the only other thing I want to talk to
you guys about is this thing right here
there's a screw right here and as you
can see when we try to take my stand
block whenever you release your foot
from the gas pedal right now I have no
pressure on the gas pedal this is what
your engine is going to run idle pretty
much as soon as you start your engine
without even pressing the guess at all
this is where your engine is going to go
it's going to release a little bit of
fuel into the engine now if your engine
seems to putter out sometimes when you
start it or it's really hard to get it
started what you want to do is you want
to adjust the throttle speed right here
which is pretty much the default speed
of your engine the default amount fuel
that's getting into your engine and
burning and if whenever you start your
engine is a great enlike sounds like
you're about to floor it well then you
want to take a little bit of throttle
off so this screw right here is your
throttle speed so that's how you just
said so with that being said
congratulations we now successfully
installed our throttle cable I don't
know what's next but uh I'm pretty
excited</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
