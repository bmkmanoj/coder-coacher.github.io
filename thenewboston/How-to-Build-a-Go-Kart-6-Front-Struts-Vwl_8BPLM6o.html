strip now the psycho strat is called a
McPherson strut and of course the strut
you guys can probably already tell what
it does just by looking at it it kind of
acts as a shock absorber it's pretty
much a spring a McPherson strut the
reason they call it this is because I
think some value McPherson came up with
it it's a combination of kind of two
different systems a lot of coil spring
which is this yellow thing and also a
piston or something just call it a
cylinder that's inside this yellow part
that moves up and down so really easy
again some people call it a shock
absorber a strategist a specific type of
shock absorber so now that you know what
it is let's go ahead and put it on go
ahead first bolt on the top in the way
it goes on is a bolts through here on
top in here on bottom so let me do that
right now and I want to show you guys
that crowd or a problem that we're going
to have so we'll go to on top screw it
on real quick
good to go so then we go ok now I'm
going to bolt it on bottom
but look the strut is too long so we
have a couple options here first what we
can do is they sell this tool called a
strut compression tool and what it does
is it takes these coils and pinches them
together so whenever they pinch together
the piston pin pretty much shortened or
that little cylinder can go back into
the piston so then you're pretty much
your entire structure ins but I'm
guessing that a lot of you guys whenever
you're boating go-karts you're not going
to have a strut compression tool so what
you can do is this instead of squeezing
this coil together because you can't by
hand no matter how strong mark what you
can do is you can just go ahead and
the top arm of your suspension and
whatever you do make sure you grab onto
the bottom because this is going to drop
down just go ahead and temporarily
loosen this just let it fall down and
now your arm is going to sway be able to
sway and meet your strut exactly where
it needs to be so go ahead and bolt the
bottom on so now the only thing that you
have to do is of course put your knuckle
back into place and I are sure you guys
have to do that and once you're done
with that do the exact same thing to the
other side and that's it your front
suspension is good to go you're ready to
move on to the next part all right guys
check it out our front suspension system
is now complete both sides have the
struts up I actually did that one before
and they also got both suspension arms
and the wheel assembly the steering
knuckle there we go so now what we can
do is actually hook up the steering
which of course consists of the steering
wheel and you know the brakes and well
we got a lot to go we've got a long ways
to go but we're getting there looking
good so far so congratulations and we'll
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
