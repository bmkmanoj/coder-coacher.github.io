tutorial in Adobe Dreamweaver these
tutorials are going to teach you
everything you need to know about
Dreamweaver inside and out to the basic
stuff that a pretty advanced stuff and
what your remover is is one of the best
editing programs that you can get when
you want to build a website and as you
open that everything looks all pretty
confusing when you're just starting out
so in this tutorial we're just going to
begin to find our way around Dreamweaver
a little bit and the first biggest part
of Dreamweaver you notice is called the
the document window window that's this
big white space right here anything you
type right here create in here is going
to be in the body of your website next
section you want to take note of is the
title bar that's these little tabs right
here that and this one's untitled one
and this tells you what file you're
working on right now as you can see
we're working on one called untitled in
the next part of Dreamweaver you want to
take note on it's called the document
toolbar the three main things you need
to know about this is the different
views code which allows you to type code
for your website design which allows you
to just the put
what-you-see-is-what-you-get and
whatever you type in here under design
that's what it's actually going to look
like or split where you can see the code
up here and see what it's going to look
like down here for the most part we're
going to be working in the design view
and right under here is the title of
your website whatever you type in here
that's going to become the title and
that's how you change it
and down here is called the status bar
this tells you some basic information
about your website allows you to zoom in
and out and also tells you the size of
your website and over here is a tag
selector if you're familiar with XHTML
or HTML you can see what tag you're
using right there so next we want to
take a look at the insert bar this is
the main bar at the top as you can see
you can expand it or contract it by
clicking this little arrow and the
insert bar has many different subjects
to it right now we're under the common
subject or common tab and this allows
you to make many things that you would
commonly use in a website like images
and anchor tags and the layout is for
the basic layout and you can put your
div tags and other CSS elements in here
that we'll get to later the forms tag is
for forms the data is mostly for if
you're making a website that's going to
include a database
here is any of the Spry elements that
we'll talk about more later and this
text tab is for formatting text and in
your favorite tab you can right-click
and customize any common ones that you
use often so let's say you use one from
text and one from forums then you can
put all those under your favorites and
you can customize it and the next thing
I want to talk about is the property
inspector at the bottom of your screen
now what the property inspector is is
essentially any attributes that you can
apply to the tag you apply them right
here so as you can see the only tag we
have right here is the body tag so any
attributes such as background color that
you could apply to your body you would
apply right here this changes with each
tag you're working on now the last thing
I'm going to talk about right now are
these panels over here these are some of
the most important things and you can
contract our expand and expand it by
clicking this arrow right there
or pull it back by clicking this arrow
right there now as you see we have four
panels open right now by default but
there are many more you can also move
these around and order them from top to
bottom however you like
you can also if you get stuck or if you
like a layout or if you just want to go
back to the default layout click on
Windows workspace layout and this will
give you all the layouts that it has by
default so that's all the time we have
for right now and this was a very basic
tutorial and now that we know the layout
in the next tutorial we're excellent
actually going to begin making our very
first web site in Dreamweaver and if you
didn't catch everything you can go to my
