your ninth you decayed soil and in this
tutorial I made teaching you guys had to
change the shape and size of your red
builder brush right here so I know what
you guys are saying alright bucket you
already taught me that like two
tutorials ago any time you want to
change the size of it just go to the
scaling motor right here and stretch it
to make it bigger or smaller or if you
want to stretch it in one direction
select this mode yeah I doubt it well
that's great you know and you can do
that but any time you want to get a
precision exact size it's not the best
way to do so in order to change the
shape and size of this red builder brush
what we're gonna want to do is select
the shape we want I'm gonna be working
with the cube in this tutorial and right
click right here whenever we right click
it our options menu is going to pop up
and it allows us to change the size to
get an exact specific size now let me go
ahead and change this say I'm building a
game and I want to give my user or the
player four to walk around on well let's
go ahead and change the size at 1024 by
1024 by 16 or something that's gonna
give us a nice flat floor right there so
let's go ahead and click CSG ad to
actually add some mass and give us four
pretty cool huh so with that being said
let me say this before I jump into
anything else I want to tell you guys
why I decided to choose those numbers I
mean 1024 and 16 sound like pretty
random numbers right well check this out
anytime we're working outside the
perspective view let me see these graphs
right here see these little check boxes
right here whether they aren't just
there for the fun of it they actually
symbolize units now you can change what
unit they show by changing the size of
your drag grid you can change it to
something small like two and then you
have small little boxes or something big
like 64 and then you get big boxes just
like that so basically we want to choose
a number that corresponds with the graph
because that way whenever we're lining
stuff up we can precision it exactly how
we wanted to
pretty cool huh so let me go ahead and
zoom out here and show you guys that if
I chose a number like a thousand or five
hundred then it wouldn't go into this
graph evenly and it wouldn't line up
with the edges so that's why depending
on what size of your graph is you want
to choose numbers that correspond with
that so that being said let me move on
now for the next part of this tutorial
I'm gonna create another shape because
it's probably gonna be easier to see so
let me go ahead and right click my red
bow to brush and change it back to let
me go ahead and change it everything to
512 so we get a nice square cube and
click this and let me go ahead and just
move this around let me move it around
so it actually just sits right on top
and actually move it around a little bit
like right there or something now let me
go ahead and build this and as you can
see we basically get a cube on a flat
sheet right here now let me go ahead and
actually move my red builder brush out
of the way just move that right out of
the way and I want to talk to you guys
about these two different modes now I
know before and it was probably for
tutorials ago or five or something I
told you guys that brush wireframe and
wireframe Mon were pretty similar
similar I mean but they were different
in one different way now is the time
that we can cover that let's go ahead
and switch the brush wireframe mode in
your perspective view and as you can see
kind of as expected everything turns
this wireframe mode okay that makes
sense
brush wireframe mode turn my brushes to
wireframe mode simple enough so now
you're saying aren't right when I click
this is probably going to look pretty
much the same
well wireframe mode changes everything
to polygons and we can't edit everything
check it out we can't move this stuff
around now let me explain you guys
what's going on brush wireframe mode
changes everything to wireframe
specifically your brushes wireframe mode
this one right here only changes meshes
and I know I didn't talk to you guys
about what meshes static meshes
different types of meshes but in
upcoming tutorials we're gonna be
learning about these things called
meshes and what this mode does is it
only changes your meshes to wireframe so
these brushes right here are not meshes
so that's why it does not put those in
wireframe bone and by the way just a
quick little tutorial what's going on
right here is what your computer is
doing is it changes all these shapes to
polygons because whenever your computer
sees 3d it doesn't really see 3d like
you and me see 3d it has to change
everything into polygons first and then
that's how it sees 3d so you know that's
just a nice little side note you don't
even have to remember that really
because your computer takes care of all
that but that's the basics difference
between but brush wireframe and
wireframe so with that being said let me
go ahead and get a new document out or
new level new scene whatever you want to
call it and I want to talk to you guys
lastly about something called brush
order now before I do that let me say
this look at our world right now it's
black it's empty it's the beginning of
time nothing is there at all
so say we wanted to go ahead and create
a subtractive brush we would go ahead
and hit this and now if we go ahead and
move our red brush builder out of the
way we can see in this top view or
seemingly this front view right here in
the top view in the side view that we
get a subtractive brush basically what
we're saying is this okay you decay we
have a universe where nothing is six
nothing exists there we go can't talk
today so we're basically telling you to
take nothing away from nothing so what
we have left with is nothing so we kind
of are left where we started from so now
let's go ahead and you know this
universe is getting kind of bland so in
our front view let's go ahead and move
this over and you know move it over just
to take a nice little chunk out of it so
now let's go ahead and whenever we add
something you're saying Ari well let me
change this back to lit mode so as you
can see in our world right here this may
look a little different than you
expected because if I took my red Bota
brush and
moved out of the way look what's going
on in this front of you right here first
we have this additive brush right here
which adds mass but we have this
subtractive brush overlaying it so it
might be a better view from down here so
basically you're saying alright Bucky
how come if you have the additive brush
right here which means add mash add mass
and you have a subtractive brush right
here which means take away mass it's not
taken away the mass so first thing
you're gonna say is this alright Bucky
you didn't fool me you told me in the
last tutorial anytime you want to update
your geometry you need to rebuild it so
if I rebuild this geometry then you
should see a chunk taken out of this so
let's go ahead and rebuild it ok it's
rebuilt hmm no chunk being taken out
still kind of weird well the reason that
there is not a chunk being taken out of
our mass is because of this it has to do
with brush order the very first thing we
did is we built an empty space and then
we added mass to it so therefore we have
our entire mass right here before in the
last tutorial what I did is I built a
chunk of mass and then I was able to
take something away from it so it has to
do with how you order your brushes again
if you have an empty space and you add a
block of wood to it you're gonna have
that block of wood that's what we did in
this tutorial however if we have a block
of wood and then we take out a chunk
from it we're gonna have a block of wood
with the chunk taken away do you get
what I'm trying to say it has to deal
with the order of your brushes so if
you're not getting your results this is
the case so you're saying all right
that's what brush order is how do we
change the order of our brushes well
what we want to do is we want to say
this alright we want to build this
additive brush first though this chunk
of mass first and what we want to do is
we want to build the subtractive brush
to last instead of building it first
like we just did so in order to do that
go ahead and right-click your
subtractive brush and go ahead and let
me see if I can find order go ahead and
put order to last now instead of the UDK
building the subtractive brush first
to build it last now whenever we rebuild
our jam tree check it out it's gonna
build this mass first and then it's
gonna take a chunk away from it instead
of you know just creating a void empty
space and adding a chunk to it
it's going to create the chunk first and
then take space away from it so that's
your basics of brush order I know it's
kind of weird to twist around your head
you know adding nothing to nothing than
something to nothing then something from
nothing but but that's the basics of it
if you're not getting your results
change your brush order so that's all I
want to talk to you guys about in this
story how to change the size of your
brushes how you can change your size
your brushes depending on what grid size
you're working with and also difference
between brush wireframe and wireframe
mode and lastly your brush order so with
that being said we're ready to move on
to the next topic so thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
