Robertson welcome to very first tutorial
in Wi-Fi wireless security now in this
tutorial series I'm going to be teaching
you guys a whole bunch of stuff related
to Wi-Fi security and I'll show you guys
how to do a bunch of awesome things like
view people's traffic how to crack Wi-Fi
keys how to boot people off the internet
which is always fun and I'll even show
you guys how to create a fake access
point so anyone trying to get on the
internet they're actually going to
connect to you your computer instead of
the router that they were trying to
connect to and we can have a whole bunch
of fun with that however before we begin
I need to give you guys a little
disclaimer
whenever you're following along with
these tutorials and doing the stuff that
I'm going to be showing you you need to
have permission for the network so if
it's your own network or let's say a
company hired you to you know review
their network make sure that you have
written permission if you don't own it
and the reason for that is because a lot
of the stuff is illegal if you just like
walk into a Starbucks or a library and
start looking at people's traffic that's
illegal and you can go to jail and well
you will go to jail for it so this is
oriole series is for people who are
genuinely interested in networking
security or if you want to become a pen
tester or if you're just you know maybe
a parent and you want to see what
websites your kids are going to because
you think they may be talking to some
creepy dudes online or whatever so again
make sure that this is your own network
no one else's or you have written
permission from a company or whoever
hired you and yeah now you're ready to
move on so to get started with Wi-Fi
security you need two things the first
thing is a distribution of Linux a lot
of the features other operating systems
like Windows and OS 10 they block but
Linux is completely open-source we're
going to have complete control over it
and the distribution that I'm going to
recommend any distribution of Linux is
going to work but I'm going to recommend
kali linux
now the reason that I'm going to
recommend this is because it already has
about 90% of the tools that we're going
to use pre-installed so they're already
built right into the distribution so we
don't have to waste time you know
learning how to install it and configure
it correctly that's you know one of the
awesome points about Kali I love it
download it and I should probably
mention this as well in order to follow
along with these tutorials you need a
basic understanding of Linux and
networking now you don't have to be like
a systems administrator by any means so
if you just go watch my Linux tutorials
in my networking tutorials then that's
going to give you a nice solid
foundation and teach you guys all the
basics and once you have a solid grasp
on everything then you're ready to move
back in to these tutorials so I'm not
going to be covering the basics of Linux
or networking so that's why I said that
so anyways once you have any
distribution of Linux preferably Kali
installed or you can run it from a
virtual machine doesn't matter the next
thing you need is a wireless adapter now
I'm guessing that you already have a
wireless card or a wireless adapter same
thing in your laptop but whenever you're
follow along with these videos you may
notice that some things don't work
exactly how you'd like and that's
because you can't just use any wireless
adapter because you need to be able to
do specific things so the things we want
our wireless card to do are special
things like monitor mode packet
injections as you can see right here and
we'll learn exactly what those are later
on but basically I'll give you guys a
real brief overview so whenever you
connect to the internet on your laptop
in every normal day life your laptop is
only designed for your own conversation
you and the computer whatever server
you're going to online so if your
Starbucks and you know people around you
were going to Instagram the New Boston
comm YouTube whatever your computer
whenever it sees that traffic that Wi-Fi
it just ignores it and that's great
however we actually want to do things
like look at that traffic so not all
water
this cards were designed for this and
you need a wireless card with a specific
chipset so if you guys want to go ahead
and learn about chipsets and all that
basically the electronics inside your
card that make it perform the way it
does then you can do that however if you
guys just want to get up and running
real quick then go to this website right
here and I just found this today and
this gives you a list of wireless
adapters that are not only compatible
with Linux but they have the chipsets
that you need to perform all of the
stuff that we're going to do so go ahead
and pick one of these in these are USB
ones so you don't have to actually open
your laptop like next to the battery and
hard drive and install anything you just
buy it plug it in to your computer and
you're good to go so I am going to be
using this one I had this one for a
while I love it it's 12 bucks tp-link
this is the model number and again it's
just a USB one boom boo-boom plug it in
and you can connect to wireless networks
another famous one
while it's famous among the Wi-Fi you
know security community not really
famous but it's this one right here so
this is an alpha and I have this one too
and I use it for I have this weird
antenna but this is the model number of
that but if you just want to look online
look at reviews make sure you find one
that's compatible with Kali Linux and I
prefer USB one since there are a lot
easier you don't got to install them but
yeah there you go so that's all you need
to get up and running those two things
and once you have those you're ready to
move on to my next video so see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
