another Photoshop cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and today
I'm going to teach you another way of
adjusting the masks on your adjustment
and layers using selections it's really
easy and photo Photoshop automate some
of it for you so it's really fast as
well and if you can get a good selection
out of your image then it's the faster
way to do it besides painting your masks
in so what we're going to do is make
sure you have an image any image
preferably one where you can get a good
selection out of it and then that's all
you need actually so you don't even have
to have any of these on so you don't
have to have any extra adjustment layers
because when we create our adjustment
layer the mask is going to be already
created for us so let's go ahead and
make a selection now I've already messed
with this a little bit and I found out
that if I had my magic wand tool and I
set my tolerance to 75 I'm able to get a
decent selection from the sky and if I
just add a little bit more in using
shift I can add a get the whole entire
sky in there and then and then you can
always come in with your paintbrush tool
later on and get these finer areas that
have been added as well so I have this
selection made now all I need to do is
go ahead and just create a new
adjustment layer so I'm going to click
on this and go to create my adjustment
layer I'll just you can click on any one
you want I'm just going to click on
hewitt saturation and now you can see
that a mask is created with your
selection already on there and let's
adjust my saturation I'll just jack this
way up or something like that well
that's way too much obviously but what's
a make it dark or something like that
but you can see now that only the sky is
being affected so now it looks like it's
been storming out
and maybe that's a kind of lucky Bengal
you wanted to go for so that's how you
create a mask or create an adjustment
layer with a mask already created and
that's by using your selection tools now
you don't have to use just a magic wand
any selection tool work so to refine
this pretty much all you're going to do
is select your paint brush make sure
your selected onto your mask here and
make sure you have the right color
selected so I'm going to want white
because I want to get rid of this stuff
so I didn't select my paint brush make
my paintbrush a little smaller and zoom
in there we go and then I could just
paint this back on oh I have it the
wrong way I should have had it on black
so this should black paint this right
off there we go and basically you get
the idea how the you can paint the mask
off or on where it is needed so if you
don't know about painting on masks check
the previous tutorial tutorial which i
think is tutorial 72 and look at how I
taught how to use the paintbrush tool to
paint off and paint on masks something
else that I thought was pretty cool
was the ability to use filters to on
your masks to soften them up or whatever
you need to do so what I'm going to do
I'm just going to zoom back out and
we're going to put a filter on this and
I'm just going to select the blur filter
filter blur and then i'll just go to
gaussian blur because that's a strong
blur and you can see already that the
edges here have been blurred a little
kind of like they've been feathered in
fact keep on going like that you can
apply these filters here and it'll
affect the mask and how how it's a
blurred
you look at the actual mask thumbnail
here you can see that it gets more
blurred as I increase the blur and if I
back off it becomes more crisp so that's
just something I wanted to show you
extra that I thought was pretty cool and
that's all I'm going to show for this
tutorial we're going to get into all
these different filters pretty soon in
the next few tutorials and I'll just go
over a bunch of them for you and and I'm
sure everybody is looking forward to
that stuff because filters are one of
the most popular things that people like
to learn about because they can make
some really cool looking images so I'll
see you guys in those tutorials thanks
for watching and check out all the other
tutorials on Bucky's room org so that
they're all in one space for you thanks
a lot have a good one everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
