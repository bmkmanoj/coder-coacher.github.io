Blackford here with a Photoshop cs6
tutorial about working with panels today
and I'm going to go over the different
types of panels that we have and where
they are and just how to use them to the
fullest extent so all our panels are
pretty much going to be over here on the
right and we can add panels and subtract
panels and they have different options
so the first thing we want to do to add
different panels is we can either click
on these tabs like this to switch
between the different panels that are
are not showing like this and there's
there's panels in each of these sections
here or we can come up here to to the
options up here to window and then we
can add some of the panels here that we
haven't that aren't seen yet
like I'll add in this one that says
notes since that one's not up there yet
and there's the notes panel I can bring
this note panel and I can drag it into
one of these other panels if I would
like so that's how you do that now when
I open up my notes panel a layer comp
just came with it
that's because the notes panel was in
this section right here I'm going to
drag it back to where it was so as you
can see some of these sections here are
there to hide the different panels so
that you don't have a bunch of them in
your way so this one will be the
paragraph panel and if I click on that I
get my character and paragraph and there
in this general area right here then
we've got our actions and our history
here
now if we want to get rid of the panels
you can either close and hide them like
by clicking on this double arrow button
right here and that will close and hide
them or to get rid of them from the view
completely click on it and drag on to
your area here and then we'll get the X
button right here where you can click on
that and it'll totally delete it out of
the out of your view so when I go to
open this again it's not going to be
there so what we're going to have to do
to bring it back is go back into window
and now one that we deleted was called
history click on that again it'll show
up again and we can just drag it back in
there if you want to if you're working
in Photoshop and you don't want any of
these panels to be in the way or
anything like that you just need to work
on whatever your this whatever the image
is or whatever you have in your canvas
then you can press tab on your keyboard
and click on it and that will put
everything away so you have a bigger
work area so that's pretty nice
something that I find pretty useful that
I like to turn on that is and on the by
default in a Photoshop is when I click
on one of these panels to bring them out
here like this sometimes they're in the
way of what I'm trying to work on and if
I click off they don't automatically go
away but there is a way to make the
panels automatically go away so click on
the panel that you have make sure and
then right click on it and click on
auto-collapse iconic panels and if I
click on that and then I go to cook off
to work on this it'll automatically
collapse and you won't have to work on
it anymore or you won't have to have it
in your way anymore so that's pretty
useful in my opinion and the last thing
that I want to show you about is the
options menu on the panels so each panel
has one of these option menus over here
to the right of them and even on the
ones that you can pull out so here's the
entire options menu and they all have
some different types of options to them
so if I go to color here and go to these
option menus they're all different so
I'm not going to go over every single
option menu but you do have the option
to close and close it which deletes it
out of there
and if you need to bring it back come
back to your window and click on it and
you have the option to close the entire
tab group so that's all the way down at
the bottom so each of these different
panels has a bunch of different options
to it that you can mess run with and
then I'll get into some of those options
for most of the panels in later
tutorials after we get go over the
basics of Photoshop so that's a pretty
much I wanted to go over with you with
about panels just remember that you can
click and drag to rearrange your panels
and you can open up new panels clicking
by clicking on window and clicking on
any of these here to bring up the panel
that you want to look at so and it'll
automatically switch to it even if it is
up here so thanks for watching this
tutorial and I look forward to seeing
you guys at more Photoshop tutorials
have a good one everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
