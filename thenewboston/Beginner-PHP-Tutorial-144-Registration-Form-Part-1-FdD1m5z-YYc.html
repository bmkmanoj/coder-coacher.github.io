with another video for the new Boston in
this part of the user login registration
tutorial we're going to be looking at
registering a user because obviously
what we've done is we've created our
database here and we'll create our table
and we've given it this data so we've
got Alex and Billy were two records
inside now we will obviously want to let
the user register for themselves and
this is going to be a simple process
we're not going to be talking about
including emailing the user to tell them
that they're registered we're just going
to be inserting the data through a form
so let's create a new file and let's
save this as register dot PHP now the
first thing that we want to do is
obviously require in the files that we
need so we've got court or Inc dot PHP
which is important because what we're
first of all doing is we are oh no sorry
called mmm we need to include that yeah
we do because we've got the logged in
here yep okay so we've also got that's
fine yep so what we need to do is in
register dot PHP include this we need to
say if not logged in we need to register
the user otherwise if the user is logged
in so else logged in
you're already registered and logged in
so we're essentially just creating a
check let's just put an escape character
there to get rid of that to make sure
this is processed this sir in single
quotation mark we need to first of all
check if the users not logged in before
we register them so otherwise we can say
register okay so let's go to our browser
and test this we're already logged in as
Billy so let's go to register dot PHP
and see what it says right so if not oat
sorry you've got the parentheses on that
there so let's refresh Oh No okay now I
say we've got else if there okay so a
couple of mistakes down my part
okay so let's refresh you're already
registered and logged in so now what
happens if we go back to index dot PHP
and we click on the logout button
we've now logged out and presented back
with our foot our login form let's go
again to register dot PHP and we're
given the option to register so let's
escape out of PHP first of all to create
our form we don't want to be echoing our
whole registration form because that
could get too much data that we need to
echo out and it's going to start to look
messy and it's going to slow our page
down particularly if we've got a lot of
HTML to output so I'm just going to end
PHP there and start up a tag again there
so our if statement block here to here
is still going to work even though we're
escaping out and then back into PHP so
let's just demonstrate that by writing
register form just as an example let's
refresh and you can see that even though
we've escaped out of PHP we can still
process
HTML here so it's almost as if you were
writing echo so let's begin to build our
form up so we are creating the outline
of our form then we'll fill in all the
properties so the action we're going to
be we're going to be going back to
register dot PHP so register dot PHP and
the method is going to be post because
remember we're going to be sending quite
a lot of data we don't want it to come
up in the URL bar as get posted
information so let's M complete our form
the necessary files wind up sorry fields
we need to include so the first one will
be username we can break down now say
input type equals text if I will keep
this on one line just to keep things
simple a name equals username ok break
down a couple of times obviously you can
use better HTML make it look a lot
better
maybe use some CSS to format the style
of everything but for now I'm just
keeping it very simple so we can focus
on the PHP side of things so password we
want to input type equals password name
equals password and we want to break
down once again now what we need to do
is we're going to duplicate this and
we're going to say password let's just
put our colon in the password again okay
so we want to ask the user to enter a
password again so I'm going to read I'm
going to name this field password
underscore again now what we want to do
is we want to ask for their first name
and input type equals text name equals
first-name want to break down a couple
more and we want to ask for their
surname and code on there so you can
build the form how you like you don't
need to do it like me and make it look
you know messy or anything like that and
obviously the last element we need of
this form is the input or the submit
button rather so submit and we're going
to say name or no not name value equals
register okay so we've got a
registration button there so let's come
preview our page let's refresh the page
okay so we've got this basic form
separated down doesn't look very nice
but we're going to make it do its job so
we are going to require all fields we've
got user name we've got password
password again first name is surname
now these are a few things that we need
to do in this process we need to check
if the username already exists in the
database that's important because we
don't to register a user with the same
username we need to check the password
here against the password that's retype
to make sure it matches because
obviously we can't see the password that
we're typing in so if the user was to
accidentally type say an extra character
on the end they might not be able to
immediately see that so they might not
remember their password I don't know
what their password is and we've got
first name and surname we click register
this data is transferred and it goes
into the database okay so that's what we
need to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
