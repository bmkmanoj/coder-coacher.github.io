to start a series of how to handle forms
and how to deal with PHP in my sequel
and apache all in your local machine
without having to have your own website
our domain name you can test all this
stuff locally we're going to be using
only PHP and we're not going to be using
like cold fusion or ASP or anything like
that mainly because PHP and my sequel
and apache are free anybody can install
them on their machine and this and this
has tutorials are going to be using the
Windows version well there's this is the
windows version and the mac OS x and
linux version of the same thing but it's
just a little bit different when you
install it but luckily we have something
called wimp which stands for windows
apache my sequel and PHP and it is all
compiled into an executable that you can
go download yourself and that is what
we're going to do first so it's as easy
as going to wamp server calm and
clicking on download and go down here
and you see this wamp server 2 point 0
go there and you click on that download
this executable save it I've already
saved it I've already I've already done
this but I'm just showing you how to get
to the place that you need to get to and
so you Dylan the executable and it's as
easy as writing the executable and I
think there's one thing that you have to
fill out whenever you you run it but it
will install my sequel PHP Apache
into it it'll do all that for you so
easily so once you do that you will have
your localhost set up and you're going
to need to start it so you're going to
go down here and click on start all
services and you can see that it has a
few options here that you can go check
out and for the meantime we're not going
to worry about those everything that we
need is installed on the initial install
so I'm just going to run through a few
things as far as what is what is going
to be useful to us we're going to be
using PHP myadmin to administrate our my
sequel database and we are also going to
be using this folder right here this www
folder which is going to be inside your
install phone in your web install folder
which is going to be in your local disk
or in your C Drive it's going to be on
the root level of your c drive so you
double click on wamp you double click on
ww and you can see that there's already
index PHP script inside of the WWF older
and what that is is the starter or the
pointer file for your your ww folder so
when you go to local host after you've
already after you've gone on here and
you've started all services this is the
page that's going to pop up and we can
actually go and see what this page looks
like inside of Dreamweaver I'm going to
go to open and then I'm going to go to
see dr lamp wwn index
and go check out the code and you can
see there are some PHP things going on
right here and as I mean in the meantime
you know we don't need to worry about
all this stuff because we are going to
create our own PHP files to start
handling some forms so now that you have
wamp install we are ready to continue on
to the next tutorial and we're ready to
start working with some server side code
start with some form handling and I know
that some of you guys have been asking
for this so looking forward to showing
you guys how to do it so make sure you
guys stay stay tuned and I'll see you in
the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
