Effects tutorial and this is a
continuation of tutorial number four I
was running out of time so um as we are
just picking off from the last one I
promise you guys I'm going to show you
guys what these things are these little
dots and I'm going to show you guys how
to use the pen tool to create keyframes
what these little dots are right here
are is the motion of your path your
motion path so if you want to change the
curviness
of this or how straight it is you need
to click these little handles and you
can go ahead and drag them now these
little handles act independently of one
another so you can go ahead and um
adjust I don't know it's called
straightness of your path by moving it
in a circular motion or you can just
adjust the curviness of your path by
pulling it in or out so the best way to
learn from those is the just play with
them and another thing I want to go over
these big squares right here these are
your key frames and these little dots
right here those are just your regular
frames these regular frames you can't
really change these keyframes are the
main keys your main major frames in your
animation so these are the only ones
that you can change but what if you're
saying alright I want this salmon guy to
go right here I want to go to different
point right in the middle of here well
there is a way that you can do that to
do that you need to use the pen tool the
pen tool is very useful in adding and
subtracting keyframes to add a keyframe
hold down the pen tool and click add
vertex now as you can see your cursor
now change to a little pen tip with a
plus over it anytime you hover over the
motion path and click it automatically
creates a keyframe and from here you can
go back to your selection tool and move
this keyframe just like you could any
other key frame and of course to delete
that keyframe let me show you guys what
this does real quick remember that we
had a Sammy just going in a big kind of
hump before now we have four keyframes
he's a surfin looks like he's riding the
wave or something so that's how we can
create additional keyframes on our
motion line now if we want to subtract
that keyframe or delete any keyframe we
just hover over the keyframe with a pen
delete vertex tool and click a keyframe
and it deletes that entire keyframe now
as you can see
Sammy's kind of jumping a little hump
right now so all in all that is how you
use the handles to adjust the curviness
and um hump of your path I guess it's
called Ariela no it's called and that is
also how you use the pen tool to create
additional and subtract keyframes from
your animation so again I hope you learn
something I hope you make sure you pay
attention how to adjust the path of your
moat of your animation and also make
sure you learn how to add and subtract
keyframes and once you learn that you
can move on to my next tutorial so I
hope you enjoyed watching and I'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
