numbers just like addition you start in
the ones place only you do it
subtraction so 9 minus 1 is 8 4-7 you
can do that so with the borrow from the
six make that a 5 make that a fourteen
14 minus seven is seven 5-8 cannot do
that we have to borrow from the five
again make that a 6 15 so 15-8 is seven
and six minus 1 is 5 so there's our
answer so over here 4-5 that's a borrow
from the five make that afore put the
one right there and making that a 14-5
is 9 4-7 cannot do it borrow from the to
make that a one-make that at 14-14 minus
7 is 7 1-6 with the borrow from the
eight make that seven make that 11 11-6
is five and seven minus three is four
over here with 6-7 borrow from the to
make that a 1 make that as 16 that's
going to be 9 16 minus 7 is 9 so it's a
borrow from the three make that to make
that 11 so 11-8 is 32 miles for can't do
it the bar from the seven make that a
six and that's going to be 12 minus four
is eight and then six minus 3 is 3 so
over here 3-8 borrow from the four make
that a 3 make that a 13 so eight nine
ten eleven twelve thirteen is five
3-7 can't do that the bra from the one
make that a zero make that thirteen 13-7
is 60 minus nine borrow from the nine
make that eight make that ten 10-9 is
one and eight minus 1 is 7 we're here to
minus seven need to borrow from the
three mega to make that a 12-7 7-12 is
our 12-7 is 52 minus eight can't do that
borrow from the five make that 4 12
minus a is for 4-6 can do is borrow from
the six make that of 5 mix out of 14
it's going to be 8 14 minus six is eight
five minus two is three those are
answers for those ones and when you get
good at placement you can do it
horizontally so 8 minus to make sure you
go from left to right 8-2 is six put the
six way over here and then 9-5 is 446
9-8 is one 6-7 can't do that with the
borrow from the six make that a 50 sorry
bar from the four make this 16 make that
of three so 16-7 is nine and we have
three minus two is 1 and then 1 minus
one is zero so you don't have to include
it you don't need to include any leading
zeroes it's very important to include
the following zeros
so 1-3 can't do that to borrow from the
to make that a one put the one right
there and that's going to be 8 1-4 can
do it to borrow from a set and make that
a 6 change that to and 11 and we have
seven 6-9 can't do that the bar from the
sixth make that of 516 it's gonna be
seven and five minus one is for and that
is our answer and that's all i have for
subtraction with whole numbers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
