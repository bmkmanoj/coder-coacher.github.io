now it's up to the developers to
actually make this thing look beautiful
however we pass it off of them and
they're like yeah I need to set up the
database but I don't like the command
line I want PHP my admin' I'm like hey
dude you talk funny but whatever we'll
give you a little visual PHP myadmin
if you want so in order to do that what
we need to do is we actually need to
install PHP myadmin
it's actually separate from just MySQL
or PHP so sudo apt-get install PHP
myadmin
hit enter password and do you want to
continue yes we'll take that memory all
right what is our webserver of course we
are running Apache - do we want to
configure our database for PHP myadmin
yes we do and now we need the databases
administrator password that we entered
earlier and if left blank we're gonna
password would be generated let's go
ahead and create our own
all right so PHP myadmin is installed a
couple other things we have to do though
clear that is I want to enable that PHP
five remember earlier when we installed
a package called PHP 5m crypt
that's the type of encryption that we
need to use with PHP so pseudo PHP 5 in
its en m OD m correct
so now all that did is enabled that
extension and one other issue I have I'm
not sure why this happens but the
phpMyAdmin configuration file is in the
wrong place so I have to copy it to a
new location so if you use sudo CP
stands for copy and then you give it et
Cie PHP myadmin Apache comp and the
other location is et Cie Apache to
enabled PHP my admin dot Kampf I could
type alright let me make sure I got all
this very and Apache Kampf a company
bola PHP looks good
hopefully all right now to test this out
we just need to restart Apache so sudo
service pachi to restart and after it
restarts in order to see if it works
correctly then we just got PHP myadmin
in the main directory we should see that
bad boy right there
so now instead of using my SQL through
the command line they can actually just
type root and we can give them the
password hit enter and check it out
no I don't want to save that we can now
visually see all of our databases we can
create them whenever we create them
they're gonna pop up right here on the
left hand side and yeah if you guys want
to actually know how to use this then if
you go to my MySQL tutorials I talked to
you about how to use MySQL
and PHP myadmin so there you go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
