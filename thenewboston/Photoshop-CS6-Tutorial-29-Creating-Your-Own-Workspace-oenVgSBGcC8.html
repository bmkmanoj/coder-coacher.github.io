Photoshop cs6 tutorial about customizing
your own workspace I'm your host buddy
Blackford and we can get started on
customizing our own workspaces
immediately so what a workspace is is
pretty much everything you see on your
Photoshop screen besides this middle
part here this is the canvas right in
the middle but all the stuff on the side
on the right will be like your will be
your workspace and even this stuff
around here you can rearrange things and
everything to create your own workspace
so the first thing I want to show you is
that there are already some preset
workspaces that you can work with and
there's two places to find them the
first way is over here in the window
drop down menu and then go to workspace
and then here is your different
workspaces here you can click on one and
it will go to it for you so this is the
workspace that is called new and cs6 and
you can tell what workspace you're on
over here on the right on the top right
and this will have the new things that
are at cs6 that you can like you can
check out for yourself now over here on
the top right you can also switch
quickly switch between your different
workspaces here and this is the more I
feel like this is a better area to go if
you want to go between your workspaces
real quick so you can pick something
like typography here and basically this
has all the stuff that you need for
typography if you're working in
Photoshop like that so let's create our
own workspace where we have whatever we
want so I'm going to switch back to
essentials real quick just so we can see
the different types of things that we
might want and click on this again and
go to new workspace and we're going to
name this whatever you want it and I'll
name my buddy's workspace and we got
this little section here panel locations
will be saved in this workspace keyboard
shortcuts and menus are optional so you
have the option to change up the
keyboard shortcuts and then like the
menus up here if you would like but I'm
not going to I'm just going to hit save
and you can make changes to the
workspace now and they will be saved so
if I just want to get rid of this color
one so I can close that tab close this
tab I'll just close a bunch of tabs and
then I'll add some more let's go to
what's a decent let's add actions tab in
here and history let's delete out
something was delete out that group but
I'm doing this by right-clicking and
click on close tab group and now I've
got like my own little workspace here if
I switch to back to essentials it'll
have everything else that I previously
had and isn't messed up or anything like
that I can go back to my workspace up
here at the top and it has all the
things that I created myself now if I
maybe I want to change this up a little
bit I've got this floating over here
maybe I want it like that instead of
along the side let's go back to
essentials it'll be back where it was in
the essentials 1 and in my workspace it
is over here just floating around now so
that's how that works out now to delete
a workspace we'll just come over here to
and click on delete workspace go to my
workspace and you can see that I can't
select it because I'm currently on that
workspace so we have to move to a
different workspace real quick so I hit
cancel
we'll go to the essentials here and now
let's go to the delete workspace and now
I'm able to delete buddies works plate
space delete it hit yes and now it's
gone now I don't have to worry about
that so if you're like sicko looking at
the new in cs6 workspace here you can
always delete it if you want to I mean
it's not it's not a really helpful one
but it just shows you what's what's new
so I like just using the essentials and
customizing my customizing the
essentials one two what I like now when
you make changes to a workspace it'll
stay how it is even if you exit out of
Photoshop it auto saves it for you so
that's how you create your own
workspaces fairly easy there um that's
uh I guess yeah that's all for that's
all for this tutorial I can't think of
anything else that would actually be in
there that we need to know well see you
guys in the next tutorial where we're
going to be talking about um let's see
creating like customized user interface
so that'll be pretty cool
see you guys in that tutorial goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
