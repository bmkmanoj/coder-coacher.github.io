61st tutorial and in this sorrow I'm
going to be talking about something
called template specialization
specialization there we go might take me
a few times to get it but basically what
template specialization is is it's a way
to make a class that has a different
implementation when a specific type is
passed into it for example if we made a
regular old template like before we
could pass any data type into it like
integers doubles characters and it's
going to be able to handle any of that
data well in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you guys say for example you
want to build a template to handle all
numbers but you want it to do something
a little different when it handled
characters because you know let's say
you wanted to build a class that handle
numbers and added them together well you
can't use all these same functions
whenever you're adding letters together
or else you're going to get a bunch of
error so it's basically a way of working
with a specific type of data in a
different way than you would regular so
let's go ahead and the first thing I'm
going to do is build a regular template
and I'm going to compare it to this new
specialized template so our boss came up
to us and he's like Bucky why is he
talking to us and only using my name I'm
not sure but he's a little weird
so he's like Bucky I wanted to build a
template to handle all types of data
however if the user passes in a
character which is this one specific
type of data I want you to work with it
in a different kind of way so one class
or one template is going to take
integers doubles floats any type of data
we pass in to it but whenever we pass it
in the character it's going to hand it a
little bit differently so after me
talking for two minutes it's finally
time to start coding so let's go ahead
and build a regular template and this is
named class T so remember T can be any
type of data and I'll just call this
class spunky because you know kind of in
the spunky kind of mood did anyone ever
used to watch Rocko's Modern Life
what was that dogs am I'm pretty sure it
was spunky but
let's go ahead and make a public and the
only thing I'm going to be making in
these classes is just a simple
constructor because I don't need to
demonstrate a whole lot I just need to
demonstrate the concept and you know not
build a huge functional class so in
order to make a constructor you of
course write the class name which is
spunky and pass in any type of data and
we'll name a variable X whenever we
first create an object so all we're
going to do is we're going to create a
class pass it an object and print it out
on the screen so see out X and then go
ahead and write something like is not a
character because we're going to be
passing in any type of data like a
number and it's going to make five is
not in a character or 6.17 is not a
character so this class is going to
handle everything
besides characters basically so let me
go ahead and make sure I got all my
semicolons in the right place and let's
go ahead and see a quick example right
now so actually I'll wait to show you
guys an example not yet I'll make you
guys wait so this is how we build a
basic template it can type take any type
of data we wanted to integers characters
floats doubles and it could say whatever
thing we passed in like J is not
character for is not a character eight
point seven six is not a character and
it's going to work fine with any type of
data that's the beauty of templates so
say whenever the user passes in a
character we want it to be able to do
something differently well that's where
template specialization comes in and in
order to do this go ahead and type
template with empty parameters right
there
or empty angle brackets this is the line
where we tell C++ we're going to be
using template specialization and in the
next line we're going to tell it what
type of data this class should handle so
this again we can name it the same class
as before because the main
implementation doesn't really change
it's only the data type in concept and
the class or excuse me
and you write your class name and in
between the ankle brackets after your
name you write what type of data should
this class handle all right this is a
special class that I want to handle
characters characters only nothing to do
with numbers or any other data type
anything like that this class is only
going to be four characters so again one
last time the only thing that's really
going to change is this line which tells
C++ we're going to be using template
specialization and this lat class that
says all right since you're using
template special it specialization what
type of data should that specialize in
and this class is going to specialize in
characters so let's go ahead and make
that constructor public and of course
it's the same spunky however in your
parameters after you don't write T X
because remember T is a generic data
type since this class is only four
characters go ahead and write character
right there and now the body is just
like before let's go ahead and copy this
copy right there and paste it right
there except um we can't have X is not a
character we can write X is indeed oops
no more explanation points indeed is
indeed a character so basically how our
program is going to work is this we're
going to be creating objects and we're
going to be creating objects of a bunch
of different types integers doubles
characters whenever our computer program
comes across the character it's going to
handle it with this specialized template
any other type of data besides character
it's going to go to this generic
template or generic class so you know
any numeric data such as integers
doubles floats yadda yadda yadda this is
going to handle it but once it sees it's
working with the character it's going to
handle this class right here so it's
going to be like 4 is not a character
8.0 is not a character but if we throw
in something like J or Z it's going to
say Z is indeed a character so don't
believe me well let me go ahead and
prove it to you guys so the first thing
I want to mention is I know I didn't
tell you guys this but you can
explicitly
well let me say this whenever we like
past in a data type before C++ already
automatically recognized what type of
data type that was but you can also do
something like this um you could throw
in your angle brackets data type right
after the class name and this helps C++
out and oh great there's a motorcycle
driving buddy right now and this helps
C++ out by it basically changes this to
T or it substitutes T for the data type
it's kind of just uh you know a nice
little hint for Objective C so let's go
ahead and make object one and since
we're going to be working with integers
we'll go ahead and we pass in seven so
now let's go ahead and copy this save us
some typing and now let's go create two
more objects so two and three and our
next object work a double and remember a
double is basically something that you
can use decimal points like three point
one five four and now for our third one
let's go ahead and use that character
and remember a character is just a
letter so arm Q or something like that
so basically what's going to happen is
this it's going to come across this
ceases working with integers and use
this generic template right here when it
gets the here is going to be working
with doubles and it's going to use this
generic template right here when it
comes across this is going to be working
with characters and it's going to say
hold on a second you have a special
class right here just made for working
with characters so on this one I'm going
to print queue is indeed a character so
let's go ahead and build to run this if
I forgotten I semicolons and it looks
good so seven is not a character seven
our excuse me three point one five four
is not a character Q is indeed a
character so as you can see these first
two lines right here usually use the
generic template class and the last one
whenever we had a character in there it
used that specialized character template
class so there you can see the beauty of
specialized excuse me they're called
template specialization so there you go
it's basically a specialization with one
data type in other word you
have a different implementation when a
specific data type is passed in in this
case character so there you go I hope
you understand it if you don't just go
ahead and ask me on my forum or leave a
comment below and I'll try to answer it
for you guys so thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe to my
channel and I'll see you guys in the
