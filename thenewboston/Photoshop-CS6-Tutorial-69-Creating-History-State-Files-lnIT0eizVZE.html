welcome to another Photoshop cs6
tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and today
we're gonna start talking about how to
save and review a history state text
file and what that really does is it
creates a file that Photoshop has
already created for you and you can save
it out every time you do some changes to
your changes to your document it'll
it'll save that stuff out so you can
easily go back and review it later the
reasons why you might want to try
something like this is to retrace the
steps you took to produce a particular
design so for example you're working on
something in Photoshop you're not really
sure what you're really doing but in the
end it comes out awesome you're like wow
how did I do that
so you go to like write down what you
did so you can recreate it later but you
always but when that happens sometimes
you like forget steps and stuff like
that but well if you save out your art
history file or your history state file
then you can look at it and it'll tell
you the different steps and one of the
awesome things about it also is that it
keeps time stamps on there and the time
stamps are good for giving to your
clients and things like that sometimes
clients won't believe you that you
worked on something for such-and-such
hours and they'll give you a hard time
all you got to do is print off the
history text file and give it to them
and be like hey this is what it was that
this is what I did and this is how long
it took so that's a pretty much yeah so
that that's what you would use it for so
let's go ahead and start saving this
stuff so first thing we got to do is set
up our save history so we're going to go
into our preferences so let's go to edit
preferences general
and then we've got this history log down
here check that box there and we can
save log items to metadata that records
the data as embedded metadata and if you
don't know what that is I'll just look
it up real quick for you right now to
pull it like on the screen so you guys
know what metadata is I don't know the
exact definition that's why I'm gonna
bring it so here's what metadata is I'll
give you a second if you want to pause
the video and read about it and
basically it's just data like a data
file about the data that Photoshop uses
so you can save it as that let's get
that out of here you can also save it as
a text file which records the data to a
text file obviously or you can do both
so let's just check both there we go now
you got need to pick it somewhere to
save it to and I'm just gonna say this
is history and then it automatically
says it as a text file I'm gonna save it
in my new Boston folder and it's safe so
you can choose it again by clicking on
this to where it's gonna save and you
can see there that it created my history
I'm just gonna do a couple things here
to my document I'm gonna click on out of
it and I need to go over the other part
of the of the preferences here we have
let's go back here and click on our
history log go to both and we'll resave
it as this and then we have the ethic
log items because there's a few of these
and I wanted to go over them a little
bit so the sessions only only records
basic information such as like when it
was opened and closed now the concise
puts more information in there on
actions you've done and then detail that
has the most data and includes date and
times for each action
and individual state so let's go to
detailed and then we'll hit okay and
let's just do a couple things I'm gonna
move I'll just move this layer and then
I'll draw on it and I'll move it again
and then I'll use the magic wand tool on
it there we go so that's a couple of
things that we've done so now we've got
it created and we want to go and review
it so I'm gonna close Photoshop so it'll
record that so let's go close in it
right here to close and I'll just hit
yes for now just to save this I don't
care where it saves let's back it up and
we'll just save it right there for now
so the shit closed out I don't wanna
save that one and let's go to where we
had our history file created so I go
into my folder and here it is here
history I open this up we can see this
stuff here when this was closed we've
got our whole bunch of stuff that's been
going on here here's some times what
else we got here move current layer move
current layer magic wand a brush tool as
you can see brush tool move move magic
wand and everything like that so this is
what your history file is gonna look
like it might be a little bigger later
on one year like actually do a whole
bunch of stuff so this is what it looks
like and if your client never questions
you on how long you took and what you
did and stuff like that or you want to
see how you created something then you
can use this to pretty much check it out
it even has like detailed stuff in here
like your selection was 452 by 70
tolerance there's a hundred I mean it
goes into a pretty decent amount
of detail into this when you have a cent
on details so if you had a sound on
sessions only it's gonna look different
so so it's not gonna have like all these
different detailed informations and all
the different times and stuff like that
so make sure you have it on detailed if
you really want to use it I mean there's
not really much reason not to have it on
detail unless someone tells you to so
that's how you use your history text
files and how to review them and how to
create them and everything like that
so it's really cool I think if you want
to like record what you've been doing so
thanks a lot for watching this tutorial
and let's see you guys in the next one
we're gonna start getting into the meat
and potatoes of Photoshop going over
like layers
I mean adjustment layers filters
different tools and it's gonna be pretty
awesome so see you guys later in that
tutorial have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
