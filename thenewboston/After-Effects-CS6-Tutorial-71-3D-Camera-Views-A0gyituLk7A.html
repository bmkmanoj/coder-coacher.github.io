Effects cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and we're
on the new Boston's YouTube channel
today I want to go over
working in a 3d scene and how to use
your views properly so that you can
quickly move around in your 3d scene and
figure out what to do so I mean the
first thing we should probably do is set
up another 3d scene so I'm gonna start
from scratch here and set up another 3d
scene in case you guys haven't seen
previous tutorials where I have done
that so let's just start out I imported
an object here so we can have something
to use as a reference and move around in
3d space so the first thing we want to
do is make sure this cube here is
checked this makes it a 3d layer and we
want to make sure our background layer
here if you want to create one is not in
3d so the next we want to do is we need
to create a new camera to look around
through in 3d space so we're gonna go to
layer new camera now we can name this
our main camera and just keep the
settings here
just look at the settings that I have
which you probably probably only need to
change if you have your preset different
just change it to 50 millimeter hit OK
now this is good enough for a basic 3d
scene we have our camera here which we
are looking through right now because we
can see that it says active camera up
here at the top right where my mouse
cursor is and also down here in our view
pop-up where we can check our views we
have active camera which is our main
camera right now or we can come down
here and click on main camera and it'll
be on it's the same thing as active
camera for now since we only have one
camera in the scene so what I like to
show you is how to use your views
correctly so we need this drop down
panel right here
where we can look at different views so
when you're working in 3d and you need
to position stuff around and get and see
where you are relative to everything
else it's a good idea to use the four
views now you'll have your main camera
up here in the right and this is what
this is what your camera is seeing and
then up here is the top which is a very
very useful view it's very good for
seeing look you're looking from the top
of the scene down so you're seeing where
your objects are in space the right view
over here you're looking from the right
from the right of the camera on and it's
good for seeing where your things are in
space from left to right and then you've
got your front view here where you can
see that this little box right here in
the middle that's your camera you're
gonna be able to see everything in the
front view and it's different from the
main camera view because you can
actually see where your camera is it
like relative to where your other
objects are so when I click on my my
picture here you can tell which one you
have clicked by one using your color
guide here so if you click on this color
you can change it if you if you would
like so if I change it to yellow it's
going to be yellow up in your selection
so you know that this right here is your
picture even though you can't see it
because it's head on now
you can move your object in 3d space by
going such as this moving in in the view
panels here and you can also move down
here in your regular properties panels
when you make something 3d there is
going to be an X Y and a new Z
coordinate here that you can use to move
forward and backwards towards the camera
depending on where your camera is if
your camera is up above then it's going
to move side-to-side pretty much and
then the y-axis will be moving towards
your camera so I'm gonna throw in
another picture here
I'll throw in something that's not huge
how about this
disco guy let's put him in in the scene
so I'm just gonna drag it on it's fairly
large so I'm gonna scale it down and I
need to make a 3d or else it's just
gonna appear like right in front of the
camera so I made it a 3d layer and now
you can see that this layer which is
color purple is now behind this other
layer so now you can see how being able
to move this way relative to the squish
marker here if you try to do this all in
one camera view let me go back to one
view it might be hard to tell exactly
where you are relative to to the to the
other things in the scene it's it's
definitely possible but if you're over
here on the side there's no way you can
tell how far away you are if you're
behind you can definitely tell but I
mean
if I scale this up it might look like
it's closer now if you get what I'm
saying there so use your views to figure
out where you are in the scene now if I
move my camera wrong one need the track
Z I'll go over these later on you can
see now that it's definitely behind the
other the other squish that the other
image there so that's a pretty basic
overview of how to use your views you
can change the view you want in which in
which section by right-clicking and come
over here to switch 3d view and maybe I
want to come from the bottom on this one
and now I'm looking from the bottom up
so I'm gonna switch it back to right
mainly I work with right front and then
this one should be top oops you got to
click in it make sure it has the little
triangles in the corner that that means
you have it clicked and then switch it
when you're working with a 3d modeling
program usually these are the views you
want to use also and you're in these
views all the time because you need to
move around and see what you're doing
and it keeps you in perspective and
everything if you try to do all from the
main camera I've learned from experience
that things get distorted and they get
like twisted and it doesn't look correct
which I mean you might not have as part
of a time with that and after-effects
but I mean you get the idea you just
want to keep things all nice and in
order for your scene especially when you
need to pass it off to somebody else so
that's the end of this tutorial
just use your use your views the way I
showed you and you should be good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
