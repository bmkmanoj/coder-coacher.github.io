welcome to another Photoshop cs6
tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and today
I want to go over with you
what Smart Objects are and they're
pretty important because they help with
a non-destructive editing within your
object or your image that are you using
and that's one of the main plus sides of
using Photoshop is that sometimes you
don't have to destroy the original data
of your image and you can keep all that
in case you like mess up you can just
delete everything in your image won't be
all screwed up so what a smart object is
it's it's like something that you put
your image in that can be continuously
rasterized which means the edges are
going to be like nice and crisp you can
scale it up and down or rotate it or
warp it in a non-destructive way that it
can and it'll stay like not destructed
so to understand these a little better
we're just going to start by importing
I'll show you a few ways how to import
your images as smart objects and there's
a couple of ways that we already did up
there's a way that we did already and is
by using the place option so if we go to
file and we go down here to place and I
just bring in anything I'll just bring
in something small like this color
scheme and I bring that in and I hit
enter to place it down now it becomes
automatically becomes a smart object the
way you can tell that something is a
smart object is one it has these
bounding boxes around it even when
you're not even trying to like when
you're not even trying to
like transform it it'll have these
bounding boxes around it which means
that these little squares are at the end
and you are able to mess with the
dimensions of it like this
so okay control ze to get off that and
another way that you can tell is that if
you look over here in our layers panel
there is this little icon that's there
which looks like a piece of paper with a
square and that is the thumbnail for the
smart object so you know that your
object is a smart object so what if you
import something in and it's not a smart
object already like this photo here that
I have let me get all this other stuff
out of the way so I have this photo here
but I can tell it's not a smart object
because it doesn't have a smart object
thumbnail on it so the way that you can
convert this to a smart object
right click on it and come over here to
convert to smart object and now we know
that smart object because it has the
bounding box around the edges that we
can see here now another way that we
could have done that which is a little
slower is come up to the menu here and
convert to smart object is also in the
menu there now there is another way that
we can bring in our objects as a smart
object if I come over here to may click
off here so if I come over here to file
and then come down here to open as smart
object we can do the same thing and
import something in here as a smart
object
so now this has opened as a smart object
but now it has opened into its own
document or from new projects so now
it's a smart object within its own
document that way you can just open it
on its own and work on it on its own
without having to work on it within
another document like this one thing
that's pretty cool about Smart Objects
is that you can edit them and then they
will be edited within your original
document that you had before so the way
that you can do this is making sure
something you have is a smart object and
a double-click on the icon or the
thumbnail this will come up you can
unclick don't do not show again if you
would like but this is just the pop-up
box that it will come up so let's just
hit OK here basically is telling you
that you need to save it or else the
changes that you made won't show up so
now I can do anything to this that I
that really would want to maybe I want
to crop this down go to Mike my
computer's like lagging a little bit and
I'll just hit enter to crop it and and
I'll go to hit save and now if I come
and look at it in our original document
which I did by moving over here and
clicking I have too much stuff going on
now we can see that it has been cropped
the way we did it in the original
document here so I'm gonna X out of a
few of these things so it's not using so
much of my
computer processing power now to get
your lair down to back so it's not a
smart object anymore all you need to do
is a right-click on it and click to
rasterize layer' and once you do that it
no longer is a smart object so I'm going
to bring up this other smart object that
I have and show you why you might want
to do that if you try to use like an
effect like the burn tool I'm trying to
actually use it it's not working as you
can see the smart object must be
rasterized before proceeding and then if
you can hit ok to rasterize it but you
can't use some certain tools on our
smart object layers anything that's
destructive like this burn tool that
will actually alter like the image you
cannot use until you rasterize the layer
so that's my basic intro of smart
objects for you hopefully it made some
sense and I thank you for watching this
one so give it a thumbs up if you liked
it and thumbs down if you hated it
subscribe for more Photoshop tutorials
coming up so thanks for watching and see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
