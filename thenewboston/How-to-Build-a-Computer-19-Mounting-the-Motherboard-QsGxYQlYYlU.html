better viewing but now that we've got
our case ready it's time to fit our
motherboard in so move all these out of
the way for now we'll be dealing with
those later go ahead and grab your case
in the way you know which way it fits in
your case you're gonna want to go ahead
and line where yeah you're gonna want to
go ahead and line those parts up to the
piece we just fitted so mines gonna go
in let's see it's going to go in this
way so I'm like it tight squeeze so now
usually they just hold it by the CPU fan
so go ahead and line all your ports up
now that we are lined up we want to go
ahead and grab a screwdriver from our
kit
and grab the screws that came with your
case these are for your motherboard
right here and now you just get screwing
one by one all right guys
the next thing once you got your
motherboard mounted is you want to
install your case fan which is gonna go
in something that looks just like your
CPU fan you want it install your these
are optional USB ports I got you might
not even have these but if they do then
you want to hook those up to your
motherboard you want to hook up your
integrated audio if you have that and
you want to hook up your LED lights and
your power to turn on and off your
motherboard all right guys I was just
editing my video and there's one thing I
failed to mention when hooking up all of
the wires or any wires directly to your
motherboard there's a certain way you
have to configure how the wires plug in
now all of the labels if you look very
closely on every place you plug in every
piece on your motherboard has a label
that's labeled its label like something
like panel number one in small white
letters and there's also on your wires
there's also labels on every single wire
that you have to plug into your
motherboard now how exactly you plug
those wires into your motherboard did
you look on your motherboard for what
component this is then you look on your
wires for what label is on your wires
and then you look in your motherboard
manual you can see that these
connections such as it's gonna say panel
number one F audio and all of those on
your motherboard and this is how you put
the wires in those are going to be the
labels on your wires so it's gonna be
different for every single motherboard
but just remember that your motherboard
is a label
your wires are going to be labeled in
this book that came with your
motherboard is going to show you how to
put the wires together
so that's how you do that I'll let you
get back to my tutorials</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
