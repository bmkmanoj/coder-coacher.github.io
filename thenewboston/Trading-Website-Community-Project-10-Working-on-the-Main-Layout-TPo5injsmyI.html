and in this video we are finally going
to begin styling the main layout for our
website so let me go ahead and the first
thing I want to do is I want to show you
guys the code on the register dot PHP
page basically we have the body which
everything that we see is in the body
and what we are going to be doing is the
easiest way to Center this webpage is to
stick everything inside a div now I'm
gonna name this div wrapper and it's
basically gonna wrap all of the content
everything we see visually on our
website now inside this wrapper is
basically everything you see here now
I'm gonna be breaking up our website
into a couple main pieces the first
piece is the main header the main header
is a space with the logo in the links at
the top this is remember the main header
after this I'm gonna have another area
which is the search bar this area right
here with where you can type in your
keywords and this little form right here
and spun this is a search area now I'm
also going to have a left-hand side
which is primarily going to be links
although it may differ whenever we make
custom web pages and also the right-hand
side so your main content the main thing
that's going to change is on the
right-hand side and this is pretty much
the main section of your website so
again the header search area left hand
side main section and also the footer so
there you go now let's go ahead and
style all these things so let me hop
back in the main CSS and the first thing
I wanted to do is take care of the main
wrapper now remember the wrapper is the
thing that surrounds your entire website
so why do I need to style this well you
will see wrapper and I'm gonna first set
the width of this box now the main width
is going to determine the width width
and that's kind of a hard word to see
say for your entire website so I want my
entire website to be 1,000 pixels wide
so 1000 pixels and what this is gonna do
is it's gonna make a box that we play
everything else into so the next thing I
want to do with this box is I want to
set a margin oh god some Flemming I
throw a margin and let me go ahead and
write this out before I explain to you
15 pixels oops
15 pixels Auto zero pixels now this is
shorthand in is crucial whenever trying
to send your webpage and let me go ahead
and explain you guys what this mean
whenever you pass three sets of pixels
in here it says okay the top box it's 15
pixels from the very top of your website
so if you look at our website we can see
the very top mouse section is this
message all these links you see that
there's a little space between all this
text and the top of the website which is
right here there's actually that 15
pixels so we're saying okay we don't
want it butted right up against the top
because that'll look weird so give us 15
pixels on top now this second Auto means
left and right so it says make it
automatic make it even for left and
right so basically the same amount on
the left and the right hand side and
whenever you do that it automatically
gives the same number of pixels on the
left and right hand side therefore
centering your website now the last one
was zero pixels and that means zero
pixels from the bottom so whenever we
get to the bottom of our website as you
can see if we highlight this I know it
has a white background but this text is
butted right up against the bottom of
the website because you know we don't
need any padding between the bottom of
the website and our content if we had a
lot of padding then that would be like
is there something supposed to be down
there that they like delete it or
something so that's why you should
always have a margin on top of about 15
pixels and no margin on bottom so I know
that um I kind of talked about that one
line of code for a while but a lot of
people don't understand how to Center
web sites properly and that's out so the
last thing I want to do is just
text-align:left and what this is going
to do is essentially left the line all
the content inside this entire box so
there you go and the next thing we need
to do is
take care of this main header so like I
said we did the main box the main
website right now the next step is to do
the things inside the website the first
being this main header which holds this
logo and this little text toolbar on the
top right-hand side now the cool thing
is if I just go main underscore header
is that the only thing we really need to
do is style the text on the upper right
and the logo whenever we put it in place
since everything is left aligned it's
gonna plop right where it needs to the
only thing we need to do is style this
so I decided to put that in a separate
div tag so for now let me just go ahead
and add a comment here space with logo
and top links and we don't need to style
anything in there for now but we want to
leave a section just in case we need to
come back that's what we're gonna call
it now for those top right-hand links
well I want those links to do is I want
them to kind of break away from the
styling that they inherited by default
these should be on the left but I
obviously want them to appear on the
right hand side away from the logo so in
order to do that let me just go ahead
and make a right aligned section and
what this is gonna be is the first thing
I wanted to do is I want to float this
to the right and I also want to text a
line right so whenever we surround text
in this what it's going to do is it's
going to take the entire box and move it
over to the right and it's also going to
take the text that's inside that box and
shift that to the right as well so that
is how you read the line that div and
the last thing I'm gonna be going over
is now that we got our main header in
our links taken care of I want to go
over this search area right here now I'm
gonna go ahead and name this give it a
name of or a ID of top search so top
underscore search
and now the first thing I want to do is
this check it out
pay attention to what we have going on
here we have this blue search bar and we
have this logo which is basically inside
the main header but as you can see
there's a little bit of space between
this logo and this little search bar now
partly because whenever I made this
image there's a little bit of white
space on the bottom but it's also
because I added a margin right on top of
this because if the logo plops right on
here it's gonna look like it's all one
big thing so you definitely want to add
some space right there so for the top
search I'm just gonna give a margin top
of about 10 pixels I don't think
anything more than that will be
necessary and now what I want to do is I
want to give it a padding now remember
the padding is pretty much the space
from the elements inside such as this
box and the border of your ID or section
as I should call it so let's go ahead
and do that right now so margin top and
give it a padding of this five pixels
zero pixels five pixels and 10 pixels
now again whenever we put four pixels
inside either padding or margin they go
in this order top right bottom left so
the top and the bottom
both are five pixels so that's why we
have a little bit of blue on the top and
the bottom and on the right hand side
there are zero pixels because it doesn't
even reach that so we're just gonna
leave that at default but on the left
hand side as you can see this last is
the left and we put ten pixels from the
left because if this search bar was
butted right up against the left then it
would kind of blend in with this
background and it would just look really
weird
so there you go um that's that so the
last thing we want to do before we get
to the really cool stuff is display this
as a block element because we definitely
don't want anything appearing on the
left or right hand side we don't want to
inline want to make sure it's a block
now what I'm going to do is I like for
this website to have a new-age rounded
corner
look now if we just make everything
square then it's really gonna look like
the 1990s this is web development in the
2012 era so we want things to have
rounded corners now hopefully you watch
from my html5 and css3 tutorials but if
you didn't then I will mention this
there's been kind of an issue with a
rounded corner is that css3 isn't fully
adapted by all browsers so we need to
kind of tweak it to trick it into
working on all browsers so eventually
it's going to be border-radius
and you're just gonna be had gonna be
able to go seven pixels and it's gone
around your corners seven pixels the
more pixels the more round
however Firefox uses something else what
they do is they use something called -
Moz - border-radius seven pixels and
aside from that Safari I believe it is
and google chrome use something called a
WebKit so whenever you type WebKit this
is gonna make it compatible with Google
Chrome this is gonna make it compatible
with Firefox and this is gonna make it
compatible with everything else like
Internet Explorer so there we go we now
have rounded corners that work on all
browsers so the last thing we want to do
is this we pretty much made this section
said aware we want it to be
we patted everything correctly and
around the corners but right now it's
just a white section with no border so
what we want to do in order to give it
this blue color is we need to set the
background color so background color and
the background color of this that blue
color that I just showed you guys is
zero zero six six nine nine so there you
go in with all that that is all we have
to do for that top search section for
now so basically we made a section that
stretches across our entire website it
padded everything in Nice has a nice
blue background so in the next tutorial
what we're going to do is we're going to
be styling the main section this left
section this main section on the right
and also the footer and once we're done
with that we're ready to move on to
something more exciting
so anyways for now thank you guys for
watching number two subscribe and I'll
see you
