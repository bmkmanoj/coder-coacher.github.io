your 32nd PHP tutorial now in the last
tutorial I showed you guys how to make a
confirmation code out of unique random
numbers and we sent them their
confirmation code in the email address
and as you can see right here we send
them the confirmation code in a link and
you set it equal to the variable passkey
so now once they click that link I'm
going to be showing you guys what
happens now so the first thing you need
to do is go ahead and make a file called
confirmation PHP since when they click
that link as you can see if I can find
it again it's going to take them to a
page called confirmation PHP so that's
what we want to be building today that
confirmation page so let's go ahead and
delete this old strip and in this
tutorial I'm going to be working on the
confirmation page as you can see so of
course the first thing you want to do is
do your PHP tags and the next thing you
want to do after that is include your
file as called something like a connect
PHP mine's going to be different than
yours you guys can name yours whatever
you want and after you have that move
this in the center a little bit you want
to get um get actually the first thing
we're going to want to do is set a
variable and we want to set the variable
passkey because we we're going to be
working with that we're going to be
working with this variable passkey but
it has no value right now so we're going
to say alright where is this variable
well we want to get this variable from
the old
Heskey that we already set and if you
follow my tutorial in my code exactly
once you do this you will now have the
random a number generated and passkey
and it's going to be stored in this
variable passkey and if you're saying
all right well why don't I just use this
if they're the exact same thing you can
use that but it's going to be really
confusing if you do the next thing
you're going to want to do is look at
your table and make sure that there's
only one pass key and this is going to
help because it's only going to allow
one user to register per email so let's
make a query let's go SQL and remember
this is just what action do we want
perform what we want to do is we want to
select all the information where's my
Asterix there er Bessie from temp
remember temp is a temporary table where
code and that's our Syrah code equals
the variable passkey so again we want to
select look at our table or temporary
table and select all the information
from where the code our secret code
equals this and remember this is the
pass key right here so this is going to
allow for one users to register per
email and of course we need a result and
let's make this a SQL one and result one
just so I don't get fused and do my SQL
query and this just means what action do
you one for I want to perform the action
dollar sign s qo1 so once you have this
actually that needs to be a variable
then this action is going to be
performed and it's going to do this so
the next thing that we're going to want
to do is say alright if we successfully
did that then we want to go ahead and
enter all the data into the rest of our
table so actually I'm going to show you
guys that in the next tutorial this
one's getting kinda long but just to
recap one more time this right here it
gets the variable from your email and
sets it in the variable that you can use
in your program and right here it
selects all the information and make
sure that your information is in that
temporary database and it's going to
just select all the information right
now and in the next tutorial we're going
to be going over how to put that
information from your temporary database
into your permanent database so I'm
going to be posting this on my website
the new Boston comm so if you have any
questions go to my site the new Boston
comm and you can ask me there and I will
help you out thanks and make sure to
watch the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
