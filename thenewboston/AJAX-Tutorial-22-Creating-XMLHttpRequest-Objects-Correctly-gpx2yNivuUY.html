create the object it gets returned into
a global armed object that all the
functions can use simple enough so now
what I wanted to do is I want to show
you guys the main two different ways
that you create this so the first thing
you're going to do is since we have one
of two ways it's best to use a if
statement the first parameter you want
to put in this if statement is window
XML I actually you know it can't be like
this text style where I can spell crap
around it can you know so that's why I'm
taking my time typing this HTTP request
and make sure that you set up your you
know capitalization and everything just
like mine
Russell won't work so what this is
basically saying is if a window is open
in your browser so that's what the
window means basically a window in your
browser so it's basically basically
saying if your browser uses this XML
HTTP request and by the way all new
browsers would use this object so this
is going to run probably 90% of the time
so if your browser is aware of this
object basically what I want to do is
something really simple I just want to
go ahead and set this variable equal to
a new instance of the object so in a
Gesundheit to myself Oh thinking of
Bucky all right so what I want to do is
set equal to a new instance of this
object so BAM you're good to go you can
actually return it right here and it's
going to work for 90% of browsers
probably even a little bit more however
there are some idiots over Microsoft who
were working on Internet Explorer 6 and
I think a few earlier versions Internet
Explorer 5 maybe who decided that this
you know maybe they wanted to change
things up do it differently so thanks
guys
way to ruin everything so they don't use
the object just like this they actually
use something called active X object and
it's made a little bit differently
let me go ahead and copy this and it's
set instead of just setting equal to
this new xmlhttprequest object like you
should have done Microsoft you actually
need to set it equal to a new active X
object and the parameter for this is
Microsoft since they are idiots XML HTTP
now before I go on remember that the
summary of this is basically all new
browsers chrome you know Firefox even
the new Internet Explorer's this is how
you create an xmlhttprequest object some
older versions of Internet Explorer do
this and remember this is what we're
doing this is for a common browser and
this is for weird browsers now some
computers and these are just like you
know if you made your own custom browser
or something then they aren't even going
to know what this is so a way that you
can kind of protect yourself against
this is put a try-catch statement inside
this out so you're going to try to
create this because right here we're
assuming that it's Internet Explorer 6
or an Internet Explorer 5 but we don't
know that it may be some weird browser
so you can put a try-catch in here you
also can expand this because there are
several different active X object
parameters and that's why you know you
had to expose it explicitly say this one
right here but this code right here is
going to work on 99% of all computers
you know that's fact so if your user is
using some weird browser and none of
this works then we have a check later on
that we can fix this but don't even
worry about it because you know if
they're using a weird browser then they
are not even expecting your website to
work so don't even worry about it in my
opinion so now that we worked with weird
browsers and common browsers all we need
to do now is return the XML
httprequest object so now basically what
we did is we returned the object and we
returned into this global variable so
now all other functions we create are
able to use this object so this object
is pretty much the core of Ajax like I
said this is the object that does all
the hard work communicates with your
server and your computer in in the
background and allows the user to have a
sweet awesome user experience so in the
next tutorials what I want to do is I
want to go over the process and also the
handler handle server response functions
in detail and remember like the first
couple tutorials I taught about Ajax I
was like these Reddy states don't really
worry about them just go ahead and write
like ready state to ready state for and
don't even worry about it well now's the
time where it's actually time that we
have to start worrying about it and
understand what they do so anyways thank
you guys for watching I'm going to
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next vid</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
