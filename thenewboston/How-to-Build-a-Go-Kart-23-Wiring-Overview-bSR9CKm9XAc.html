and in this video I just want to show
you guys the spinal cord that I ripped
out of some Evo alien right here of
course I'm kidding guys this is actually
the wiring kit which we have to install
in the go-kart pretty much the brains
the spinal cord pretty much everything
that makes the go-kart cool is right
here
so I figured I might as well go ahead
and start at the very top and this is
the front of the go-kart and after you
travel along the wire you end up with
the rear of the go-kart so all that goes
in the front all that goes in the rear
and instead of going through each piece
as I'm installing them I first want to
give you guys the overview of all of
this so let's go ahead and get started
now right here of course we got the
dashboard this sits in on pretty much
right next to the driver so we can stick
the key in we're going to be going into
detail of every one of these pieces
later on in a separate video these two
clamps right here this one and this one
are for the front headlights these
clamps right here that one and that one
are for the front turn signals now that
green little clamp is for the horn
although I don't like to have a horn on
my go-kart for some reason I just think
it's annoying and this right here is for
the brake indicator lights it's going to
sit right behind your brake pedal so
whenever you touch your brake pedal a
sensor is going to kick off complete the
circuit and it's going to trip your
brake wire lights or brake lights
whatever you want to call them so that's
all there is in front again most of the
stuff is in the dashboard in sense the
dashboard is so complex I'm going to
save that for another video a separate
video we're going to go into more detail
now of course you follow the wire all
along until you get to the rear of the
go-kart and whenever you're mounting
this wire just go ahead and bolt it on
the frame of your go-kart that's pretty
much what you do with all the wire you
pretty much are going to mount it along
here along the side down here all the
way to the front and that's actually
what these little brackets are ready
you're supposed to put the wire under
here and clamp them down so it keeps the
wire from like getting on your feet and
stuff by anyways let's get back to the
good stuff
so now as we look at the rear wiring
system these two wires right here are
for your rear turn signals this one
right here is whenever we install the
roll bar the roll bar has wiring built
into it fog lights on top of it so this
is for the lights in your roll bar the
fog lights now this thick wire if you
notice this wire right here is a little
bit more thick than the rest of the
wires and whenever you have a wire
that's more thick it usually means then
that it's for the starter because the
starter takes a lot of electricity and
they mean it needs a thicker gauge wire
now this confusing looking wire let me
get that those attaboy this is for the
fan on your engine this right here is
for the gauge on your carburetor
and all of that right there is pretty
much just where
and connects it's the brain of
everything that one with blue tape over
it is a ground wire and I put blue tape
over it because it has two little
washers on it and I just didn't want
them falling all over the garage floor
and of course you guys probably know
what these are already these two wires
are the positive and the negative for
your battery of course you plug those
into your battery and it gives
everything else juice and this right
here is the spark plug wire which pretty
much sends a electronic signal and it
makes a spark in your spark plug so
there you have it those are all the
pieces and what I'm going to be doing is
the things that we already installed in
a for example the carburetor you already
know where that plugs in but the things
we did install yet such as the lights
and the turn signals in the dashboard
those are the only things that I'm going
to be going over how to hook up the
electronic things in detail because
obviously you know that ok this plugs
inside the carburetor I don't need a
tutorial to show you how this plugs in
it's pretty obvious so like I said I'm
only going to be going over some of the
electronics in detail but it's going to
give you a pretty basic idea of how to
hook everything up so before I let you
guys go in this tutorial I'm just going
to show you guys where this electronic
box goes if you look kind of right above
your muffler it screws into these two
brackets right here now once you have
the box screwed into these brackets what
you do is you put the cover on which I
see right here and that just keeps all
the dirt and the rain and stuff from
getting out so I'm not going to show you
guys that because working with
electronics is a pain in the button like
I said I'm going to say muscles most of
the stuff for upcoming tutorials but for
now this is what you have to look
forward to so thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and I'll
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
