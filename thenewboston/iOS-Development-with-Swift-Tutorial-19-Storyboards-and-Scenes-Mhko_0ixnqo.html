tutorial what I'm going to do is I'm
going to show you guys how to have a
little bit more control over the
navigation for your entire app because
most of the time whenever you create an
app it's going to have more than one
scene more than one screen so we want to
be able to build navigation systems that
make it really easy for the user and
really intuitive to switch between these
screens now by default we can add some
things like navigation controllers and
we already saw that in the I don't even
know if it was a last tutorial maybe two
tutorials ago where you can have like
tabs at the bottom you can also have a
menu at the top but in this example I'm
pretty much going to be breaking
everything down and we're going to
understand all the different pieces and
later on when we learn how to use these
built-in navigation systems it's going
to make a lot more sense so I just made
a really simple single view application
and the first thing I want to do is this
I'm gonna go to the storyboard that's
where I'm at now and click this scene
right here so by default we have one
screen one scene and I really hate how
the background of Xcode is white and
this is also white it's kind of hard to
differentiate so I'm going to click this
and change the background to light blue
turquoise good enough whatever alright
so in order to demonstrate switching
between different scenes we probably
need a different scene so I'm going to
go here and if you right click anywhere
in the background and just zoom out
probably give you a little bit better
view actually if you're using Xcode on
your entire desktop it's probably fine
but for my screen recorder umm I have to
kind of minimize it so it shows up good
on like YouTube and stuff so what I want
to do now is take a view controller and
drag it out and that gives you a brand
new scene let me just position that and
it doesn't really matter where you
position it this is just for you know
visually
wherever it is it doesn't really matter
your composition down to the top
whatever and another thing I want to
point out before I continue is this
consume back into 100% you see this
arrow right here what this arrow arm
signifies is whenever you open your app
for the very first time this scene right
here is going to be the first scene that
the user sees so a lot of people were
like okay what the heck is that that's
what it does and you can actually move
this if you want so if you decide to
move it over here then this would be the
initial scene but I like it where it was
I'm going to take it and move it back
there alright so now that I'm zoomed in
back 200% the next thing I want to do is
this I'm going to change your background
color of this one to something like red
and in this example what I'm going to do
is zoom back out and just add one more
just so we have a bunch of different
stuff to work with so zoom back in so I
can edit it and this third one will just
be like yellow
maybe this ugly yellow green puke kind
of looks like baby poop but I kind of
like it in a weird way you know alright
so now we have three different scenes
three different screens that the user
can view but we have no way of switching
between them first of all we don't have
any buttons that the user can click and
second of all even if we had a button
that they can click there's no
connection between these screens there's
no flow so let's learn how to do that
right now so just for this example we
will have the user click a button so
type in button and drag one out to your
very first one and since I'm not um you
know using proper size classes or
layouts or anything like that just stick
in the top left and then whenever we run
the simulator we can see it and change
the text on this to like go to scene 2
all right so that looks good right there
and whenever they click that I'll show
you guys how to change the screen to
this one and we'll also have a button on
here that says go to scene 3 so this of
course is scene 1 scene 2 and this baby
poop one is scene 3 all right so now we
have buttons so the user can actually
touch something on the screen so how do
we pretty much get that transition or
that segue between them well what we do
is actually really incredibly easy
select the button that you want and hold
down control on your keyboard and drag
that blue line and release it to
whatever scene that you want to
transition to whenever they click the
button now a segue of course that's how
you pronounce that word actually didn't
even know I heard people say before but
I never seen it written down until um
like whenever I started learning about
iOS development so it's kind of weird
but whatever so just choose show right
now and I'll talk to you guys about the
different types of segues or transitions
that we can have but right now what this
does whenever you add that connection is
it says okay now I know whenever the
user taps this button that you want to
go to this scene right here so we can
actually run this right now let me go
switch to like iPhone 5 or something all
right so once my stimulator loads
why are you unable to run you son of a
probably because I was moving it around
all right beautiful
all right so remember the reason that it
knows to go here is because this little
symbol symbol says this is the very
first launcher screen for this app so it
starts out on your blue one and whenever
the user clicks the button go to scene
two it takes them to that other scene
scene two so now since we didn't add any
functionality functionality to this
whenever they click this
you see I'm clicking it but nothing is
happening so we already know how to do
that so let's take care of that right
now select the button hold down control
and drag and if we hit show and run this
again check it out go to scene two take
this the red scene go to scene three
takes us to the baby poop screen looking
awesome now we're like alright then how
do we get back to you know that red
scene or that blue scene again well
there are a lot of different ways of
course since you already know that
functionality you probably could figure
out how to make a button to make a segue
in the opposite direction
but what I want to do is show you guys
how to add a navigation controller and
this takes care of a lot of the
background functionality and another
thing I want to mention is this let me
stop this and run it again and show you
guys a problem that we have you see in
the users mind whenever they're going
from one scene to another the way that
mobile apps are built they're kind of
gonna picture it a scene sliding in from
the right to the left now check this out
by default the transition is whenever I
click this it slides up from the bottom
so I'm going to click it again and see
how that scene slides up from the bottom
well what we can do is I'm going to show
you guys in the next video how to
customize these transitions but whenever
we add a navigation controller what it
does is by default it takes those scenes
and slides it in from the right so how
do we add a navigation controller well
what we do is we select that first scene
so make sure that this is selected and
if you go to the editor embed in
navigation controller what this is going
to do is it's going to give you an
overall navigation controller for your
entire app your entire storyboard we can
see this easier if we zoom out alright
so it put it in a really weird place let
me zoom out to 25 percent but all we can
do is take this and drag it down
and I really wish that a YouTube videos
were bigger so I can record my whole
screen but there you go let me zoom back
out any guys can see this a little bit
easier now also take note that this
initial arrow it points to the
navigation controller and well all we
have to do now is test and run this and
you can see what happened here so we saw
that okay we have this bar at the top
now this bar is the navigation
controller and if you hop back in Xcode
you can see that what it did whenever we
added that navigation controller is it
added that bar to the top of every scene
so this navigation controller pretty
much controls the entire navigation for
your entire app now one of the things
that this does by default is whenever
you click go to scene 2 it gives you
that back button so it does two things
that we notice right away first of all
it allows you to go back by clicking
that button and of course at the very
first one you can't go back because
nothing's before it so it gives you a
natural flow and another thing I want to
point out is you see how before the
scenes were appearing from the bottom
and sliding up well they now appear from
the right and slide to the left and
that's a lot easier for the user it's a
lot more intuitive because you see how
this back button is pointing left it
just makes a lot more sense and it's a
lot more natural feeling so there you go
there is the basics of how to create
additional scenes in how to add segues
to navigate between them and also how to
add a navigation controller to give you
some pretty much default functionality
whenever you're working the navigation
but of course there is a lot more to
cover so uh yeah that's probably enough
for this tutorial but I think guys for
watching and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
