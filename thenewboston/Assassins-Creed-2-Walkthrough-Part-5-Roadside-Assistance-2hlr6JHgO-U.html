the fifth walkthrough for assassins
creed two and this is memory one of
sequence 3 and this is called roadside
assistance now this is a pretty
self-explanatory admission but one my
subscriber said hey make sure you go
over this I don't know I guess he likes
it or something we pretty much do is a
made up a bunch of guys so you know oh
and another thing up that she had a
counter in this one um a counter I mean
even when I was playing the first time I
just used the wac guys with swords until
they died but then someone told me about
the counter and really useful itself I
mean I'll let you know so the first
little segment you have to just beat
these two people up and you don't have
any weapons beside your blade yet so
just go ahead and hit him each once
probably and they'll die just a bit so
now run at him again and he's like yeah
yeah yeahs yatta gonna send some more
people after you been what's kill you
and do not spare the women and then you
got a bunch of arrows she win the
lottery part he's like what's going on
now not so this boys like kill skill
show your fan so sorry continues and
ends up that uh it's a cousin i think is
normal and now you have a big ol
Braveheart battle so it's axiom fo and
now pretty much what you have to
concentrate on is keeping Maria body
alive so if you can stay close to them
but I mean it's really unlikely that
they're gonna die so and another thing
when soms well yeah it's better kill
people coming back but you're when
you're on one and one with somebody like
this see if I can protect me well no
just kill see they're too easy to kill
but anyways let me try to counter this
guy all right hold your high right
trigger bun then as soon as he hits like
as soon as he strikes you hit the let's
do a button it is the X button or the
attack Mun and what this is going to do
is counter kill so instead of having to
beat them with your sword 500 times
until itself goes now I need to do is
wait for them to hit you and when you're
in high profile just hit X as soon as he
strikes and it's going to kill it in one
swoop so this is going to say be like 15
hours in the game so you don't have to
keep whomping every one night it's
emilio mario luigi Nidal to that bar but
um so yeah there you go I forgot what
his name is buddy wanted to see a walk
through on this I mean it's pretty cool
just beating people down but let's get
you hold on that's pretty much it so
mission complete thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe to my
channel and check out all my latest
videos so again thank you and I'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
