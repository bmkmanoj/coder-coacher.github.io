your 200th Android tutorial the final
tutorial in series and what we're going
to do is we're going to update our
basically our apk file on our developer
page here and if we try to go to the
apks here what's wrong with my mouse
keeps right-clicking for no reason
alright this is getting annoying stop it
my phone was sitting on the control
button there so that's what that's what
was happening alright so if we try to
upload let's say you know the New Boston
again so we're just going to go to
choose apk go into the new boss in
trying to open that and upload it's
going to say you know we already have
this apk uploaded and it's still version
1 so you aren't really updating anything
so let's just close that and go into our
code and basically let's say you want to
add a new you know something to our list
another activity or something within our
project and we need to update it to the
marketplace you solve some kind of bug
or something that people are having
trouble with so how we change or get it
upgraded apk is we're just going to go
into the Android manifest I don't know
if you guys saw that or if it I went too
quickly but basically there was the bird
code our version code was set to one so
any time we do it upgrade we're all
gonna we're just going to set this
version to like two or something like
that and then we're just going to save
it and again we have to export it so
we're going to go to Android tools
export signed application now we're just
going to hit next and we have to use the
same key store and key alias so we're
just going to say use existing key store
and we're going to say our password that
we setup the last time that's why it's
important to remember these password
anytime you update you need to have the
same password and the same certificate
and the reason we have to sign it to the
same certificate is that way you know
people can't just like upgrade our
application if they
pakkun they need to have the same
signature certificate so we're just
going to hit next and then we also have
to have our alias name which there's
only one alias under Marquis store
that's supposed to be T and B but oh
well so that was our alias name again we
have to have the same password or I'm
not the same password but what if your
password was for your alias hit next and
then it says destination already exists
so we're just going to say the new
Boston to maybe save finish and then we
can go into our marketplace and say
upload apk and choose it and we just
pick the new Boston - which is our
upgraded apk hit open and upload and
again now we can actually you know
replace our apk with this new upgraded
apk so we're just going to hit save and
we have this choice again we want to
switch this new code the version code -
to active and it says obviously this is
going to replace the currently active
one is that okay yes cool and then we
just have to save it and there we go we
have our upgraded apk on the marketplace
and when people download it the new and
improved version of our application is
going to be what they're downloading so
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
I know it's kind of simple but again
just to keep in mind you need to save
your passwords and you also need to
replace your version code so you know
just keep that in mind as well and
that's pretty much it guys so hopefully
you guys enjoyed the the tutorials you
learn something sorry again if I went
too fast or too slow or it's too boring
or you know all that stuff so it hope
you guys enjoyed it and if you guys have
any more questions feel free to hit me
up on my bring back
or you know my my youtube channel or
something like that
so I'll catch you guys later hopefully
and thanks again for watching and have a
good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
