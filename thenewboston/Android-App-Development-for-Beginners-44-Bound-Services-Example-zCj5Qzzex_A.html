and the first thing we need to do is
import a bunch of stuff Android view dot
view import actually let me pause my
video and I'm going to import everything
we need to all right so I imported all
the stuff we're going to need for of
course to reference our interface and
also to connect now another thing I want
to mention is for this last one in order
to be able to access the weird little
binary class of you made make sure that
you import your package name right here
and it's just just copy this package
whatever it is and then get this class
name and then this class name so again
package superclass binder class all
right so now once we do that we can go
ahead and actually start writing some
code first let me show my line numbers
and get myself some space there right
alright so the first thing we need is of
course my service object and I'm just
going to name this Bucky's service and
this is just a reference to this class
right here now another thing I wanted to
do is I want to make a variable called
is bound so eventually we're going to be
testing is this client bound to a
service in by default of course since we
didn't bind it yet we're just going to
start it off as false and whenever we
bind we're going to set is true and
that's just so we can check the state of
our what's called like bind anise or
whatever and I want to flee all these
because I hate these extra comments and
you guys will be able to read all the
important code easier
let me tighten this bad boy up all right
so the first row is whenever we want to
bind to a service we need a service
connection class now what this class is
going to be responsible for is its
pretty much going to say okay when you
bind to the service what do you want to
happen and when you disconnect for a
minute what do you want to happen so
again those are two two things that
we're going to need to stick in there
but first we need that class so after
all of your methods give yourself some
space in private service connection and
you can name anything you want I'm going
to name my buckey's connection again
this is going to be the class that's
responsible for binding to some kind of
service so again set it equal to new
service connection and make sure you add
your semicolon right there and as you
see whenever we created it it
auto-completed all of the stuff that we
need to have in it again this is really
simple on service Connect that says what
do you want to happen when you try to
connect on service disconnect okay
whenever you disconnect from the service
what do you want to happen so I know
it's a lot of code but it's really easy
to understand so whenever we try to
connect to a service all we want to do
is we want to reference this binder
subclass and then it pretty much takes
it from there so if we go to my local
binder and then we can just name it
binder or something and we set this
equal to my local binder service let me
finish writing up this one last line of
code
all right so Bucky service set equal to
binder dot get service and we'll change
that is bound variable to true all right
so what did I just write and what is
this on me so all this is right here is
a reference to my local binder in other
words that binder class that we wrote
last time now once we have access to
that class we're going to call the
method get service
so we know what that does and I'll get
serviced is going to do is it's going to
allow us access to this class so we can
use all of the cool methods in there now
that takes care of the connection and
just for housekeeping checking and stuff
I'm going to set is bound equal to true
because that means okay we are now bound
to a service pretty stinkin sweet now of
course you guys already know it's going
to happen here one line of code whenever
we disconnect from that service or um
you know get booted out for some reason
we're just going to change this to false
easy enough so now what I want to do is
I want to go up to on create right here
and whenever we create this activity
that's when we want everything to start
so just like before we're going to make
an intent called I set a equal to new
intent and all right so this is our
intent this is what we intend to do my
service dot class now check this out
this is where things get a little bit
weird now instead of just starting the
intent which would be for normal intent
remember we want to bind to this we want
to connect to the service that's the
whole point of this tutorial so if we
call a method called bind service this
is a built-in method that allows us to
bind to something and the parameters it
takes are your intent where is it
located the second one is Bucky's
connection so the second parameter it
takes it has to be an object from the
service connection class so that's why
we just couldn't like stick this code in
your routes because this method to bind
to service it requires an object from
this specific class all right now one
last parameter Wow
that is definitely ignore security death
ins sound
good so context like you know type today
bind Auto create so again you guys
already know what this does right here I
already explained it no need to explain
it again so the last thing that we need
to do is you probably scratching your
head and you're like alright so this
looks good in all butts
okay we're connected to this and then
get the time but how the heck does it
show because I know that we had this
button right here and it called a method
show time so um shouldn't this like app
do something useful like implement that
method so yes let's just go ahead and do
that right now
so again this is the easy part
public void I'm gonna start my emulator
right now
alright alright alright get out of my
way could get out of my way thank you
alright so public void show time this is
going to be the main method responsible
for actually showing the time and string
current time set equal to Bucky's
service all right move that all the way
to so Bucky service gets current time
because remember once we take care of
all of our housekeeping stuff this Bucky
service is essentially going to be a
reference to this class and it's going
to allow us to access all the methods in
here which look at that little gem we
get current time so after this of course
we just need to update that time on the
screen so text view Bucky's text instead
of equal to text view one view by Rd Rd
- Bucky's text and of course now that we
have a reference to it we can just call
set text and the current time is going
to be current time pretty sweet so there
we go and now let me just wait for my
emulator start up actually I forgot to
as my views longer all right so
hopefully cross your fingers I'm going
to click this and check it out and now
is connecting or binding to the surface
which is returning the time and
displaying it on the screen so whenever
I click it it calls it again so remember
this n is six seconds click it again 11
pretty stinking awesome so that ladies
and gentlemen that is how you create a
bound service in other words how you can
create an activity that can communicate
to your service technically it's called
a client communicating or binding to
your service but whatever
I don't give a F alright so think guys
for watching
and I will see you guys in the next
