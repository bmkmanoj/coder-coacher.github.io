another PI game tutorial video in this
video we're gonna be talking about how
to incorporate images into our PI game
so in the last video we actually drew
our image and we made it give it a
transparent background and all that fun
stuff
today we actually want to bring it in
now I do just want to mention that the
topic of images and games generally we
call an image in a game a sprite and
curiously you know we're two sprite come
from and the term sprite is actually
used it's like it means in Greek fairy
or ghost and so the idea of calling it a
sprite is as it's like an image that
doesn't like mess up the background so
to speak so remember how I was talking
about um how we could have a white
background if we wanted because our
background in our PI game is white so
you wouldn't really notice it too much
but if you run over objects you'd get
like that like corner of the square and
that is kind of just ugly and so we
don't like that and so we use sprites
and we use the term sprite to describe
something that can go over you know the
background it doesn't look like we just
you know collage images or something
together to make you know what looks
sort of like a backer or like a scene or
or whatever so that's the history of
sprite and why we use the term sprite so
Greek fairy so we're going to add some
Greek fairies to our game here anyway so
adding the images to your PI game or
your games in general is something
you're probably going to do a lot so
obviously we can draw objects in PI game
like I've shown you guys and actually
can do a lot more drawing of objects
than I've even shown so far so you can
actually you can draw like circles and
polygons and even like like you decide
what the polygon is you know you just
names important it's and it connects the
dots fills them in all that so you can
do some really cool drawing in PI game
but like say you want to make um like a
road or something like that generally
you would use a sprite for this you
would make a road yourself and then it
would just repeat itself over and over
and over and it makes the game look more
realistic
so anyway loading up images in PI game
simple enough I'm just going to show you
guys some quick and dirty code just to
get an image to show up to our screen so
first of all we wanted like we want to
define our image and we want to load in
the image so this part you kind of want
to careful about because you can you can
code it poorly and get a lot of
input/output happening and you just you
don't really want that so above and
outside of all of your code immediately
you want to define the image so before
the while loop runs basically so we're
just going to do it right here so we're
going to say image equals and then we're
going to say pygame image load and then
here you give the full path or the path
to that image so my image was snakehead
to PNG and I have the snakehead to PNG
is in this same directory as the script
that I'm writing right now if it's not
in the same directory and you can't get
away with this and also depending on how
you run it say you're on Linux or
something like that
depending on how you run it this will
may or may not even work you might have
to give the full path so if you've got
it in the same directory as your script
this isn't working you need to give the
full path to snakehead to PNG so just
keep that in mind also just for anybody
since we haven't really covered pads in
here and maybe this is one of your first
Python tutorials when you give pads like
in Windows if you like copy and paste a
Windows path it looks something like
this see colon slash users slash h /
desktop stuff like this
well this backslash is an escape
character so you don't want to use a
backslash you'd want to change all these
forward slash forward slash for what's
on and so on just a two point data so
anyway snake it to dot PNG and that's my
image so next thing we want to do is we
want to actually put this to the screen
so and actually and into our game so the
way that I want to do that is we're
going to put the
in the snake function here and you see
how we have for x and y in snake list
and then we do PI game draw and rack and
all this well what we can do instead is
we can come out here and remember as we
as the snake grows we append things to
the end of the list and the earlier
stuff in the list or the first things in
the list are actually the end of the
tail of our snake so what for the snake
head the head of our snake is going to
be a the negative first element so when
you reference a list and you do negative
one that's the very first element in
that list so let me just go ahead and
show you guys really quick so we've got
defined snake blocksize snake list and
then what we want to go ahead and do is
we're just going to say game display dot
lit and then we're going to blit what
we've lit the image and then where do we
want to blit this image well we want to
believe this image in the location of
where that first block ought to be so
that that location is in snake list it's
the negative first element right the
second to last or the last element
rather and then it is and that gives us
an XY pair so then we do 0 that will
give us the X and then we give the Y
which is going to be snake list a
negative one and then the first if
element which is actually the second
element which is our first is our X
second is our Y and that's our Y so
that's how we can blitt the image to
that location then we come down to our
for loop and we see x and y and snake
list and instead of doing all of the
snake list instead what we want to do is
basically all of the snake list up to
the negative first element this will do
everything except
very last element in snake list and it
will blit all this stuff or draw the
rectangle rather so that all should work
one last glance so let's go ahead and
run this so save and run it and see here
we have our snake quite easy he just
some good-looking snake so we can move
our snake around oops too hard skin is
too challenging for me oh my goodness
okay so we have our snake but we notice
okay well we've got a couple of problems
first of all this thing is way too fast
I'm slowing down for the next video but
we see the snake head is only turned in
the right direction when we go up so we
have to rotate the image so rotating the
image is fairly simple but that's what
we're going to cover in the next video
and before I forget I want to change our
FPS to 15 that's going to slow it down a
little bit and you guys will probably
see it better
oh my goodness how did I die already do
this again understand I just like loaded
the game and I died a little concerned
anyway that's better so in the next
video we're going to talk about is how
we can get this snake head to turn based
on the direction that we're gone so stay
tuned for that thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
