to do is I want to talk to you about
proper layout constraints and how to set
up your items on your screen so they're
adaptive to every layout so what I did
already is I started a brand new project
so let's go hop over in the main
storyboard and we can see in before
again what I did is I just clicked you
size classes and uncheck this and it
gave us that little iPhone that
resembled our simulator however that
wasn't really the proper way to do I
mean whenever we're just testing things
out and looking at cool little demos
learning how to develop it's fine but
that's never going to work because our
applications
they need to be adaptive to every layout
every single Apple device preferably and
also whenever they rotate it so a bunch
of different screen sizes a bunch of
different orientations so let's go ahead
and learn how to properly design a
layout so the first thing I'm going to
do is just add some items on the screen
so I'm going to add four buttons so a
but and I'll say like a top left and
I'll just ease in a second top right
bottom left and bottom right alright so
now let's go ahead and position them
like we would think so grab the top left
drag it up until you see that little got
guideline and also to the left right
there now for the top right but it up
against the right and also put it in
line with the top left and for the
bottom left and bottom right let's go
ahead and do the same thing alright so
that looks pretty good
right like that again this is just going
to be a really simple example and
actually what I'm going to do is I'm
going to take like what can I get maybe
I'll able to stick in the center let me
get a textview we haven't used that yet
so a textview is pretty much just arm
well it's same thing as kind of a
textview and web design just a little
chunk of text it's bigger than a label a
label is usually just one word or one
sentence so this would be for something
like a paragraph and I have like it's
not I know so you know that's Purdue
discussing all right so now what we need
to do is run this bad boy and check out
what goes wrong and let me run it on
like iPhone five or something so we're
going to run this in this stimulator it
gave the simulator but whatever and
check it out so okay that looks nothing
like we expected I mean this top left
button looks alright but this is way off
to the side the bottom left button is
like getting cut off and if I click
Hardware then what I can do is I can
rotate left or right all right so that I
don't know like doesn't even fix it you
can see the right button at least but
everything else just getting cut off and
messed up so what we need to do I'm just
closing my simulator is we need to make
some rules saying how we want things to
be laid out or other words position on
the screen now these rules in iOS
they're called constraints so we can
click on one of these items and start
adding constraints and for example these
can trains to say okay always position
it so it's in the top right corner of
the screen
so no matter how big your screen is no
matter what position you're holding it
in it's always going to be in the top
right corner so let's do that right now
for example so what I want to do is
actually close my file Navigator right
here and to do that I'm going to click
this little icon hide or show the
Navigator and I'm going to open up this
by if you go in this file at the bottom
left you see this tab so this allows you
to see all of the items on your screen
each of these refer to a different
object for example this top layout guide
is it just a little reference where the
status bar would be you know that little
black bar that says the time in the
battery life the bottom layout guide is
just the bottom of your screen the view
is just think of it like the overall
screen in general it's the container
that holds every other item on your
screen on your interface so the view is
just the basic screen the main screen
these are all the buttons and of course
that is the textview so again like I
said the first thing we want to do is we
want to add a rule to this top right
button in that role technically called a
constraint is going to say always
position this in the upper right corner
so make sure that you have your view
selected in your top right button
selected and what you can do is you can
hold down control on your keyboard and
drag this so you see that we have a
little blue line just like whenever we
were adding actions and outlets drag
this from the top right button to the
view and release now we're never to do
this we say we want to add a rule to
position the top right button relative
to the main screen so now we're saying
don't we'll like before you're just
looking at the top left corner no no
what you do now is you could position
this item on the screen relative to the
entire screen so you guys are going to
see what it does in a second so if we
choose trailing space to container
margin I know it's kind of a stupid name
but what it does is it adds a constraint
in other words a rule right there now
whenever we click this object we can see
that it now has been strength but we
have these weird orange lines now any
time you're working with constraints and
you see these orange lines it's not good
because it means that you have some kind
of issue something's not working the way
it's supposed to now the reason that we
have this issue right now is the way we
position this is we need two rules first
we need to say where we want it to be
positioned horizontally and the other
one is where we want it to be positioned
vertically now that first thing we did
it just takes care of the horizontal
position it gives it a little bit of
padding on the right hand side now if
you click this little red arrow then
it's going to give you some more detail
it says neat constraint
for y-position so essentially it's
Jelena Micic hey Bucky you told me where
to position it left and right but now I
need to know where to position it up and
down so let's go ahead and back by
clicking structure and do that right now
so probably the easiest way that we can
do this is this go ahead and click this
again and hold down control and drag it
back up to the view and now we want to
add another constraint and this
constraint can just be top space to top
layout guide this pretty much means just
butt it up against that top layout guide
right under the status bar so now
whenever we click it it now knows how to
position it horizontally and vertically
so what we can do is just run the
simulator and test this out all right
pretty cool pretty cool all right it's
gonna work this time all right so check
it out so I'm like before when this
button was way off over in no-man's land
right now it's in the top right corner
well let's go ahead and try to rotate it
something's probably going to mess up
rotate right oh look at that
looking good no matter what way we
rotate it and also if we ran it on an
iPad simulator on iPhone 6 it would
always appear in the top right pretty
stinkin awesome so it follows those
rules but now we have to fix all these
other things as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
