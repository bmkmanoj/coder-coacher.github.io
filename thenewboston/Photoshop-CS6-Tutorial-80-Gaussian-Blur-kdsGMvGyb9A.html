Photoshop cs6 tutorial and in this
tutorial I want to teach you about the
Gaussian blur or as other people like to
call it in a different one the Gaussian
blur but I'm gonna say Gaussian because
that's the way I was taught in school it
might not be the right way but that's
the way I've always said it and it's
hard to break now so let's get going
into what that blur actually is so to me
the Gaussian blur is my favorite blur
it's softer than the box blur so it's a
and it blurs like everything using like
a mathematical formula that's kind of
hard to explain actually really hard to
explain if you really want to know the
mathematical formula go ahead and just
type in the Gaussian blur formula under
in Google or something like that and see
what see what pops up so it can be used
to smooth details in an image blur
something like way out it can be used to
add like a soft focus to an image and
among other kind of things I'm not going
to list every single thing that the
Gaussian blur can do but you'll find
lots of different uses for it so first
let's just see what it does on its own
so let's go select my layer filter blur
Gaussian blur so pretty much it's just
your basic looking blur there you go and
that's pretty much what it does
adjusting the radius obviously to the
right makes it a stronger blur and to
let more is a weaker blur so you can see
that and you can move around inside the
box here the preview box to see
different patches if you would like to
or you can just check the preview box
here to have the different preview or to
have a preview on the main image here
this square that's on the main image you
can use that to pretty much like select
the area you want to look at in this
smaller box over here so I can go on
Joby's face over here and that's what's
gonna appear over here in the image or
in the preview box so that's what the
Gaussian blur is it's my favorite blur I
use it all the time so I'm going to
cancel and I'm gonna show you like one
use I like to use Gaussian blur for and
then it's to create like a focus now
everybody in this picture when you look
at it you can pretty much see this
person which is me in the front and
everybody else in the back and what I
want to do is kind of like blur these
guys out while keeping me in focus
because I'm in the front so what I'm
gonna do is duplicate my layer here and
I'm going to use an elliptical marquee
here for my selection and just make this
and I'll do something like this so it
gets like just like me in there I guess
so I'm like something like that around
there and a feather out your image and
somewhere like five is good it depends
on how big your picture is honestly and
we'll go from there so make sure it's
feathered and then we're gonna add a
layer mask into it and you do that by
clicking on this button here while this
layer is selected so this adds a layer
mask and it uses our selection to punch
a hole into the layer mask pretty much
now what I can do is blur the bottom
layer while keeping this selection that
I made untouched by the blur so click on
your bottom layer go to filter and then
add your Gaussian blur and when you when
you're using filters the last filter
that you used and the amount that you
used is saved here at the top and I can
click on it and it'll bring that blur
already into there without me having to
add anything else I'm gonna go back real
quick so I'm gonna control z
I'm just gonna add the blurb manually
from the filter blur menu so Gaussian
blur and I'm just gonna show you as I
move the blur around what's being
blurred and what's not so check out
these guys in the back relative to the
selection that I made and you can see
that how that selection is the rent so
I'm gonna keep it around some like two I
just type in two to keep it as a soft
blur here hit OK and you can see the
difference here
if I the bottom layer I'm gonna turn on
and turn off the bottom layer and you
can see what's going on with that and
then the top layer you can see if I turn
it off everything's blurred if I turn it
on now this section that I made as a
selection is now more in focus and then
the back layer so that's what the how
one way to at least use the Gaussian
blur is and at some point I may teach
more ways or or use a project where I
use a Gaussian blur in a different way
and I plan on doing some projects after
I get like all the basics down in these
tutorials that I'm making so look
forward to that in the future and in the
meantime you just experiment with the
blur and see what you like so that's the
end of this tutorial
and thank you for watching this one and
I'll show you some more cool filters and
effects in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
