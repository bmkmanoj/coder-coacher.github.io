little a little ooh alright that should
be my intro for every tutorial but uh I
don't know probably not what am I
talking about alright welcome back and
in this video what I'm going to show you
guys is the bare basics of how to work
with github using Android studio and of
course this is not a github tutorial
series I'm gonna assume that you guys
already know what github is and a little
bit about version control and uh yeah if
you don't then I actually have a
tutorial series on it
pretty much allows you to a build
software with like a team of people or
work on cool open-source software
together so the first thing you need of
course is a github account so go to
github calm and create an account and
then once you have that hop back in here
and we already start learning how to use
it in Android studio so the first thing
i preffer should mention is this i made
a brand new project this is just you
know as I have always done it just has
that default text label actually want to
change this so my project I named clam
blaster because I know that was first
thing that popped in my head
oddly enough so I'm just going to take
some label and you don't even need to do
this I just don't like that default text
label I don't have a little grudge
against it you know say bust some clams
alright so now we have you know now it's
ours
you know has that more personal feel to
it so say that we created this awesome
app like I have right now I'm like you
know what I need the world to see this
app I'm gonna make this project public
so anyone can download it helped build
it work on it together so the first
thing we need to do before we actually
take this and put on github is we need
to prepare it for version control so if
you go up here to VCS this stands for
version control you can select enable
version control integration so what we
wanted to do is since we're working with
git and not subversion or anything we're
going to choose get and select okay so
what this does
is it pretty much takes this project and
it creates a git repository
now with this git repository we can go
ahead and take that and put it on github
now another thing I want to point out is
this let me expand some of these files
you see that after you do that your
filenames they turn to red and this just
indicates that ok you didn't actually
push anything to github yet so you just
created a local repository on your own
computer now if you look at github and I
refreshes I see that I don't have any
repositories nothing changed on the
website so now we have to figure out how
do we take this and actually share on
the website so the world can see well if
you go up to VCS again and you go to
import into version control you can
select the option share project on
github so the very first time that you
do this it's going to ask you to log in
to your github account your github
username and password however after that
what you can do is you can just set up a
password and this is just a met a master
password for quicker logins so I'm going
to type mine in right there and hit OK
and it says ok you don't have the set up
on github already so I'm going to assume
that you want to create a brand new
repository which we do so this is our
project and for the description I'll
just write like best Android app ever
since that is a pretty accurate
description now I'm going to hit share
and after I do that it's going to give
me this little pop-up right here so this
is pretty much saying that do you want
to share all of the project files well
yes we do we want to take these this
entire project that we were working on
and we want to pretty much push it to
github to make a public repository now
the default commit message is just
initial commit since this is our very
first commit and hit OK it says
successfully share project on github so
now if we look on github and refresh all
of those files this entire
project is now available for the world
to see pretty sweet all right so that's
it that's how you take a project in
Android studio and add it to github so
now you're like oh you know what I
actually need to make some changes
through this what I want to do is this
instead of bust some clams I'm going to
change this to bust some hams and all
right
that is much better since I don't know
maybe we're changing this project the
hand blaster whatever so after we make
some changes look at this the file name
they turn blue and whenever it turns
blue it indicates that this local
project is different than the main
github repository it pretty much
indicates that something is different so
what we need to do now is we need to
figure out how to take these changes and
push them to our github repo and that is
actually really simple the only thing
that we have to do is this now you can
go to VCS and choose commit changes or
if you notice whenever you create a
repository it gives you these nice
little shortcut icons so this button
right here is the commit button so if we
hit that and if I resize this up at the
top it says okay these are the files on
your local machine that are different
than your github repository and since we
only change one file that's why we have
that now the commit message will just
say um we'll just say like change the
label text to ham
alright looks pretty good now what we
can do is we can just hit commit and it
will commit it but if we just want to
commit and push all at once then we can
do that as well so now it says that is
it it uh let me do my thing and this is
just a little verification are you sure
you want to do that Buckey yep
just take these and push it into what it
does is it takes all those changes and
pushes it to your github account so now
if you refresh this you now have the
updated project and you can navigate and
verify that if you want but we trust it
so that is pretty much that how you add
a project github and also after you make
some changes how you can through Android
studio pretty much push those changes to
your public repository on github</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
