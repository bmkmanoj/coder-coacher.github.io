keyframes and everything is the J in
Kaiba and will move between keyframes so
that is very useful the page up and page
down button on your key frame will move
or on your keyboard I mean will move
page down moves it forward one frame
page up moves it back one frame so that
way you can get really precise hold
shift and hit page down you'll go up ten
frames
shift page up will go back ten frames if
you need really really precise key
frames you can zoom in really far and
then you can see where each key frame
where each frame is and then you can go
frame back for him if you really need to
sometimes you might I've used it this
way before it's a pretty useful and then
you can just either use this up here to
zoom back out or use this again to zoom
back out down here either or
now also if you have this twirl down and
you need to find all your keyframes if
you hit you it will show all your
animated values if you hit you you twice
in six yep succession really quick it'll
show all the change the values so if I
change
another tip will too
will be to how to add a keyframe in the
middle of something when you don't want
to actually change the value you just
want to add a keyframe maybe you want to
edit later or something like that you
can click on this button here which it
shows like a little diamond click on it
and I'll add a keyframe instead of and
if you don't want to use the J and K
buttons to move to keyframe the keyframe
you can click on these arrows here but
it's faster to use J and K and unless
you're already over here so can leave
that keyframe in there if you use if you
switch to the pen tool pressing G or
coming up here go into the pen tool you
can add points on the motion path add
keyframes when it turns into a plus if
you see you can see right now the icon
is just a pen and now it's a pen with a
plus and as you see I added another
keyframe in there and it is down here on
the bottom so that's a quick that's an
overview of how to edit your keyframes
and there are more ways to edit your
keyframes and different types of
keyframes and other things that we'll be
going over in a later tutorial but for
now it's about time we head out I got to
go catch a fish fry down at the local
Legion and the Penguins and versus New
York Rangers hockey game is on so I'll
be watching that also and I think Bucky
is at one of the add that hockey game
right now so wish his team luck and
hopefully you guys know which one it is
I'm not going to tell you you'll have to
figure it out or ask him so have a good
one guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
