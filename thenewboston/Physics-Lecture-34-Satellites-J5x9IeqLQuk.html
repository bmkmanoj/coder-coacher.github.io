your 34th physics lesson and in this
lesson I want to talk to you guys about
satellites but before I start rambling
on about satellites I'm gonna say this
you guys better get ready to use your
imagination because this example is
going to be really crazy but it's the
only way that I know to demonstrate
satellites so go ahead and picture earth
right here
pretty good earth I'll label it for you
earth the greatest strong ever now
imagine that you were feeling really
ambitious one day because you know
you're tired of playing xbox so you
decided to go to North Pole
and build a tallest the tallest building
ever created so here's you standing on
top of your building yeah this is my
building
look world look what I did I'm the best
you say that because you know you're
kind of cocky you're so cocky and so
stupid that aside from standing on top
of a big building at the North Pole you
thought it would be funny to bring a
potato gun with you why guys I don't
know you're kind of weird but anyways
what you did is you made this potato gun
and you decided to shoot out a potato
so the first potato you shot out was
basically traveling like this where it
crashed into India somewhere because the
force of gravity since it's sucking
everything towards the center of the
earth the potato pretty much gave in to
that force of gravity and made smashed
potatoes or mashed potatoes over in
India just basically whenever you shoot
a gun out I don't know maybe you're
hunting in real life the bullet is going
to get closer and closer to the ground
because gravity like everything else on
earth is sucking everything towards the
center of the earth so then you're like
you know what that's not what I wanted
to happen I'm going to tune my gun up a
little bit maybe you added more co2 or
gunpowder
however the heck you know you make a
potato gun and you decided that this
potato was going to go further so you
know you ramped this baby up and you
shot out the next potato and it was like
boom and it went on forever dude
freaking people keep texting me during
my story I'm going to dropkick my phone
but anyways this potato right here you
put way too much gunpowder in this even
though gravity was pulling it on pulling
on the potato a little bit since you
shot it so hard the potato overcame the
force of gravity and it pretty much
acted as a rocket it's like goodbye
cruel world in the momentum from the
potato would send it moving through
space forever so again two forces are
acting on the potato first of all the
momentum or the power or force from the
gun which is causing it to move away
from the gun but also the force of
gravity which is caused by the earth and
it's sucking it towards the center of
the earth so that's why instead of
perfectly straight like out here the
potato had kind of a curved path and
eventually overcame gravity so it's
going to go on forever and ever
but that's why the path is curved a
little bit because gravity was sucking
on it you know if gravity sucks and
doesn't push or whatever but now you're
like dude I don't want to make mashed
potatoes but this was way too much
almost blew my arms off so then I'm
going to put it directly in the middle
whatever potato gun meter you have so
you shot this last one out and here's
what happened it travelled like this
boom and hit you right in the back of
the head and you're scratching your head
because you never took a physical class
before so you didn't know why this
happened well the reason for this is
just the right amount of thrust would
keep your potato satellite orbiting
around the earth because these two
forces which is a the force of the
potato or the force from the gun which
causes the potato to have momentum and
be the force of gravity would balance
out perfectly and actually what would
happen is those two forces would cause
this potato to orbit around the Earth
forever and ever and ever
now this is actually how satellites work
whenever they launch those in space on a
whoever launch of satellites NASA
probably they're able to orbit around
the
earth without crashing down in the
ground or getting lost in space because
these two forces balance out perfectly
so guys that is how satellites work and
that is what would happen if you ever
built you know a huge building at the
North Pole and launched potato guns or
launched potatoes out of your potato gun
so I think you guys for watching don't
forget to subscribe and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
