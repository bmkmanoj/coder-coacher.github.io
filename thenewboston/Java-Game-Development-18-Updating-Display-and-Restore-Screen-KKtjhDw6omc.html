18th drop game development story and in
this story we're going to be building
our update method to update this play so
you know enough talking let's just go
ahead and get started
you heard enough of me talking updates
display two plays what updates display
public void we'll just name it update if
you want name yours up mate can but why
would you do a silly thing like that
so public void update first we need to
get our window object and of course this
would be our vc dots get full screen
window so now W is pretty much equal to
what you're seeing and now we need to
test if what you're seeing if W equals
no if you see nothing
then this pretty much means if you see
something other than nothing so if you
see something then what do you wanted to
do buffer this is party type slow so I
don't F anything up but for strategy s
equals W dot get buffer strategy so now
your s object is equal to the window get
buffer strategy is equal to the your
windows strategy and what you want to do
in here is you need that s because you
need a test for it if s dot contents
lost
now this contents lost method is a
boolean method it's going to either
return true or false so if the contents
are not lost that means you have
contents there you want something to
look at so let's go ahead and if you
have something look at then just show it
on your screen now why do we need a test
for this because if the contents get
lost on one of our updates then we're
going to have nothing to look at and if
it shows us nothing to look at
then we're going to get flickering or
we're going to get a weird display or
something like that so only when we have
something to look at that's when we want
to call that show method
again if we have no contents and it try
to show its going to show us like a
black screen or it's going to flicker or
something like that so this method
updates and only shows us the contents
when they're good so pretty cool huh
so now aside from update what do we need
to do um well let's go ahead and make
return full screen window we're going to
need this later on to public it's going
to be a window object of course get full
screen window and all this is going to
do it's not going to take any parameters
it's just gonna write their return video
card get full screen window so make sure
Hey look they've been lined up so now I
can make sure they match easily how cool
is that this tutorials getting cooler
and cooler or with a second now the last
couple things we need to do actually we
need about four more methods but two of
them are going to go by a like a piece
of cake we're going to build it two
methods to get the width and get the
height of our first full screen window
and this was if you remembered up here
get width width and get height and this
is pretty much for testing resolution so
public and get width right there it's
not going to take any parameters get
width and this is window W equals video
card get fourth screen window again
since we need to tell it what window we
want to get the width of and let's put
if W is not equal to null so if it
actually has a window return W dot get
with so return the width of that window
and get width is actually a built-in
method and we're just going to build our
own right here so it's actually both
else um if it actually is equal to null
if we don't have anything to work with
return zero so this is her current
this is you're gonna return on the width
of your window and if it doesn't have a
window then just say the value is zero
easy enough
and forget height we could go ahead and
we could go ahead and type this all
again but I found out about this cool
thing named copy and paste so I'm going
to try that get height and get height
and now I can make sure get height so
now we have two methods get width which
returns the width of our window and get
height which returns the height of our
window and I guess we have time to build
one more method so in our next tutorial
we're only going to have all that less
so now that we made all these cool
methods to test for everything and
especially to take us to full screen we
need a way to get out of full screen so
get out of since I mean once you run
this game we're probably not going to
want to play it forever
I mean if we build it really good then
we probably will want to play it forever
but some people some crazy people might
not want to play this entire game
forever
so they need a way to exit full screen
so public void restore screen spouts a
good restore screen and now what we need
to do is of course get that window W
equals VC dot get full screen window we
need to get our window store an object
called w1 make sure that it actually has
something if W has something in it then
what do you want to do we want to
dispose of that piece of junk which
pretty much pretty much means throw in
the trash and video card set full screen
window equal to nothing and what this
does is pretty much gets rid of your
window and takes you out of full screen
mode so that was easy enough we learn
about that unless like 10 tutorials ago
but just thought I'd refresh your memory
and now I have one more method to build
in this class and that's pretty much to
make an image compatible with display
but this is going to be not that lengthy
but I mean a little lengthy for the time
we have left so I just want to take the
time we have left to thank you guys and
that's it I'm going to tell you guys to
watch my next tutorial because we're
going to be finally finishing this class
and moving on to running our animation
so thank you guys for watching don't
forget to subscribe and I'll see you
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
