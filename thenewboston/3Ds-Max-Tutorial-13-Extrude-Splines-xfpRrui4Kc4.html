max story oh geez must have whooping
cough or something or swine flu anyways
welcome to your 13th 3d studio max
tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
to be going over how to take an editable
spline and add some depth to it so we
already figured out how to make a
regular spline just by using any of our
drawing tools so I'm going to go to my
top view here and get rid of my grade or
else it's going to annoy me and let's go
over here to the shapes and create a
spline so I'm going to go ahead and make
um just a little shape like this curve
it and keep one right there and you can
make any shape you want it's just I'm
making this one for a very specific
reason that you will see in a little bit
and oh yeah just like that
and not bad close that spline so now I
have this spline right here and I'm
going to go ahead and select it and I'm
going to go ahead and right click this
and convert it to editable spline but I
can't do that with my screen recorder on
it or it'll mess up so you do that and
I'll see in a second alright so now I
took this and I converted it to editable
spline now in my modifiers tab right
here I can I treat it like editable
spline so the first thing I want to do
and this is how you add depth to a
spline let me turn this so you can see
the depth what you need to do is select
it and then you need to go down to your
extrude modifier if I can find it
probably above the FS extrude in BAM
look at that you can change the amount
which is depth in the segments is just 4
well you can probably see in this low
check box right here if I select this
the segments is pretty much how much how
much data there is there so I'm going to
leave it with like only few like that
since we're not going to be really
working with it anyways and again
anytime you want to have add depth you
need to go to your modifiers list and
extrude and that's how you can turn
something that was 2d into 3d and by
changing the amount changes the depth of
it pretty much so
let me go ahead and select this and get
rid of my extrude in for everything I
want to do that just want to get rid of
my extrude modifier so what I'm going to
do now is add something called a lathe
this and I think a lathe
I'm not sure where the name come from
exactly but like whenever whenever you
put something like you're creating
pottery and you put it on that thing
that spins it around and like molds it
like I don't know like you're making
pottery I guess I think that's a lathe
if I'm wrong leave me a comment and tell
me if I'm right leave me a comment tell
me I'm right I need to learn something
but anyways that's what pretty much it
does do this so that's why I'm guessing
so in order to do this make a lathe and
what that does is also take this 2d
spline and make it 3d we need to select
it and for the modifier you can probably
guess what this is lathe and I might
have can be saying you're wrong so now
we have different options right here
this is the center of it this is the min
which I want and that's why I created it
and this is the max each one spins it
different way and gives you a different
portion so what that did is pretty much
took that spline and spun it around
until it made a 3d shape so that's why I
picked that since I made a nice little
glass right here so if you wanted why
the F did I make that weird shape that's
why I want to show it to you guys so
that is pretty much the basics of how
you take a my or excuse me an editable
spline and make it 3d again that's the
extrude modifier let me select that
extrude modifier and that would be
facing shirred or lathe right there so
those are two different ways depending
on what you want to do to make it 3d so
in the next tutorial we're going to be
going over editable polygons and that is
the advanced way that you edit on 3d
shapes so I just wanted to give you guys
a quick tutorial on how to work with 2d
and converting to 3d so thank you guys
for watching the next couple tutorials
probably next three tutorials are
probably going to be the most important
in this whole entire series series so
make sure to check them out but again
thank you don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
