biology tutorial and in this tutorial
we're going to start talking about cells
now I know that we talked a little bit
about cells before and we know things
like all living things are made up of
these smaller living things called cells
and also the cell is basically the
smallest living piece of an organism but
what I want to do in the next couple of
videos is I want to take a cell and I
want to break it up into the smaller
pieces so inside a cell are smaller
pieces called organelles so organelles
now each organelle does a specific job
much like the organs in your body so
these are actually pretty easy to
remember and in the next couple of
videos like I said I'm going to be
taking each organelle and going over it
specifically and by the time I'm done
going over every organelle you guys are
going to understand how a cell is put
together made and what its job is now
before we get into all that I want to go
ahead and talk to you guys about the way
that biologists categorize different
cells so the first type I want to talk
to you guys about is called Pro
carry-outs
and the other type of might as well
write it right now is
eukaryotes so even though you know I
know I didn't talk to you guys about the
specific types of organelles and what
they do but prokaryotes are cells like
bacteria there are a lot different than
animals and plant cells so just right
bacteria are prokaryotes in animals
humans even though we are animals and
plants those are all something called
eukaryotes now another way that they
differ is prokaryotic cells they don't
have a true nucleus and I know that you
guys don't know what a nucleus it but uh
again this is but this would be a lot
easier to explain if I talked to you
guys about the organelles already but
just remember no nucleus in the nucleus
is pretty much the brain of the cell and
no organelles and eukaryotic cells of
course they do have a nucleus and um
they do have I'll just put organelles so
in the next couple of videos I'm going
to be talking mostly about eukaryotes
and that's mostly what we're focused on
whenever we talk about biology unless
you go into you know field that's pistou
specifically specifically studies
bacteria or prokaryotes most people are
concerned with the you know finding
diseases or you know just learning about
the human body so most people are
concerned with eukaryotic cells
eukaryotes so that's what I'm going to
be talking about in the next couple of
videos so let's go ahead and get started
and the first piece of the cell I want
to talk about is called the plasma
membrane
now the plasma membrane is also called
the cell membrane and if you guys
remember from the last couple videos I
said that the membrane was basically the
skin of the cell now I say the skin
because it's job is to surround the cell
and protect it from the outside
environment now while I'm talking about
this i mighta just go ahead and mention
that the inside of the cell the fluid
inside is called the cytoplasm so
cytoplasm is pretty much the fluid
inside the cell and the skin of the cell
is called the plasma membrane or some
people also call it the cell membrane
but I'm typically going to be calling it
the plasma membrane because I think
that's the more technical term and
another thing that I want to mention
real quick is that plant cells have a
special thing called a cell wall so cell
wall plants only so again even though
that humans animals and plants are all
eukaryotes like this plant cells in
animal cells differ a little bit I'm
going to be talking about the
differences later on but for right now
the only difference is that plants have
something called a cell wall and a cell
wall is just a more solid and rigid
structure that goes around the cell but
plasma membrane cell membrane is
basically the skin of the cell what
surrounds it and inside the cell is
cytoplasm so I actually ran out of time
in this tutorial but in the next video
what I want to do is I want to take a
closer look at the plasma membrane and I
want to show you guys exactly what it's
made of because in the last tutorial I
talked about things like carbohydrates
and lipids and actually the plasma
membrane is made up of a lot of those
things that you guys are going to find
very familiar but for now thank you guys
for watching don't forget subscribe and
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
