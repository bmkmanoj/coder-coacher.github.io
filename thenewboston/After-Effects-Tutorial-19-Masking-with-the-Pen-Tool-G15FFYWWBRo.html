Effects tutorial and in this tutorial
I'm going to be showing you how to use a
pen to create masks and also some
options when you're creating a mask with
a pen so go ahead and double click
whatever your sources and your layer
panel should pop up
go ahead expand that so you can see and
now you can go ahead and grab your pen
tool and the first thing we want to do
is make sure this roto Azir is not
checked so if it has a check on it click
it and it shouldn't be checked so let's
go ahead and start creating a masked by
the same way we create a shape remember
just start clicking anytime you just
click it makes a straight line anytime
you click and drag it makes a curved
line so just go ahead and make a simple
mask and go ahead and connect it and
actually I want to change my background
so that is how you make a simple mess
and if you want to select the pen tool
on the shortcut is G or you just can
click up here to select it but again any
time you want to do that you select G
and any time you want to temporarily use
the selection tool all you have to do is
while you have your pen tool selected go
ahead and hold the ctrl key and as you
see it temporarily changes to the
selection tool so you can edit a
keyframe so any time that you're in the
middle of drawing a mass instead of
having to change from back to here back
to here just hold ctrl and no
temporarily change but once you have
your entire mask created we recommend
that you press V and when I said we
recommend I mean I recommend just to
permanently change to your selection
tool so that's a that way you can edit
it a lot easier and another cool thing
that you guys will might want to know
anytime you hold ctrl o and click as you
can see it kind of turns into a Flying V
just like when you're drunk shapes
whenever you click this all your curved
point change your straight points
so that is how you can change a curve
point to a straight point using just
that little shortcut hold down control
all on your keyboard and go ahead and do
that now another cool thing that I want
to show you guys is how to add a vertex
using your pen tool now go ahead and
select your pencil or press G again and
whenever you do any time you hover over
a line where there is in the keyframe
your pen changes to a little pen with a
plus sign on it and this means that if
you click it adds a keyframe right there
so you can go ahead and edit that any
time that you hover over with your
pencil that already is an existing
keyframe your pen change so - and you
can subtract the keyframe right there so
that is how you can add and subtract
keyframes and that's pretty much all it
is to making custom masks with the pen
tool so let me go ahead and delete this
mask and let me show you on what I meant
when I said on what that road of zero is
what the roto Bezier is is and I don't
know if I'm saying or right because I
learned it from reading in the book but
it pretty much is just a way to create
automatic curves so go ahead and select
your pen tool again and make sure that
it's checked this time and not unchecked
and if you go ahead and start creating
things unlike last time we're
automatically made straight lines this
automatically makes curved lines and
instead of clicking and dragging to make
curved lines whenever you click and drag
it out it just moves the entire keyframe
so that's the difference between a
regular pen tool and a roto Bezier pen
tool and as you see you can close that
just like this now in the last tutorial
I went over all these masked properties
except the mask path and what mask path
was is just a way to animate your mask
pretty much so for example go ahead and
click this and our mask is kind of in
the top left corner right now let's go
ahead and
move it - five seconds and then let's go
ahead and put ctrl T and actually it's a
lot easier if we do it here highlight
your mask put ctrl T and in five seconds
we'll go ahead and move it over here so
now we can see in our mask path it's
going to move from the top left to the
bottom right so now if we go ahead and
play that as you can see it's moving in
top left to bottom right and this is
just like position and the other one but
mask path is pretty much the same thing
as mass position or excuse me mask
position except it's not on your main
frame so that's a real easy way to use
that
so again um that's how you use the pen
tool and the pen tool with a roto Bezier
to make custom mask paths and also what
the mask path is is pretty much a way
that you can animate your path it's the
same thing as position but it's special
for the mask so that's that for my 19th
tutorial um thank you guys for watching
if you have any questions just send me a
message and I'll try to answer them for
you
