variable so we can use it a bit better
later so we're going to say text equals
dollar underscore post text that just
saves us writing out this dollar
underscore post text again and again
okay so now what we're going to do is
we're going to check if this equals a
value so we'd only be inserting empty
values into our database we want to be
entering at least some text so I'm going
to say if not empty and we're going to
say text so we're referencing text into
here and if not empty text we do
something else I'm going to echo out
remember we're echoing out whatever
output we get from this updating page
we're update up so we're outputting it
into our message div down here so we can
we can give error messages to the user
and it will pop up without refreshing
the page this is the whole point of Ajax
it gives you things a lot quicker and
without refreshing the page it's a lot
easier to deal with so we can say please
type a please type something for example
so let's just go ahead and echo out okay
here just so we know what we're doing
and let's go ahead and submit nothing
okay it says please type something now
let's insert our type Alex click Submit
okay so we know that that's working
that's great now we can start
constructing our query to insert this
data into the database and then check
whether the query was successful or not
so that stops constructing the query
this is quite simple
I have tutorials on this as well so go
back and refer to them as your or your
stack on this bit we're going to say
insert into and now we choose the table
name so if we go back to PHP myadmin we
can see the table name is data so we're
inserting into this data table and then
we say you values and inside parentheses
we're going to supply the amount of
values and the values that we want to
input so we're going to say two values
so we've got two bits of string data
here if you like the first one is an ID
and it's an auto increment so we don't
need to specify a value we can keep this
blank what that will do is the database
will automatically
data to the next number in line in the
increment button here what we need to do
is specify this text here now we do need
to add some level of security so we need
to add we need to basically escape from
this string here and append on this text
variable and then we need to append on
the rest of the string now what we can
do is we can use the MySQL real escape
string function and close that text in
that and the reason we do this is
because SQL injection is possible
whenever we're allowing a user a user a
dynamic user input going into a query
can always a result potentially in SQL
injection so now we're going to say
query underscore run equals MySQL query
and then obviously the query string
inside of there so let's just add this
into an if statement so we can check if
it's worked
so if query 1 equals MySQL query what
this is going to happen what's going to
happen here sorry is this is going to
return true if the query was a success
so we can say in here success else we
can say failed so let's echo failed up
knowing capitals spent Road so failed
and then otherwise here we can say echo
data inserted for example ok so now
let's run back to our browser and test
this out so as it stands inside our
database we've got no values in here so
MySQL returned an empty result set ie 0
right so we've got nothing in our
database at the moment or in our table
rather so now I'm just going to pop my
name in there and I'm going to click
Submit so it says data inserted so now I
can presume that the data is being
inserted into the database let's go in
and let's click on browse and you can
see that it has in fact inserted this
data let's go ahead and type something
else so we'll type down click Submit and
we get the same message back again
hasn't changed I presumed that that has
just we given me the data inserted very
echo and yeah it's inserted more data so
now we can start and start to insert
different data and whatever we want so
there's not really much a much point to
this application itself but hopefully
from this tutorial you can go away with
your knowledge now of the post the post
data or posting data using Ajax as
opposed to using get data and you can
apply it to your own your own uses so
we've gone through the Ajax stage of
things we've gone through the HTML on
the div and we've also more importantly
gone through the PHP and how we can
combine that with Ajax and taking our
post variable in order to post a value
to the database or insert a value into a
database</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
