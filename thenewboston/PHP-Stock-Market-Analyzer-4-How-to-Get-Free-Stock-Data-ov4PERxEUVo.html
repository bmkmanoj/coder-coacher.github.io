fourth PHP stock analysis tutorial and
in this lesson what I'm gonna be doing
is I'm gonna be teaching you the first
little tip I have for you know I said
I'm gonna be teaching you guys a couple
of cool things this is one of those cool
things so you know how I said what we're
gonna be building in this program is
basically a program we can input a
formula and it takes a bunch of
historical stock data and it test it
against it well we obviously need a
bunch of historical stock data all the
stock data for like the last ten years
or something to get a good reading so
what we could do is we could go to
Google type in historical stock data and
we'll get a bunch of websites where we
would have to buy it maybe for you know
a hundred dollars two hundred dollars a
month and we could do that but there's a
better idea if you go to yahoo.com and
look under the finance section on the
left-hand side you could type in any
company sticker let's say Google which
is goog and hit enter now here's the
information from the day and on the left
hand side there's a section called
historical prices go ahead and click
that and what it allows you to do is
input a range of dates your starting day
in your ending date and then you go
ahead and hit get prices and then what
it's going to do is it's gonna give you
a chart of the historical prices for the
company in that range of dates it's
gonna give you the date which is of
course you know the day obviously and
let me just go ahead and read these
through in case you guys don't know
anything about stocks or very little the
open is the very first price it opens at
whenever at the very beginning of the
day I'll say that's the price of open
high is how high did the stock price
reach that day low is how low did it
reach closes at the end of the day what
was the stock price so at the beginning
of the day is open and is closed volume
is how many shares or how many stocks
were traded during that date and
adjusted close most of the time this is
the same as closed it's just if there
have any errors whenever they are
calculating it then they need to adjust
them anyways we're typically just going
to be using closed instead of adjusted
closed because they're the same thing we
do
both so with that being said what we can
do is we can use this data and we can
grab it in a couple ways we need this
data in our data base to test against so
one way is we could pay some guy you
know I don't know minimum wage to go
ahead and sit and type this for hours
upon hours into our database or what we
could do is at the very bottom there's a
little link that says download to
spreadsheet now whenever we hover over
this link or whenever we click it we get
a spreadsheet or CSV file that kind of
looks like this now it gives us a CSV
file which is basically a comma
separated file and if you ever work with
Microsoft Excel these are the types of
files that it uses basically a bunch of
data separated by commas on different
lines so we can go ahead and type in you
know maybe we're analyzing 500 different
companies go ahead and type in our
company name and then go to historical
prices and then download all the data
for that do it 500 different times
however we are computer programmers we
know a little bit about computer program
and so we're gonna do this the easy way
we're gonna use Yahoo in a way that they
probably didn't intend us to use it for
if we go ahead and hover over this
download to spreadsheet notice in the
status bar on Google Chrome and now the
status bar is in the bottom left and
it's that big long link that pops up
that says I charted com table now all of
that crap after isn't just a random crap
it's actually information that we can
utilize and kind of you know take
advantage of so in order to get that
link just go ahead and right click this
download to spreadsheet and hit copy
link address and now it copies that huge
long string that was on the bottom so
now I'm just gonna go ahead and delete
this close this and we're gonna create a
new file so we can start coding this
program file new and I'm just gonna go
ahead and save this in my main directory
not my includes and what can we name
this stock downloader dot PHP now go
ahead and click and see
this and let me just paste this in right
now before I start coding it I want to
talk to you guys about what all these
symbols mean in how we can use them
first
this is the regular URL we don't need to
mess with anything after that but after
this s is basically the company's ticker
that you remember all those things we
typed in there the reason we want to put
them in a separate text file is because
we're gonna be treating them as
variables and looping and pretty much
plugging them in here and it's gonna
download all of the files automatically
so we can go make a grilled cheese
sandwich it's gonna download 500 a
thousand files for us well we don't have
to do anything it's an awesome program
trust me
this D right here is what was the the D
is the current month subtracted you
pretty much take the current month and
since this is January it's 1 and you
subtract one from it so cuz 0 to 11 just
remember to start at 0 and it's kind of
like an array now this e right here is
the current day since it's January 3rd
you put 0 for D in 3 for 3rd and F of
course is the current year or the ending
year now for this stuff right over here
excuse me I have to swallow G just go
ahead and leave that at the 10 is
basically or excuse me a is basically
the beginning month that you want to use
so since this is 7 it's actually the 8th
month which is August B 19 is the
beginning day in C is the beginning year
so basically we're saying okay grab the
stock data from Google from what is it 7
19 2004 until today in that way we can
kind of add whatever values we want in
here and what we're gonna be doing
eventually is we're gonna be treating
all these values as variables so we can
have say I don't know make a website
where the user can input their own stuff
and it could download it forum so what
we want to do is we want to use this in
a function but I just wanted to explain
what all of those little symbols mean so
now that we kind of you know stole some
stuff from Yahoo we were ready to pick
this apart and start utilizing it in an
awesome program so there you go that's
how you get free stock debt instead of
you know paying for all of it it's kind
of you know I don't know not the most
proper way to do stuff but it's the way
I'm gonna teach you guys so for now
thank you guys for watching over get
subscribed and in the next tutorial I'm
gonna show you guys how to use variables
and make this baby start working so
thank guys for watching I'll see you
then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
