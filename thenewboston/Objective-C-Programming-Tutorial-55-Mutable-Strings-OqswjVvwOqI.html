your 55th objective-c tutorial awesome
and in this story we're gonna be talking
about mutable strings in comparison to
what we carried before and that was
immutable strings so what is mutable
string it's pretty much a string that
you can mutate or change now in the last
couple of tutorials we made strings that
were basically just static and you know
we could do something so might count how
long they were we could make copies of
it we can make a copy of it in
uppercase' but we could never change the
string itself like adding stuff to the
middle of it however in this tutorial
we're gonna be able to make sure is that
we can mutate pretty cool way so let's
go ahead and you know get typing some
code so let's go ahead and make a
regular string n - string and I'm just
gonna name this like dog because let me
think of a cool dog saying you can type
anything in you don't have to follow me
Pig hot dog hot fog hot dog I thought
you said pumpkin see these are the crazy
things that pop in my head when I don't
prepare for tutorials so now after we
create just a regular string let's go
ahead and create a blank mutable string
and in order to create a mutable string
it's different class it's NS mute a bull
string and I'm gonna name this so you
guys can easily tell I'm gonna name it
mute but you can name it anything you
want so the most simple thing in
probably what you commonly want to do is
you want to be able to create a mutable
string from a non mutable string so in
order to do this go ahead and take your
mute and set it equal to and we're going
to call a method NS mutable string oh it
already knew
and remember string with string ruh
means replace this string with what
string and all you do is pass in dog
and in essence what it does is say
alright I want to create a mutable
string from the string dog and I want to
store that string in mute so now it
doesn't change dog at all but what it
does is now Mew is the same string as
dog but mute is mutable pretty cool huh
so now that we have a mutable string
let's just go ahead and print out NS log
app and let's just go ahead and you know
we don't have to type us sing to hat and
mute now this is gonna look the exact
same as a regular string hot dog I
thought you said pumpkin the only
difference between the mutable strings
and immutable strings are unmute or
think it's immutable is that hold on got
it each in my I see I only have itching
when I am doing tutorials or playing
guitar hero I don't know why but soon is
I'm not allowed to that's when I start
itching so anyways was I saying I
probably nothing too important a mutable
string looks the same is it immutable
strength but you can change a mutable
string so don't believe me you say
alright let's go ahead and do it right
now see another common thing that you're
gonna want to do is since you can mutate
this let's go ahead and insert some
characters in it so we need method let's
go ahead and calm you since that's our
mutable string and the method to insert
characters is insert string and as your
parameter what you need to do is first
type what you want to insert what string
or what text and let's put like
let's put like the sauce so it'll be
like hot dog sauce instead of just hot
dog
and is your second parameter at index I
mean you need to tell it what you want
to insert sauce and you need to tell it
where you wanted to go and we say at
index six and that should be one two
three four five six so that should be
right if I counted correctly
copy and paste that so building and run
and check this out our original string
hot dog I thought you said pumpkin our
new mutated shrink hot dog insert sauce
got hot dog sauce I thought you said
pumpkin what a great story we have going
on so far so you know definitely doesn't
make sense at all but the point is our
program runs we learned about in search
strings pretty cool so another cool
thing you're going to want to do is
you're going to want to add a string
just right to the end of your string I
guess
add a new string to it so instead of
just counting out the indexes there's a
separate function that you can just add
stuff right on and that's append string
and whatever you type in here is just
going to pop at the end so what can you
say after I thought you said pumpkin
just like my bad and let's just go ahead
and print this baby out again so the
cool thing about this method is you
don't have to count all of your
characters and pick what one is the end
you can just append it and it
automatically poppy on the end so a bit
high thoughts to us I thought you said
pumpkin my bad and this runs under the
other line but you know no big deal
it's still cool still cool so what can
we do now oh the last thing I want to
teach you guys is how to delete a range
of characters now you know that each of
these characters numbered 0 2 you know
whatever probably like 30 or whatever in
this case and you know what arranges
from last time like like say this is 10
to 20 so the range of this would be 10
to 20 make it a substring so in order to
delete a range of characters here's what
you need to do call the method on the
string up cos mutate above string once I
get typed mute
delete characters arranged just look at
that I already typed it for us
so NS make range and now what you need
to pass it for argument is of course the
range and the coordinates which is first
what character are starting it and well
I'm second so it must be like 12 or
something and let's say we're gonna
delete 20 so this pretty much means all
right what character do you want to
start at the 12th character and how many
characters after that do you want to
delete 20 so in essence this is from the
12th the 32nd character we're deleting
so now after this is just go ahead and
print this baby out copy and print oops
I accidentally hit enter embarrassing
and so what did we delete so this string
before it was hotdog Hauss I thought you
said pumpkin my bed and a hot dog sauce
pumpkin my bed so evidently we deleted
this right here so our coordinates 12
evidently this was 12 right here in 20
characters after that expanded all the
way to I thought you said so our new was
hot dog sauce pumpkin you know I could
have had something cool that it made
sense either way even if he deleted it
but you know I don't got time for that I
got stuff to do so I got tutorials to
teach you know what I mean so anyways
that is pretty much the basics of a
mutated mutate Abel mutable string and
there are a couple other really common
stuff that I'm gonna be teaching next
oriole it's a very essential dish very
essential that you watch Oprah so
anyways thank you guys for watching all
the source code is going to be in the
link below if you want it so uh yeah
thanks again don't forget to subscribe
and I'll see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
