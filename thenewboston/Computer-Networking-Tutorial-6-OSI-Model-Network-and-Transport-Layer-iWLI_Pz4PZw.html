see six I believe networking tutorial
and in this tutorial tutorial we're
going to be talking about the network
layer and I know how brilliant illy they
named the network layer in networking so
the network layer is above the data link
layer and the job of the network layer
is to control the passage of packets
along routes in the network and a packet
is pretty much a unit of data that's
pretty much they format it to send it as
a signal over a network so pretty much
what we have so far is we have all this
binary code 1 1 0 0 and this is the
physical layer and what the data link
layer is is put this in an envelope and
it puts address of the sender and it
puts the address of the receiver there's
a nice little envelope we have right
here and here was our two layers before
what the network layer is going to do is
pretty much put a stamp on that envelope
and send it on its way so that's pretty
much the job of the network layer and
again it pretty much reads packet a
protocol address information and it
sends the packet along the fastest route
both physical and logical route and it
just helps transmit the data now what
the network layer does is it pretty much
gathers information from different
networks in different parts on your
network like computers and stuff and
when it gathers all this information the
process of this is called discovery and
that's how it finds the quickest path it
also the last thing that I'm going to be
teaching you I'm certain um let's see
certain layers can only receive data at
a certain rate so fords I mean this
would never happen but
say you can send packets at ten packets
a second and this is extremely slow but
this is just a this is just example and
say your receiver and I'll tell you guys
what this means can only receive package
that five packets a second so what the
network layer would do is take this
packet that's ten packets a second and
split it in half into two five packet
segments now this might not make sense
but I'm trying to just relate you guys
relate it to you guys and so instead of
receiving um one big file that it can't
handle it would receive two smaller
files or packets that it can handle and
again I will clear this up for a later
but this is pretty much what the job of
the network layer is now after this
layer is something called um let me get
rid of this is something called come on
baby delete there we go after the
network layer is something called the
transport layer now what the transport
layers the main job of this is pretty
much to ensure that the data is sent and
received in the same order now when I
was talking to you guys about the routes
of travel um each route has to be
assigned a unique identification value
and the value of this is usually called
the port now the port is identified in
the transport layer let me get out my
drawing tool because drawing is always
fun so say you want to send something
from here to here there are a bunch of
different routes from here to here or
maybe way off in here what the transport
layer does and we'll name this trans so
you guys know what I'm talking about is
it goes through all these ports and it
finds the quickest one and it also
assigns a value for each of these just
like you assign a highway
this helps with error checking and stuff
like that and another thing that the
transport layer do is it breaks or it
sends messages into smaller units when
um let's see how can I explain this when
you have one protocol oh man
I'm not going to you guys aren't going
to understand that but pretty much it
helps with a network layer when sending
um when you have one protocol right here
in this computer can handle things
differently from this computer so pretty
much the transport layer that looks at
all the ports gives them an assignment
number and also helps a network layer
send the data through each one of these
ports so the transport layer in network
layer you pretty much think in our
aren't those like the same thing well
they are very similar to one another but
actually you'll be learning the
differences later and when you check for
errors with your packets and your
information stuff that's when these two
different layers come into play because
they check a bunch of different things
and so Rijo firma for assessing errors
on your network and stuff so those are
pretty much the basics of the network
and the transport layer remember the
network layer um kind of axis is traffic
director and sends your packet along and
the transport layer gets all those
routes final it's the best way to
deliver your information and it sends it
and also checks for errors in ways that
they didn't check for before to ensure
your packets going to get there safely
and securely so again those are the
basics of the network and transport
layers the next layer is a session layer
which we'll be talking about in the next
tutorial so pay attention this there's a
bunch more information online you can
find it at and don't forget to subscribe
my channel thanks for your watch thank
you for watching and I'll see you guys
in the next tutorial thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
