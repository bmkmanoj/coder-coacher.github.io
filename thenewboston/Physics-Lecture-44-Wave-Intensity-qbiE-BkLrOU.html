physics lesson and in this lesson I want
to talk to you guys about intensity of
waves now the intensity of a wave in
everyday language basically means how
high is the wave so of course waves with
greater amplitude means that they are
more intense now let's go ahead and take
a look at a couple examples a and B and
see what the heck I'm talking about so
say we were looking at wave a and it
kind of looked like this right here
pretty normal wave if you ask me but
then we looked at wave B and it looked
something like this as you can see what
we know so far the wave length distance
from here to here is basically the same
as here to here and also the frequency
how many waves per second or how many
cycles per second are the same however
the amplitude or the distance from this
point to this point is the only thing
that's different in wave a and B now of
course the greater amplitude means
greater intensity so if we were looking
at these waves we would say that wave B
was more intense than wave a so why am I
talking to you guys about this when I
should be talking about sound waves
well actually sound waves have a lot to
do with sound intensity especially with
humans because whenever a sound wave is
more intense humans perceive that is a
louder sound so just to give you guys an
idea of you know how intense is what
sound waves are often measured in
something called decibels DB you
probably heard of it before now people
talk normal conversation at around 60
decibels is basically what I'm talking
about right now around 60 decibels now
if I was to whisper somewhere like this
then I would be whispering at around 20
decibels and a rock concert is around
115 decibels so that's when it gets
really loud that's the general idea of
what a decibel is and how much basically
each decibel is now aside from them
I also wanted to point out that waves
decrease intensity with distance so
remember our example where we threw a
rock into the middle of the lake
well this rock obviously whenever we do
that is going to cause ripples around it
around it and around it in a wave
pattern now whenever you drop a rock
into a pond like I said it causes
ripples which are these things these
blue things or waves in the water in a
circular pattern now as the waves move
outward then notice what's going on
first of all what they're doing is
they're getting bigger and bigger but
the intensity of them is getting smaller
and smaller or they're becoming less and
less intense as they move outward why
does this happen you ask well this
happens because even though the inner
ripples right here have the same amount
of energy is the outer ripples right
here the bigger ripples are more spread
out and the energy therefore is more
dispersed so that's why the intensity of
the waves decrease the further they are
away from the source which is this rock
right here and also you know on concept
of sound going back there that's why
music sounds louder the closer you are
to the speaker because sound moves in
all directions in 3d it's kind of like a
speaker is the source in a sphere wood
is basically what sound would look
around it if it was coming in a wave
form so when you're real close to a
speaker the waves might look whoa let me
go ahead and draw you a little graph
here when you're real close to the
speaker the waves might be really
intense like this right here however in
you're really far away even though
they're the same types of waves with the
same frequency the same wavelength it's
essentially the same sound it's just not
as intense or not as much energy in
those sound waves as before</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
