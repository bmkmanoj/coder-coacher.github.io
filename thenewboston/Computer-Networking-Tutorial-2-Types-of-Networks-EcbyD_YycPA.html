second computer networking tutorial and
in this video I want to talk you guys
about the different types of computer
networks now computer networks pretty
much like everything else they can be
classified in many different ways for
example you can classify a personal
network like the one you would have in
your home or a professional for
businesses or you can classify them
according to the different you know
types of computers they have you know a
cellular network for example but
probably the easiest to understand and
probably the best starting point
whenever you're trying to classify
networks is just classify them according
to their reach or size so reach or size
and if you hear any moaning that is
actually my dog I don't know what he
wants right now he's just looking at me
but anyways let's carry on let's go over
the different types really old Dan
alright
fight through it the different sizes are
a land in a land is a local area network
and first what I'm going to do is I'm
going to give you guys the three
different ones land man and LAN and then
I'll talk about each one in detail so
land stands for local area network man
stands for metropolitan area network
and when is actually a wide area network
my dog isn't allowed to come in my room
so he usually just sits out in the
hallway and he knows he's not supposed
to come in so he sits out in the hallway
and he looks in and since I'm busy he's
slowly inching closer and closer I think
that you know he hopes that I won't see
them many ways the first thing the first
one I talked about is the land so let's
go ahead and cover that right now so
what is a land well I I said that it's a
local area network well what type of
computer network does this represent
well a local area network pretty much
means that all computers are in the same
building so here's your building right
now you might have a computer here here
all right
computer computer computer and you can
you know of course have a printer that's
a type of computer too as we talked
about earlier but basically land which
is a local area network this is how you
know if your network is a limb all the
computers are in close distance to each
other and they're usually in the same
house or same building again the
building can be either a house or a high
school or even you know a small business
so say that this is a small business
right here this would be an example of a
LAN now why would you want a land why
would you want to connect the computers
in a high school or you know even in
your home well it's good say this was a
college it would be really good for
sharing printers and that's how college
is whenever they connect them in this
type of network that's why every you
know computer in your computer lab it
doesn't need its own printer so that's
one you know very useful technique of a
LAN another thing is you know if this
was your house and you know maybe your
mom and dad had a computer maybe your
sister had a computer and you had a
laptop what you could do is you could
actually hook this up to the same server
Oh Dan be quiet I'm trying to teach here
and basically all of you guys can store
you
are illegal movies on that same one
server so that's really handy anyways
good for sharing things in small or the
same building in a close vicinity and
these are usually connected by cable or
wireless okay I gotta let my dog out
sorry guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
