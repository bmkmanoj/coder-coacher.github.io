development tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm going to teach you guys how
to multiply vectors and actually what
multiplying a vector even means so
pretty much say you have a vector that's
a 10 10 so like that 10 across and 10
down so this factor is 1010 dreads
beautiful and say you want to multiply
this vector by two well when you
multiply or divide a vector what it
means is it takes that number that
you're multiplying by and multiplies it
by both of these coordinates such as 20
if you multiply it by 2 you get a new
vector that's 20 20 so pretend this is
the new zero point actually i'll change
that so your new vector would be that
right there 20 across and 20 down so
your new vector would be 20 20 so again
whenever you multiply a vector it pretty
much just takes his length and doubles
it and same thing when you divide if you
took this vector house 2020 invited it
by 2 able to give you the smaller vector
10 10 so again it pretty it doesn't
change the direction at all but it just
changes the length so now that I show
you guys what multiplying a vector is
visually let me show you guys how to do
it in PI game or actually just Python
now whenever you multiply a vector well
let's go ahead and create a vector first
so let's go ahead and name it a vector
11 and we will set this equal to might
as well set equal to 10 10 like we did
before so now that we have vector we
need a function to multiply it so let's
go ahead and put define multiply spell
all right good and of course set the
first parameter equal to self self set
the next parameter equal to your vector
I'm going to name mine V because I
probably had
a vector summer they had this class is
named vector so to undo that and next
you're going to want to take what number
you want x so name it numb or something
else some variable you don't have yet so
in order to find the answer we first
need a variable we can sort of answer so
put self um you put answer i'm going to
put product i think when you x two
numbers together the answer is called
product and next what is this going to
be equal to well what we want to do is
take the first coordinate in x by the
number in the second coordinate and x by
the number so since v's going to be at
uppal we're going to put V zero which is
first coordinate and multiply it by the
number we also want to take the second
coordinate which is 1 and multiply that
by the number right there and of course
when we're done we need to return our
answer so it gives us something so self
they're real product so now that we have
this function called multiply we can
actually call it so we already have our
thing object and our vector so let's go
ahead and print the product of this is
I'll just put the product is save some
time space funny and other stuff thing
multiplied since thing was already a
object of the becket class now we have
to pass it the parameters which is the
first one is vector one what we're
multiplying what's is going to be turned
into V so vector one and also the number
that we want to multiply it by such as
two so let's go ahead and everything
looks good go run this and it says the
product is 2020 so this is the original
vector vector one and when we multiply
it by two we get an extended vector that
has a product or a vector of 20 20 so
that's your quick
oriol on what multiplying a vector
actually means again it means just
multiplying both of the coordinates
which give it gives you an extended a
vector of a different length so again
I'm not going to teach you how to divide
by a vector because if you can't figure
it out then that's I feel pretty bad for
you but anyways we got one more vector
tutorial to go I believe maybe two and
then we're going to be getting into some
awesome stuff but thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and I
hope to see in the next couple doors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
