17th video in in this video what we're
going to be doing is finally start
coding some PHP so let me go ahead and
give you guys a little bit of background
of what we're going to do first I decide
you know probably the easiest thing to
do is go ahead and work from top to
bottom however if you scroll around this
website for a little bit you're going to
notice a few things this section down
here changes but look at this this is
the main page and whenever you go to the
register page we still have our logo the
links at the top and the search bar
login page logo link search bar even on
the search page if we search for
something like the New Boston and go
ahead and hit search the logo the links
are at the top and the search bars at
the top on every single page so we can
code this website in one of two ways we
can go ahead and include the logo the
links in the search bar at the top in
all of our code right here or a more
efficient way is we can just go ahead
and write this code one time and include
it on every single page that we need to
and this is a better way not only
because it's easier and faster but then
if we ever decide you know what I
actually spelled register wrong or I
want to add another link or another
category we only have to change it in
one location and it changes on every
single page so let's go ahead and do
that and what I decided to do is I'm
going to go ahead and make all my little
HTML code and include it in another file
because then it's all in one location
now I'm going to name this file HTML
codes and again this is pretty much
going to be all of the HTML codes that
you've reuse on multiple web pages so
let's go ahead and make a new file just
going to make this real quick and I'm
going to go ahead and save this as under
includes save as HTML codes dot PHP now
the very first thing that we need to do
is we need to create the header now of
course the header is the location with
your logo and also the links now I
probably should mention this even though
they say register and login right now
whenever you either register or login
the line
are going to change they're going to say
like my account my messages so in order
to add this feature you of course need
PHP so let me go ahead and hop into our
HTML codes and let's go ahead and code
this header first now let's go ahead and
build a function and since this file is
going to have a whole bunch of functions
in it what I'd like to do is I like to
add a comment above each function
because just for visualization purposes
whenever you're scrolling through a huge
list of function it's really easy to see
in green code for header and search bar
it's really easy to see because comments
are green and notepad plus plus and it's
really easy to point out where your
functions start and where the end so
let's just go ahead and build a function
and let's name this header and search
code so basically the job of this
function is pretty much to provide the
HTML for the header which is the logo
and the links and the search bar at the
top why because then we only need to
build this function once and we can
include it on every single web page so
header and search code let's go ahead
and get to it now before we actually
start coding I want to show you guys a
cool feature that I put in this website
usually whenever you search for
something such as I don't know oh la la
la baked beans and you go what this is
going to do is right now we're on the
homepage whenever we hit search it's
going to take us to the search page now
by default whenever you go to a new page
your form values are lost so by default
this form would be blank again and you
have to type in whatever baked beans
again however whenever the user searches
for item I thought it would be cool to
keep that value in there then if they
say you know I meant beans with a Z or
something like that they can just edit
it real quick it's the same
functionality that amazon in ebay uses
it's better than having the you know
lose your value and retype it in every
time so in order to keep that value we
actually need to get it from the URL now
hopefully
guys watch the PHP tutorials and you
know about getting post and if you don't
then I highly recommend doing that but
anyways I'm going to store that value in
a variable called default text and of
course HTML entities is a function that
we're going to use now what HTML
entities does is it basically takes any
weird symbol like quotation marks and it
converts them to HTML safe it's actually
when I talk about PHP security I'll
touch more about this but i definitely
look this up and it's going to be very
useful now the value that we need to get
is actually a value from the URL which
is get and I just named it keywords so
basically as you can see whenever you
search for something your keywords get
passed through the URL right there and
all we are doing is we're grabbing them
again and we're going to put the default
value for this form right there and if
you guys don't know what I'm talking
about then trust me you will and about
arm one minute whenever I build this
form so now that we grabbed a variable
which is pretty much the default search
term let's go ahead and start making
some actual code the first thing we want
to do is we want to work on the header
now the header remember whenever we
coated it in the CSS see if I can find
it the header is the space with the logo
and top link so we have to make sure to
name it main header whenever we create
that so let's go ahead and echo that I'm
going to use a single quotation mark
since I'm not passing any variables in
and now let's go ahead and make the
header now the ID of this was of course
main header and the next thing I want to
do is I'm going to go ahead and the
first thing I'm going to code is these
links right here now again remember in
if I can find it in the CSS file we
created a section called I'll find it
eventually write a line right here wow
it was right under it and basically this
is the section that we need to put our
links in this is what makes the links
appear on the right hand side of the
webpage so let's go ahead and add
another div this one has the ID of right
align so I wrote it yep right align now
inside here what we can do is we can go
ahead and make those links now typically
what you would do is usually just write
the HTML code for the links however
remember this these links aren't going
to be normal links they're going to be
dynamic depending on whether the user is
logged in or if they're logged out
they're going to change for example
right now we're not logged in that's why
they say register or login whenever we
do login they're going to say messages
my account so on and so forth so in
order to make those limps links dynamic
i'm going to add another function called
top actually let's just go ahead and
right now put links will be here and
left to remember to make a function
later on to actually um create those
links but for now we'll just add a
comment to make things real quick the
next thing i want to do is echo some
more stuff so basically that is where
the links are going to go so the first
thing that we need to do is we need to
end that div so there you go so after
this the next thing we want to do is we
need to include this logo right here so
what i did i know i probably should have
waited for you guys but i actually
uploaded the images to the test site
already and i actually made in a fake
logo called main logo topping I don't
know why I said fake logo is just like a
tester logo so H ref
index dot PHP now what I want to do is
anytime the user clicks on this logo I
want them to go ahead and be taken to
the main homepage for example if they're
on the login page and then go ahead and
click this logo I want it to go ahead
and be a link to the main page so in
order to make this image a link just go
ahead and make a link to index PHP and
we might as well go ahead and end that
link right there now inside this link
what I want to do is I want to add the
image for the logo so image source
equals it's in the file called images
main logo dot ping now what I like to do
is just tighten this up a bit and now
check it out we now included our main
logo and we also made it a link to the
homepage pretty cool huh now the last
thing I want to do right here is just go
ahead and close out that header and now
check it out our header is basically
complete again the main header was this
section that we already styled with the
logo and links what we did right here is
we pretty much included the links on the
top right hand side and we also added
our picture or our logo and we also gave
the functionality that whenever you
click the logo it takes you to your main
page so in the next story what I'm going
to do is I'm going to start coding this
search bar and finally then we're going
to be done with this main top section
and are ready to move on to the good
register stuff but for now thank you
guys for watching and we get subscribe
and I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
