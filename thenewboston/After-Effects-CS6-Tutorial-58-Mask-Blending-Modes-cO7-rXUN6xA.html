exciting After Effects tutorial this is
After Effects cs6 and my name is buddy
blackford today we're going to be going
over the blending modes with masks so
what I did for this tutorial is I just
drew two masks on the same layer and I'm
going to show you how they are like how
they interact with each other so I'm
gonna keep the mask one which is this
wat on top the square on top on ad and
then the bottom one I'm gonna change
that too with the different blending
modes so we'll change the first one to
subtract and you can see it just cuts
out of the other masks and it also cuts
out itself it takes away itself so the
next mode here intersect now it's only
gonna show where the two masks intersect
obviously now and lighten and darken
deal with opacity so I'm gonna come over
here to difference and then you can see
that difference has where the intersect
cut out the other two modes here lighten
and darken as I said are dealing with
the opacity so real quick I'm going to
change the I'm gonna change this to add
and then I'm going to change the opacity
of the top mask down a little and then
I'm gonna also change the opacity of
this mask down a little will change them
both the fifty and and you can see that
the resulting mask in the middle where
they intersect is darker than the other
two masks and the problem here can be
fixed by switching the bottom mask to
lighten and now they are the same color
so if you ever have that problem that's
how you fix that now
when the objects are set to intersect
I'm gonna set it to intersect right now
and I'll start these back at 100 real
quick I reducible if you reduce both of
these to 50% so you can see how this
works the resulting opacity in the
middle is 25% to fix this you would
change the blending mode to darken and
now it changes it back to 50% and
there's also one other thing I'd like to
show you so I'm just gonna delete one of
the masks I'm gonna show you what the
invert does 100 percent here and here's
the whole mask here if I check invert
it's just going to instead of everything
inside the mask it's going to mask out
everything outside of the mask so I'll
just click on invert again and you can
just see how it does it's pretty
self-explanatory if you know what the
word inverted means you know how it's
gonna affect the mask so that's a it for
the blending modes there's only a few
it's not as confusing as the blending
modes here for the other layers so I
look forward to seeing you guys in the
next tutorial I'm all done with this one
see you on the other side</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
