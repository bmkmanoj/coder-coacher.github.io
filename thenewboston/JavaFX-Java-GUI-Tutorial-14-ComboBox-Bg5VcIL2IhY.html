show you how to use a combo box now a
combo box is essentially a really
awesome drop-down menu and I say it's
awesome because instead of the last list
that I showed you guys in the I don't
know is like the last two tutorials
these combo boxes can actually generate
actions so we don't have to stick
listeners on them whenever we just want
to you know perform some kind of action
as soon as the user chooses that option
and also you know how with a regular
drop down menu click button drop down
got some options but with a combo box
what you can do is you can either select
one of those options or type one in
yourself pretty sweet so let's go ahead
and learn how to use this and if it
sounds kind of confusing I'll show you
guys a couple examples and it'll be
really easy so combo box what data do
you want to have in it let's just go
ahead and use shrinks and we'll just
name it
combo box now I stuck it up here because
I'm going to build another method and I
want to include this combo box in this
main start method and also the one I'm
going to build so that is why I did that
and you guys can probably figure out how
to create it just let this equal two new
combo box just like our last tutorial
and to add items this you just use combo
box you got to get all your items just
like before and you can either add them
one at a time but I'm just going to add
all of these at once and what I'm going
to do in this demo is I'm just going to
show you guys how to make a real quick
list I'm gonna have movies in mind but
you know of course it doesn't really
matter and what movie do I want Good
Will Hunting I'll say that we're making
some kind of movie app and we want the
user to like select their favorite movie
and uh Saint Vincent I saw this the
other night he's actually pretty good
the preview looked kind of crappy and
then my sister is like hey I saw that's
pretty good so I'm like I'll give it a
shot it was actually pretty good
black hat apparently this is a movie
about hackers I didn't see it yet but I
think I might about get it tonight who
knows alright so now we have a blank
combo box and actually let me just go
ahead and add this on the screen right
now so we're going to run this and check
it out so this is pretty much what it is
it looks just like the last one
alright nothing really different but let
me show you guys a couple cool things
all right the first thing I want to show
you is this actually let me show you how
to add prompt text so when you add
prompt text unlike before when you just
had a default value in that value had to
be equal to an option in here your
prompt text can actually be whatever you
want so you can say something like what
is your favorite movie and whenever you
run this the default text in there is
what is your favorite movie in that way
it kind of saves you some trouble from
having to make a label or a title
somewhere else and you just select the
three okay that's cool now of course we
know that what we can do is just have
something like this button set on action
and we'll just feel like II like a quick
method called print' movie turn that up
a tidbit alright private boy prints
movie
alright so freaking Coffman is annoying
for some reason to Ike off more at night
than in the daytime and I don't know if
anyone has like a real cool home remedy
then please let me know alright so
anyways what we're going to do is we're
just gonna demonstrate that the user can
click a button that click me bond or
whatever I typed on it and in order to
extract the value from it you just use
combo box
get value now we don't need to pass it
through because we declared it up here
so we get access to it pretty awesome so
I just want to show you guys this what's
your favorite movie gonna select Good
Will Hunting hit submit Good Will
Hunting
alright that's nice but still I'm not
seeing any you know awesome
functionality like I promised well the
one cool thing that differentiate this
combo box from the other observable
lists is this whenever you have a combo
box like I said at the beginning the
tutorial it generates their own actions
so you can use combo box set on action
in this action of course is just
selecting you know one of those options
a Good Will Hunting or save Vincent
whatever and then once that occurs you
can just use system out you can actually
do whatever you want
let's I'll make a let me make this
different than this one down here so
whenever they choose an option I can not
click the button but just select a new
option I'll say user selected and by the
way that reminds me of chicken selects
for McDonald's they are delicious really
go get some what time's it 3:16 a.m.
obviously not open now but alright so I
want to show you guys the difference
between these two so this action again
is going to occur whenever you just
select an item so again watch what's
going on on between my mouse in the
terminal so right now I'm just going to
select the movie blackhat and without
hitting this button that action is fired
up so if you ever want to do something
like um change the background of this
without having them you know click
submit button or submit any form you can
do that however if you want the
functionality where you can actually
click the submit button and then
whatever code that you want to do is run
or Ram is wrong as you're in Iran I
think it's Iran alright then you can do
that as well so that's
one benefit and another thing I want to
mention real quick is this you know how
I said that in addition to just having
you know a fancy drop-down menu with
some cool functionality you can also
type in your own options since you know
if you're making a movie app give them
some default popular movies but
obviously some users are going to have
different favorite movies in this so
check this out you can actually let me
put it right here alright so if you call
combo box set editable true and whenever
you do this the prompt text gets
overridden but look what happens
whenever you set editable not only can
you select these movies right here but
you also give them an option to write in
their own movies like Avatar so pretty
awesome not only do you have a fancy
drop down but they generate their own
actions
you can type in your own custom movie
this thing can do everything it can you
know probably cure diseases too but you
know I didn't see the documentation in
that but I can I can trust me alright so
I'm going to shut up now
go on maybe go to bed dreaming bout some
chickens legs whatevs see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
