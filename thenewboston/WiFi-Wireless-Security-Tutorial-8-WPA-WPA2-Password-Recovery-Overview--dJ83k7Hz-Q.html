I want to start talking to you about WPA
and also wpa2 password recovery so
basically this is a way that you can
figure out the password of a WPA
password-protected network and this is
useful let's say that you just move
somewhere new and you set up your Wi-Fi
made a password and then a few days
later you forgot it well you can
actually get that back let's say if you
forgot it write it down and the reason
that I'm teaching it in this video
series is this is actually what hackers
do whenever they figure out the password
for your wireless network so if your
network keeps getting hacked and you're
like what the heck's going on I clearly
didn't tell anyone else my password well
this is the technique that they use to
figure it out now just a little
disclaimer what I'm going to be showing
you guys is an extremely simplified
version of what really happens the exact
802 11 Wi-Fi protocol and also the
algorithm that WPA uses for the
encryption keys it's actually really
complex I just want to give you guys a
real brief broad overview because in the
next video whenever we actually perform
this attack it's good to have a nice
basic understanding of you know just the
fundamentals of what's going on behind
the scenes so this is essentially how
WPA and password protected networks work
whenever you have a device and it wants
to access a password protected network
we'll say the password is bacon 1 2 3
what this tablet needs to do is it needs
a way to verify that it knows the
password however here's the tricky part
it can't actually send the password to
the router now I say that it can't send
it because the reason for that let me
draw a mean face on this laptop is the
reason that it can't just send it in
plain text is because anyone that's
listening they could just be spying in
listen for that password alright that's
a kind of tricky so how the heck is this
tablet going to prove that it knows the
password without actually saying the
password well what it does is it
actually uses that password and puts it
through this hashing algorithm now this
algorithm
the specifics of how this algorithm this
formula works they aren't really
important but I just want to give you
guys you know a quick demo so it pretty
much takes a bunch of different
variables like the SSID the MAC some
other things and one of those variables
is the password so it takes all of these
pieces runs it through a hashing
algorithm and comes up with this weird
answer which is like 87 JK I'm just
making this up for two explanation
points so there you go so the reason
that this actually works is because this
guy right here if he knows the correct
password then he's going to get this
answer right there so then he can get
that and send it across the network so
87 JK for two whatever
now this access point it obviously knows
the answer because it's stored in there
and it knows all the other pieces so
it's going to know that the correct
answer is 87 JK for two right there so
whenever it figures out the answer sends
it across the network the router is
going to be able to check it and say
okay this dude clearly knew the password
and the best part about this is this is
how you can actually prove that you know
a password without sending the actual
password over the network so it's all
actually pretty fascinating if you want
to look it up some more highly recommend
that and this isn't you know all there
is to it from here they do other stuff
like make their encryption key and once
they both have the encryption key that
is how this tablet and this access point
can encrypt in decrypt packets for a
nice secure conversation and if you
remember a couple tutorials ago whenever
we view those packets and we were trying
to read them it looked like all mumbo
jumbo well the reason for that is
because it was encrypted using the
encryption key that was derived from
basically this authentication method
known as a four-way handshake so this is
all pretty technical and like I said we
really don't need to understand most of
this what you really need to understand
is this if you can figure out all the
pieces to the puzzle
then you can basically figure out
everything else in other words once you
know the pieces that go into making up
the keys then what you can do is not
only can you join the network yourself
but you can decrypt everyone else's data
that's on the network alright that's
pretty cool but the problem is that we
don't have these pieces specifically we
are missing the password so you know I
guess that's a I guess we'll go home
well wait a second let's think about
this I mean we may not have the password
yet but what information do we have well
we have the entire formula I mean not
all the pieces to the formula but we
know how the formula works and we also
have some other critical pieces that we
may need I mean we can see the answer
and plaintext no problem you may think
that that's worthless but I mean we can
get the SSID we can get the Mac and all
of the other pieces except from the
password we can just pull out of plain
text all right
so we have all these pieces but the only
thing we're missing is this so what we
can do from here is actually really cool
we can have a huge list of passwords and
we can just start plugging them in for
this part of the puzzle right now so
we're going to run through a huge list
and whenever we hit one that gives us
this answer we know that that is the
correct password so this is actually
called a dictionary attack when you have
a huge list of potential passwords and
you're just going to go through one by
one by one you're going to plug them all
into this formula and whatever one is
going to give you this result then you
knew that that was the password for the
wireless network and once you have the
password like I said not only can you
log in and access the network but you
can also figure out how to make
everyone's key and start decrypting all
of their information so I know it sounds
pretty confusing and like I said this is
was just a real brief overview of what
we're going to do believe it or not it's
actually easier just to do it so in the
next video I'm going to be showing you
guys how this all works and trust me you
guys are going to love it so I was
to you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
