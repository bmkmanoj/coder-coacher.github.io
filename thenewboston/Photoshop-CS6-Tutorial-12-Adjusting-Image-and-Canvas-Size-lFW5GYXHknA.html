Photoshop cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackbird and in
this lesson we're going to learn about
changing the image size and resolution
of your images and how to change the
kamut or how to change the canvas size
as well because they're both around the
same like area so might as well go over
them both so what I'm talking about
I want to maybe like make this a little
smaller or even possibly make this a
little bigger so let me take down this
so welcome to photoshop art and we just
got this picture of the two cool-looking
girls so let's go up here to our options
up here and go to image and click on
that and we're going to come down here
to image size and you can see that the
hotkey for Windows is alt ctrl + I so
that would be command option I on a Mac
so click on that and we've got the
ability to change the width and the
height of our pixel our of our image so
something that I wanted to show you guys
is that when you see this a locked
button over here it looks like a it's
supposed to be like a locked symbol this
constrain proportions checkbox here
toggles that and you mainly almost all
the time want to have that on because it
will constrain the proportions and of
your image which means that your image
won't be all like distorted so I'll show
you real quick what it let's just make
this a little bit smaller I'll make this
like a thousand and then this because
it's constraint proportions will be 600
is 67 I'll hit OK
and then as you can see it made it
smaller now I'm going to go to edit undo
to get it back to where it was now if I
go to change the image size again but
don't constrain the proportions and then
I hit OK you can see that the image has
now been squished and now it is
distorted looking so that's why you
usually want to have constrain
proportions on I mean if you're if you
have just an image of like I don't know
like a solid color or something like
that then worrying about distortion
doesn't matter as much or like anything
that's not like a photo so mainly with
photos you always want to have the
constraint proportions on so let's go
back to the image size and and let's try
to put constrain proportions on and then
we can increase the size and a Photoshop
does a good job of keeping the image
quality intact one because it's a smart
object right now and two because we have
a setting on there that I'm going to
tell you about but as you can see I was
able to increase the size of this image
and still keep some pretty good photo
quality in it so let's go duck back to
undo and let's go back to our image size
down here at the bottom there is this
drop-down menu that has a bunch of
different types of resampling which is
if you uncheck this box where it says
resample image this will no longer be
available so you want to resample the
image here which helps keep the the nice
quality of your of your image when you
scale it up or scale down so you want to
make sure you have that checked
now bicubic automatic is the new
one in Photoshop cs6 and that is it's
the default and it gives you the best
it's like the best one for like most
things that you use and it gives you
high quality now we got a couple other
ones here and they give you a an idea of
what they are good for so
nearest-neighbor it's a best for quick
results with a low quality bilinear is
good for like line art like if you're
just trying to make a bunch of graphic
design using like lines bicubic is best
for smooth gradients and bicubic
smoother is good for if you want to
enlarge your image and a bicubic sharper
here is good for reducing the image
while keeping high quality results so
that's what these are that's what these
mean most of the time you just want to
stick with bicubic automatic because it
it's kind of like the all one tool that
will help you do like almost everything
so one other thing we can change this to
percentage so maybe you don't know the
exact pixels you want but you someone
your client was like reduced that size
by 50% so we can go 50% there and it'll
reduce it by 50% so that's another great
thing now let's come back into our image
size here and we've got our resolution
down here that we can also change now I
can bring this down to maybe like 72
pixels per inch hit OK and it'll lower
the resolution and then you can see that
it also lowers the amount of size so if
you remember and if you watch the
previous tutorial or I told you that I
was working on a logo for someone and I
did it in 72 PPI and then I had to
change it to 300 PPI because she wanted
it on print that
pretty much I had to when I changed it
to a 30 or to 300 PPI it like way
blasted up the size of the logo and then
it made it a little less less resolution
in it so I had to redo it again now one
thing when you are using the when you're
trying to change just the resolution you
may not want to have resample image on
because it is not needed when you're
trying to fix the resolution that way we
don't have to have anymore extra
processes going on while we're doing
this so that's just something to keep in
mind now we want I want to show you how
to adjust the canvas size go to image
and right below image size is canvas
size now we can do this in inches and
then we got pixels we got percent I'm
going to put it two percent right now
I'm going to increase the canvas size by
a hundred percent 150 percent and if I
hit relative oops
should have hit relative earlier let's
put this back to 100 now click on
relative and when you click on relative
it brings it down to zero so that now
you can increase let's go to fifty and
maybe 50 here hit OK and it increased
the actual canvas size so let me zoom
out using the zoom tool here and the
canvas all it is pretty much is
basically just something for you to work
on kind of think of it as like if
someone's painting a portrait or
something like that this is the canvas
and this is just the amount of space
they have to work on you can always turn
off your canvas or whatever but this is
what's going to show up this is what
like anything outside the canvas is not
going to show up when you try to save
your image
so that's how you edit your canvas size
let's go back into it see if there's
anything else we need to mean nothing
else really that we need to check out
just remember that relative we'll set it
down to zero so that that way you can
work with a little easier it's pretty
much your preference so that's a that's
all for this tutorial we talked about
image size resolution and canvas size
and how to change all those so thanks
for watching this tutorial everybody and
have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
