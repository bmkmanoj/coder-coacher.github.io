Bucky and welcome to your 42nd
objective-c tutorial and in this
tutorial we're going to be going over
exception handling what what the heck
did you say what's an exception and how
do you handle it well exception handling
is pretty much what to do if you get an
error in your computer program computer
programmers like the user term throwing
an exception but all this means is
pretty much I got an error in my program
I use the term exception and err
interchangeably I know you shouldn't but
um if you see me saying like I get an
exception or I get an error it means the
same thing but I don't tell any
professional programmers just from
Harvard or anything because I they might
get a little upset so anyways check this
out as you can see I already deleted
everything in our class from last story
except this object declaration now
normally in our programs before whenever
we came across code with the air or
something so check this out let's go
ahead and type air you have a object
called n of course that's right here and
try to call method call no method in it
and if you can't remember we didn't have
a method called this in our numbers
class so this is going to go ahead and
generate an error method saying you have
no no method method so after this let's
go ahead and NS log something on the
screen this is code after the air so
let's go ahead and run this save it and
see what we get well as soon as you run
this and you see we get an error right
here we get this horrific unsightly what
is this all computer mumbo-jumbo I don't
even know what's going on right now but
this is ugly to look at you think our
users want to see that when they're
running our program I don't think so and
even worse than all that as soon as you
get an error check this out this is the
code after the air it doesn't even get
to that it just shuts down our program
right as it gets an error and just stops
you think we want our users programmed
you're just shut down whenever we get a
little teeny air I don't think so
so it kind of sucks how that works but
trust me there's a way to fix this and
that's called exception handling so
instead of having to deal with errors
like this well objective-c
allows you to do is test a little bit of
code to see if it gets in there and if
it doesn't and if it does get an error
instead of giving you huge long error
messages it allows you to write your
custom error messages a lot smaller
preferably and it also allows you to
continue with your code in your program
so not only can you have prettier error
messages that the user can actually
understand it won't shut down your
program and allow you to keep going with
your code SILVER saying all right this
is nice and how about how the heck do I
do this well the syntax for this is at
try and here's this X it's a syntax I'll
go ahead and delete this at finally
we'll be teaching that later on the main
thing is I want to be teaching now is
try and catch now you see this try and
catch syntax is a pretty simple for the
try inside the curly brackets you type
what statements do you want to try or
what code do you think may generate an
error and go ahead and type N and try to
call method called
this is going to get an air and make
sure you spell it wrong so we are sure
to generate an error so I only typed one
line but you can have as many lines as
you want you can try four lines of code
if you want so what we're saying is all
right objective-c we want to try this
bit of code inside the try block now if
we get an error instead of spitting out
over horrific error messages like this
and ending our program instead what we
want you to do is run the code inside
the catch block and what this catch
block means is this it says it takes one
parameter
this is NSF exception stary now there
are different kinds of errors that you
can catch or look out for this pretty
much means look out for any
err that this might generate so this is
default again we'll be talking about
that later but leave it like that for
now if you only want to look for one
specific error say you only want to
check if the user divides by zero just
that then there's a special thing you
put in here but anyways we want to look
for any exception that might occur or
any error so we say all right try this
it's going to generate an error instead
of shutting down our program and you
know just given us a horrific error
message do this instead NS log just a
put a nice little user friendly say
you've got an air and your program so if
we get an error which we will instead of
seeing all this the user is just going
to see this you get an error with your
program and the coolest thing about this
all is instead of shutting down the
entire program right after that and just
terminating everything this is code
after the air as soon as it's done
handling the errors it allows you to
continue with the rest of your program
like nothing never happened so let's go
ahead and build and run this select ok
select all and I put I always do that
I put log lower case L so embarrassing
is it really that embarrassing but you
know so check it out instead of getting
all this like before we ran our new
program it gave a little message to say
all right this wasn't a real method and
instead of getting a huge error all it
said was our custom error messages
message is just one message you got an
error in your program that is much more
user-friendly than all this trust me and
then the coolest thing about it instead
of just shutting down our program
without even asking us it went ahead and
continued with the rest of the program
so that is pretty much how you handle
errors in computer program works well
Jeff objective-c program not only to you
know give the user a custom error
messages that
may understand but also continue with
the rest of your program so it doesn't
just shut down on them and you know it's
just a neater way to do things so there
are some things that you absolutely need
to put in triblock so we're going to be
doing a couple of these things later on
and there's also a couple other syntax
like at finally and this well don't
worry about now but you know there are a
couple of other neat tricks that you can
use when handling errors but uh we'll
get into that later if you have any
questions and just ask me my form I
usually don't respond to YouTube emails
or messages so you know that's all I
have for you for this story well thank
you guys for watching um all the source
code is going to be for free in the link
below so don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
