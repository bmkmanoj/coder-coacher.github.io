this video I want to talk to you about
file attributes so every single file on
your computer has a set of attributes
associated with it and these are pretty
much just properties of the file and
give you guys a real quick overview of
all the different attributes there
aren't that many if you just type ATT RI
b and do your little help symbol then
you're going to see a real quick
guideline or xishi of what they are and
a lot of these you're probably really
familiar with um for example a archive
this means basically whether or not a
file needs to be backed up um let's see
hidden of course you guys know what
hidden means and not only like whenever
you're just looking at files like
through Windows Explorer but also
whenever you use the dir command if a
file is hidden then it's not going to
show up so again hidden files are
usually just to prevent people from
deleting them so that's why you would
have those read-only on this pretty much
means that you can open a file and view
it but you can't edit it or actually
delete it system files of course those
are ones that are needed by windows
tomato tomahto so on and so forth so
basically we have all these attributes
that can be applied to files but how do
we know which file has which attributes
say we have a text file and we want to
see what attributes it has how do we do
that let me go ahead and clear my screen
and make it text file which is really
good okay
they cannot text alright so if you're a
day are we see that we now have a file
called bacon dot txt so where are the
attributes well in order to view the
attributes what you do is move into the
directory in rate ATT ri B so this means
show the files and tell me what
attributes are associated with it now
right here we can see that we have the a
so right here on the Left enter if you
remember this means archived so let's
say that all right
right now the file has that attribute
but we also want to make this a hidden
file so how do we actually add
attributes this well in order to add
attributes type your ATT
our B keyword again and if you want to
add an attribute just write plus and
then the letter name now remember in
again it doesn't matter if it's capital
or lowercase but H means hidden so you
have to use the little guideline or
cheat sheet and what file do you want to
add the hidden attribute - well how
about bacon text and now if you look at
the files again you can see that this is
has the a and H so is now a hidden file
and if we can verify that I actually
have um my window set up to display
hidden files but I don't know if you
guys can even know this is but it's kind
of um transparent and if it wasn't
hidden they'll be completely opaque I'm
sure you guys can't even notice that
it's like the tiniest icon on a YouTube
video but trust me um it is hidden as
you can see here so what if you're like
alright I don't want to make that file
hidden anymore actually want to remove
the hidden attribute and I want to add a
read-only attribute whoa my man that is
really easy I don't know why I'm doing
this I could easily just like look how
lazy I am
attr be art so we want to add the
read-only so plus R and we can also do
this all in one big shebang so take away
the hidden attribute bacon dot text and
now if you look at those again check it
out so we took away the hidden and added
read-only so there you go there is your
real quick introduction to attributes
thank you guys for watching I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
