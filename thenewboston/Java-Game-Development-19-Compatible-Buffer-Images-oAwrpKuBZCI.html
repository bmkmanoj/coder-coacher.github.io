19th a Java game development tutorial
and in this tutorial we are finally
going to be finishing up our screen
manager class I promise you guys we only
have one more method to build and all
this method is going to do is going to
create image compatible with your
monitor pretty much so what we're going
to be doing is we're going to be
returning a buffered image or an image
that that our buffer is going to use and
it's pretty much just going to create an
image based on what we need for our
monitors settings so let's go ahead and
name public buffered image create create
compatible image and it's going to take
three parameters in W for the width and
H for the height and in T and T is
transparency and those are three things
you pretty much need for your buffered
image right now with a width
pickup's a height of your image and the
transparency settings for it which we'll
talk about later on so now you need to
create a window object and don't name it
W because W is actually width up here so
name it like win or something and set
equal the VC get fullscreen window so
now when is equal to the window you're
looking at pretty much so put R if the
win is not equal to null if it has
something in it then what do we want to
do well the first thing when you do is
get the characteristics of our monitor
now we can't just go ahead in our
computer and look at the settings
because we want this computer to run on
every game so it's going to be different
for every monitor so let's go ahead and
put graphics
configuration GC and set this equal to
the windows dot get graphics
configuration and what this pretty much
does is get the characteristics of your
monitor or who whatever monitor is
running this program and it's going to
store it in a variable called GC and
let's see if we can see it I can't read
that because my screen recorder is in
the way but I just told you what it does
and now what we wanted to do what we
want to reduce is return G C dot creates
compatible image and we want to create a
compatible image based on the things we
passed in so with tight transparency so
now that it knows your monitors settings
it can create a compatible image based
on the settings pretty much based on the
settings we passed it in and the
settings that it got from its monitor so
that is pretty much what's going to
happen but of course if that doesn't
happen then let's just return No so
things go bad just return nothing
because if we don't have a return
statement then this program won't work
so that's pretty much the only thing
that we had left to right for the screen
manager class and in the next tutorial
we're going to be going over the class
with the main method in it and we're
going to be running our program no
probably not in the next tutorial and
eventually we're going to be running our
program without flickers or tearing or
anything like that it's going to be one
smooth animation it is going to be
amazingly awesome but for now I just
want to say thank you guys for watching
thank you for sticking with me and
watching my free tutorials it's been
awesome um that's it for this tutorial
I'll see you next time don't forget
subscribe see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
