video I am going to talk to you guys
about components now I want to say if
you ever read the documentation about
components holy crap they try to make it
as confusing as possible but I promise
components are super super easy to
understand and right now we actually
have one component this is it the
easiest one to understand ever and if
you want to check it out go to app TS
app component TS alright so what the
heck is a component so your angular
project and all of the projects you ever
make using angular they're going to be
made up of these things called
components which are basically the core
building blocks of your application now
in simple terms all they are are just
part of your website so right now all
this component is is a plain old title
of course later on you may want to make
some ones that you know are a little bit
more complicated like I don't know a
video player component or a chatbox
component but for right now we just have
a really basic one now another thing I
want to mention is that components or
parts of your website can be made up of
other components so let's say that
you're making this component that was
like I don't know like a chat messaging
feature kind of like Facebook's so that
would be your component it would also be
composed of like a buddy list and the
main messaging window and maybe arm
like the messaging form at the bottom
where you type in so all these different
pieces make up this bigger thing in
other words all the smaller components
make up a bigger component so again
whenever I say component I'm in saying
part of your website so that's basically
a component of your website all right
sounds simple enough so how do you make
these well the first thing that we did
in this example is we had this import
statement so this import statement all
we're doing right here is we're actually
importing it from one of the packages
that we download the main angular
package
and this component keyword right here
this just says hey we're going to be
making components so that's why we need
to import that now this next thing right
here this app component this is actually
a decorator and all this is is
essentially saying hey you know this
class right here this isn't just a
normal typescript class this is actually
an angular component in other words it's
going to be a part of our website that
we're going to be able to stick into our
HTML later on so it's pretty much just
information making this regular class a
component so we already see that it
comes with some basic information that
we have to fill out this first thing is
the selector so a selector of a
component all this is is the tag name so
whenever we make this component of
course we need to include it in our HTML
file so we include things in HTML files
using tags right here we use the title
tag right here we use a link arm right
here we use the body the div whatever so
you see this one my app wait a minute
I'm not familiar with that one well
that's because we made our own custom
component or part and we gave it a name
so that's what the selector is basically
you can name anything and then whenever
you include it you just name your tags
those things and it knows all right that
references this component and you can
actually name it whatever you want if
you want to name it tuna fish check it
out then you could switch your tags to
tuna fish and there you go it's going to
work fine and actually let me change
that back to my app because I know I
just think tuna fish might be a little
bit confusing to understand and art so
the next piece of the puzzle is this
template right here now a template is
just the actual code that displays
inside our component so basically we
already know that whenever we write my
app that this means all right put my
component right here now the code that
you want to go in between here is just
whatever you have in
your template so right now we just have
a heading one that says Engler to Bucky
but let me just write like I am inside
the component and now let me go back to
here and check it out
so once it loads I'm going to go ahead
and inspect it and look what's happening
so this is the my apt tag in other words
our component now inside these tags we
have our template so again whenever we
make a component we give a name and that
is just the selector and we just set
this equal to my app now the template we
can set equal to whatever we want and I
just made this a simple heading one tag
so I mean again components are super
easy now the last line of code we have
in this file is this export class right
here now this component is like the
dumbest component I could possibly think
of later on we're going to be making
components that are kind of useful so
let's say that we were writing some blog
application or like a news article
application of course if our component
was a news article it would have a title
and author and some content so then in
our class we would actually make a
variable for title and set equal to
whatever the title was the author could
be something different and the content
would be something different it's
basically like a blueprint for your
component so actually if I want to make
a simple title variable in here then I
could do that and then set this equal to
it but again that's all it is so great
now have a pretty stupid component but
that's what it is now one thing I do
want to mention is this export keyword
right here whenever you have this export
keyword what you're saying is this
component is public in other words it
can be included in other places in our
application so this isn't just a normal
type syrup class we can actually use
this component elsewhere now it's
important to have this because whenever
we start making smaller components and
putting them together in a bigger
component then it's important to not
get that keyword so that's what this is
so again just to recap one last time
whenever we are making angular 2
projects they're going to be made up of
different parts called components so in
order to use a component you basically
make a class which is going to be more
complicated than this most of the time
and we need to give it a selector name
so that way whenever we include it in
our HTML it knows that these tags
reference this component and whatever
code you have as your template this is
the code that's going to appear in
between right here now one thing I want
to mention I say one thing this is like
the 70th thing I'm going to mention in
this video but you see this information
right in between here by default you
don't even need this this is optional
but as your websites loading for the
first time before it loads in all of
this code right here then this is just
the code that gets displayed to the user
so they're usually only going to see
this for like maybe a second or two but
if you just want to have little loading
or I don't know like Oh waiting to load
or anything you want in there then they
know that something's going on and they
just don't see a blank screen and aren't
freaking out for like a second or two so
again that's what components are basic
building blocks of your application
boom roasted easy enough</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
