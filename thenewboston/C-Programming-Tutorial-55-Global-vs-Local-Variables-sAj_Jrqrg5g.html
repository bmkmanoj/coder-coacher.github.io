wanted to do was learn about global and
local variables that's what everyone
always tells me you know since they're
from you know England or ASHRAE whatever
the heck the accident was so to all the
people who asked that let me go ahead
and teach it to you right now so there
are two main types of variables or
scopes of variables that we're going to
learn this tutorial one global to local
what's the difference between them
well don't let the words global and
local confuse it because I'm going to
explain it real quick this is the rule
for using variables in your program
whenever you make a variable like int
tuna outside and above all of your
functions any of your functions are
allowed to use that variable so main can
use tuna just like a normal variable
print something can use tuna just like
normal so when it's above your functions
any function can use it now
whenever you make it inside a function
only the function that it's created
inside can use it so for example if
print something wanted to use tuna it
wouldn't be allowed to okay so when it's
inside a function only that function can
use it when it's outside any function
can use it now just so it sticks in your
brain let me go ahead and make like a
two second example so enough of the tuna
let's feel like words so we'll set words
that how many words do I have 23 and
that's only on my forehead believe it or
not true story 23 big one size of
baseballs alright
so remember I told you that anytime you
make outside any function can use it so
let's do it right now so printf
I have its integer so percent D warts
and might as well kick that to newline
and for this we're going to put warts
looking good and also I got rid of the
print something so right now if we just
ran this arm print something would never
be called and that's remember that told
you that whenever you want to use the
function I'll put the name parentheses
and then a semicolon and that pretty
much goes down to here and cause
whatever's in there well whenever I say
calls it's just a technical term for
using the function so you know just a
some little programming lingo so right
now I'm going to call print something
and we'll see if that can use words as
well all right so I have 23 warts I have
23 warts it was able to be used from
each of these functions so what happens
if we accidentally made it right in here
well what would happen is it would say
okay I am main in this warts variable
belongs to me and me alone no one else
can use it
so when print something tries to use
warts right here and check this out if
we look it said on a clear Devender and
a little I can't even refer can talk
pretty much it's saying hey dude we
don't have a words variable and there's
none out here to use so you can't use it
and again one last time whenever a
variable is declared out here it's
called a global variable and whenever
it's created inside a function it's
called a local variable local to that
function so now you know about global
and local variables congratulations of
see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
