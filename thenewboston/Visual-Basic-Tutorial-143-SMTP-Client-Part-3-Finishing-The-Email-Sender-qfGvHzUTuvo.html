more that will send the message
so private sub send message and then
we'll just do SMTP or SMTP sender dot
Sindh and we're gonna send my message
now what we're gonna have to do is
enclose this in a try-catch statement so
in case something goes wrong our whole
program won't crash
so catch e^x as exception and then we'll
just in try so if something happens and
we get an exception let's just go ahead
and show that
so message box dot show e^x dot two
string and we gotta close this with one
more okay so now let's double click on
button sin and what we're gonna need to
do is call each one of these so we'll
start off by creating the message we
will create the SMTP and then we will
send the message
and now for discard all we have to do is
just clear each one of the text boxes so
text body dot clear text from dot clear
text pass dot clear I had the subject we
got to clear the subject and then that
body or weight - okay so let's go ahead
and run this and hopefully we won't get
any errors and it will send our email so
we're gonna do from and it will just do
my email address so this is going to be
censored out and one more thing before
we actually send it let's go ahead we'll
go over to our text pass properties and
we need to not show the text so password
character is going to be a star or an
asterisk so let's go ahead and run this
again so we'll do from type in my email
address password you can see that the
password is all stars right there now
I'll just send it to myself I will do
visual basic email and then we'll just
say turtles let's go ahead and click
send
and you can see because I enabled SSL
encryption my avast detected it so let's
just go ahead and we'll close out of
this and we'll go back and disable SSL
so we'll just set that equal to false
let's go ahead and run it again
so from
okay so we'll go ahead and send it
hopefully everything works now we'll
open up my email and we'll just click
send or receive if it's on here now here
let me drag this away real quick and you
can see here here's the message that
says turtles and it's - Sam McNally from
Sam mcanally and then we've got turtles
which is the one we said before that was
blocked by avast and I guess it got
through so go ahead make this email
sender if you haven't already you can
learn a lot from it you can change stuff
inside of it and then once you've done
that go ahead and move on to the next
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
