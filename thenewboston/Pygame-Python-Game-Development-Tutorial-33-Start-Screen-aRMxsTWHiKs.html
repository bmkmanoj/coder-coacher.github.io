33 PI game tutorial video from
youtube.com slash cent as for bucking
the new Boston what we got going on here
is good this nice snake game we've fixed
our our text all that awesome and now
things are a little better when we lose
the game and now what I want to talk
about is like a starting screen so right
now when we start the game we're
basically watching the game the snakes
move in and maybe that's a little bit of
overload for people so kind of works to
have some sort of like Start screen you
know um
so that's what we're going to add in
this videos we're going to add a start
screen and kind of improve it in the
next one so without further ado let's
get started so a Start screen only needs
to run one time we could run it on game
over but we already have game over
handling right game over handling is hey
either quit or play again you already
kind of understand a game and you're
ready so we don't need to do that we
just need to run game intro like right
at the beginning so with that let's go
ahead and just make a quick function
here we're going to just do a define
game underscore intro and what we're
going to do is we're going to say intro
equals a true and while there in the
intro we're gonna say wow intro and then
we're going to just do uh the typical
stuff so this will be kind of like its
own little instance so you'll see what I
mean a second book game display dot fill
white and then we're going to do a
message to screen and the message his
screen will be welcome to slither and
the color is going to be green the Y
displacement will be negative 100 and
the size will be large and just so I
don't confuse anybody these are the
defaults you don't since we're using all
of them you know we didn't have to
specify size really so I could do just
this just so
it's not like why does he differ on just
that one then we're going to say so
let's welcome to slither large screen
while intro is true all that awesome
then what we're going to do is do
another message to screen and this
message will be um the objective of the
game is to eat red apples
um comma and this will be black I guess
black and then we'll do like negative 30
black negative 30 and this will be small
if you recall we actually have small as
the default so we don't really have to
throw anything in there at all so that
and then let me just let's just copy
this and paste and paste and then we'll
come down here and then we'll say um the
more apples you eat the longer you get
and then we'll say this is at negative
uh 70 maybe and then uh uh if you run
into yourself or the edges or I guess or
the yeah I guess we'll say or the edges
you die and then this will be negative
110 so we've been moving like 40 pixels
every time so let's go ahead and run
that really quick actionable nothing
will update if we do that so what we're
going to want to do is we'll say PI game
dot display update and then we'll do a
clock tick 15
like that um and then in theory we'd
want to have like some sort of call to
action as well but we'll get there in a
minute um so let's just run that really
quick and see like how that alignment
works Oh Ohio we didn't even call it oh
my goodness amateur hour over here so we
need a call game intro so we'll just
call it I do be best to be dead like way
down here where we call the main loop so
game loop we really call game intro
empty parameters at the very bottom here
save and run that one more time and so
we have this so we have a little bit of
overlap we've also got a lag happenin
here that's not good that something is
not working correctly close there this
one so we definitely have some things
that we need to fix here uh where the
hell is here we go so let's do um you
see what I had done before so negative
30 and then oh I switched so negative 30
and then 10 and then we'll do 50 and
then eventually we'd want to run another
function here or another question and it
would be like this right and this one
will be able to do 180 and let's go over
to the edges here and we'll just say
press whoops press C to play or Q to
quit okay so I save and run that again
we're going to have that same lag issue
but yeah the alignment is decent I can't
even move the window over to like show
you guys but got like there we go not
responding but the alignment is working
so now we're going to close out of this
and we're going to fix this this other
major issue that we've got going
and for that I think we'll do that in
the next video so stay tuned for that as
always thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
