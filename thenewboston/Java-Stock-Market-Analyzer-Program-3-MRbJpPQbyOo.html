third lesson and how to build a Java
stock market analyzer program and in
little s tutorial we built a little
method to check whether that file was
actually a file or not so let's go ahead
and add a little comment to tell us what
our methods does and pretty much says
check if the file is a file and now I
just like to add a little comment above
each one of my methods just to tell what
they do so now we have this method built
we can actually test this return value
in our next method so we're gonna be
building a method now that pretty much
finds the number of rows in our CSV file
so let's go ahead and put fine number of
rows in CSV file and now we can go ahead
and begin building another method now
this method is going to return an
integer depending on how many rows so
it's gonna return 20 hopefully because
this da file has 20 rows in it so let's
go ahead and put public int since it's
gonna Rev returning an integer find row
number so I'm gonna name my method find
row number because that's what it does
so now what we need to do is first of
all we have this variable called a row
up here and it's set to 0 and what we
want to do is set it to 0 again right
here and this is because if we call this
method twice at the end hopefully this
row is gonna be set to 20 and then if we
call it somewhere else from our program
we don't want it to be set to 21 it
starts again we want it to be set to 0
every time so that's why we need to
reset it to 0 even though we set it to 0
up here we can actually probably put
this in here but if we need this row
elsewhere you know just a set the row
equal to 0 in here that's what I'm
saying so now that we have the row set
to 0 what do we want to do well the
first thing we want to do is check if
it's a file or not so if this is true in
how can we do this if
is filed and what this is gonna do is
hopefully return true and it's only
gonna do this bit of code do this if
it's a file there we go so we're gonna
have a if-else statement if it is a file
which hopefully it is we want to do this
bit of code that we're gonna program in
about five seconds else if it's not a
file let's just go ahead and give them
air mesh it so system.out.print line and
let's go ahead and print like this is
not a file so hopefully we're never
gonna be receiving this message right
here the only time we're going to be
receiving this message is if they like
selected a file that wasn't a file so
this is a nice little kind of custom
exception handling we just built just
because if we mess up in our program
somewhere then we get a nice little
prompt but now let's get the good stuff
what do we want to do if it is a file
which it should be by the way well the
first thing we're gonna want to do is
put a try-catch statement in here and
we're gonna wanted to do this because
we're gonna be working with files and
anytime you're working with files like
reading them you usually want to try
catch in there so let's go ahead and
build that catch right now so catch just
catch all exceptions exception e and go
ahead and put something like
system.out.print line e and if you don't
know what any of this is then I
recommend going to my drops tutorials in
my main page and then you'll understand
what everything I'm doing right now but
if this is too advanced for you then I
go check out my basic Java tutorials but
all the other guys who suffered through
my other Java tutorials you should know
what all this means so now we put a try
and catch statement so at first checks
if it is a file and then if it is it's
going to try to do this code so what do
we want to put in here
what we actually want to put in here is
we need a way to read that file so
what we're gonna have is some of the
code buffered reader and this is a built
in class in Java and I'm gonna name my
reader reader and this is pretty much
how you read files in Java it's one of
the many ways and I'm gonna set it equal
to new buffered reader hopefully I
didn't mess up and as your parameters
you need to type new file reader and put
the file name in here and remember we
don't have to type the whole directory
because we've stored it in this nice
little variable right here so instead of
writing this whole thing we have the
privilege of just rank file right here
so this reader right here is pretty much
gonna allow you to read your file and if
you're wondering number this stuff came
from bufferedreader and file reader
these are built-in classes in Java that
allow you to read files how nice of them
to put them in for us so what we're
going to do is read through each line of
the file and each time we get to a new
line we're gonna increment this row
counter so how do we do that really easy
just make a simple while loop and put
this while I move my cursor every reader
it's not read or reader dot read line
can't type today read line and put is
not equal to null and what this is
pretty much saying is all right this
read line by the way method is built
into Java and this pretty much reads
your file line by line using this reader
object that we just built and what this
is pretty much saying all right if we
get a line and it's equal to something
it's pretty much not empty what do we
want to do well what we want to do is
just take that row variable and
increment it by 1 so in essence here's
what I'm saying if you have one line in
your file
that's not empty we're gonna say alright
this row is equal to 1 if you have 10
files or excuse me
if you have 10 rows in your file this
counter is gonna be equal to 10 if you
have 20 which we should beginning this
counter is going to be equal to 20 so
this is a really simple
way of counting the rows in your file
and again we're gonna need to count the
rows to in order when we create our rate
we need to tell it how big to make our
array so the last thing we need to do is
since we promised Java we're gonna
return an integer variable is let me
figure out where the end my method is
right there let's just go ahead and put
return row so what this is gonna do is
pretty much count all of the rows in
your file and then return that variable
so now if we go ahead and go ahead and I
forgot the name of it already fine row
number let's just copy that cuz I'm lazy
paste we're gonna print out the row
number and now if we run this we should
get 20 come on no whammy no whammy BAM
look at that 20 so we pretty much just
printed the return value of that fine
row number so let me explain you guys
one last time what that means so there
isn't any confusion we built a method
called fine row number to find them
pretty much row number done they explain
that part but it did the first thing we
did is set to Rho equal to 0 in case
somewhere else in our program later down
line we mess it up somewhere
we checked if that file we were looking
at is actually a file and this should
return true all the time if it is we
pretty much tried this code right here
again we shouldn't be getting it this is
just errors down here we pretty much
read that file this reads the entire
file this reads line by line and every
time we've got that new line we
incremented that variable by one so
since it had 20 lines that is the value
it returned at the bottom 20 so that is
why it printed out 20 right here so now
that we got that number 20 of rows
whenever we create an array we know how
big to make our array how awesome is
that and again we don't have to even
figure out how many columns do it
because there is always 7 columns in
that file so this is a getting a little
too easy
so any problem in this program right
here so make sure you have your code
just like mine or if you're just
watching it for fun just listen to me
talk you know just watch but in the next
program we're gonna be taking this file
and add to that we just got and we're
gonna be building our array so thank you
guys for watching and don't forget to
subscribe and I will see you next
