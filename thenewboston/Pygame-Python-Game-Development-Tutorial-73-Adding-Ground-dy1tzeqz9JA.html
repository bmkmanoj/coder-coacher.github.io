welcome to another PI game tutorial
video in this video what we're doing is
adding a ground to our game so at the
moment when we play our game you know
we've got this tank here and we've got
this you know barrier here but that
there's no like ground and really our
our explosion is occurring below our
tank so these are like floating tanks
which you know that's totally a
possibility in the future but for now I
think it would be wise for us to go
ahead and add a like ground to the game
so let's guy didn't do that so first of
all let's just add ground the ground
isn't gonna change at all in this game
so let's just say we add ground ground
underscore height here and I'm sure how
many pixels up the tank is but we'll
find out soon enough so let's make the
ground height 24 now we'll probably have
to adjust that but we'll make it 24 now
so then we're gonna scroll all the way
down to basically the fire shell
function so what are all the things that
have to change when we move the ground
up you have to kind of think about these
things well for the most part not much
the tank doesn't need to change because
the tank doesn't know where the ground
is anyways the barrier doesn't really
need to change because like you could
draw the barrier on top of the ground if
you want but you can also just draw the
ground right over the barrier and it'll
look like you've drawn their barrier
right over the ground you know and then
finally it really the only thing that
needs to be changed is where we're
exploding because we're exploding that
are under the tank so what we'll do now
is we've got fire shell here and
basically we ask the question if the
starting shouts this is the little block
of text that's asking if the shell has
hit the ground so basically if if that
is greater than display height
- the ground underscore height then we'd
want to run the ground height
functionality there and then we also
need to subtract let's see so this is
display height right we need to say
because this is beta this is what we're
saying here is that like this is where
the hit is occurring so times display
height and then we will do - ground
height there and then also display
height - ground height again so that's
quite where the impact is that's what's
gonna draw the explosion so good enough
that should be all we need to change
there and now what we want to do is
actually draw the draw the ground on our
on our game so what we want to do is
scroll all the way down and basically
after all of this code then you've got
the game display dot filled out white
basically anything after that we can go
ahead and draw the ground but I would
recommend that we draw the ground after
the barrier that way it's like over the
barrier a little bit so then what we can
do is we can go game if you remember
there's two ways that we could do this
we could use pi game draw it out rect
and draw a rectangle totally fine what
we can actually sense it's such a large
amount of space that we're gonna use up
any ways we can use dot fill as I was
telling you you can use dot fill to
actually do any rectangle so and if you
remember dot fill we can actually do
graphics acceleration on it but we're
not going to be getting into that but
still I'll show you that anyways again
so we would do game display doc fill and
then we would say green but we just add
another parameter here which is wrecked
and here you give the rect of X Y width
height it's basically so it would be
zero comma and then display
this way underscore height minus the
ground underscore height and then you
would have this is zero display height
minus ground height and then you would
have display underscore width so the
whole width and then ground underscore
height so X Y so like X Y and like these
are the starting points to the top left
X Y and then the width is display width
and height round right done so now let's
go ahead and save and run that play and
you can see that there is our ground
it's not quite making it to our tank yet
but if we fire you'll see it's exploding
on the ground so that's fabulous and
then also on the barrier if we hit it
well we know we had to bring the ground
up a little bit so 20 was a little more
than half so I'm gonna vote for 35 we'll
see if that does it for us all the way
to the top ground height 35 see how that
works out
oh man what a perfect guess my goodness
I'm proud of myself
no there we go nice shot man okay so I
got a tank we've got a ground
we're obviously missing a very major
major and integral part of our game
however and that is an enemy tank so in
the coming videos that's press what
we're gonna have to be covering next
because we're just very lonely player at
the moment so stay tuned for that
hopefully you guys enjoyed as always
thanks for watching and stay tuned nice
