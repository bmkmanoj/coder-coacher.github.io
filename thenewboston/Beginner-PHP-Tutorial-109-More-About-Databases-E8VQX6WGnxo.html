let's just put some pseudocode here
select a data or select the username
from users so this is our table here
where the ID is equal is equal to two so
this is what we call a query this is in
potato code at the moment I haven't well
almost it's just English English
language but I am what I've done here is
I've constructed a something called a
query and what a query does is allow us
it allows us to use specific syntax this
isn't specific syntax at the moment to
select information from different parts
so what we're doing here is we're
selecting the username in this column
here from users table which is this
whole table here where the ID is equal
to two so the idea is equal to two we
want to select the username and we're
taking the username which is Billy so
this query would return the value of
Billy so you can see the advantages of
storing inside a database it might look
complicated at this stage but when you
start to use it inside PHP PHP makes it
very easy for you to extract data even
insert data and perform a variety of
queries etc and that's done through
MySQL so you can also have other tables
so we can have table let's say uploads
we might have allowed users to upload
files now why is this going to be useful
let's just add another column called ID
and then I'm going to say user ID and
I'm going to say location so the ID will
again be auto increment but this time
user ID what we're doing here is we're
referencing the user ID back to this
initial ID because that is the users ID
so you can call these column names
anything you like but I recommend
something of the similar structure so
user ID might be one and the location of
the file that's been uploaded might be
logo dot PNG for example and now we can
come onto say record too and this might
be user ID one again might have uploaded
a file called PHP jpg entrepreneur three
and we might have user up user to upload
a file called Arctic jpg so now what we
can do is we can perform a query to say
and let's say our user is logged in as
Alex what we would do is we would have
the ID ready to select things relative
to Alex so the idea is one this is
unique to the user
Alex so what we could do is we could say
select location from uploads remember
this is the table name where user ID is
one now what this query here would do is
return the values wherever the user ID
was one so it would essentially return
these two now we've selected location
only so what it would do is it would
only bring back this data so what we can
do to speed things up we can select a
specific earth column name so we can
save time in our program our load time
and we can save uhm you know resources
so this is essentially databases
the reason we use databases is it's a
quick and easy way to add information
somewhere that can be easily retrieved
we don't have to deal with text files we
don't have to deal with comma delimited
files or space delimited files or tab
delimited files which would look
something like Alex Garrett PHP academy'
de org we can have maybe one there I
might have to Billy Garrett and nothing
so to do this we would need to open the
file we would you need to use an explode
function to get rid of these commas and
put this into an array then what we
would do is we would have to select a
specific part of the array so either 0 1
2 or 3 but by putting it into a database
you're creating almost something that
you can visually look at you can
visualize as a whole and extract
specific data and insert specific data
you can also update data really really
easily as well with with just a single
query so that's an introduction to
databases like I said we're going to be
using the database MySQL which is
sometimes pronounced my sequel and SQL
stands for structured query language now
I've been talking about queries and this
is exactly that we have a structured
query in which to retrieve update delete
create anything inside of our table so
this is just the name of the database
we're going to be using</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
