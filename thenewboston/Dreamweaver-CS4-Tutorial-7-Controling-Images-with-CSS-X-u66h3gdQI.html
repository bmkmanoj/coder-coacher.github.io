going to show you how to insert an image
and move it around and give it some
space basically wrap the text around it
with just CSS so we're going to insert
our image here grab image and once you
have an image in place we are going to
create a new CSS rule for CSS new rule
image I'm gonna make it a class we're
gonna make it an internal CSS rule we're
going to go to box and we're going to
say let's float left which means we're
going to wrap the text around to the
right of it but it's gonna float to the
left and we're gonna add some padding
we're gonna give it 10 pixels of padding
on all sides and as we can see inside of
our HTML document it created this style
for us with the image class and it's
going to give 10 pixels of padding all
around and it's gonna float to the left
so we're going to go inside our document
and we're gonna click on the image
itself I'm going to right click down
here we can see with the images and
we're gonna say set class to image and
we can see that all of the text moved to
the right and it floats to the left we
can also change the class that I meant
by setting it right here we could say
none where we say image where we go here
and say no
and sent class to image does the same
thing also if you want to change it
maybe go to the right you can say right
and you can change the batting to if you
want to add more space in between there
and that is how you control your image
with CSS thanks for watching and don't
