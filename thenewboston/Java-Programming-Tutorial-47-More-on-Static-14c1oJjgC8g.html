tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
to be finishing up talking about static
members and also I'm going to be showing
you a nice little trick that you can use
when accessing static members so go
ahead and in your toon class or not the
class was not your main method in it
class without your main method and there
we go and let's go ahead and under this
constructor let's go ahead and build
three other simple little methods we're
just going to have one to return the
first name returning last name and
returning member so public string and
let's just name it like get first it's
not going to take any parameters and
we're just going to have it return first
simple enough and now let's go ahead and
make one for last name public string get
last and guess what we're going to have
this one to return last oh you guess
that on a pad and now let's have one
more and we'll name it um it's a public
static remember this method needs to be
static static and gets Emmy and BRS I
know I could figure out how to spell
members get members and then what are we
going to have this one do let's just
have returned members so now we have
three variables up here a private first
private last and a private members which
is static this method returns first name
this method returns the last name in
this method right here it's going to
return the variable members so now that
we have three objects made go back in
your main apples class or whatever you
call it let's go ahead and let me show
you how each member has its own set of
data so let's just go ahead and for
housekeeping sake put system.out.print
line
and let's just go ahead and print an
empty line right there
there because it'll just be easier now
let's just go ahead and copy that
because we're going to be using it I
didn't know we can do that did we
and let's just go ahead and put what do
we want to print on our first line and
it's really our first line because this
one's just an empty line well what I
want to show you that is even though
they all share that variable called
members they each have their own set of
data so let's go ahead and put member 1
which is our object 1 which is Megan Fox
and we'll put get first and then let's
do this with last copy get last and was
lesson called get members so get members
so here's what's going on now um make
sure it's going to print out yep so
anytime you call this one it's going to
have Megan Fox and this is unique to its
own object but it's going to look at get
members and see that it's static so it's
going to share this variable with all
the other ones so depending on how many
members are in this then that's what
it's going to print so let me go ahead
and run this click OK and we have again
we have our other data that up there if
you're wondering oh it went but it says
Megan which is unique Fox which is
unique in 3 which is shared among all
objects so now let's go ahead and change
that to 2 remember to remember to
remember to now let's go ahead and run
this and now you can clearly see Natalie
which is unique
Portman which is unique and 3 again that
3 and that 3 is because this private
static int static means our this
variable is shared between all objects
so we don't need to you know why would
you make a separate variable if it like
anything how do
put this why would you make a separate
variable that is going to be unique that
we're going to have to update in every
object if it's the same value no matter
what object to this so I mean you don't
need to so we're not gonna so that's
where static comes in handy and now let
me show you that trick I was talking
about um since the variable static
variables don't change between objects
static information is value is available
even when you don't have an object so
for example say forget about all these
objects right here and we actually can't
just delete them but we'll delete these
right here and we can just add in this
print liner really instead of calling a
separate object like an object and then
your dot separator and then your method
like that what you can do with stack is
just put the name of the class and put
your dot separator and then put your
method get' members like that now let me
run this and you can see the three right
here can you guys see that the three
right there so before we were never able
to do this we had to get an object and
go to object anytime we want an access
to any of these members or any of these
methods right here but with a static
it's a little bit different because it's
not going to change from object to
object since no matter how many objects
you have the variable is the same so
that's why I Java lets you instead of
having to have an object which you can
do by the way what we just did you can
also just put the class name and put the
static method ahead of that so again
anytime you have a static method that
use static variables um you don't have
to have a separate object you can just
put the class name and then you can just
put the method and that's how like in
arm stuff like math like math functions
and math constants on that's how they do
that so that's just a nice little tidbit
of information so don't forget that
um static variables are shared among all
objects and that you don't have to
access static methods with a specific
object you can just do it with a whole
class since it's the same so thank you
guys for watching I think I confuse the
enough for today but uh like I said
thank you for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I will see you next
