roberts and welcome to your very first
javascript tutorial now for those of you
who have no idea what javascript is
javascript is basically a scripting
language used to make webpages more
interactive so for example if you have a
webpage and you maybe want to add a
calculator to it or maybe you want to
put a quiz on it or maybe you just want
to have a navigation bar with some cool
rollover buttons well in order to do
this you need to use a special language
called JavaScript and that's why I'm
going to be teaching you guys but before
I begin and we start typing JavaScript
you guys need a couple of things first
the first thing you need is a text
editor now any text editor will work
fine but I'm going to use one called
notepad plus plus now if you don't have
this you can go ahead Google and
download it it's actually free and it's
actually the one I recommend it's the
best it's awesome again notepad plus
plus go ahead and type that into Google
and you'll be good to go another thing
that you guys are going to need is a
knowledge of XHTML and that's what this
is right here if you guys don't know how
to create a basic web page in XHTML then
you need to watch that series first I
made a XHTML and CSS tutorial series
before this so if you don't know how to
create a basic web page go ahead and
watch that it's on my youtube channel as
well as on my website the New Boston com
so anyways once you have those two
things then welcome to the world of
JavaScript so let's go ahead and for all
you guys let's begin I take a deep
breath and get ready and let's go so
like I said javascript is something that
you add to webpages in order to make it
more interactive so just like everything
else in XHTML you need to add JavaScript
through the use of tags now the tag for
JavaScript is called scr i PT script and
now let me mention this
in the internet there are a lot of
different scripts that you can add to
web pages
there's JavaScript actually there's like
50 different types of scripting
languages javascript is just one of them
so when our browser comes across this
code we need to tell explicitly that
we're going to be working with
JavaScript so in order to tell our
browser that we need to give it an
attribute called type and we set this
equal to text slash JavaScript go ahead
and end that and go ahead and add an
ending script tag and in between these
tags is where you're going to be typing
all of your JavaScript code so that is
JavaScript code it's not really but you
know that's my example and in between
here like I said all of our coding is
going to be done so let's go ahead and
actually let's write a real simple
program right now go ahead and copy me
document dot write and inside
parenthesis with a semicolon at the end
add quotation marks in array like hey
now brown cow
now I know you guys don't understand
what this document really why we had
parentheses or why we even have a
semicolon at the end but for now I just
want to make sure that JavaScript is set
up in your browser and you're able to
run it so let's go ahead and save this
and go ahead and you can press run
launch in Chrome launched an ie I want
you in whatever browser you want so let
me go ahead and move this back and check
out what we got hey now brown cow
so as you can see JavaScript is working
in my browser if anything like that pops
up in your browser that means that well
you're probably at school and they try
to block YouTube or you know something
so they probably took JavaScript off
your browser's by anyways um make sure
that you have JavaScript set up so if
you see this that means your goods go if
you get an error message or don't see
this at all that means that it's not
working in your browser and you need to
fix that so with that being said let me
mention one more thing
a lot of the older browsers like you
know when they first started making the
internet and web pages a lot of the
browser's didn't understand JavaScript
their main job was just to understand a
basic HTML web page so whenever they try
to read a program like this it's just
going to come across them back whoa what
the heck is this I don't know so I'm
just going to go ahead and type out
what's ever in there and we want hey now
brown cow to type out on our web page we
don't want this whole long string of
text right here so if it's you know
typing out something weird or something
other than hey now brown cow that maybe
the issue is that you have an older
browser and it doesn't understand what
javascript is so anyways if you know
that you're going to be making a web
page using JavaScript and a lot of
people with older computers are going to
be looking at it or if you know that
your viewers have older browsers you
might want to add a little safety check
in order to protect against older
browsers from trying to read this
javascript go ahead and put the greater
than sign or is it the less than sign I
think that's a lesson sign explanation
point - - and when you're done with your
javascript go ahead and press forward to
us for / - - greater than sign now
whenever older browsers come across this
it's going to think that this is just a
comment and it's just going to ignore it
basically so go ahead and save this in a
refresh and see what we get you can see
that since this is a new browser it's
going to know not to ignore and it's
going to be smart enough to know that
this is indeed JavaScript but if I had
an old browser it wouldn't type anything
at all so that's a nice little safety
check that you can use against older
browsers it's going to work with or
without it but for the sake of this
tutorial since I know that I'm going to
be using a new browser I'm going to go
ahead and delete them because I mean we
only have so much space here and that's
just taking up space but anyways it's
common practice or it's good practice
that include those whenever you're
typing JavaScript so I'm not but you
might want to personal preference so
anyways well that's probably all I need
to teach you guys for this tutorial in
the next tutorial we're probably going
to be talking about
out comments and variables so anyways go
ahead and you know just get JavaScript
set up go ahead and include these tags
and make sure that you you know try to
test out this line of code and trust me
I know you guys don't understand what's
going on right now but now that you're
set up you're ready to move on to the
next tutorial so anyways thank you guys
for watching don't forget subscribe to
my videos and I'll see you guys well in
the next store</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
