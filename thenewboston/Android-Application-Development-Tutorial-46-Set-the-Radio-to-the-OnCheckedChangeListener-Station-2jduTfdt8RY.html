tutorial for the new boss in we're gonna
do in this tutorials I'm going to tell
you about the on check change method but
first I want to make sure you guys got
everything set up because I didn't
realize I forgot that you guys probably
want your variables the same as mine so
here's for my data class setup some two
buttons for the start activity and start
for result the text view of the edit
text text view then again for the data
class you want to use the get layout and
then I've created this initialize method
which initialized all those variables
set the references set the
onclicklistener to this and then I just
want to show you this as well because I
before I'd tell you guys to do the view
dot on click listener and do it that way
but also you can just type on click
listener but if you hover over you have
two different classes where the on click
listener comes from ones from the dialog
interface you don't want that one you
want it coming from the view package so
just click on that one and then again we
just have to implement that so there we
go we have our on click method set up
for the most part we'll get into that
later but also the other thing I want
you guys to change real quick is our
send XML I forgot I wanted to add a one
button here so just drag and drop a
button in there call let the text be
returned and then the ID is button
return right there
nothing too new you guys can again you
know set that up however but I just want
to show you guys how I set this up and
then I go into go into our open class
and again this is how I set up I had the
two textview references question and
test the button reference return data
had the layout set to send set up an
initialize method again where I added
those references and just going to set
up that
sit onclicklistener real quick again
this class is going to implement the
implement the onclicklistener
so there we go we have the basic setup
now what we want to do is basically
reference this radio group if we
reference the radio group we can get
some information about which button was
pressed so what we're going to do is
we're going to set up a global variable
whoops it's the menu class don't worry
about that so what we're gonna do is
we're gonna say within our initialized
or you guys if you set up your variables
here just do it in the next line but
what we're going to say is radio group
that we can use within different methods
so radio group and we're going to call
this our g4 radio group or will say
selection list something like that make
it a little bit more descriptive so
there we go we have a a radio group
set it up set up and then go within your
initialize method or wherever you guys
are using or whatever you guys are using
for the most part we're going to say
selected our selection list which is
again a radio group we're gonna hit dot
we're going to say set on and then it
gives you pretty much the preference
that it's going to look for again we
could do like onclicklistener but it's
better to say on check checked change
listener because any time one of those
radio buttons within this radio group is
clicked it's going to call this method
basically the unchecked change listener
as you guys can see here you can see
within his parameters it takes a very
variable type or object from the most
part unchecked change listener so what
we're going to do is we're going to
implement the on check change listener
just like when we say set on click
listener it takes on click thing within
it we can implement two classes so
that's what I kind of want to show you
guys and again we're just going to say
this because we're going to implement it
so how you implement two classes is you
just hit comma do and then do a on
checked change
listener because again this is a class
name that this set on check change
listener is looking for so all we got to
do is hit hover over and say import and
again we have two options we want import
from the radio group class so select
that one again we have to use the
methods every time we implement
something so add unimplemented methods
now when you implement something again
you have to use the method within it and
when you extend something you can use a
method in it but the thing is you can
only extends one class so I couldn't do
like you know another class here or
something
you can but you can implement more than
one class so that's nice that's it's
kind of a difference between
implementing and extending as well so
basically when we scroll down this is
for a button that we have that Return
button that we set up and this is for a
radio group and at any time one of those
radio buttons is selected it's going to
tell us what group it's from and also
which basically the ID of which button
was selected so we're going to go within
here because again it gives us kind of
the information about the radio group
that was pressed or something changed
within it it's also going to tell us
which button within that radio group was
pressed so what we're going to do is set
up a switch in case kind of like we do
anytime we have multiple things going on
and it's pretty simple all we're going
to do is say path pass in the second
argument called arg1 and this is going
to give us pretty much the button that's
pressed or the ID of the button so now
what our cases are going to be is just
the IDS of those buttons so we're going
to say case then our dot ID dot our
crazy
what's our top answer top one was crazy
and we're going to just set this up for
the most part copy and paste this twice
because we had two buttons
and change this from our crazy to our
sexy and are both and control shift f4
format you can do that in job as well so
again it's given us the ID of the button
and then if we're looking for this
individual button it's going to set that
up so there we go we basically have our
class set up for the most part we'll
break it down a little bit more in the
next tutorial so I'll catch you guys
then and hope you have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
