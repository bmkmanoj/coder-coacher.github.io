buddy Blackford we're going to learn in
Adobe After Effects cs6 today with the
new boston and today we're going to be
learning about the auto key frame mode
and let's get started guys
so the auto keyframe button is right
here and it's you know it's selected
when it turns red also Auto key framing
for warning can mess up your composition
or your project if you don't use it
correctly so make sure you only want to
have this on when you know you're going
to auto key frame things and turn it off
when you're done using it so what the
auto key frame button does is anytime
you change a parameter it's going to
automatically keyframe it wherever the
frame is that you're on so right now I
created this little tuna thing here tuna
can terribly drawn but I mean I just
needed something to show you this real
quick so I'm going to open up the
transform menu for all everything so you
can see real quick turning on the auto
key frame doesn't set the stop watches
but if I move this let me change the
position you can see that it has created
a keyframe if I move this over and also
you can see it doesn't create a keyframe
for everything it just creates it for
what you have changed so I move in the
timeline a little bit and I'll move this
down creates another keyframe and so on
there we go so it created this little
motion path without me having to click
on the keyframe button every single time
so maybe I want to come over here and
change the scale
now it's going to change the scale at
that point it also starts off on your
first keyframe that you make it starts
it off at that scale so it's not going
to start at zero it's just going to stay
there right now only things are animated
when there's two keyframes so maybe I
want to go back here and start this back
at 100% now it AutoKey framed it and it
actually scales as you can see that you
can see how this might get a little
risky if you're forget to turn it off
and you're trying to set like default
values maybe forgot it's turned off and
the opacity you wanted to change it to
like fifty percent or something like
that
well now it's keyframe there and you
forgot that it was you forgot that you
made a keyframe you want to change it to
75 percent to start out for the whole
comp well now it's going to keyframe and
go to fit from 75 percent to 50 percent
so make sure if you have auto keyframe
on you have it on only when you want it
to be on so that's basically how Auto
key frame works there's not much more
about it I just wanted to give you the
warning and wanted to show you it
because it is a time saver if you need
to animate a bunch of different ways
usually I keep it on up and just keep it
on for one parameter do that parameter
and then go back from the beginning and
then do the next parameter also a quick
tip is that when auto key frame it is on
it's on for the entire project so a
project contains compositions this is a
composition right here that's called
animation and if I go into maybe this
son this composition here
you can see that it's still turned on so
remember that when you're switching
between compositions that's the end of
this quick tutorial I hope you guys
learn something here and remember to
stay vigilant when you're making stuff
in Adobe After Effects see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
