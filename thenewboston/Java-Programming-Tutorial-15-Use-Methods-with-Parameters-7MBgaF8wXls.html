Jeff tutorial and in this tutorial I'm
going to be teaching you guys how to use
methods with parameters now in this
tutorial we're also going to be building
a custom function where we're going to
let the user enter their name in the
outside class and it's going to call it
in the main class in just say like hello
to whatever your name is or something
so if that sounds complicated then I'll
follow along and I promise I'll make it
easier it's probably easier just to see
then maybe even say so follow-on so
again we have our main appleís class
with our main function or method in here
and we have our outside toona class with
the method that we call so let's go
ahead and clear everything out of your
public class tuna if you have anything
in there because we're going to be
adding a new method so go ahead and type
as I do public void and we want our
simple message again and instead of just
adding empty parameters this time we
needed to take an argument in our
parameters and let's go ahead and make a
string variable and call it name so
again anytime you have something in your
parameters is called an argument in an
argument or extra parameter data is
pretty much any extra information that
the method needs in order to work so let
me show you guys what this method
actually does and you'll see why it
needs extra data what it does is just
system.out.print line it just prints on
the screen hello and then it prints the
name so if you don't have a name it will
print hello and nothing so again an
argument is any extra information that
the program needs to run so again what
this is going to do is print hello and
then your name so before we use it we
need to do a couple stuff to our main
function of course to enter our name we
need to import the scanner or else we
have no way of importing a data to Java
so go ahead and import java.util.scanner
and this is going to allow us to use a
scanner so we can give information to
our program next we need to make a
scanner object so let's go ahead scanner
name an input new scanner and I believe
that I tell you guys how to do this in
the last tutorial so you should know
what I'm doing
system in and that's that for that line
that makes that we can use the scanner
Mexico ahead and do what we did last
time and create a tune object so we can
use this object to get the information
from the tune class we just need that
empty parameters next let's go ahead and
print
system.out.print line
spell alright and we just want to write
a prompt to the user so it knows what to
do
enter your name here so this is pretty
much the only thing that's going to go
on right now
we now have text on the screen that says
enter your name here now we need the
next thing they enter to be stored in
the variable name so let's go ahead and
make string name so the variable name is
equal to input next line and I told you
guys how to input integers using the
scanners anytime you want to input a
string use this next line method so
again anything that the user enters is
going to be stored in the variable name
so now what it's going to do is look at
name and say hello name so if you're
entered Bucky it's going to say alright
Bucky equals name so hello Bucky so now
before I do that we need to actually use
that object to call the method
so tuna object and go ahead and put your
dot separator simple message with your
name parameters and again unlike last
time where you don't use anything at all
you have to put the argument that it
takes in here and this says again that
this isn't just a method that you don't
need any X
information for we're going to give you
this extra information for something
because we want you to do something with
it so go ahead and let's run this
program and then I'll show you guys what
does later enter your name here um bucky
roberts and then it says hello bucky
roberts and let me talk you guys through
this one last time we imported the
scanner because that's how we uh how
Java allows us to input stuff in the
computer like i typed in bucky roberts
without this I wouldn't be able to type
in anything next in our main function we
set our a we want to put this this just
allows you to use the scanner after you
imported it we next made an object
because without object we can't use
anything in this class as I taught you
in the last tutorial next we just put a
prompt on the screen we learned this
like in the first tutorial just showed
what we need to do next
we put all right we have a variable
called name we want this to be equal to
anything we type in B and that's so if
you have different users that are using
this program doesn't just type the same
message you can use it for a bunch of
different users no matter what they type
in for their name next we set our write
in the class tuna use a method called
simple message that takes an argument of
name so it's going to go look at all the
classes find the one called tuna and
find the method that's called simple
message and and do whatever it says to
do and what this method says to do is
say alright take a variable called name
which we already had we just gave it to
it and then just print out hello
whatever the name is so it says alright
hello
Bucky Roberts so that is how you use a
method with a parameter and that's what
parameters do is just the extra bit of
information that you might need to run a
program so again that's your quick
tutorial on how to use methods with
parameters in a different class so thank
you guys for watching and don't forget
to subscribe to my channel for all my
latest videos and also check out my
contests so again thank you and
hope to see you in my next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
