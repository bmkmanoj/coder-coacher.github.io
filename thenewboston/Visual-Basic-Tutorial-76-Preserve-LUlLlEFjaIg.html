slash on live gamer for the New Boston
in this tutorial we're going to be
taking a look at the preserved keyword
now if you remember the last tutorial we
created a little application that has to
list boxes it has the first array and
then the new array after we read eclair
it by using the Redeem keyword and we
went through and we use the for each
loop to add each item to the first list
box before it's changed then we're e
declared it using read in and then we
added the two values to the end of it
that weren't already there and then when
we added them again you can see that we
get a problem here we have blank values
inside of our array now here I'll just
show you guys what will happen if we
don't have the brackets here so if we go
ahead and delete these you're going to
see that we can error because it cannot
reference nulls and place them in a list
box so go ahead and click read them and
you can see that the application freezes
up says value cannot be no parameter
named item so the way we fix this is
just by adding the brackets around it so
at least there's something being put
into the list box so we'll go ahead and
stop it here or we can drag this arrow
right up there and then continue running
it let me close out of that and you can
see that it works just fine so now we're
going to do is we're going to talk about
the preserved keyword so sorry I had to
pause there so I may be off topic a
little bit but um after we use the
Redeem keyword we can use the keyword
preserve now if you read the description
for this it says prevents the content
contents of an array from being cleared
when the dimensions of the array arch of
the array are changed so it just
preserves the original array you had and
adds on the existing items and now read
them that stands for word read dimension
so if we go ahead and run this
you can see that if we click read in we
get basketball I mean baseball
basketball football over here then
baseball and basketball football
wakeboarding and soccer
so you can see that preserved all the
items in our string sports now let's go
ahead and make the array smaller and you
will see that data is lost even though
we use preserve so we'll just add soccer
here so if we re declare and preserve or
read them and preserve string sports but
this time we only let it hold in four
spaces or let's say four spaces instead
of five if we go ahead and run this you
can see that we get baseball basketball
football wakeboarding and soccer and
down here we get baseball basketball
football and wakeboarding so even though
you use the preserve keyword data is
still going to be lost if you make your
array smaller now if we just read eclair
it right here and run it you can see
that it gives us four blank spots
because we did not preserve what we
already had in there
and we made a smaller so even so data is
lost and there is nothing down here
after wakeboarding so we just have an
empty array that holds four spaces so
preserve is a very simple concept it
should be you should catch on to it
really quick once you practice a little
bit with reading and preserving arrays
go ahead and move on to the next
tutorial and if it's not out yet just
wait a little bit and it'll probably be
posted soon so thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
