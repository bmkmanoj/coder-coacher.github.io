tutorial by making Florida in Boston and
in this tutorial I'm going to give you a
quick overview of namespaces and classes
so in the next tutorial I'm going to go
a little bit more in depth on classes so
all you're going to need for this
tutorial is a class and in order to add
a class file to your project you can do
one of two things you can go up to
project and then go down to add class or
you can right click on your project in
the solution Explorer go down to add in
a class now once it's dialog pops up
make sure that class is selected now you
can give a name to your class I'm just
going to call it my class right now but
you're usually going to want to call it
something that is relevant to what your
class does once you're satisfied with
the name just go ahead and put add now
you should have this new class file
ready and if you cannot see your class
file let's go over the solution Explorer
and click on the class file that I've
created for you
in order to go back to your form just
click on your format solutions floor
right here or you can use these tabs up
here at the top and right here we have a
name space and the name space is the
same name as our our projects name but
I'm just going to call it my name
today's all right and what name spaces
are used for is we're used to organize
classes interfaces and structs and we'll
get into interfaces and structs later on
you can have a name space inside of a
name space so we created a name space
here it would be like a subcategory of
whatever this was it let's call it mine
so next and now inside of this name
space we could put classes and
interfaces constructs as well so and
what classes are used for is they're
used to organize things like variables
and
um methods so we could have like a
method in here that shows a massive box
and another method that shows a
different type of massive box or
something like that and usually the
things inside of the classes work
together or they work very closely
together so like they do things that are
very similar to one another so in order
to access a namespace you've created
you're going to need to use a using
statement so if we go back here and in
order to access this main space that we
created
we'd have to type using and then our
namespace name which is myname space and
then since we have a sub namespace in
there we have my sub namespace however
if you wanted to access this class right
here we wouldn't do dot my sub namespace
because this class is not inside of this
namespace and right here we have this
using system that window dot forms and
this system is a namespace this windows
names based side of this system
namespace and this forms namespace the
name space inside of this Windows
namespace and inside of this formed
namespace is a class called message box
and that's what we use to display a
message box and without this using
statement we would have in order to
access message box to identify file
system windows forms
message box which is a class and as you
can see right there it says class and
then dot show which is the method you to
show the mess of thoughts or does nephew
up go back up here undo until we get
this back we're getting an error all
right so that's pretty much it for this
tutorial and it was just a quick
overview and in the next tutorial we'll
get on to more advanced things so see
you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
