tutorial to go to computer now in these
next couple tutorials I'm going to be
teaching you guys everything you wanted
to know about choosing components for a
computer if they're compatible with the
rest of your computer and finally then
put all the parts together and show you
how to build a computer now I already
got all my parts with me so we're ready
to get started but before we do I just
want to remind you guys make sure you're
watching these tutorials and high def
I'm going to put a link under my
description box and trust me it makes a
whole lot of difference so now that I
gave you guys a little introduction let
me go ahead and get started with my
first component now the very first thing
I do when picking out parts for my
computer or building a new computer is
pick up the CPU and what the CPU is is
the processor it stands for central
processing unit and this is pretty much
the brain of your PC or computer now
what the CPU does is pretty much all of
the data and instructions that are going
to be sent to your computer has to go
through the CPU this is a thing that
makes it all happen
in the CPU therefore is the biggest
factor in performance when building your
computer now you're going to say alright
now I know it's CPU does now what
exactly one do I buy or what am I going
to look for when buying well first of
all you're going to come across one
major issue and that there's two brands
of CPUs you got your AMD CPUs and your
Intel CPUs now what this is is pretty
much just a brand name
some people think one's better than the
other it's pretty much like a Ford and
Toyota or a frosted flakes and fruit
loops it's pretty much just the name
some people for one over the other I
personally prefer Intel but today we're
going to be working with
