video and in this video we have two more
methods to complete show message and
able to type basically I already did
this before and nothing is really that
much different
what show message is going to do is
basically update the GUI so your message
gets displayed in the chat window and
able to type is just going to give the
user permission so they can start typing
things into their little text box so
this first one is change or update chat
window which is the main area where you
view all the messages and I might as
well code this one first private void
show messages um I'll just put messages
as em okay that'll be good enough I
guess try to write messages too late for
that crap I got stuff to do okay so
swing utilities and VOC later and the
reason that I'm not explaining
everything is because I already did it
and I don't really want to waste your
time I'll just show you guys had to do
it so invoke later okay so new runnable
creates a thread and whenever like it's
called it's public void run which pretty
much means you know the main method for
the thread and all we're doing is chat
window okay if I can freakin type it a
pen which pretty much stick on the end
of the string and this bigot this is
basically one long string that appears
in your chat window is the message that
we want to display which got passed in
as M so basically whenever we have a
message that we want to appear on the
screen we don't want only this message
to appear we want it to appear at the
end of the conversation now the
conversation itself is one long string
that gets thrown inside the chat window
so we say okay stick this on the end of
that string and make it appear simple
enough so now that that is taken care
of go outside and now we have to do able
to type and this gives user permission
to type crap into the text box ok good
enough now after this private void able
to type final Blaine TRF which means tor
true or false and now if I can just copy
this I wonder if I copy right there will
be good oh yeah there we go look at oh
man it still isn't properly formatted I
have to go on did I accidently
discuss no I said freaking guys calm
down and pretty much create the same
thing we did last time so new runnable
run a pen except this line of code
changes to use your text set editable
equal to TR f so basically what this
line of code is going to be responsible
for is giving the user permission and
making that textbox editable or not
editable if it is editable and if this
is true then they can type things in and
pretty much send them to the server if
it's not editable then obviously they
can't type anything in obviously can't
send it to the server
so now if I scroll up I should see that
well show message is getting error
because that says show messages which is
not but hopefully I should get no errors
awesome that is a beautiful-looking
program when you see no red x's so
congratulations guys you now did it we
only have the one other client tetes
class to code and once we're done coding
that then we can begin testing this baby
out it's going to be awesome cross my
fingers I really hope that it works so
thank you guys for watching don't forget
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
