Photoshop tutorial
last time we covered the interface and
found our way around Photoshop this time
I'm gonna be going in to the specifics
of colors so we just touched on this
down here a little bit but I'm going to
talk about this a little more this is
called the foreground color right here
there's teal color and this red color is
called the background color
now this foreground color whenever
you're painting this is the main color
you paint with and the swishing me
between the foreground color in the
background color you just use this
little toggle menu right here and as you
can see see they switch or if you want
to use the default black and white you
can click this little black and white
square right there now if you double
click any of these colors you're taken
to
something that's called the color picker
and then the color picker does exactly
that as you can see we have a slider
right here look it slide over any of
these main colors to select any of the
main colors that we want to choose
and as you can see as we in the main
section we can see the new color that we
have chosen right here and the current
color that we're replacing right here
and anytime you find a color that you
want and you want to add it to your
swatch all you have to do is click this
button add to swatches and you can name
it something if you'd like and then
click OK and now it's on your sweat
swatch panel and this color libraries
button right here takes you to some
different libraries that are preset in
Photoshop with basic colors and their
relatives and if you're making a web
document then you probably want to use
web-safe colors colors that you can use
and incorporate on your website to do so
to do that click this only web colors
and now you have a list of all the
colors that you could use on the web or
if you already know your specific color
you can type it in right here so let's
click OK and now we have selected green
and let me talk to you about what color
mode you're gonna be working on if you
click on image and highlight mode it
gives you all different color modes your
you either on be an RGB or CMYK these
are our main color modes or if you want
to make a grayscale image this is how
you changed at the grayscale and the
last thing I want to talk to you about
is the color palettes right over here
here are all your main swatches and if
you added a color then they appear right
under the swatches and if you want to be
finicky you can adjust your color
slightly the red green and blue value
and if you ever close this out you can
go to window and all of your palettes
are right there and the last thing we're
going to talk about colors today is
again remind you of the eyedropper tool
when you select this you can select any
color on your image in that color
becomes your main foreground color so
that's all the time we have for right
now if you're not already there you can
go to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
