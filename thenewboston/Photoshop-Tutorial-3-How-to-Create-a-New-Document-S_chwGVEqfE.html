Photoshop tutorial and in this tutorial
I'm going to show you guys how to create
a new document now this is a little bit
more difficult than creating like a new
document in Microsoft Word because you
just don't press file new and then
you're good to go they're actually a lot
of settings that you need to go through
before you create a document and I'm
going to be talking guys through all of
those settings right now so go ahead and
choose file new and like I said unlike
any other program where everything just
pops up and it's ready to go you have to
answer a bunch of questions or fill out
a form before you can you know make a
new document so the first one name it's
easy I'll just name this you know
YouTube name it whatever pretty much the
name of your file so whenever you save
it this is going to be the default name
that it saves under now right here your
next option is your preset now this is
generally a the main option you want to
focus on first because you need to ask
yourself first what are you using this
for if you're just going to make a
graphic for the web or you know just
something that you're going to stick on
a blog or something then just go ahead
and put a default Photoshop size and
it's going to fill out the rest of these
settings for you however if you're
making like a flyer for I don't know
maybe you're going to make a have a
garage sale or something then usually
want to choose US paper or maybe you're
working on something for a movie then
you can choose film and video and then
it's going to give you some more options
of your video but just for the probably
the rest of these tutorials and just for
default you usually want to stick with
default Photoshop size and then
everything is filled up basically how
you want it to so the next setting
unless you're doing anything weird then
just go ahead and stick with that the
next setting is the width and height now
usually whenever you're working with the
web then you want to work in pixels but
some people prefer inches again if
you're overseas then you probably don't
use inches and use metric instead but I
prefer to work in pixels just because
you know I design things for websites
Allah
and whenever I talk in Photoshop I don't
I'm not like okay move this make a box
that's two inches wide people usually
say make a box sets you know 150 pixels
wide so that's why I prefer to work in
pixels as well but you can work into
whatever matter preference now
resolution is where things get kind of
tricky because it really depends on and
really all of these things right here
depend on what is your final image then
be used for if you're making the image
that you want to use on a website or the
web in general or or on your computer at
all it needs to be 72 pixels per inch
again it doesn't need to be but that's
the best resolution to use um for the
web or for a computer if you're printing
for example if you want to make a flyer
for you know your gratzel or you know on
your new business and hang it up at the
grocery store then what you want to do
is you want to change this to 300 pixels
per inch so it really depends on your
printer but typically printers are 300
pixels per inch that's going to give you
the best quality and for the web as you
see if you ever choose default it puts
it at 72 because that's the best for
images that you just view on the
computer now if you use anything less
than 72 or less than 300 for printing
it's going to make the image look kind
of pixelated and bad quality and if
you're saying you know what I want this
image to be really good for the web so
I'm going to put this at you know 1000
pixels per inch that's going to look
crisp actually it's not going to look
crisp it's going to look worse and the
reason that you know they put 72 is
because that's the standard so don't
think that um you know putting like a
thousand pixels per inch is going to
give you a really high quality image
it's not going to make a difference it's
just going to use it's just going to
waste a bunch of memory on your computer
so remember the rule 72 for web 300 for
print now the color mode is another
weird thing you know how you know when
Apple and Microsoft were first making
their computers they couldn't make
anything compatible this is
another weird thing that the compute the
people who may like printers and
computers this add this to annoy us RGB
and CMYK are the two main color modes
you're going to use whenever you're
working with images on the computer use
RGB and typically printers prefer CMYK
so if you ever want to print something
on a piece of paper it's probably better
to use CMYK color but since I'm making
tutorials and using these pictures on
the web you typically want to stick with
RGB 90% of the time now the other color
modes I might as well go over those is
grayscale pretty much means um you know
if you're making a black-and-white photo
you want it all grayscale and the rest
of these lab color and bitmap lab stands
for luminosity a and B channels in
bitmap don't even worry about lab and
bitmap right now because that's more
advanced stuff the really only thing you
need to worry about in these tutorials
I'm going to be using RGB 100% of the
time and that's what people typically
use unless you're doing something really
weird so just remember that that's the
main one we'll talk about the more
advanced ones in the upcoming tutorials
now 8-bit don't really worry about that
right now if it's fine for what we're
going to be doing the background
contents are you can make it a color
which is you know of course green blue I
typically like to use white because
first of all even if you want your
background transparent like you're
making a logo that you're going to put
on a website and you don't want a
background that's white I like to make
the logo with a white background anyways
because it's easier to work with and
then later on when you're when you want
to save the final image you can take the
white away so I always choose white
right here and even if you want the
background to be transparent you don't
want to work with a transparent
background it looks weird in Photoshop
so you want to pretty much always stick
with white right here and I'll show you
how can you remove the background really
easy later on about two clicks of the
button now the other things I want to go
over is the Advanced section again this
is obviously advanced stuff so you might
as well just hide that because you don't
want to accidentally click anything
but the color profile don't even worry
about that right now whenever we talk
about color management I'll talk about
that in the pixel X aspect ratio this is
pretty much do you want your pixels to
be square or not square
pretty much 99.9 percent of the time you
want square pixels the only people who
ever don't want square pixels is if
you're working with a really um weird
video editing program some video things
or some graphics that you make for
videos like titles or I don't know maybe
just making a special effect on your
video they like pixels that are kind of
stretched out because you know how every
like TV screen in every video monitor
displays your image a little bit
differently but unless you really know
what you're working with with video
again 99% just leave this as square
pixels I never used anything but square
pixels so once you're done setting
everything then just go ahead and hit OK
and it creates a new blank document
where you can draw and add some text add
some images add whatever you want so
that's how you create a new document
again file new and then fill out
everything you need to and in the next
sort of what I'm going to do is well you
know what I'm not going to tell you guys
because it's going to be awesome don't
want to spoil it for you but again a lot
of these things you don't even want
touched you just want to choose default
Photoshop size and okay but if you want
to go you know change one thing specific
to how you want it that's how you do it
so thank you guys for watching don't
forget subscribe follow me on Twitter
Google+ and you know if you want to send
me like $1000 in the mail you can do
that too so uh thanks for watching again
and I'll see in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
