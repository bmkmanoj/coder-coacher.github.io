welcome to another app review for one of
my well not favorite games but it's a
game and it's called skeeball now what
this ski ball is is pretty much the same
skibo you played at arcade that actually
made it pretty similar to that so just
open it right here in case you can't
figure out how to play it just go ahead
and prick play right there and that'll
load and take it to the skee ball screen
and this light in my room is really
stinking I think it's about to blow so
if I start to catch on fire oh god it
stinks let's see if i can give you see
that light let's see if n oh never mind
just trust me anyways back to the game
before i suffocate um the point of the
game is to pretty much get the balls in
this little ring right here in the
different rings are different points in
order to fund them just put your finger
on the screen and you can fling them
upward like that so just drag them
upward just like this and aside from
just doing that you can also put your
thumb on the screen and flick it like
this let me see if I can get it again I
never do this alright I'm telling you
that is how you do it and you see I just
did it but it's really hard to do that
and it's like not accurate at all so why
would you ever do that I don't know
don't do it that's why I'm just saying
so again like I said anytime a cup is
highlighted let me see if I can get one
highlighted um see this cup is
highlighted right there this means that
if you get it in that cup it's bonus
points but that's one of the hardest
cups to get in so I'm not going to get
it there but I sure real try oh so close
you stumble oh and let me just throw my
last one and oh great the lowest thing
you can possibly get that's pretty good
so now that you're done you get rewarded
a certain amount of tickets I got eight
depending on how well you do that's not
very good but this is your total tickets
right here 51 and you can go ahead and
pick more if you want to do more or done
if you want to go back to the main
and the main screen gives you two other
options I didn't tell you about the
first of all redeem is to pretty much
cashing your tickets and get tons of
fabulous prizes and so remember we have
51 tickets total we won like eight that
game I think so what do we have to
choose from headphones not interested in
eraser maybe only have this cool glitter
bracelet but I already got one so what I
really want is this card right here see
this card is going to come in handy why
I have no idea but I'm going to buy this
and I'm also going to buy this rare
lollipop because it says rare and I
pretty much just buy anything that says
rare because I'm pretty easily
influenced so it doesn't achievement
unlocked you have a glow-in-the-dark
tongue see that's really what I'm going
for just kind of small little prizes
like that to boost my day so I'm going
to be happy for the rest of the day so
let's go ahead and click exit and now
your other option loot it's pretty much
all the prizes that you want so far so
if yours all my prizes that I've ever
won playing this and the only point of
this is pretty much to show it off to
your friends so let's see what I got I
got a custom old skeeball I got this
rare lollipop not bad um I got this card
I just spot on the sneezing Panda from
YouTube a half-eaten donut all right I
got it don't need to do that um let's
see I got this fabulous mustache right
here a banana and a glitter pencil so
you know I got a pretty good stash right
here I think we'll be good to go for a
while but yeah that's the basics of the
game i'm just going to exit that um it's
just a game pretty much to keep it busy
and the more you play the better you get
so i'm going to go ahead and rate this
game a sudden a 7 out of 10 because it's
pretty fun to play but you know there's
not really a whole lot to it's just
pretty much the same thing over and over
so for the price i think it's like 99
cents or 199 is definitely worth it to
buy so i highly recommend buying it and
getting it again don't forget to
subscribe and if you want me to review
any more apps than just a little
main comment here and let me know so for
now thank you guys for watching I'm
going to be playing this for about the
next three hours so thank you again and
I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
