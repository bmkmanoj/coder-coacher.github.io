intermediate Java tutorial and in this
tutorial I want to start talking about
networking and eventually I'm going to
be building applications that connect to
a server and utilize stream sockets and
going into some really complex
networking but for now since we're just
beginning networking and this is our
first video concerning that topic I'm
just going to build a very simple
application of Austin org it takes you
to that or you can pick another one and
it takes you to that so again this isn't
really in-depth networking but for just
the purposes of jumping into networking
and getting our feet wet I think this is
going to be a really good example just
to get you started so the very first
thing we need to do is we need to build
this web page right here before we
program any Java so again remember that
whenever you make a applet and make it
accessible to everyone on the internet
you basically build an HTML file in and
link it to your java class that's
essentially what you do so go ahead and
open notepad plus plus not Eclipse
although I think you could write in
Eclipse and let's go ahead and start
making this HTML file we won't write any
like standard XHTML just go ahead and
make very basic oh and by the way prepa
sure to mention this if you guys don't
know any HTML whatsoever um I have
videos on my website that you can learn
from but this is like the most basic
website you guys will ever see the only
thing it has is a body so let's go ahead
and add that
I won't even add a head and the applet
code so actually I want to save this
right now because the color of black and
white is just ticking me off so go ahead
and put file save as and I actually made
a folder on my desktop called test and
I'll just name this what can I name this
bucky HTML name it something that HTML
and you'll be good are a so anyways i
want to build my app little it or applet
code again ahead myself here now the
first thing you need to do is you need
to put your code parameter in of course
whenever we write this applet in java
what is the class going to be named so
i'll just name it
Bucky's sites class now of course we
didn't write this yet and we're probably
going to be doing it in the upcoming
sales but for now i just want to focus
on this main webpage so the other thing
you do is give your applet a width and
i'll just put it like 500 and the height
of 300 250 all right looks good enough
so now our applet tags are taken care of
now here is how we're going to set this
up you see that we have an applet
basically in we have two main websites
in the new boston org in my twitter you
actually can put as many websites as you
want in it but i just put two because
you know if we just have one then we
couldn't even have a selection it would
just be like you know what are you going
to choose this one or this one so you
know put at least two web sites in there
in the web sites themselves don't really
matter it's the code that is really
important so for hello capslock where
did you come from for the parameter
we're going to have four different
parameters which consists of two
different titles and two different URL
locations so the title for this one
would be the new boston org in the URL
would be the address which is HTTP you
know colon backslash backslash WW all
that good stuff so that's what the
parameters are going to consist of so
parameter one the name is title zero and
the value since this is the title we'll
just put the new boston dot org
all right now four should I do the other
title or the address I'll just do the
address actually I'm very lazy so let me
just go ahead and copy this now the name
for the second parameter is address zero
and the value for this is that there you
go the full URL which you would type
into your browser to take you to the new
Boston org simple enough so now let me
just go ahead and copy these two and
I'll set up the other website for
Twitter so of course instead of the name
being title zero the Twitter one has the
value of one so pretty much each website
has an identification number if you
wanted to put you know thirteen websites
on there on your thirteenth set of
parameters it would be title thirteen
address thirteen so on and so forth but
anyways the value for my twitter is just
something like Bucky's twitter and the
value for the address which is the URL
of twitter is HTTP actually I'm just
going to go to my Twitter because too
lazy to type all this just copy that and
paste that shiz or right in there so if
you guys can't see that a URL it doesn't
matter just go ahead and put in Google
or anything the key of this tutorial
isn't to get the same URLs as me it's
pretty much just to get the concept of
what we're doing and that is we're
setting up an HTML file and we're also
going to be building an applet which
pulls information from these parameters
and utilizes it to of course as you can
see make your browser go to these
websites so again we're not really
connecting to server through like any
complex way what we're doing is just
pulling information from an XHTML file
and tricking our browser to go to those
websites whenever we click on this list
right here so there you have it that's
what we have to look forward to now that
you've got now that you have your HTML
file set up we can now begin bill
the Java in the next video so think guys
for watching and we're going to
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
