your second networking sorry and this is
ro we're just going to be going over
some network terminology and some boring
stuff like that but I'll try to make it
a little interesting for you in the last
tutorial I told you guys that notes or
anything that were interconnected in the
network and one of the most common
things that is interconnected in the
network is something called a
workstation now you're going to be
hearing this term a lot workstation and
people like to use this to use this term
a lot when they're talking about
networking stuff and what a workstation
is just pretty much just a personal home
computer just like this it's nothing
fancy it's just a regular computer so
whenever you hear that term now you know
what they're talking about another term
that they're going to be thrown around a
lot is something called a client and a
host now in a network a client is any
part of the network that receives data
and the host is any part of the network
that gives the data out or where the
client accesses it accesses the data
from so for example in on this right
here say that this is the host right
here this means that this computer has
data on it and this is the client right
here so what the client would do is go
talk to the host and ask for information
and then the host would give the client
information so again the client gets the
data the host gives the data so just
pretty much like a client and a host a
client gets the stuff a host gives the
stuff another thing that you're going to
see a lot is something called a server
now what a server is is pretty much it
offers a lot of users different users
access to the same information
so for example if you have three
different workstations right here you
can have a server so that all of these
workstations can have access to this
data so all of these computers are right
here can all connect to the server and
get information from it and a website is
an example of something that would be on
a server a website would be storage
right here and all of these computers
can see all of the information on the
website so again this thing right here
is called a server and these are called
workstations so we can move on to the
next concept after that the next concept
is something called a network interface
card now again all these workstations
and servers clients host they're all
connected to the network and they all
need to be connected some way you just
don't take a wire in a screw to your
computer and you're connected to the
internet or something like that you need
a special card called a network
interface card and this is pretty much a
card that you install on your computer
that allows you to plug either at an
Ethernet or allows you to get Wireless
that you can connect to the network in
one of the most common NIC cards and IC
is either an Ethernet card that allows
you to connect to a cable modem such as
Roadrunner or something like that or a
telephone NIC card that allows you to
plug the telephone line into here and
also another common one is a wireless
card now all of these cards you can just
plug into a slot on your computer and
these will allow data from different
networks to show up on your computer so
again that's called a NIC card and the
NIC card allows you to connect to a
network you can't connect to a network
without a net card so again what we
learned today
workstations those are pretty much just
basic computers so if you
someone saying workstation you know what
they're talking about a client is
anything that gets that up a host is
anything that gives that a server is
pretty much anything that offers a lot
of users access to this information and
you need to connect through any of these
using a NIC card and that stands for
network interface card so again as
always just want to tell you guys if you
have any questions just go to my site
the new Boston comm and I'll answer any
of your questions there I never check my
YouTube account so if you are messaging
me asking me for questions then I'm
probably not going to answer it unless
you go to my forum sign up so thank you
guys for watching make sure to subscribe
to my channel and I will see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
