name is buddy Blackford and in After
Effects cs6 today we're gonna learn how
to blur out people's faces since they
didn't want to be in your video or you
don't want people to know who it is or
whatever else is going on so I'm gonna
show you how to do that and it's really
easy we're gonna use the mosaic effect
and adjust the settings in it a little
bit and it's gonna be awesome so I we
have this picture here and someone did
want to be in the photo and didn't sign
a nondisclosure agreement or you see
he's wearing like a beer shirt and we
need to get that out of there because he
didn't pay Coors Light to actually have
that t-shirt on or something like that
who knows another thing you can use it
for is if you're taking a video and
someone's license plate is in there and
you could get that license plate blurred
out of there so that's how we do that
but we're gonna go for the more
professional look instead of just trying
to blur it out we're gonna use the
mosaic effect so what we're doing here
is we're gonna have a picture or of some
video that we've got here if we've got
video then we need you're gonna need to
keyframe the mask that we're gonna make
and if we just have a picture I mean
unless the picture moves around then you
don't need the keyframe the mask
obviously so what we're gonna do is
create a new adjustment layer so let's
go to layer new adjustment layer and
what we're gonna do is create a mask on
the person that doesn't want to be seen
so in this case it's gonna be the fish
because he was too dumb and got caught
so that's all we got to do is just throw
that mask on there and I use this
ellipse tool here and I clicked on it
and I just dragged out a mask to what we
wanted here now we're gonna go over here
into our effects and presets section and
type in mosaic which is M which I
spelled it wrong mosa IC and let's drag
that onto our adjustment layer
and we've got to blurt out but the
original settings make it look stupid so
you kind of want to tell what it is a
little bit so if I had this over
someone's face it wouldn't be able to
tell it's a face so I mean you can't
tell that it's a fish face right there
you have no idea what's there so we're
gonna increase these horizontal and
vertical blocks to 75 or somewhere
around 75 oops I clicked off of it 75
and there now you can tell that it's
like still a fish that he's holding a
fish there but you can't tell that what
the actual what the face of it looks
like no sharp colors here you can put
that on or off if you want I mean
there's no big deal I mean honestly I
think sharp colors off looks better so
that's how you blur it out so we'll just
go do it again and since there is
already an adjustment layer on here with
a mask with the mosaic on here all we
need to do is just create another mask
and it auto automatically mosaic out his
face now if you do if you think that's
too recognizable and people know who it
is just lower the amount of your blocks
here and it'll make it more distorted oh
man Ellis that looks creepy but there
now that's how you do that effect if you
ever need to like move around your lair
or these masks you just need to animate
the mask path here by clicking on the
stopwatch and just moving this around if
you click on mask path it'll select all
the points and that way you can go ahead
and time and just move all the points so
there you go that's how that works so
there's the quick tip for you and that's
the way to make the professional-looking
blurred
effect so thanks for watching this quick
tip and on the effect so thanks again
and I'll see you guys later goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
