tutorial and in this tutorial I'm gonna
be going over how to fix that problem we
had last time with our animation and
we're gonna be able to control the speed
based on time and if you're wondering
alright why would we want to do this
instead of just doing it like we did
before well before we had an animation
based on how fast this loop could
execute so if you had to move one pixel
every time the loop executes it would be
faster on computers with a faster
processor and slower on computers with a
slower processor and when you're
building a game you don't really want it
fast around some computers and slower on
others especially if you're gonna have
like high scores and stuff like that so
to do this we need three variables we
need the x-coordinate let's just a set
it to zero to begin to same as last
tutorial the next thing that we need is
a clock object now in pygame there's a
built-in function called a clock and
this is pretty much the clock on your
computer and this is so you can work
with time so pygame in the time library
or module and then go ahead and click a
clock and after this what you want to do
is set a speed for your animation and
I'm gonna set it equal to 250 pixels
every second and once I use these
tutorial I mean not tutorials once I use
these variables you'll understand what
it does pretty much so after you got
your three variables let me move that
down so you can see them um
and after you've lit your ball here's
what you need to do the first thing that
we need to do is calculate millisecond
so mi ll I equals clock tick now why is
this important you ask well I'll answer
that for you whenever you use clock tick
it calculates one tick equals one
millisecond so unlike how fast your loop
executes a millisecond is the same on
fast computer as a slow computer
whatever this isn't based on how fast
your computer is this is BAE
on actual time so now we get a constant
across all computers a millisecond is
the same amount of time no matter who
you talk to
so once we have a millisecond figure it
out we usually want to convert it to
seconds so go ahead write seconds and
set it equal to milli divided by a
thousand and after you write a thousand
go ahead and write dot zero or you can
just write dot and if you worked with
Python and you follow my tutorials then
you know that whenever you divide by
like a thousand this is gonna give you a
whole number and you don't want this you
want the detailed fractions of a number
so whenever you divide by a floating
point integer you get a detailed decimal
point answer and this is gonna give you
point zero zero one seconds so right now
we have the variable point zero zero one
stored in seconds and again this gives
you a constant instead of just how fast
this loop can execute so once we have a
point zero zero one seconds we want to
calculate the distance moved so let's go
ahead and click a DM and set it equal to
seconds
let's see Co nd s and we want to
multiply it by speed in a kin we are
made the speed in this story so when we
multiply point zero zero one seconds by
0.25 we get the distance moved
so now we can X plus equal DM which is
distance move and what this is gonna do
is move it a quarter pixel or 0.25
pixels every millisecond or 250 pixels
every single second so let me make sure
I got everything all right looks like
it's all good I can go ahead and run
this run module save it ok and now you
see we can control the speed of a ball
by changing that one speed variable so
now instead of having this ball speed
based on how fast your computer can
process it it's the same on every single
computer no matter
what so that is how you can work with
speed and when you include that in your
variable speed pretty much evens out all
computers incessant Mollet even level
and again this is what you want to go
for in the effect you want to achieve
most of the time so again one last time
we started the x-coordinate is 0 just
because it's a good place to start after
that we went and head and opened our
clock method because what this clock
object does is allows you to give a
constant across all computers next we
set a speed which is 250 which we were
going to use later we went ahead and
found a millisecond and then we
converted it to seconds and we went all
right the distance move is that seconds
times your speed and this gave you a
constant for all computers again can't
stress that enough
but hey I'm trying and then you want in
head and move that just like we did in
the last story so that is your basics of
how you can incorporate time to make
speed constant across all computers so I
hope you enjoyed this tutorial I hope
you understand that at least a little
bit so thank you guys for watching don't
forget to subscribe and I'll see you
