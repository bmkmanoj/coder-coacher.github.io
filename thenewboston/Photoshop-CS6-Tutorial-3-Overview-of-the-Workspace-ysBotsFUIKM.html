Photoshop cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and today
we're just going to start opening a
Photoshop and going over what is what
you see when you first open it so let's
open up Photoshop and there are two
different types of Photoshop
we've got Photoshop cs6 and that's a
32-bit version and Photoshop cs6 64-bit
version now if your computer is a 64-bit
operating system and has over four gigs
of RAM you're going to want to use the
64-bit version because it uses 10% more
it's ten percent more efficient over at
using like the memory storage and all
that stuff over the regular 32-bit now
sometimes you might get some plugins or
something like that for Photoshop that
may only work in the 32-bit version but
most of the time you're going to want to
use a 64-bit so just click on that and
open up and I already have Photoshop
open and when it opens up it'll just be
like this right here and there would be
nothing else except for these different
panels and I'm going to go over what the
panels are called and then we'll open up
a composition or new a new project so up
here in the top this is our just our
this is our like options up here we've
got our file edit image layer sorry for
going so fast the room but I'll go
through those later we don't have to
know everything in those we've got our
options bar underneath and this displays
a options for the tool that you have
picked the tools are over here on the
left and if you click on one of the
tools the option bar is going to change
to use the tool they have selected the
different options for that tool so if I
click on some of these you'll see that
it shape it changes now our tools here
are what we use to work on a lot of our
unlike our images and
on our design projects and everything
over here we have our workspace menu
which is this drop-down up here in the
top right and it displays the different
options that you have so this one's the
painting menu and we'll go to essentials
I'm going to keep it on essentials you
can create your own menu are different
types of things based on what you use a
lot now right we have the the panels and
this gives you access to the different
Photoshop panels here and some of them
are tabbed we've got our layers panel
that you might be familiar with what
this is where all of our layers will be
and then we got our color and there's a
whole bunch of different panels that we
can add by coming up to the window and
then clicking on at least one of these
so I'll go to some like properties and a
and I'll show that for us up there down
here at the bottom
let me need to create I'm going to open
up something really quick let's go to
file and we'll go to new and this is how
you open up a new project and it brings
up this screen here where you can name
it and we'll just name this first and
there's different presets here for you
so us paper is just like the same as a
piece of like printing paper 8 by 8
point 5 by 11 inches and then we've got
film and video down here 720 by 480 and
then underneath our paper I mean
underneath our preset we have different
other types of presets so maybe we want
to do HDTV and then it'll change the
different pixel dimensions and
everything so you can go up into custom
down here at the bottom and enter your
own values if you would like
so that's a what we got going on there
we you can change your background to a
color white or transparent that's up to
you and then you got your color modes
here and then your your bit depth here
which I'll have to go over at another
point in time when it will make more
sense now I want to let you know that
you could also change that from the unit
of measurement that you're most
comfortable with so it's on pixels right
now but you can also do inches
centimeters so and then there's a whole
bunch of different other ones that you
can use also I'm most comfortable with
pixels because it just reminds me of
like a monitor size and then like a TV
size but sometimes if you're working on
like a you're making a flyer you'll want
to stick to like the u.s. paper one so
we'll just hit OK on that to just bring
up something and here we go we've got
something a canvas to actually work on
now now down here in the bottom left is
the zoom size and you can either type
type in how much you want to zoom in and
that will be a hundred percent so you
type it in and press ENTER and you'll be
able to zoom in I'm going to go back to
what it was so we can actually see so
this is that 25 percent now there is a
document window right here this have
right here and we can drag that move
move that back forth if I open up
another document we open up something I
already had made we can see that we can
switch in between these two documents by
clicking on these tabs that we can
reorder them and then to just get them
down you can go file close or you can
just click on this X here so I just
click on the X and
the other one went away now I just want
to show you one more thing before we
head out from this tutorial to save it
you click on file and then come down
here to save or save as and then you can
just save it wherever you would like the
hotkey for that is control s and that'll
save for you so thanks for watching this
part of the tutorial it was basically an
introduction onto a Photoshop has when
you first opening it up and I look
forward to seeing you guys on the next
tutorials where we're going to start
getting more into like panels and all
that stuff so I'll see you guys later
have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
