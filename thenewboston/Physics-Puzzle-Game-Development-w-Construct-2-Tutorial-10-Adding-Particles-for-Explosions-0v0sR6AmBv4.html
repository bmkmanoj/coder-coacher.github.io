sweet tutorial and in this video I want
to show you guys how to add particles to
your game and this is actually really
cool for things like explosions and when
things get destroyed it gives you guys a
nice cool effect so right now of course
whenever our ball gets destroyed it just
kind of disappears which is I'm kind of
stupid in my opinion so let's go ahead
and make it blow up so the first thing
we want to do is we need to insert a new
object into our layout so double-click
your layout and choose this right here
particles you choose insert now for just
right now we can just add it to anywhere
around the game and once we click we see
we get this weird little blue box in
this little um editor pops out basically
what we need to do is we need need to
first give it a base image basically
saying okay what do you want me to make
particles out of if you're gonna blow
something up what are the pieces of it
gonna be so since we're gonna make this
goal or excuse me this out was it called
the target ball the Bucky face whatever
let's go ahead and load that Bucky ball
in first and now we can just what we can
edit everything from here I guess so the
first thing I wanted to do actually
probably easier if I just do that so
close out of that and the first thing I
want to do is change the settings
because right now if we just play it it
looks kind of weird this is the default
settings it just is like that one thing
shakin around like it kind of looks like
a spray so the first thing I wanted to
do is set the spray cone so make sure
that you have that selected and under
the or as a spray cone right here under
the regular properties set this to 360
so now whenever you hit Enter
it doesn't just spray in that one
direction like you're spraying with a
Windex bottle it actually I'll show you
guys what these do one by one it
actually sprays in every direction kind
of more like an explosion now after this
what you can do is set the speed equal
to 100 actually not
b-day with 200 words right here speeder
and miser you got a 100 and what this is
gonna do is it's gonna make your
particles more random and this is good
because you don't want all of your
particles coming out at the exact same
velocity or it's gonna look kind of
weird so let's go ahead and change that
speed randomizer and the last thing I
want to do is this right now whenever
you play it okay so it kind of looks
like a constant stream of like not an
explosion just like a constant stream of
crap being sprayed at ya or something so
we want one blast one explosion so how
do we do that well if we go to type let
me try to find it type right here
continuous spray go to one shot and now
I never do that it's gonna just blow up
one time how awesome is that refresh so
that is pretty much exactly what we want
one big burst so now that we got our
explosion taken care of when you learn
how to make a cool explosion effect what
we need to do is add the logic to say
okay add this effect whenever the ball
or whenever we reach the goal the ball
is destroyed so head over to your event
sheet and the first thing you want to do
is you want to add another action for
the on collision with the ground because
we already got the two events that we
need these are the two events basically
whenever the balls are destroyed so add
action right here and the action of
course is going to be what we're gonna
do is actually spawn another object so
hit target ball spawn another object and
the object is oh let me do this first
this might be a little easier to see
take this particle effect and name it
explosion so basically now we can go
ahead and add another object target ball
spawn another object that explosion
right here
they kind of look the same before so
that's why I had to name it and of
course the layer that we want this to
appear on is one because that's where
all the cool stuff is an image point
zero pretty much means it originates for
the center just like before so basically
now when this ball collides with the
ground destroy the original ball make it
disappear and add your explosion and
also the same for this so target ball
spawned another object and the object
for this is also explosion on layer one
so now whenever we hit it with a
meatball or this collides with the
ground we can go ahead and make it
explode and we can get this out of the
way for right now we might have to edit
that later so it will we'll just keep it
off-screen so now let me go ahead and
just fire your meatball and that time
the meatball hit it and now let me go
ahead and have it hit the ground you
check it out so again it looks really
cool and actually what I would probably
do is I don't really like it that a
bunch of little balls so I would
probably um make this new explosion use
like a fire image or something like that
but that was pretty cool for now I just
want to teach you guys the basics of how
to add particles and also um you know
like how to add cool effects and spawn
another image or a particle effect right
from there whenever you're destroyed I'm
rambling on now so I'm gonna shut the
heck up and well I'll see you guys next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
