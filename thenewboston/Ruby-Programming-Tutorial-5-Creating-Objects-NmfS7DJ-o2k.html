tutorial and in this lesson I'm going to
show you guys how to create an object
from the class so remember in the last
lesson we created a class in animal
class now a class is pretty much a
blueprint for creating objects so
anytime we want to create an animal it
can have a name and age in a trait so
now let's go ahead and create an animal
object anytime we want to create a new
animal object we go ahead and we first
need to give it a name or a variable so
first animal and variables can have
underscores by the way obviously as you
can see equals animal dot new this is
how you create an animal object
basically we're saying ok we're going to
create an animal object named first
animal and it's going to be a new object
from the animal class now go ahead and
hit enter and this is just where it's
stored in memory
it looks more confusing you really never
need to memorize this address or
anything like that but that's what it
means that's where it's stored on your
memory on your computer so this will be
different on your screen than mine so
now that we gave a variable nickname
anytime we want to refer to this object
we refer to it as first underscore
animal then Ruby knows that we're
talking about this animal so remember I
wanted to have this variable first
animal animal I wanted this object to
represent the dog next door to me the
one named Floyd that barks all the time
and it keeps me up when I'm trying to
watch my dang Netflix movies so remember
every animal can have a name age entry
so let's go ahead and set his name right
here so first underscore animal dot name
now in order to access in objects
attributes and remember the attributes
of all objects are basically these
things a name age in the trait in order
to access those we need to go ahead and
write the object name which is first
animal dot attribute in this case dot
name
so now we're pretty much saying okay we
want to access this object's name and we
want to set it equal to armed you can
name yours anything you want I'm going
to name mine Floyd so now go ahead and
hit enter and now our object first
animals name is Floyd simple enough so
now what we want to do is we want to set
the first animals H basically Floyd's
age and a trait about Floyd
so first underscore animal dot age
equals how old is Floyd he's a really
old dog probably like 93 hit enter now
before I go on I want to mention this in
Ruby programming anytime you're working
with text like Floyd or maybe you want
to set the gender to male or female you
need to surround text in double
quotation marks and any time you want to
work with numbers you don't use
quotation marks so numbers don't get
surrounded and texts get surrounded with
quotes so for example whenever I want to
set the tray of this object
so first underscore animal um what is it
the trait and I'll just say that this
one is annoying that's why I surround it
in quotation marks because remember any
time we're going with text get
surrounded in quotation marks so go
ahead and hit enter and now it says okay
annoying this is pretty much just a
little prompt saying that you set it
correctly so now we have an object and
its name is Floyd it's ages ninety-three
and Floyd is annoying okay that's nice
but did it just you know give us our
little output and now it doesn't even
you know remember ever again well we
want to see if Ruby can remember our
object the attributes from our object so
let's go ahead and test it right now now
another command you know I told you guys
that there is a command called print
which printed text out on the screen
there's also a similar command called
puts now puts also prints text out on
the screen but it's different than print
for a couple different reasons I'll talk
about that later on but just remember
the command puts
print stuff out on the screen so what we
want to do is we want to print the name
of Floyd out on the screen so what we do
is in order to access that trait we
would go ahead and write the name of the
object which is first underscore animal
and in order to access the attribute the
name attribute separate it with a dot
and write name now
I can't even talk I got so many things
going through my brain
I'm so excited by this programming
language it's awesome but think about
what we're doing right here we want to
print out on the screen that's what puts
means the name of our first animal
that's what we're saying in this command
right there so go ahead and hit enter
and if all goes right it prints out
Floyd and we get note back which means
no errors pretty awesome so now let's go
ahead and print out another trait and
another shortcut that you guys might
want to take note of whenever you're
working in interactive Ruby if you go
ahead and hit the up arrow on your
keyboard it's going to go ahead and
circle through your commands so up up up
up up is just going to pretty much it's
going to act like memory and so for
example the last command I typed was
puts first animal name if I type up
that's the last command I type so for
example I want to print out the trait
now so instead of having the type all
that I just go ahead and type my last
command delete it and you'll see well
that's pretty obvious what's going on so
now go ahead and print the trait of the
first animal which is Floyd go ahead and
hit enter and check it out
annoying with no errors so that's pretty
much it it's pretty much think of this
right now is well I'm going to talk
about this in the next tutorial but that
is how you make a class and an object
and that is how you access the
attributes of an object so for now
that's all you guys get so thank you
guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe and if you want to you can go
ahead and save this program go ahead and
sell it to Microsoft for millions or
watch my next tutorial where I'm going
to be spicing this up a little bit so
for now thanks for watching now see you
