slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to
create a favourite viewer now this is
going to be spread out into a bunch of
different tutorials because this is a
fairly large application compared to
what we've made so far but compared to
all of the apps this is pretty light so
like the paint program that we created a
couple tutorials ago this comes directly
from beginning Microsoft Visual Basic
2008 by Theron Willis and Brian Newsome
now I don't take any credit for this all
the credit goes to them I'm just walking
you guys through the program and
teaching you what it does so you can
understand it so let's go ahead and
create a new project select a windows
forms application and call yours
favorites viewer now I'm just going to
add YouTube at the end of this because
I've already created a favorites viewer
and while we're waiting for that to load
I just want to apologize for any
background noise and there's nothing I
can really do about that so let's set
the file name instead of form or dot VB
we'll call it viewer VB so it's easier
to use and work with and form one is
kind of hard to know where it is and you
want to use names that are easy for you
to recognize and know what they are so
we'll set the title of it to my
favorites and we'll come up here and
we'll set the icon to that same star
icon that we used in our FTP download
now the reason we use it in the FTP
downloader is because we didn't have any
other icons we could use so we just use
one that we could find now this star is
actually made for favorites so we have
my favorites now let's come down here
and it will set the size of this so we
want to set it to 470 pixels by 300
pixels so now that we've done that let's
go ahead and we will set we will add a
list view control now don't get this
confused with a list box so here's our
list view and we need to anchor it to
the top the bottom the left and the
right so we will find anchor
and we'll just anchor it to all of those
okay let's see where were we so let's go
ahead and select our list view and let's
rename it so it's easier to use later on
so we'll call it list favorites and
we'll go ahead and press Enter now what
we need to do is we need to dock this to
the sides of the form so we'll go ahead
and just dock it to the top and we'll
drag it down to about right there that
looks good so let's come over here and
we'll add some columns to it so we will
set we will add one we'll set the name
of it to header name go ahead and click
OK and then we will set the text do name
so let's find the text here
and let's go ahead and add one more so
we'll set this one to header URL so this
is this is going to hold the URL of our
favorite so we'll set the text of this
to URL now let's set the width of each
of these so set the width of this one to
220 and we'll set the width of this one
to 220 so it's going to be cut in half
so go ahead and click OK and you can see
that it hasn't shown up yet so what we
need to do is we need to come down here
and set view to details and you can see
here that our columns will show up show
up where we have the name and the URL so
we can just make the URL a little bit
bigger okay so now let's set full row
select equal to true so what this means
is that let's find a here first full row
select is going to be equal to true so
if we select an item over here in name
it will also select the corresponding
item in URL so now let's come over here
to our toolbox and we will add a link
label so we'll set the name of this to
link URL so link URL and we will anchor
it to the bottom of the left and the
right now let's go ahead and hit enter
there and now we need to do is we need
to align the text to middle left so
we'll set the text line to middle left
okay so your program should look
something like this by now and if it
doesn't you may want to move back and
find out where you messed up and once
you've got this created go ahead and
move on to the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
