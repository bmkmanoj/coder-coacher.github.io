13th in the last part of our animation
tutorials for now and in the store we're
going to be finishing up this Bucky
class and finally finally running our
animation that we have been working so
hard for so let's just make one more
method the draw method that's going to
be the easiest method ever make it
public void
just name it draw we have to since we
named this drop here and of course it's
going to take that G graphics parameter
so graphics G and in your body go ahead
and we need to draw the background in
whatever the image is so put g dot draw
image and yep it's going to give me like
8000 parameters i had a feeling that
would happen drop in and of course the
image you want to draw the background at
0 0 since you're on up here in the top
left and just put a null don't need to
worry about that and now what it's going
to draw is g draw image get go million
parameters and then go ahead and type in
for your first one you want on you want
to draw this image depending on what the
image is either me with my eyes closed
or open and we don't know we're going to
let our program decide that so what we
do is we made a method in our animation
if you can remember called get image
that's why we made that and we want it
to draw a bow would start at 0 0 to make
it easier and for your image observer
just but no and if you remember in
alright this a get image see if i can
find it right here it gets the current
image so depending on whether it needs
me with my eyes closed or eyes open
that's what when it gets so now when you
draw image you don't have to write code
in here all you have to write is that
one method and it gets the image to draw
and draws it out so that is actually all
we need to do for this tutorial all the
coding the only thing i'm going to do
now is test this baby out and i know you
guys can't see it
but let me tell you if it works yep what
I see is my background gradient and me
with my eyes ov eyes closed eyes open
eyes closed eyes open eyes closed eyes
open and it does that for five seconds
so that's why your spleen screen turn
black for five seconds and here's a
little visual representation of what I'm
actually seeing so it starts out me and
I would have a background of course a
set for my tea and it pretty much looks
like this
eyes closed eyes open eyes closed eyes
open eyes closed eyes open and I took
these screenshots before so you know
that's why that's why I'm able to do
this but I know you guys can't see I
want to show you in this tutorial
whenever we do the animations kind of
sucks but hey with my screen recorder
software you got to deal with it I guess
I'm trying so that is how you pretty
much animate cartoon style or still
static animation whatever you want to
call it in Java um there's also
animation where you have like a face
like this and instead of just changing
the image itself it would like move
around the screen and that's what
animation we're going to be learning
later on and both of these are very
necessary to Java and everyone and
alright do you ever use a style of
animation heck yeah like in Super Mario
Brothers where it's like the same image
but he has like his arms up and down
when he's running what they did is they
just took one image and they changed his
arms and legs to gave his the appearance
of him running so if we ever wanted to
do something like that like make a
cartoon character run this is the kind
of animation we would use we would
change the picture itself and also
change the location and that would give
the appearance of him running so you
know it's really useful so I always
suggest watching all these stories again
until you fully understand and got a
good grasp and then you're ready to move
on the next series or next tutorial in
my game programming but thank you guys
for watching right now I can't wait to
get more in depth and start creating
some awesome stuff don't forget
subscribe and I'll see you next door</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
