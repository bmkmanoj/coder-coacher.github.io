your 30 second JavaScript tutorial and
in this tutorial I'm going to be talking
about the last array methods now there
are a couple more that I didn't cover
but these are the most basic ones most
well-known and also the ones that are
going to be working with the most often
so if you want to learn all of them then
I don't know go on like your website for
JavaScript arrays or something but for
now I think this is all I need to cover
so in this story I'm going to be
teaching you about the reverse push and
sort methods so before we get into that
we actually need an array and I'm going
to make an array of body parts so I'm
just going to name it BP because you
know way too lazy to type out body parts
so let's go ahead and put like head
shoulders knees and can you guess toes
head shoulders knees and toes knees and
toes
anyways so the first thing I'm going to
be teaching about is called the reverse
method and what this does is you take
your array in your reverse it doesn't
take any parameters because you're just
reversing it so now our BP array is toes
knees shoulders and head as opposed to
head Scholz
head shoulders knees and toes so I'm not
going to print it out because trust me
it reversed it just to leave me so aside
from that the next method I want to show
you guys is something called the push
method now the push method is kind of
the opposite as pot of pop you know how
pop took the last element and removed it
from the end of your array what the push
method does is it adds element onto the
end of your array so you can either add
one element or multiple elements so for
example if you wanted to add one element
on the end of your a you would push one
element on like Tong and this would add
Tong to the end of your a if you wanted
to add another one you can either call
this method again or you can just
separate it with a parameter and add
another body part to the end of your
so what this would do is add these
elements onto the end of your rate
simple enough so the last method I want
to talk to you guys about that I'm going
to introduce is called the sort method
and all this does is it takes all your
elements in your rate and it sorts them
in alphabetical order so no matter if
you reverse them push them out or what
you did before this is now going to take
all these elements and sort them out in
alphabetical order and replace them in
your array so what I'm going to do now
is I'm going to print this out on the
screen and by the time I'm doing this
and by the time I'm done writing this
code I want you guys to see if you can
type all these in alphabetical order so
let me see if I can code this or you can
type it faster so ready set go
string 1 equals VP join crap crap I'm
getting too nervous
VP join document right Wow if you guys
don't win then that is embarrassing
document right string 1 now let me go
ahead save refresh and bam so I'm
guessing that since I was incredibly
slow I think I took like 20 seconds that
is what you guys should have guessed so
if you can sort this manually faster
than I can then that's missing if I
didn't have like 8,000 typos then you
know maybe I'd stand a chance but
anyways now that I just raised the guys
let me explain what I just did
why did is I joined them and remember
what this method does it takes your a
and it converts it to a string separated
by a comma and it's stored that in the
variable string 1 and then all I did is
I wrote string 1 on the screen so that's
how I got this so basically we reversed
it we pushed two elements on and then it
sorted it so basically reverse and it
did nothing but anyways we did it
anyways so we basically added two
elements into this array and we sorted
it alphabetically and as you can see now
this arrays in alphabetical order
H
k L s TT so that's alphabetical order
there you go so that's all I have for
you guys for different array methods um
like I said there are more array methods
but I'm not going to be talking about
all of them with you guys
so that's all I have for you guys for
this story and next tutorial we're
probably going to be talking more about
arrays but I promise we're done with
array methods for now so thank you guys
for watching don't forget subscribe and
I'll see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
