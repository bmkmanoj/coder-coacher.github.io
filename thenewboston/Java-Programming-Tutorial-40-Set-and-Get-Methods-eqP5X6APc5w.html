tutorial and in this tutorial we're
going to be building the set our set
minute and set seconds methods now we
already got the data from the data that
we need in the last story so hopefully
you watch that because you need this
code anyways but if you did and typed
everything up then that's good you're
good to go
so let's go ahead and build first the
set our function or excuse me method the
same thing as function pretty much I
just spent on around C++ all day so
anyways public void since it doesn't
return anything and sets our and what
arguments is take in H it takes just the
hour since again we're only setting an
hour nothing else now in this what we
want to do is check if the data is
between 0 and 24 and if it is it's valid
if not we're just going to set it to
default like zero or something and by or
something I mean 0 so let's take that
hour and first let's make a simple if
statement is the hour greater or equal
to 0 and where's my add 7 right there
again I put stickers on my keyboard so
it's kind of annoying and is the hour
less than 24 you're going to say all
right if that is true then you can go
ahead and use the hour else if it's not
true go ahead and put 0 so again this is
a conditional expression or um it's
pretty much the same as an if statement
what this is going to do is check if the
Hauer is between 0 and pretty much make
sure that hours greater than 0 and less
than 24 and if it is use it if not use 0
so now do the same thing for minute and
second except when we use this um we
want to change our minutes and seconds
and we also want to change this minutes
and seconds
and we also want to change this minutes
and don't use a capital and second and
also on changes minutes minutes second
second and instead of having let me
check the sub data real quick in minute
minute minimum in it instead of having
24 you want to change these to 60 since
with minutes and seconds it doesn't need
to be between 0 to 24 it needs to be
between 0 and 60 so that's why we do
that so now that we've got our hour
minute and second built what's this a
right here to get methods second hour
and type 2 that's good we're good to go
hour minute second what we need to do
this is what Oh saner here sets minutes
and set second so then now that we got
our check for hours our check for minute
and check for second what we can do now
is write get methods just to get them
since we write a set method to change
data if need be if it's bad and we need
a get method to pretty much when we're
retrieving our data um this is what we
need this method for so let's go ahead
and write public int and the first one
we want is get our so get our and this
is going to take no parameters and what
it's going to do is this is the easiest
thing you'll do all day get returned
hour right there
so what this is going to do is pretty
much take this and return it so let's
copy this and keep up with me it cuz
it's going to be a little too easy
get minutes and this one's going to
return a minute and get second and this
is going to return a second so now that
we have three set statements in three
get methods I mean set methods get
methods we need one more method and I
pray
this is the last one the last method
that we need is pretty much just a
formatting method and this pretty much
just spits it all out or display method
so like last time I'm going to put
public string since this is going to
return a string and after string I'm
just going to name it output like two
two military times it'll do military
time military time is a lot easier than
normal time and this isn't going to take
any parameter since you're just going to
return string so what we want to return
is let's go ahead org string format and
again it tells us we need two arguments
in the first argument is let me get rid
of this as annoys me the first argument
is how we want to format so we want to
format percent zero to D percent zero to
D :
percent zero to D so percent zero to D
percent is your T % zero to D and this
means the hour the minute in the second
is each going to have two decimal places
so for the first one for the hour it
says what number do you want to use well
we want to use whatever number was
returned in our get our method right
there for our second one for our minutes
we want to use whatever was returned and
our get minute method right there
and for our last one of course get
second right there so now these
functions let me double check this make
sure it's good these functions are good
to go
we built all the methods that we need
and again whenever I say functions I
really mean methods I'm just uh just
another language those methods are all
we need so now we can go in our main
apples class right here and we can begin
building our objects now again whenever
we're going to go ahead and create four
different objects because we had four
different constructors and actually I'm
going to be doing that in the next
tutorial so as you can see we have one
constructor two one two three four so in
the next tutorial I'm going to be
putting four different objects each to
use these constructors in four different
ways
and then I'm going to be summing up and
telling you how this whole program works
and actually what the heck we just did
and then you're going to understand that
awesomely so thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe and now see
you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
