first Android tutorial and what we're
going to do in this tutorial is
basically get an activity to be full
screen as you can see we here we have
our title bar and we have like kind of
this Android you know toolbar or
whatever this thing is we're just gonna
get rid of that and make this whole
activity fullscreen so basically we're
gonna do is we're going to go into our
main activity which was menu and always
to do is make a request and if Android
doesn't give it to us we're just gonna
beat them down we're just gonna chase
them down beat him with a baseball bat
all that good stuff you know it's gonna
be good clean fun but to do this what
we're gonna need to do is go into our on
create method or on create bracket here
that we set up and this is probably
still looking kind of confusing for you
guys for the whole you know ListView
maybe it's not maybe it's starting to
clear up a little bit we've done quite a
few tutorials but yeah we're gonna go
into this on create method and before we
actually set up are listed act adapter
we're gonna go we're gonna go right
below this super line here that's
referring the superclass and this is
where we're gonna make the request to
have fullscreen and then we're gonna see
like get the window and set the flags to
be fullscreen kind of confusing
terminology but just think of it as
we're requesting it from you know the
operating system and making it happen so
first thing we need to do is say request
window feature and then we hit within
parentheses we refer to the window class
so we say window dot and we do the
feature no title because we don't want a
title right that's what we're gonna
request and injured spry and allow it to
happen so we want the beat them down
there and then the only other line of
code that we need to write is we
basically need to set the height and how
to do that is we're gonna again say get
role I guess it's not again but we're
just gonna
they get window I can spell always a
challenge get window and that's a method
then we hit dot and we're gonna say set
flags so let's scroll down kind of read
you the definition maybe it's one I like
set flags it takes an int flags and also
a mask so let's see what the flags is
and what the mask is so as a new window
flag well we're gonna have to refer to
something else nevermind but the mask is
which of the window flag bits to modify
yeah Hooked on Phonics works for me
sorry it's kind of trying to read two
different things at once but there we go
so basically it doesn't really make
sense to you guys sorry for even trying
to read that there and now what we're
gonna do is we're basically set up both
of these the the flags and the masks to
be fullscreen for the most part we do
that through the window manager which
again is a class manager dot layout
parameters or layout params because you
know Android use slang like that and
they're just so cool so then we hit dot
and flag fullscreen flag underscore
fullscreen and there we go and basically
this is gonna be the same for the mask
as well so we're just going to copy and
paste right here and then end our or
statement with a semicolon and I'm just
gonna hit return so you can see it one
screen here right after that first comma
so this is our flags and this is our
mask just so you guys can kind of see
everything all together here and there
we go I mean that's basically gonna get
rid of the title and set it to be
fullscreen and again you guys want to do
that before your set list adapter or be
for your set content view because this
is going to kind of set up what is
available for you know your set content
view basically telling it what it has to
work with it's going to scale all of our
XML files to fit the screen that is
available so you want to do it before
that and again you know it's kind of
confusing or not confusing but it's kind
of hard to remember all these things so
building this application you can always
refer back and you're like okay this
activity has full screen so where is
that so we're just going to leave a
little comment here that says full
screen and then you guys can kind of
refer back and you're like oh that's how
to do full screen I'm just going to copy
and paste this for my my activity that
I'm actually building and you know there
we go we're pretty much done let's check
it make sure there's no airs that that
we're aware of known for those airs
sometimes so and there we go I mean it's
gone
no title no you know extra space up
there everything's working properly so
we are good to go guys
and I'll catch you guys in the next
tutorial no that's kind of a quick one
but it's also very useful when you're
trying to get rid of all that extra junk
so I'll see you guys then have a good
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
