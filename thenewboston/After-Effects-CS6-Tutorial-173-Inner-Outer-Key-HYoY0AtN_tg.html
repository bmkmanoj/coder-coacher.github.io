Blackford here with another After
Effects cs6 tutorial and today I'm going
to teach you about another King method
called inner outer key and that's in
After Effects native and it's a way to
use masks while you're King and use
those masks as guides for the keyer to
figure out what's going on and what to
take
now this keyer is pretty different from
the key the other keys that we've been
using so far in the fact that we don't
pick a screen color to clip out so what
it does is it you you create a mask
inside what you want to keep and then
you create a mask outside of it also and
it's supposed to calculate transparency
for the color and transition that
accordingly to make the object that you
masked out stand out on its own from the
background well I just wanted to let you
know that this footage hat just happened
to not be that great for this method and
you will find out that when you use
methods different methods of keying not
all of them work perfectly with what
you're using so that's why there's a
bunch of different keys and that's why
I'm showing you each type of keyer so
what I want to show you right now is
what I have created for my masks so I'm
going to turn this on and this is how
the effect is supposed to work you
create a mask and the yellow is going to
be inside if I looked really close in
here it's going to be inside the edge of
the line here and or it's inside the
edge of the of the object that we want
to keep and then we make a second mask
around the outside
of the what we want to keep to like get
to catch the background so it's gonna
calculate what's in between these two
lines
and then it's going to take what's out
of the background it's supposed to take
it out now I just like I said before it
didn't work awesome with this but it
this is the way that you're supposed to
use it and it'll work on other things
prop most likely so looks like I didn't
go fooling outside with this one oh no
that's just uh that's just how the
masses are affecting each other so that
was outside them right so what I did was
first I created the inside mask and I
messed out different parts with a four
to four different masks this big this
one first mask is just the large garbage
mask that I created before so I did the
inside of the masks and basically wrote
ode rotoscoped the whole entire gun and
hand and strap then what I did was i
duplicate clicked on all those layers of
a masks and I press ctrl D to duplicate
them and what I did was just grab the
points and pulled them out and change
the color of the mask you can change the
color of the masks by clicking on the
square down here and just changing the
color to whatever you we want it to be
so I mean this one is not blue because I
just changed it to Blues but whatever
you want the mass to be that's what it
that's the color that you can set it up
I choose two different contrasting
colors like pink and yellow when I was
working in the professional studios and
stuff like that where I had to if I had
the rotoscope I would always use bright
pink because it's easy to see and
doesn't blend in with a lot of different
colors so that's I mean it's not too bad
to work with so let's
let's go here and I've got my two sets
of masks and we can set in our effect
here we go to effect King inner / outer
key and turn that on now we're going to
let's see we're going to take the masks
here so let me open that back up again
and bring up my masks mass two three
four and five all the yellow ones beside
the first one are going to be my
foreground - and then you gain
additional foreground here three there's
four and then see
and then we got to come down to this
background and change this to six seven
eight nine six
seven
the
and nine
now we can see what's going on here is
I've got some of the masks coming in
within inside the other mask now you can
see that this is creating some
artifacting and that it's glitch with in
After Effects that you can't do this so
if I go to my alpha and look our alpha
is all screwed up and just does whatever
it wants to do for no reason same here
where these two overlap also so what you
want to actually do is create just one
giant shape if you have footage that
moves around and you have to animate
it's not the easiest to try to animate
one giant shape so think of that when
you're trying to pull the inner and
outer Keys it's not the not the greatest
you can try to use a tracking to do that
if you know what tracking is and watch
I'll go over at another point in time
but that's how that works so we've got
the artifact in here but this is how
you're supposed to set up your different
your inner outer key and then you've
also got some more options down here at
the bottom we've got cleanup foreground
and cleanup background so you can input
the mask that you want to clean up and
change its written brush radius this one
right here or it's pressure you can see
that it just kind of like works like the
tolerance and stuff like that so I don't
really need to clean it up so it's it
known on that we've got our edge thin
and if you need to turn off the masks by
using this button here we've got our
edge thing where we can bring in some of
the edges
as you can see there and the artifacting
gets even worse the edge feather we
probably know what that is just feathers
out the edge and then edge threshold
which will also help eat in at the edges
and mess up more of our art affecting
obviously and then we have blend with
original which I'm not sure why you
would want that too much if you're
trying to key out something in vertex
traction just cuts it out so that's what
that's how you use the inner outer key
sorry about having the artifact in there
that could be distracting just remember
that you want to use one big shape
instead of using a bunch of shapes too
that overlap each other in here and
that's just a bug that After Effects has
so thanks for watching this tutorial and
I hope you guys can use inner outer key
maybe if you have something like a
hammer that is easy to mask out or
something easy like an orange I don't
know and you need to key that out then
that'll be more helpful to have this
inner outer key used for that and it
produces some good results actually so
go ahead and try and use it if you have
the time so thanks for watching
everybody see you guys in the next
tutorial thumbs up if you like the video
thumbs down if you really hated it and
this artifact it really bugged the
out of ya I know it did to me it was
pissing me off I couldn't figure out why
I was doing that it even does it in the
render so subscribe if you would like to
see more videos good luck in your
projects everyone have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
