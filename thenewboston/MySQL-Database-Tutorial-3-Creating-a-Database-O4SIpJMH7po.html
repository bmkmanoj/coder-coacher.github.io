third MySQL tutorial and before we
continue I want to mention this
whenever I start teaching guys about all
the different MySQL commands all the
different things that you can do to the
database I'm going to be starting
teaching you guys some very simple
commands now these commands may include
something like how to view your
information how to sort your information
in your database however before we use
those commands we obviously need some
information
we need some data so we can sort
something or view something obviously
now lucky for you guys I already made
all of the tables that you guys need to
follow along with these tutorials you
can download the files and use them
whenever you want for 100% free
now in order to use this information in
order to use this data you need to
create a database first because that's
where you're going to be putting the
data so in order to create a database
what you need to do is log in to your
account
and you can either hit this MySQL
database wizard or this MySQL database
icon I think this one is the easiest one
although some people may disagree with
me but if you want to follow along with
me click on this MySQL databases icon
and what you do is you create a database
by just naming it something I'm going to
scan a name on YouTube and hit create
database now you hit it and it says okay
created mysql database basically gives
you a confirmation if you don't see this
then you did something wrong so now we
have a database created we can begin
filling it with data however I want to
add a MySQL user to this database now I
don't know in the advanced tutorials if
we're going to need this user because
typically whenever you're writing a
website in PHP or something you need
this user but anyways I don't know if
we're going to need it now but in case
we need it later on I don't want to come
back to this section and do it all again
so might as well do it now so in order
to create a user just go ahead and give
them a name I'm going to name them Bucky
now you can write your own password but
what I like to do is I use the like to
use the password generator
gives you a weird password there's mine
and just go ahead and click I've copied
this in a safe place click use password
and then once you have a name and a
password go ahead and hit create user so
now we created a database and we created
a user now when do we need this user
well sometimes we need a user to access
the database which we'll see later on in
the more advanced tutorials but anyways
in order to add that user to the
database we pretty much want to give
that user access to use that database
you need to scroll down to the very
bottom section and choose your user and
choose your database and hit add now
whenever you're programming this is like
really advanced stuff that you guys
don't need to know now but you only want
to give your user specific privileges
only the privileges that they need
however for the sake of these tutorials
I'm just going to go ahead and give
Bucky all privileges give him access to
do anything he wants to the database so
now we go ahead and make changes and now
pretty much Bucky has access to do
anything to this database now that
really wasn't important for this
tutorial so let's go ahead and click
home the key thing that you need to make
sure is is that pretty much you have a
user and a database so now we have a
database oh that's pretty cool ok so how
do you see it does it have tables in it
already does it have information in it
well in order to see your database go
ahead and click this icon called
phpMyAdmin now whenever you click it it
says okay wait wait and now a tool
called PHP myadmin opens up now in this
tool is where we're going to be typing
all of our SQL commands this is where
we're going to be spending most of our
time now all of your databases are
listed on the left hand side now
obviously we just created this one
called Danielle underscore YouTube so
that's why that one's there you also may
have one called information schema or
however the heck you say it and some
other ones depending on if your teacher
made some dummy ones by anyways the one
you created to definitely be there now
in order to view any tables in it just
go ahead and click the name
your TED database and if you have any
tables already like for example
obviously we didn't create any tables
yet but if you do have a table like from
your work or if your teacher already
created some tables for you they're
going to be listed on the left-hand side
however well I'm going to be doing is
I'm going to be teaching you guys in the
next tutorial actually I think I have
time in this tutorial so that's what I'm
going to do now obviously we need some
data so in order to get some data to
following these stories go to my website
called T n B forum com it's my forum and
by the way if you guys have any
questions that you need answering just
go ahead and ask me I'm going to forum
and I'll answer for you there by anyway
scroll down to the section that says SQL
and databases make sure to ask your
questions there now at the very top
you're going to see a link that says
files from tutorials go ahead and click
that and whenever you do you're going to
be able to click on this MySQL files
zip folder now go ahead and click that
and you're going to start downloading
this MySQL files these are all of the
data files that you guys need so
whenever I'm working with a table and
one my tutorials and you guys like whoa
Bucky I don't have that table then just
go ahead and follow along download the
file this is where it is so in order to
pretty much abstract or excuse me
extract it just go ahead and double
click this and depending on whatever
program you have just go ahead and click
one click unzip and then it pretty much
extracts it to your downloads file
so remember downloads you're going to
have a folder called mysql' files and
then another one and then you're going
to have a table name followed by dot SQL
now remember in the very first tutorial
that I said that pretty much all of the
information is contained in tables you
may have a table that has all the user
information you may have a table with
all the product information you may have
a table with all the video information
I'm going to name each of these files
just the table name so you're saying
okay
I followed it along with the years
tutorial so far I downloaded this SQL
file which whatever you say has data in
it now how do I get it into my database
right here well in order to do that you
need again make sure you're in PHP
myadmin and make sure you're in the
database you're working in so make sure
you have the database selected in this
case it's Danielle underscore YouTube
now once you have the database that you
want to import your table into go ahead
and hit the button import this means
pretty much import outside data now my
data or your data as it is now it's in
that downloads file and if you click
MySQL files
it's the folder or excuse me it's the
file customers SQL so go ahead and
double click that and now it says ok it
verifies that excuse me I click
something wrong it verifies what file
you're trying to open or import and then
leave everything else at default now if
you accidentally click the button then
make sure pause the screen for a second
and make sure all of your you know
settings and check boxes are the same as
mine format SQL so on and so forth and
once you choose your file just go ahead
and hit go now check this out it says
import has been successfully finished 11
queries executed ok kind of confusing
more importantly is you now have all
that data I made for you guys on your
database how awesome is that for free
didn't have to pay for anything
so you're saying ok I don't believe you
well if you don't just go ahead and
click on this customers table over here
and now check it out if you scroll you
can now see that all of the information
that you guys want is right here and by
the way if you're saying ok I just
imported a table called customers what
the heck is this well this isn't any
real customers form any real company or
anything it's just a quick little sample
table I made up for teaching tutorials
basically it has an ID number a name and
these are just fake names except mine
that's real address city
stay in zip basically just a bunch of
fake data that we can play along with
and basically practice my SQL and SQL
queries on it so there you go there you
have it that is how you get free data
and by the way I know even though there
is one file in here for now
in the upcoming tutorials I'm going to
be making more tables and whenever I do
make another table then just go ahead
and download it again and it's going to
be there so I'm going to be updating
this as I'm teaching these tutorials so
if you ever say hey I didn't get that
table well just go ahead and download it
again
but anyways I'm rambling and I need to
drink a water or something so thank you
guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
