thirty fourth tutorial in PHP the game
we're making and in this tutorial I'm
gonna be showing you guys how to take
that temporary data from the temporary
table and insert it into the permanent
users table and also inserting the data
or setting data for a couple new tables
that we're gonna need so right here is
our temporary variables that was in the
temporary table and once they click that
confirmation code it took us right here
and the last thing we did is take out
the spaces in all the variables so users
couldn't use MySQL to hack into our
website so the next thing we want to do
is take all of these variables name the
email and the password that they entered
and we want to enter them into a
permanent users table so let's make a
comment insert into users table and to
do this we first need an SQL into MySQL
query so let's set variable and name it
let's let's name it
SQL two since we already have a SQL one
up there and go ahead and add quotation
marks in your semicolon at the end
that's what I usually then we want to
use MySQL to insert this into a MySQL
table so one put insert into users and
your table might not be named users but
my name is user so whatever your table
name is replace it where I put users set
username equal to the variable name and
what this is gonna do is take whatever
variable they entered right here it's
going to take all the spaces away and
it's going to put it into the MySQL
table table where it has the field
username and you're gonna want to do the
same thing for all of your fields in
each field is going to be separated with
a comma so set username equal to the
variable name
set email equal to the variable email
and you keep doing this in this until
you reach the end of wherever you are
trying to insert and once you reach the
end of it you just want to go to the
next line I'm not going to show you guys
all of this but you pretty much have a
user name email password if I write
password it's gonna be off the screen so
and once you're done with all of that
you need to make a result variable now
the point of on a result variable is
just so you can do my SQL underscore
query and this says what action do you
want to perform and we want to perform
SQL two in this pretty much this says
what the action is and this says RA do
the action the next thing that we're
going to want to do in our game is I
don't know if I told you before but
you're going to have to make two other
tables one called game stats and one
called character stats the game stats
table is going to have all of their
stats for their game and their character
stats is going to have the statistics
and variables for the character so let
me show you guys how to make one of
these tables called let's go game stats
table now once you have this permanent
data you can do a bunch of different
things with it
the first thing I'm gonna want to do
there we go is take this information and
use it to create a table that's going to
store their stats for the entire game so
let's go ahead and make another action
called SQL three and I'm gonna put just
add those again I always do that put
insert
into the table you guys can name yours
whatever you want I named mine gamestats
set username equal to and you can just
set this equal to name since it's gonna
be the same and then um any stats that
you want say you have a field called job
or something see if your character has
job I'm gonna have their first job equal
to peasant
let's have or say you have one of their
stats called money to see how much money
they have in the game you can set the
original variable equal to 100 and what
this is gonna do every time they make a
new character it's gonna give them a
starting value so you you want them
start out with some money or maybe you
don't maybe you want to set this to zero
but you keep doing this since my game
has a user name has money it has an army
health you might want to set something
called energy to 100 and this is gonna
allow you to set the first variables for
each part of the game so again once you
have this permanent data right here this
is the point I'm trying to stress you
can make any amount of tables using this
data just make sure you have this right
here because without this MySQL is not
going to know where to look
then when you're done making all the
tables you need you have to make a
variable total result 3 equals my SQL
underscore query there we go finally my
and in your parameters have a SQL 3 so I
did this I had a terrible called game
stats which had a like health energy
stuff like that and I had another table
called character sets where it had like
the power the defense the speed of the
character so I'm actually just gonna
post this all on my
the New Boston comm so if you want to
check out my code in the tables that I
made you go to my site the New Boston
calm and I'm gonna have it all posted
there so instead of just showing you
guys me typing in the same thing over
and over it's just gonna be a lot easier
for you guys just to go grab my code
paste it in make the tables and there
you go and if you have any questions at
all or if you need any help
just uh post the thread on topic on the
New Boston calm and I will respond you
and I will help you there
so that is how you take the permanent
data from your users that you created
and make it into different tables that
you can be that can be used in the game
so study this tutorial go check out my
code at the New Boston comm thank you
guys for watching and I'll see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
