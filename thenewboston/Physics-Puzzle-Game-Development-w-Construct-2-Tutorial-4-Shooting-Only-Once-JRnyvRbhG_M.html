sweet video and in this tutorial what I
wanted to do is I want to show you guys
how to make this more like physics
puzzle game so what I mean is if you
ever played Angry Birds you know that
you just don't get unlimited shots at
the tower you only get one shot per turn
and right now we can click this a bunch
of time and we have like a semi
automatic meatball cannon so of course
we don't want to let the user like fire
800 meatballs at our Tower we only want
to allow them to shoot once per turn
it's a lot more fun that way so let's go
ahead and learn how to do that
right now move my microphone alright
there we go so in the event sheet what
you can do is right click and hit add
global variable now the name of this
I'll just name it - can fire basically
saying can the user fire a shot or not
now just set this a number this looks
good the initial value 0 looking good
okay so we now have a global variable
that we can control and add some
functionality to that later on so what
we want to do is we want to change this
variable whenever the user fires a
meatball and that's this event right now
this mouse on any click that means
whenever they clicked it a meatball has
been fired so what we want to do is add
another condition to this to make sure
pretty much to check this global
variable can fire right now
so hit C on your keyboard and it's going
to add another condition and for this
one it's going to be system compare
variable right here it's actually the
only one under global and local
variables and the variable should be
good to go can fire equal to 0 so right
now set done in by default remember you
want to set to say your default value
when our game first starts out this can
fire variable is equal to 0 and whenever
it's equal to 0 you are able or able to
fire a meatball
so after this happens what we want
do is we want to add another action so
set system and we want to set the value
of a global variable to one so basically
this is saying this whenever you're
playing the game make sure that your
global or excuse me your can fire
variable is equal to zero basically
whenever you first started and after
that fire the meatball and then set it
to one so basically you're saying I can
only arm fire a meatball one time so now
whenever you run this game let me fire
this and now I don't know if you guys
can hear me clicking but if fired once
and I was only allowed to fire one
meatball just like every other puzzle
game out there so that is how you do
that and another thing that you guys
probably notice is that whenever we
fired that I mean our tower is gonna be
way over here on the right-hand side so
right now we're just firing this and
it's going off screen and our cameras
not following it at all of course we
want to see it what happens whenever the
meatball hits the tower so let's have
the camera follow the meatball right now
and in order to do that we need to
select this meatball again and if you
add another behavior by hitting
behaviors then add if you scroll down
you can see this little where is it it's
a scroll to right here it's under
general scroll to in the description
always Center the view which is pretty
much the camera on this object and hit
add so now this meatball has physics and
scroll to basically saying a camera
follow me around or concentrate on this
point so add that right now and the
camera now follows the meatball and also
um earlier whenever I was talking about
parallax properties if your parallax
property for the game layer or if your
camera is going too slow then
Croesus if it's going too fast and it
shoots right by the meatball then lower
it but right now I think that's pretty
good 160 by 160 I'm gonna run that again
yeah that's pretty good camera right
there so the only other thing that I
want to do in this tutorial is this
check it out
whenever we shoot the meatball in the
air like that what I want to do is I
actually want to destroy the meatball
and this is you want to do this a lot
for memory purposes but basically
whenever this meatball goes outside this
layer then destroy it so we want to add
one more behavior and this one is
destroy and I cannot find it either did
it destroy it how can I find there's
like five buttons here all right so Anna
Mike Lee destroy the object if it leaves
the layout area so add this and another
cool thing that this does as well is say
that we have a tower in its built and
it's only like not that tall whenever
our meatball meatball goes like that and
it goes off the screen the memory
doesn't keep tracking it when it rolls
off so whenever it goes too far it
automatically gets destroyed and we can
just say okay let's just use a new turn
or in the game or whatever logic we want
to add to the game but right now that
helped us out with some memory our
meatball is now firing our cameras
following it and the only other thing
well we have to do a bunch of stuff in
the rest of the Saros but for now then
guys for watching and I'll see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
