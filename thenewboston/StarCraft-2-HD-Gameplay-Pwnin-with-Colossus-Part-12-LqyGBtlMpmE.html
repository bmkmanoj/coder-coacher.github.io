course and like I said a welcome to my
very first starcraft 2 gameplay video
and if you guys think that this is going
to be the most impressive gameplay video
you have ever seen you are wrong I've
only been playing starcraft 2 for like
two months I'm not that great but a
bunch of you guys were requesting to see
my gameplay and just to see me play
starcraft 2 at least one time so here's
a nice video for you guys so on my team
I'm going to playing with Dom flying
panda who's going to be playing zerg and
on my ramp right here we're going to be
playing with gesture who's going to be
playing terran and of course the
greatest player of all time right here
there's me the New Boston I'm going to
be green throwing up a quick pylon and
getting all those probes out trying to
get resources early so I can tech up and
let's take a look at our enemies right
here s gonzo who is going to be look
like he's going to wall off early and
there's my trademark oh my god WTF BBQ
that I say before every match I don't
know why there's really no reason for it
and after that you see pretty much the
whole entire map gets involved talking
about barbecue for about a minute by
anyways back to the game looks like both
of our enemies are going to be walling
off with some barracks and supply depots
in this Protoss up here is thrown up to
really quick gateways which is one of
the worst strategies I have ever seen he
really should be concentrating on his
probes but anyways that might bite him
in the butt later on so here's Dom
throwing up a quick Forge he might be
going for a cannon rush or he might just
be using net throw some early cannons
for a defense against any Marines that
might be heading his way there are three
things that have known donk to do a he
can rushes lot be he gets dark templars
and tries going for early kills before
they can get any detectors and see he
builds massive void rays law so we'll
keep an eye on Dom see what he's doing
this match but anyways looks like they
are going to
successfully a wall off both of their
bases and I have my first gateway being
built and also my to assimilate errs I
like to pretty much q of my nexus with a
bunch of probes and take care of my pros
first and once I have a nice resource
collection right that's when I like to
throw my sim layers I probably get my
simulators earlier than most people but
I do that for a couple reasons one I
hardly ever built any zealots I usually
just go straight two stalkers so that's
why I really have to concentrate on
getting gas early and too because I tech
up faster than a lot of people instead
of building first Tyrion so that's why I
need gas as well but anyways we'll see
how that works out so yes it does indeed
look like Dom's can use those cannons to
protect his own base very smart move
since they did wall off and they do look
like they're going to have some early
marine so it also looks like Dom is
going to leave a little space there
between his cannons and gateway so if
any Marines do decide to try and rush
them they aren't going to see a wall
that they can't get through turn around
and run away to me they're actually
probably going to try to run through
those cannons be picked off so that's a
strategy he uses a lot is a very good
one instead of just deterring the
Marines he kind of baits them in as he
picks them off with the cannon so here's
my teammate as he promised that deciding
not to wall off her base and said he's
going to throw up a bunch of barracks
close to his command center and pump out
some early Marines so I mean it looks
like those Marines are going to be
protecting our base own unless they make
a huge push we should be good so here is
flying panda as promised that early
zergling rush and he should be pushing
out soon because we have some marines
coming our way there might be a early
confrontation here so here are those
Marines they see those cannons right
there and here is the conversation wait
a minute looks like those earrings are
going straight for their base and those
Marines are going to stick make it early
dom space and that's what i was talking
about right here look at those cannons
just slaughter those Marines right there
and yeah they are rough shape they had
about six Marines now they have to
actually one and a half looks like this
probes going to have to take business
into his own hands and now looks like
Dom's going to mass production and here
comes Earl is just about the destroy all
these Marines right here look at all
this blood oh that is just amazing so
now it's going to try to pick off that
pylon try to slow down their supply in
you see a bunch of stalkers being pushed
in so those zerglings are also probably
going to kill all of those stalkers
although sluggers are probably the best
thing that you can use for early
zergling rush so let's go ahead and oh
my god just look at this those zerglings
are just eating those probes those
probes they not stand a chance so there
goes his entire workforce maybe he
shouldn't spend so much time go stupid
gateways and buildings of those more
horses
his teammates are gonna have to come
totally rebuild his entire economy so
looks like my teammate gesture had to go
in and save Dom so uh looks like we are
in pretty good shape right now and here
is me sending my first group of stalker
is probably the worst thing I could
possibly do I have no idea why did this
um I really don't have a good reason but
these stalkers then i'm sending in are
just going to get suicided right now i
don't know if i was trying to distract
in them or just pick up these early
marines for you know i didn't want to
rush or something but not a good
strategy on my behalf but i promise this
game gets better so as you can see
they're just continuing the pump album
acid bearings and they're probably just
kind of sit on the higher ground and
pick off my stalkers while my teammate
let's see what's he's doing he's just
walking around with his bunch of marines
and marauders and looks like Dom has
some void rays in the oven right there
can we pumping out some void array soon
and there's those Marauders and marine
just patrolling around just uh you know
minding their own business by anyways it
looks like our opponents have a bunch of
stalkers the bone up which is good for
me because I am taking up two immortals
and as you know immortals pone stalker
so if it's his stalkers against my
morals I'm going to win nine times out
of ten so this is looking up very good
for me but we're actually running out of
time in this video I didn't want to put
it in a one long video so the massive
battles are going to be coming in the
next video for the next two videos I
haven't decided yet however many it
takes but yeah it looks like both teams
are just working on their armies right
now huge battles are sure to ensue soon
so things are looking good for us so
there's another zergling rush coming but
as you see that's the end this video but
thank you guys for watching don't forget
to subscribe and yeah don't forget to
check out the next video it's going to
be pretty effin sweet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
