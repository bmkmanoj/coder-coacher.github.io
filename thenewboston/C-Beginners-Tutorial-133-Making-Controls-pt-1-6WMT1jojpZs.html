thirty-third c-sharp tutorial that I'm
making for New Boston and in this
tutorial I'm going to be showing you
basically how to create your own control
and first control that we're going to be
treating is just a simple body so in
order to create your own control just go
up to project and then add windows form
then go down and please see user control
and just select that then just rename
user control to anything you want I'm
just going to call it my botany because
the first thing like I said that we're
going to be creating is just a button
and then just go ahead and click Add and
basically what this is right here this
is just another design window where you
can design your control so what we're
going to be doing is painting it
ourselves using sea shark so that no
matter what side the user makes the
control it still looks proportional and
also basically what this is right here
it's the size of the control or the size
of your control will be when a user
dragged the under their form so if they
were to go over to the toolbox and then
like drag your control onto their form
then it would be this big when they do
that and that's just too big we're gonna
make it about that size
cuz that's about the size of a button
alright so in order to draw it we're
just gonna want to right click on here
and click view code and this is all the
code for our button and as you can see
it inherits from the user control class
and in the user control class there are
a lot of useful methods like drawing the
control and like setting acute
properties and stuff like that but we're
going to want to override the method do
draw it so that we can draw it ourselves
and have whatever colors or anything we
want on it so we're going to type out
your override and then on paint the
method that we'll be overriding
and then in your intellisense right
there it says on paint and then you can
just click enter and it'll type
everything out for you and as you can
see it's protected meaning that on only
people and hairatan it will be able to
see it and obviously in the same class
alright so what we're going to want to
do here is just create a new
and brush to draw so say solid rock s
because I'm new to solid rock and the
color that we're going to be using is
we're gonna be using it from a known
color so we're going to say color from
known color and then known color dot
control and control is just basically
the default color for a control and
that's basically that color it's like
the color of a button so control and you
can obviously have be anything to color
like if you want to make it be red or
something like that but I'm just gonna
make it this color for right now and now
we're gonna have to create graphics so
we're gonna say graphics G equals best
creative graphics and this basically
just refers to our control or our class
we're in right now so my button and now
we have our graphics created we can draw
a rectangle on our button right here or
on our control so we're just gonna stay
G dot fill rectangle brush two are
obviously going to be using in our own
so solid brush and the position that
we're going to want to start at is zero
zero so that it fills the entire
controller and then on the width that we
want it to be is size of the control
that it is so we're just going to do
this dot width so it'll always fill the
control no matter what size you have it
and same thing for height went through
this stop height alright so now we can
go back to our form right here and in
order to drag our control on here we're
just have to do it for build and then as
you can see our button appears right
there just drag it onto our form and
since the back color of form one is
control they just pull under it together
so we're going to change the back color
of our form to something different so we
can actually see our button like black
but yeah there is our button right there
and now any debug see we have a button
but since we haven't done anything with
it yet it just looks like it's a panel
or something
but in the next tutorial we're going to
be setting up with text on it and making
our button look more like a fog so
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
