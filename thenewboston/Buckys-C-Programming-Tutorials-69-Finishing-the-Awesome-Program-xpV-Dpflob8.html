last tutorial number 68 and now you're
watching the 69 tutorial and in this
tutorial we're going to be finishing up
the program that well I don't know if
we're going to be finishing it but we're
going to be continuing the program that
we started in the last oriole so in the
last tutorial what we did is we
basically built the main functionality
for our program the only thing that we
didn't do is handle the other items
except for four so I already told you
guys that what this loop does is it
tests this variable what they want and
if it's equal to one it should print out
the plain items if it's equal to two it
should print out the helpful items if
they enter to the number three then they
should print out the items that are
harmful to the character so what we want
to do is we want to test this what they
want variable for one two or three now
what we can do is make a bunch of
different if statements but remember I
told you guys
whenever you're testing a single
variable for multiple values it's better
to use a switch statement now a switch
statement takes one parameter the
variable what they want and it tests it
a bunch of against a bunch of different
cases so let's go ahead and finish this
by we need the curly braces right here
and inside the curly braces of the
switch statement we write all those
different cases so we go ahead and we
first write in the case of one what do
we want to do and we're going to be
wanting to display these items and we
can write all the code right here but
since we're going to be displaying the
items multiple times it's better to
build a function later on so let's go
ahead and just again I didn't build this
function yet we're going to be building
it later on but let's go ahead and build
a function called display items and
whenever we enter one we're going to
pass in the parameter one now display
items like I said is going to be a
function that takes one parameter
depending on what parameter it takes it
knows what items the print out so
whenever we display items with the
parameter one it's going to print out
the plain items so of course remember we
add break after every case so it doesn't
go to the rest of the cases and let me
just go ahead and copy this two more
times
so in the case of two and in the case of
three so if what they want is equal to
two then we want to display items with
the parameter two if they enter three
that means that they want to print out
the harmful items so we'll go ahead and
write a function display items that
takes the parameter three now check it
out this main function is done
completely we don't have to do anything
else to this main function the only
thing we have to do is build this
display items function
pretty cool huh so let me go ahead and
come down here and the first thing like
I said that I like to do whenever I'm
building a function is add a comment now
I'll just go ahead and put display items
function now this function it's only
going to print out stuff on the screen
that's his only job to display items so
let's go ahead and make a void as a
return type we're not getting any
information back it's just going to
print out something it's just going to
you know do the dirty work for us so
it's void we're not asking for anything
back in return we're just asking it to
do something so now let's go ahead and
write display items and of course
remember it needs to know what items you
want one two or three it basically needs
to know what choice did you enter one
two or three so we're going to be
passing it in an integer parameter just
like that now well the first thing I
want to do before I continue is go ahead
and prototype my function and remember
to prototype your function one last time
go ahead and copy the header and paste
it right above your main and the reason
we prototype functions one more time is
because whenever we come across it right
here in our main program it knows that
it's a function that we made later on
right down there hopefully you guys
watch my series before and you should
know that but anyways let's go ahead and
build this display items function so the
very first thing that we need to do is
we need to have access to that file
where all the items are and remember
this is the file right here with all the
items in in you know whatever this is
the effect of energy on our character or
whatever
so remember we already know how to open
a file to gain access to it and that's
through an if stream object and by the
way before I even finish typing that
make sure you have included your F
stream this is pretty much the header
file that allows you have access to the
files so in order to read information
from a file we need to make an if stream
object and just go ahead and name your
object you know objects file by the way
I named this file objects so that's why
I'm in this object file and of course we
can put this on two different lines but
it takes the optional constructor of
what file do you want to associate this
object to and we want to associate this
object with a objects dot txt file
that's the text file that I just showed
you guys now after this we need to make
two variables the first variable is
going to store the name of the object
and the second variable is going to
store you know the power or the energy
whatever you want to call this thing
I'll call it power so the first variable
is going to be a string variable and
it's going to store the name of the
object the next variable is going to be
a double variable and this is going to
store the power of the object so now
what we can do is the first thing we
want to test is what choice did they
enter so we're going to be making a
bunch of different if statements we can
make a switch statement but I think if
will look a little bit neater so we'll
say all right if the choice they entered
which is X is equal to 1 then check it
out
that means that they wanted to display
the plain items in other words they want
to display the items that has zero
effect on our character so if the choice
they entered is equal to 1 what do we
want to do well we want to go ahead and
first here's what we're going to do
we're going to loop through each object
we're going to loop through this one
this one then this one then this one
then this one each time we loop through
we're going to want to check if the
power is equal to zero if the power is
equal to zero then we're going to want
to go ahead and print it out so it's
going to say all right loop through this
one print it out loop through this one
don't print it out don't print it out
print it out print it out um so that's
what it's basically going to do so the
first thing we need to do is loop
through each object and we in order to
do that if you remember from let's see I
want to say two tutorials ago we can
just go ahead and make a while loop and
in this while loop just go ahead and
write come on there we go I was waiting
for it to pop up go ahead and write your
object file and then go ahead and we're
going to store the first thing and name
and we're going to store the second
thing in power and this is going to loop
through as long as your file is open so
it's going to say all right loop through
the first thing stored a name and store
it in power so now what we want to do is
we want to check all right whenever you
loop through an item and the power is
equal to just go ahead I don't want to
add that space if the power is equal to
zero then go ahead and print it out so
see out name of the object and then
we'll just go ahead and add a little
space and then the power and then we'll
go ahead and end that line so basically
we're going to be looping through this
whole file whenever it gets to item
where the power is equal to zero print
it out on the screen now let's go ahead
and copy this two more times
you never say all right remember X is
the choice that they entered so if they
enter the choice of number two then they
want to print out the helpful items just
like that so whenever they want to print
out the helpful items we know that the
power must be greater than zero because
remember a helpful item is like a candy
or a soda
where the power is greater than zero so
what this is going to do is whenever
they enter the choice to print out the
items that have a power greater than
zero and whenever they enter the choice
3 print out the items that have power of
less than zero and these items are you
know a ninja meth and dirty needle all
those items that are harmful items have
a power of less than zero right like
that so basically our program is
complete this is ready to run and I know
you guys are just itching for me to
press this build and run button and see
this program go to work but I'm actually
going to be doing that in the next
tutorial because first I want you guys
to watch one of my other videos kind of
sucker you into that one and also I'm
going to be showing you guys that it
does indeed run perfectly I actually in
between these videos I'm going to check
for errors and make sure I didn't mess
up anything and I'm also going to be
talking through you guys one more time
to clear up any you know confusing
things that or any questions any guys
might have so thank you guys for
watching I cannot wait to press this pun
so I guess you guys are going to have to
see me
press it in the next tutorial so thank
you guys don't forget subscribe and I'll
see you guys next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
