intermediate Java tutorial and now that
you're done creating the GUI or the
constructor the next thing that you need
to do is pretty much set up your
application pretty much the background
housekeeping boring setup stuff so I'm
going to go ahead and set up and run the
server because that's what this method
is going to do again this is going to
get called once your GUI is done being
created so what you need to do is create
a method called public void start
running I think that's an appropriately
named method now we're going to want to
put all this in a try-catch statement so
let me go ahead and do that right now so
crap try or cry once we get some errors
catch and exception I oh I hate typing
this freaking catch stuff I hate
catching because that means we've messed
something up if this happens so i/o
exception what happens when we mess up
just go ahead and print stab trace so we
can see how we messed up and we're
getting an error right here because we
didn't type anything into the try
statement yet so let's go ahead and take
care of that right now
so again try-catch statement just so you
know whenever we mess something up we
can see what we did wrong and but
hopefully we don't mess something up so
the first thing we need to do is we need
to set up the server and basically give
a port number I'll explain you guys what
that means in a second but you know how
I created this variable right here and I
said you know don't worry about it if
you guys don't understand what it does
right now
you'll extent you'll understand it later
on well guys the time has come we now
have to tackle it unfortunately so go
ahead and first thing you need to do is
set your variable equal to new server
socket and we're going to throw two
numbers in here the first one six seven
eight nine that's pretty much just a
dummy number just for testing purposes
but don't forget it and the second one
is 100 so what does this do right here
well remember like I said
this program or these set of tutorials
that I'm going to be teaching guys is
pretty much a two-part program one of
the programs is going to sit on a public
server that is going to be my server and
I'm going to be sending it wait for
people to connect me and the other part
of the program is one that you guys can
run pretty much on you know one that you
can put on your computer and connect to
that server so once we're connected we
can have a conversation with each other
now if you never work with servers
before or don't understand what a port
number is I'll tell you guys a surfer's
basically like any other computer except
that a lot of people can access it now
go ahead and look at the computer that
you're looking at right now it doesn't
only have one application on it you may
have you know Google Chrome you probably
have eclipse on it you might have
Photoshop um you know Microsoft Word a
bunch of different applications so
whenever you connect to my server you're
going to say okay where is the
application that I'm looking for where
is that instant messaging application
well we actually stick this program at a
certain port and the port that I'm just
going to use is six seven eight nine you
can name it um you can give it any port
number that you want but basically
whenever your boat comes through your
stream and it connects to my server it's
going to be looking where its dock
basically where is that program well
let's hit port
six seven eight nine and guys I'm not
making that up when I say port number
the technical term is actually port
number basically where do you want to
connect or where is this application now
this number after this maybe it says it
right here if I highlight serversocket
yep import and it back log now the
backlog is basically saying okay how
many people can wait - pretty much
access this Instant Messenger because
obviously this is going to be a very
popular program probably probably more
popular than Photoshop because you know
I'm creating it how awesome is that so
we don't want you know millions of
millions of people waiting to chat with
me I only want a limited amount of
people because if there's too many
people then you know my server is going
to crash so I'm going to say okay
only a hundred people are allowed to sit
and wait at my port so basically we're
is this application on your server and
how many people can sit and wait to talk
to you and this is technically called
the backlog or queue length how many
people can wait so that's what we did
right there and now that the server is
set up in whenever you know by the way
another thing whenever you run or build
the other application the client side of
your program you're going you guys are
going to need to know this port number
so write it down on a sticky note or
something don't forget it so now that we
set up the server we're going to want to
stick the rest of the application they
say that wrong application it's kind of
hardware to say in a while loop now this
while loop is going to run forever so
just go ahead and stick it inside true
now what part do we want to run forever
well that's pretty much the main program
and if you guys ever made like a video
game or you know something in Java you
stick things in loops because this is
the code that you want to run over and
over and over again so what code do you
want to run over and over and over again
well we're going to put this
unfortunately in a try-catch statement
too so you know my apologies ahead of
time so what we wanted to do is try to
do something and if we do that wrong
then just go ahead and catch it uf
exception and you guys understand what
this means in a second I just can't talk
and type at the same time
all right so pretty much if we mess
anything up and this actually isn't
really messing up it's pretty much me
doing it so show message um something
like new line and I know I'm not
explaining any of this but I just need
to type it for server
and then the connection explanation
point all right
so what we're going to do is pray see
basically try to you know connect and
have conversation with someone else now
once we're done having that conversation
what we're going to do is we're going to
catch an error now it's going to view it
as an error but really um whenever I end
the conversation you know I'm back you
know what I'm done talking to you
I either have to go make hot pockets or
you know maybe my mom's calling me in a
mobile on I'm going to go ahead and end
the connection and once that connection
is going to end
then this message is going to pop up and
the EOF exception is let me see if I can
highlight it it pretty much as you can
see this pretty much explains it better
than I can exception is mainly leaves by
data input streams to signal end of a
stream so again this means end of a
stream or end of connection so whenever
I say okay you know I'm done running
this program the connections going to
end
obviously the stream that connects menu
is going to end and this is what's going
to show on your screen just to say okay
you know Bucky left server ended the
connection now finally what we want to
do after all that is holy crap can't
freakin type today house is run a method
called closed crap which pretty much is
housekeeping stuff to signal the end of
the stream close all the sockets so on
and so forth so I guess I have time to
you know finish this right here so
obviously that comment won't to the main
meat of this is we're going to be
running three methods and these three
methods are pretty much going to be the
brute of this application now the very
first thing I need to do whenever this
application starts running on my server
is I need to wait for someone else to
basically connect with me one of you
guys needs to you know connect with me
before I can have a conversation with
someone so for that method I'm just
going to call wait for connection and
obviously we have to build this method
later on there's no built-in method that
you know does that so once someone is
connected with me the first thing that
we needed
is we need to set up the streams we need
to set up my output stream in my input
stream so I can send messages to you and
I can receive messages from you or from
the client so we'll name this message
set actually I think setup is one word
set up streams and again this is going
to set up my output in input stream now
once we are connected we're going to
have to run a method called while
chatting and what this method is going
to do is it's basically the code or the
programming that allows us to send
messages back and forth to each other
during our chat so again essentially
what this entire program is going to do
is it's going to first start up and wait
for someone to connect to it the next
thing it's going to do is once it's
connected it's going to set up a
connection or a stream between my
computer and someone else's computer and
the last thing it does is when two
computers are connected then of course
you want to be able to send messages
back and forth to each other so that's
why I have to code this while chatting
method and I'll show you guys how to do
that now once I decide that I'm sick of
talking to you guys I'm going to say
show message server enter the connection
and it's just going to send you a
message that said you know what Bucky
left and closed crap which is pretty
much a housekeeping stuff and pretty
much end the streams close the socket
it's all that good stuff so that's what
we have to look forward to coding all of
this stuff so you know I guess I'll have
to wait to the next tutorial so I'll see
you guys then oh yeah follow me on
