video I'm going to show you how to make
a sidebar layout that you can toggle on
and off now this type of layout as you
can see it has a sidebar on the Left
where all of your usually navigation
items are in your main area on the right
this is the part that whenever we
collapse it look what happens it just
doesn't shift over it actually expands
and is responsive now another reason
this layout is cool is because on
smaller devices let's say a phone that
was that size the entire menu is off the
screen and the user can toggle it
whenever they you know want to go to a
new page or do whatever so it's one of
my favorite types of layouts you put
that back to normal and this is actually
one that I'm working on for a little
section on my website right now and I
don't know I just like it because it
feels like I'm working with actual piece
of software and it looks kind of like a
control panel rather than you know a
plain old boring generic website but
anyways whenever we make this project
here's what we're going to do we're
going to have a wrapper and this wrapper
is going to encompass everything so the
wrapper is essentially your entire
website now inside here we're going to
have two sections the sidebar in the
main page content
now the wrapper is going to say okay
depending on and then we're going to
write a little bit of JavaScript do you
want to use this layout which is all
your main content or this layout with
the sidebar so all we're doing is we're
making two layouts one with a sidebar
one without sidebar and we're going to
use this button to switch between them
it's pretty easy so let's see if we can
figure out how to do that now I already
added two files one is this index.html
this is just our basic template and this
sidebar dot CSS you can actually stick
it all in one file but whenever I post
it on github um you know it was kind of
going to look jumbled together so since
I have my CSS in another file we
actually need to include it so link rel
stylesheet' href sidebar CSS
all right now remember what we need to
do in order to get this functionality is
we need to surround everything in a div
our main div and this is our wrapper you
can actually give it whatever ID you
want but a lot of people usually name it
wrapper get everything properly
formatted and remember we're going to
have two sections one is the side bar
and the other one is the main content
I'll just say a page content and another
thing I want to show you guys is that
whenever we designed this layout I'm
going to have this side bar be
unresponsive just a normal generic side
bar it's going to be static
the only bootstrapping we're going to do
is this main page content because that's
the area you see that expands and
contracts is pretty much adaptable to
your website this can just be okay
a static little chunk of HTML do you
want to display it or not so of course
you can do whatever you want but I'm
just going to stick with the bare basics
so first let's make the static non
bootstrap sidebars so make a div and
I'll just add my items that items in the
navigation list as an unordered list so
anyways the ID of this could be like
sidebar wrapper
and let's just stick an unordered list
in here so we have some you know
navigation items and I'll say class
sidebar nav we just make like three of
them and ways will make them link to
something
I'll just make a bed link and uh well
can we have the first one the accounts
page and uh notice some other pages that
we have like settings and logout or
something so say that I don't know this
is like a social networking admin panel
whatever who cares re now that's all
we're going to have for the sidebar in
now I have to cough all right got a
little whooping cough there alright so
now we get the fun part the page content
so this is the part that we have to make
adaptable all we're doing with this is
we're going to say okay do you want to
display it or not so I'm going to be
putting everything in the div just so I
can design it a little bit better and I
need a ID so we can reference it and
this can just be like rapper so this is
going to be your entire right-hand side
so now what we have to do is we need to
bootstrap it so you know it's actually
responsive and the first thing that we
need to do for that is put it in a
container and I want mine fluid because
it's going to take up the entire width
of this right hand side and now inside
here you remember not dialogue we need a
rose
and for each row we have a column now
for this right here you see that I have
three columns one for this one for this
and one for these panels in this example
I'm just going to make one huge column
because I want to make it really basic
just to demonstrate this idea but
whenever you're designing actual site
feel free to put you know three
different columns in here or you know
two and they can be different sizes
whatever you want to do so for div I'll
set this class equal to column large
twelve so I just had to equal to twelve
if you want to think up the entire thing
and now check this out see in this
example what I did is I made a toolbar
at the top but in the demonstration I'm
showing you guys it's going to kind of
look like this we're just a sidebar and
the main area so we can't stick that
little button that the user clicks on
the toolbar because we don't have one so
in this example I'm just going to put it
like somewhere around here and you know
do whatever you want like I said but
that's what I'm going to do so it's
going to be a link href I'm so lazy that
every like time I hit a key I just wait
for like all my code to pop up for me so
that's why I'm like I don't know kind of
takes me a while but whatever alright so
now what class do we want well we want
to make this into a button so button and
button success so this would just be a
plain blue button and now we need to
give it an ID so I'm gonna name this
menu toggle and I'll just say like
toggle menu pretty creative so
essentially we're going to be clicking
this button right here and whenever we
click it it's going to change layouts to
either this one or this one so that's
all we're going to do we have two
different layouts in this button is
going to switch between them easy easy
beautiful covergirl stuff alright let me
just add a couple other things
sidebars sidebar layouts are cool and
just a paragraph let me add a bunch of
text in here so you guys can see
whenever we hide the menu and show it
again that the content is actually
collapsing and expanding and our
responsiveness works so I love pie seems
like a good thing to type alright that
should be enough text to a tick of the
entire screen now the last thing that
we're going to do is we need a little
bit of JavaScript code it's actually
jQuery and this is the code that's going
to change the classes so again like I
said we're making two different layouts
we did it yet but we're about two and
CSS well now is this one layout is this
now in order to change those we're going
to give a wrap or the wrapper a classic
alike will say like is toggled or is not
toggled or showing menu or not showing
menu whatever but that's what that
button is going to do so that's the
reason for this JavaScript and I'll put
like a menu toggle script
script script in the first thing is we
need to select this button right here
because this is the thing that's going
to cause the action so to get it that
works on menu toggles so this is the
selector if you aren't familiar with the
jQuery so we want to select this button
and this is just we're referencing it by
the ID so we're going to select that
button and we're going to say whenever
the button is clicked then we can do
whatever we want so function not 1e let
me make sure I got more semicolons in
place all right so here's the thing that
we need to watch out for you see this
button right here it's a link but the
default action of your browser whenever
you click a link is to go to a URL now
all we're doing with this link is we're
treating it kind of different we don't
want to go to a new website we just want
to use it to toggle the menu on and off
so we actually need to take care of that
by preventing the default action which
is the pretty much tell the computer
that hey whenever we click this it's not
supposed to you know perform the default
action of going to a web page so II
prevent default event so again this is
the event in other words whenever you
see e that's just the button click and
that's all that means in we're saying
okay prevent the default arm clicking
action of a link in other words don't go
to a URL and you know it's kind of a
weird way to say it but whatever and
what we're going to do after this is we
just need to change the layout the
overall layout now the reason I made
this parent right here is because this
is our container for everything else so
all we have to do is we need to give
this a layout and let me actually select
this
and it's pretty much whenever we arm
have a reference to this then we can
control whatever is inside it it's
pretty good way to explain it alright so
we're just going to say for the wrapper
toggle clasp and I'll name it toggled
all right so what this means is whenever
you click this button right here
whenever a click on the button happens
then don't worry about going to another
URL and also toggle this wrappers class
to toggled or not call toggle that's
what this toggle class function does it
adds or removes the toggled class so by
default right now it doesn't have it
when we click it it'll add it when you
click it again it'll hide it when you
cook it it will add it and that is how
we can just say on and off and on and
off and you don't have to worry about a
bunch of state variables really easy
that way so now we get to hop over in
the CSS in our so you stick that in a
new video but for now there you go
thanks for watching and see you next
