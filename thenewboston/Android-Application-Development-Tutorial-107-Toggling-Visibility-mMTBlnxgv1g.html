Androids toil for the new boss in what
we're gonna learn about in this tutorial
is visibility for the most part for XML
layout such as a button let's say for
this example we're gonna have a button
where the user can save the data but
first we want to make sure they have
actual our file name so we don't want
them to allow us to save anything until
they create the file name so that's the
kind of concept we're gonna go through
in this tutorial it's gonna be pretty
simple for the most part since
everything's pretty basic so what we're
gonna do is we're gonna add a let's go
with a textview trying to gather my
thoughts here sorry and today I edit
text and then let's say a button to
buttons let's do two buttons so one
button two buttons now let's just change
them stuff around first edit text that
we just have we're gonna say save as
something like that and for edit text
we're gonna change this to ET save as
and for button we're gonna say confirm
and for a first button anyways and our
second button we're gonna say save for
the text and then let's change your
references for those buttons to confirm
save as something like that just trying
to make sure we don't have the same
references that we've used before and
also save save file
there we go so let's check this out
everything's looking pretty good and
what's gonna happen is when they click
this confirm button then this Save
button will appear so first we need to
kind of disable the Save button actually
being visible to start with so it's
pretty simple just gonna format right
there for you guys and Android all you
do is Android and then visibility and
let's see what options we have I believe
it's visible and invisible so we're just
gonna hit equals invisible gone would be
like its destroyed so after if you guys
just want this button to be clicked once
and then destroy it you want to use the
gun which won't really make too much
sense in the XML layout it's more kind
of the same reference as we do in Java
so let's check that out
our Save button isn't there so now let's
go over to our external data Java file
and just kind of set up some of those
references so we had let's make make
everything accessible here for a whole
class or edit text and we're gonna have
this save file two buttons confirm and
save
import both those and what's up our
references now are confirm equals button
see you know I I always debate if I
should do this before the tutorials or
if you guys actually like me setting
this up so you don't have to pause the
video and catch up so I can't really get
any feedback from you cuz you know it's
not gonna be it's not gonna be published
until I'm done with the whole series so
let's see a button and then what was it
and oh yeah and since we don't have our
references available yet we I go over to
our XML file save it I always forget
that
so now button confirm save as for
confirmed button and for Save button
we're gonna have this again equal just
button find view by ID and it is button
save file now let's add our Ellen click
listeners
- both are save and/or confirm
implements see at one point I bet you
guys thought the button thing was kind
of difficult but now here's your pros
you're showing everybody um
and so once we get our onclicklistener
set up let's go down here and setup a
simple switching case that we're all so
familiar familiar with get ID
all right and now we're ready to go for
a tutorial with the Java side of the
visibility thing so what we're gonna do
is again our Save button is invisible to
start with so when they do the click
which goes through this on click method
in this case confirm click what we're
gonna do is we're gonna change the
visibility of our button in this
tutorial anyway so what we're gonna do
is we're gonna say our Save button dot
set visibility and and what we want to
set this equal to is from the view class
so we're gonna say view dot and we have
all these options such as the gone one I
was telling you guys about earlier
there's invisible if we want to make it
invisible and there's visible so we're
gonna click visible and we're good to go
let's just check this out make sure
everything worked no it's pretty simple
tutorial but we got some stuff set up
for the future always think about the
future guys all right so let's check a
clip the video because that my emulator
wasn't started external data no Save
button and when we hit confirm BAM our
save buttons available so I'll catch you
guys in the next tutorial will reduce
some more sweet stuff and have a good
one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
