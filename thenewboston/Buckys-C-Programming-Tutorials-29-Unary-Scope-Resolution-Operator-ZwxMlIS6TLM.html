welcome to your 29th C++ tutorial and in
this tutorial I'm going to be talking to
you guys about something called scope I
can't remember if I talked to you guys
about scope already but I need to talk
to you guys about it again anyways so
anyways I'm gonna be talking to you guys
about scope not the mouthwash a little
bit different and also something called
the unary scope resolution operator but
I call it the colon colon because you
know whenever we're typing it it's just
a colon colon so let's go ahead and
first let me build another function
aside from main I'm just going to build
another function called Bucky and all
this is going to do is well we won't
even have it do anything yet so right
now we have two functions main and Bucky
they're both good to go so sometimes
people build variables inside a function
like in X and set it equal to 10 well
let's go ahead and make some interesting
variables I'm tired of X so int tuna and
set it equal to 69 now let's go ahead
and build another variable called tuna
and set it equal to 20 well I just want
to demonstrate one thing some people
would declare variables outside
functions and some people declare
variables inside functions now it's not
just like some people have blue eyes
some people have brand eyes there are
people nonetheless and it doesn't really
matter where I color they have well
actually this does matter it's not a
personal preference it actually does
matter in your computer program where
you declare or make your variable
whenever you make your variable outside
the functions then every single function
can access this tuned variable so this
function can use it Bucky can use it
every function has access to this
variable but for example say you only
made your variable inside one function
so you only made this variable inside
main that means that whenever Bucky
tried to use the variable tuna it's
going to get an error message so check
it out
it says tuna what the heck is tuna
because main functions are basically
greedy whenever they create a variable
they're the only ones with access to
that variable so that's why people
typically like to use variables in
declare
outside all of the functions because
whenever you make a variable
outside the function then every single
function in your program is going to
have access to that so say for example
main wanted for an Altoona and book you
wanted to print out to know well you can
go ahead and run this program right now
and check it out both programs are going
to print out tuna just fine so the
reason Bucky didn't print it out and you
only saw tuna once was because we didn't
call it anywhere but anyways that's what
the scope of variables is basically
where you create variables depends where
you can use them so if you declare a
variable in here only main can use it if
you make one in here only buck you can
use it if you declare outside both the
functions can use it but now we come
across a little bit of a conundrum and
let's go ahead and delete Bucky for the
rest of the store oh because he was just
an example a dang fine one but a he was
an example what if a user did something
stupid like this
they made a variable called tuna outside
main so of course main has access to it
but they made another variable called
tuna that's inside main as well so main
can access that one too so now when you
try to print out tuna as a choice do I
use this one or do I use this one let's
go ahead and print this out and see what
happens
it chose 20 and why did it do that well
computers pretty much take the most
recent or most inner variable that they
can they say all right here is a
variable that I can use but why use that
one when I have one right inside my
function I'm going to assume that since
this one was built right inside my
function that that's the one you want me
to use so these are called local
variables and these are called global
variables and when it has the choice
it's always going to choose that local
variable so you're saying all right
let's go ahead and say
that I'm building a function just like
this and I want to call both of these
variables tuna but I actually want to
use this variable tuna out here well how
do I tell my program that all right I
know you have a local variable called
tuna but I want you to use this one well
in order to do you need to use something
called the unary scope resolution
operator in other words the : : : :
tells your program all right you have
two functions called tuna one of them is
local and one of them is global whenever
you have this : colon before tuna that
means use the global tuna in other words
use the tuna outside your function so
now whenever you run the program check
it out it uses that global tuna instead
of the local tuna and the reason people
actually do this is because when they
have variables with the same name of
different data types that's when it
comes in handy so for example if you had
an INT tuna and the double tuna and you
ran it it would use the double tuna
which is 20 but if you use that colon
colon which is called again the unary
scope resolution operator if you're
taking the test or something then it
uses a 69 so I just don't want to show
you guys if you're stupid and put in
twice people typically write variables
with the same name whenever they're
using different data types so just
wanted to point that out so what to take
away from this tutorial whenever you
create a variable inside a function you
can only use that variable inside the
function where you created it you can't
use it inside any other function
whenever you create a variable outside
of function you can use it in any
function in your entire program so if we
had another function called Buckey and
another one called
Toni and another one called Jessica we
can use this tuna in all of those
functions so that's why you can decide
whether it makes this outside or inside
your function and the last thing I want
you guys remember from this story
whenever you have two variables with the
same name one is local and one is global
and you
want to use the global variable in your
function you need to use this dot dot or
colon colon unary resolution operator
whatever the heck you want to call it
it's two colons before your variable and
that tells C++ hey C++ I know I have
variable in here but I want to use this
one the global variable instead and if
you remember these three rules you'll be
good to go so that's all I have for you
guys for this tutorial again basically a
really easy tutorial just a little weird
concept that you have to understand so
thank you guys for watching don't forget
to subscribe and I will see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
