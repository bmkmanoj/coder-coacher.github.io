youtube.com slash on live gamer for the
new Boston and in this tutorial we're
going to be taking a look at a card
application that we're going to be
working on throughout the next couple
tutorials and in it we're going to talk
about inheritance mostly inheritance and
some other stuff that I wanted to teach
you guys so let's go ahead and create a
new project and it's what we'll use to
make the application so we will select a
windows forms application and we will
just call it car application and we'll
just go ahead and click OK and wait for
that to load now let's come over here to
our solution Explorer we wait for it to
the finished loading
okay so we'll right-click our
application and we will add a class so
we'll shrink this down a bit and we will
name our class let's just call it all
cars
okay so let's go ahead and get rid of
this right here and now what I need to
do is we're going to create a namespace
that is going to hold all of our car
classes so namespace all cars and then
we'll go ahead and end that namespace
now we're going to have a bunch of
classes in here that do what's called
inherit from each other and now
basically what this means is that the
stuff you use in one class can be used
in a lower class so let's say you have
an animal class a dog class would
inherit certain attributes from the
animal class that is true for all
animals so let's just create a car class
right here so we'll just go ahead and
start out by creating a class so we will
type class car okay so now we're going
to do is we are going to add a variable
in there that will get the color of the
car so we'll type public color as string
now let's zoom in here a bit so you guys
can see it a little bit better okay so
now that we have the color in there
let's go ahead and add some other stuff
that all cars will have so cars will
have a speed so we'll make private in
speed as integer so this is the speed of
our car and we're making it private so
that anybody else had this class can't
directly access in speed and change it
without using the accelerate function
that we're going to be creating so now
let's make a property that will let the
let any other class get the speed of the
car so we'll type public read-only
property and we're just going to go
ahead and name this one speed so speed
has integer I will go ahead and press
ENTER and you can see that gives us an
get and
and get and what we want to do is we
just want to return the speed so we will
type return in speed so now anybody
outside this class can call speed and it
will send them back there the speed of
the car now let's create a function that
will let them let somebody accelerate
the car or we'll make it a method so
public sub and subs are also referred to
as methods because they don't return a
value so we'll just call it accelerate
and for the arguments we're going to
have them send an integer so by Val
accelerate by as integer okay so
whatever they accelerate we're just
going to add that to in speed so in
speed plus equals accelerate by okay so
now that we've created some stuff that
we can use inside of our car class let's
go ahead and make an object of this car
class over here so we'll double click on
form one and we will zoom in okay so
let's just make a default car because
we're going to be asked to function in
functionality that will let you create
multiple cars so private default
car as new and then we're going to type
our name space so all cars as new all
cars dot car so now that we created an
object of cars let's go ahead and set
the color so default car
dot color equals let's just do red
and we'll go ahead and show that in a
message box so message box default car
dot color okay so let's go ahead and run
this and you can see that it shows us
red now this is to be expected so go
ahead and if you haven't put this code
in already I would suggest doing that
because we're going to be using this
code a lot in the upcoming tutorials
it's going to be very useful if you have
it there for you to manipulate
manipulate yourself so let's just
comment this a little bit so this gets
the speed public and private members and
then accelerates the car okay so if you
don't have that already like I said go
ahead and make it and then once you're
done with that go ahead and move on to
the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
