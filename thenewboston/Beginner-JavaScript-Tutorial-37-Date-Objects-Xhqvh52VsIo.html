welcome to your 37th JavaScript tutorial
and and this is oral I want to go over
something called the date object now the
day object is a really useful built-in
object whenever you're working with the
date and the time so what it does is
whenever you create a date object it
goes ahead and it grabs the current date
which is in this case 331 2011 and it
also grabs the current time which is 321
p.m. so let's go ahead and before I get
into the date object even more I want to
show you guys a special function that
we're going to be using and that's
called the set interval function so what
the set interval function does is it
someone's texted me hold on let me see
who it is hmm
some girls macking on me sorry girl
you're going to have to wait I'm doing a
tutorial so anyways what the set
interval function does is it runs a
function however met however much time
you want to increment it by so for
example you can run a function every
second or every 5 seconds so this is
really hard to explain so I'm just going
to show you guys an example so function
will just name it like do something and
what this function is going to do is
just print something out on the screen
so document right and just go ahead and
write like tuna on the screen or
something tune key a who the heck cares
so set interval takes two parameters the
first parameter it takes is what
function do you want to run well I'm
just going to run that do something and
make sure there we go it's the right one
make sure you don't have any typos and
the second parameter is the increment
you want to run in and this is in
milliseconds so if you write 1000
milliseconds that means one second so
now what's going to happen is this
you're going to have your function
called do something and all the sizes
print something out on the screen and
you're going to say run this function
every one second so now we could go
ahead and launch this in chrome it's
going to say tuna tuna tuna
tuna tuna every single second so that's
a pretty cool function again that's
called the set interval function and the
reason I want to explain to you guys is
because we're going to be using it in
the program we're going to be building
right now so anyways the program I'm
going to be making is this I'm going to
be making a basic clock and what this
clock is going to do is each second it's
going to give you what time it is so
it's going to say 323 323 one second 323
two seconds 323 three seconds so it's
not going to be formatted nicely and
it's not going to be real pretty because
I only have like seven more minutes to
make it but I'm just going to try to
explain you guys what the date object is
and how the day object is useful
whenever you create things like clocks
so the first thing that we're going to
be needing is a function that we're
going to be calling every second so go
ahead and make a function and I'm going
to name my print time because all this
is going to do is print the time out on
your computer sir Oh got a hair ball
print the time out on your computer
screen so go ahead and make a variable
call now and in order to make a new date
object go ahead and press new date with
empty parentheses and what this does is
it's going to go ahead and grab the
current time of day and also the date
and store it in variable called now so
now that variable called now holds the
current date and the current time so it
holds a lot of information but we want
to access certain pieces of information
such as the hours the minutes and the
current seconds and where we're going to
be doing with this information is just
printing it out so let's go ahead and
make a couple variables variables ours
is going to be equal to now which is the
day object and the method to get the
hours in that day object is get hours so
for example right now like I said it's
3:24 p.m. so it's going to get the
number 15 because 15 is the number of
hours in military time of 3 o'clock the
reason it doesn't grab 3 even though
it's 3:24 p.m. is because if it just
spit out the number 3 you want to know
if it was 3:00 a.m. or 3:00 p.m. so
that's why it
whoever made JavaScript decided to get
it in military time so this is going to
have 15 stored in the variable hours
which is equal to three o'clock so now
let's go ahead and make the variable
minutes which is equal to now dots get
minutes and like I said right now the
current time is 325 so now this variable
is going to be equal to 25
pretty cool huh and last but not least
you can probably guess what I'm going to
do now variable seconds equals now get
seconds so this is the number that's
going to be changing on our screen every
time it's going to be like 15 16 17 18
it's going to print out a new second
every time since is every second it's
going to be grabbing all that
information and the seconds is going to
be changing every time we print it out
so basically all these variables are
doing are grabbing the current hours the
current minutes and the current seconds
simple enough so now all we have to do
is print it out on the screen so
document dot write and let me just go
ahead and write it in a hours plus + : +
mins + : + seconds
and after seconds I'm just going to add
a line break because what we could do is
make this appear on the same line
but I'm just going to make the new time
appear in a new line every time since I
don't have that much time to make a you
know pretty-looking alarm clock so um I
think this is good so what this is going
to do is it's going to print out 15 26
30 15 26 31 15 26 32 so on and so forth
so let's go ahead and check it out we
now have a function that prints out the
current time but now we have to use that
sets interval function that we learned
before to call this function every one
second so again like I said it takes two
parameters the first parameter is print
time or in other words what function do
we want to call and the second parameter
is how often do we want to call it 1000
milliseconds a kaeru wanna call this
function every one second so let's go
ahead and save it and launching Chrome
and I got a typo somewhere so hold on
I'll find it for you all right guys I
found my error I accidentally type get
menus instead of get minutes so now that
I threw the T in there it actually
should work now so let's go ahead and
launch in Chrome there we go 15:29 49 50
51 52 53 54 so every second it calls
that function in again like I said I
could have formatted this nicely so you
know it maybe would have said three
o'clock instead of military time and
maybe I could have put it on the same
line of having it instead of having it
up here on a different line every time
but hey I only have like ten minutes to
make these tutorials so that's what you
get so basically what I want to show you
guys in this story is we can use the set
interval function which is a built-in
function in JavaScript to call one of
our functions in a certain time
increment in this case every second so
in this example every second it called
our function print time and all print
time does is use that date object to
store the current time of
day in the variable' now and what we did
is there are a bunch of different
informations in that object three of
them are get hours get minutes and get
seconds we use those pieces of
information to make a very simple clock
on our website um again the date object
has a lot of different methods that are
associated with if I went through all
the methods then it will take an awful
lot of time and I don't have that much
time in these tutorials it will take
like 20 tutorials to teach you guys of
all the different methods but if you
want to learn those methods go to the
javascript website whatever the heck it
is and you can check them out but
anyways
whenever you're working with dates such
as building a calendar or times such as
building in alarm clock this is the
object that you need to use and this is
how you create it right here so
hopefully you guys learn the concepts of
set interval and also how to use the
date object for something in a kind of
useful program so for now that's all I
have for you guys so thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and I'll
see you guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
