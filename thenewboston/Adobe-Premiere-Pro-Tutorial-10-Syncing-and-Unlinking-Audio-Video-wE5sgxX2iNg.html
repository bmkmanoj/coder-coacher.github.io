tenth Premiere Pro tutorial and in this
tutorial what I'm going to be doing is
I'm going to be doing something a little
different than how I have been teaching
you up to this point I've been kind of
teaching you the theory what everything
is pretty much is giving you the
information but we never really put
everything into practice and I never
showed you actually how to edit a final
video so here is how I add a final video
here's how everything kind of gets
pieced together the very first thing I
do is start a new project and move my
tools pretty much set up my workspace
exactly how I want to be set up so that
looks pretty good right like that
looking pretty good so now what I need
to do is import everything I need I like
to import everything first so I'm going
to go ahead and file import and say I
want to edit the podcast from 9/8 so
what happens is we should our podcast
with two different camcorders one that's
mostly on me and one that's mostly on
her or closer to me and closer to her
so here is one video clip and let's see
35 and 108 is the other one so I'm going
to go ahead and import both of these
video files and again as you can see one
of these is closer to me and the other
one is closer to her so they're pretty
much shot the exact same time just two
different angles so aside from that
check this out the microphone that are
on the camcorders are ready are they're
pretty crappy microphones so that's why
we have the these awesome microphones in
this mixer right here to get really good
crystal-clear audio so we're going to
have three separate pieces of audio the
audio from this camcorder the audio from
this camcorder and the separate audio
that we recorded on our computer and
that nice crystal-clear audio is the
audio that we want to use so I'm going
to go ahead and import that right now
and that's what this file is it's pretty
much the perfected crystal-clear audio
instead of the camcorders audio and I'm
going to show you how to swap those out
little later on but for now we need to
import one other thing and that is the
main title picture so go ahead and hit
file import
and I have under downloads and that's
this right here so if I go ahead and
double-click that I can preview yep
that's what I want to use for the main
title so the very first thing that I
need to do is I need to sync up this
video clip this video clip in this audio
since all of this stuff was filmed at
the exact same time so go ahead and take
35 and drag it out on your timeline and
leave some space so you can move some
things around now go ahead and take 108
and drag that out too and we want them
kind of on top of each other and we're
going to go ahead and expand that now if
we look I want to show you guys
something what I do to sync everything
up let me go ahead and double click 108
in order to sync everything up what I do
is I have Lola clap and the moment she
claps we can see that if we look right
here we get a nice little peak so that
is why I have people clap and if you
ever see in the movies they have that
white board with black marks on it that
they they're like alright scene 1 shot 2
action and they snap it that's why they
snap it so they can align everything up
when they get this nice audio peak right
here so here is when she's clapping in
this film in this clip and here is when
the clap is in this clip so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to hit unsnap
and I need to line up these claps so
they look pretty lined up right there
but I'm going to go ahead and zoom in
even further and by the way here's a
nice little tip if you go ahead and
select one of these tracks hold down alt
on your keyboard and hit left and right
it's going to move it one frame to the
left or right so go ahead and line it up
as close as you can so now these tracks
are pretty much synced together if we go
ahead and play these
it's going to sound like one piece of
audio again this is pretty much syncing
up our audio from both the camcorders
that's what I'm doing now however
remember like I said this is the crappy
audio these two audio files right here
the good one we want is this one so go
ahead and drag this out on your timeline
and expand it and now what you need to
do is we need to listen for the clap so
let me go ahead nope that was in the
clap maybe this is the clap right here
yep I just heard it I know you guys
can't hear because I'm not recording the
computer I'm recording me talking but
this is the clap from this nice audio
file that I need to line up with a video
and then once I line all this up my
video is going to be synced up with my
audio file so let me go ahead and move
this over and by the way that's why I
said to not butter everything against
the zero zero because if everything's
blended up again zero zero we're not
going to have space to move this crap
around so let me go ahead and sync this
up and let me just make sure I got the
clap yup here's the clap right here so
let me go ahead and zoom in and what I'm
going to do is select this file hold
down all on my keyboard and move this
left until I line it up perfectly so I'm
going to go ahead and zoom in all the
way and check it out now everything is
synced together but yours guys are
saying alright it's off a little bit
Bucky I can see well check it out each
of these lines is one thirtieth of a
second so they might not be precisely
exact this is about one sixtieth of a
second off but your brain is never going
to be able to recognize that so get them
as close as you can and it'll be fine so
now pretty much this clip from this
camcorder this clip from this camcorder
in this piece of audio everything is
synced together however if I play it now
I have three different audio tracks it
kind of this kind of sounds like three
people are talking in the background
because I have this audio this audio
which is the crappy audio in this final
audio so what I'm going to do is I need
to get rid of this audio in this audio
what I could do is go ahead and take the
volume and bring it all the way down but
it's just going to be there and in the
way so here's what you need to do if you
go ahead and try to delete it
then it's going to delete both the video
and the audio so what you need to do is
you need to highlight the track right
click it and hit unlink what that's
going to do is it's going to unlink the
audio from the video so now you can move
the audio separately and you can go
ahead and delete that now and do the
same with the other track go ahead and
unlink that and now the audio and the
video are separate now you can go ahead
and delete that now what we want to do
is we want to make sure not to move any
of these because everything is synced up
so what you can do is go ahead to a
certain point of time and turn snap back
on and now go ahead and move everything
to that current time indicator and now
everything is synced up at this very
same point in time so now I'm going to
go ahead and hit play in both video
clips and audio clips everything is
synced up perfectly so now I can zoom in
and I'm going to figure out where do I
want to start this video so i zoom in
and look so obviously I start to talk
right around here as you can see from
the audio so instead of pulling
everything right like that I mean I can
do it this way but an easier way since
everything is already synced up is
highlight all of these and pull them are
all there at once and now I have both
video files and one audio file starting
at the exact same time so I'm going to
go ahead and zoom out highlight
everything and bring that all to zero
zero and now I have both video files in
the audio file which is the clean
perfect audio file playing exactly where
I wanted it to play and starting it
where I want it to start so there's a
bunch of other stuff to cover on editing
this taking a little longer than I
thought but hopefully you got a better
idea of how
edit video and if you have two different
camcorders that is how you sync things
up again make sure you clap at the
beginning so you can see visually
because check this out if you are just
looking like this and have a bunch of
different files that look like all of
this crap it would be really confusing
to try to line that up it's like a
putting the puzzle together however if
you have one peek it's really easy to
see so that's why people clap at the
beginning so they have one little piece
of audio that they can see and line that
up really easily so anyways um thank you
guys for watching in the next video I'm
going to show you what I do next and how
to make this video into a professional
looking podcast so thank you for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
