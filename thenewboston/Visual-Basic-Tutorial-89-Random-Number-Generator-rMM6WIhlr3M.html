slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
making a random number generator so go
ahead and select a new project we will
select windows forms application and we
will call it random generator then we'll
go ahead and click OK now before we get
started I want to talk to you guys about
something
computers cannot truly be random because
computers always follow a set set set
instructions and they cannot decide for
themselves or make random decisions now
the random class is the best attempt at
this that the dotnet developers have
created and I'll show you a little flaw
with that now here is a small
application that I made in about 10
minutes just to show you guys that
computers aren't really random so if I
start this random animation you can see
that it starts drawing on these graphics
right here you can see that as a trend
it's going up and to the left and it
just keeps doing that now if we leave
this running after a while you will see
that lines just streak up into the left
over and over and over again now we will
be making this closer to the end of the
series of tutorials when we get into
graphics just so I could show you guys
how the random class works and how it
isn't really random so um let's go ahead
and get started I'll leave this running
back here so we can come look at it
after the tutorial is over so go ahead
and resize this we will come over here
to our tool box and we will add a list
box and we will add a button and we go
ahead and make this a little bit larger
okay so let's go ahead and set the name
of the list box to list random numbers
and we'll set the text value off the
button to random numbers and we'll go
ahead and set the name to button
generate so let's go ahead and double
click on random numbers and we'll zoom
in once we get in here okay so now what
we need to do is we need to create an
object of the random class now in the
next couple tutorials we're going to be
learning about making classes now we
have used objects before so this is kind
of something that you need to learn
leading up to making class your own
classes and stuff so when you create an
object of a class it's pretty much like
making a variable it takes that class
and makes a little a copy of that class
that you can change the values call the
methods call the functions and it exists
all on its own and has nothing to do
with the original class and you can make
as many objects of a class as you want
so let's go ahead and declare let's just
do generator as new random so now that
we have made a new random object we're
going to go ahead and print out all
these random numbers to the list box so
we'll go ahead and do we will make a
do-while loop so do and we'll just type
list let's see what are the name of our
list box was list random numbers dot
atoms dot add and we'll type generator
dot next and it returns a non-negative
random number of type integer so it will
just set a limit for this so we'll do
from value 0 to value 20 and then we'll
go ahead and convert that to a string
okay so what this does is it uses our
annum class object and it generates a
random number between the value of 0 and
20 by using the next function and then
we went ahead and converted that integer
to a string to add to our list box so
what we want to do is let's come up here
and create a variable so we'll declare
my R and as integer and we will set it
equal to generator dot next and we'll go
from 0 to 20 now let's go ahead and take
out this right here because this will
generate two different numbers so I'll
just go ahead and type my R and sorry I
didn't think of this later but um so now
that our generator or our random number
is stored in a variable we can loop
while my R and is equal to a certain
while it is not equal to a certain value
so let's go ahead and loop while my R
and does not equal 5 and let's go ahead
and declare this outside of the loop so
that it can be used there so we'll just
take this out and we will type my R and
equals generator dot next okay so well
this is going to do is it's going to
keep running out random numbers while my
R and is not equal to 5 and once it
equals 5 it is going to stop the adding
the numbers to it so let's go ahead and
bring this over here and we'll go ahead
and click random numbers so you can see
that it adds 0 11 and 5 and then when we
do it this time it gets to 15 4 16 10 to
19 14 13 and it goes all the way and it
generates a whole bunch of random
numbers until it's five and then it
it stops doing that so let's go ahead
and type list random numbers dot atoms
dot clear so each time we click the
button it's going to clear the list box
and give us a new clean list box so we
got lucky on this one and the first time
I generated a number it was equal to
five and when we did it this time we get
a whole bunch of numbers and then
finally the last one is equal to five
and it stops the loop so go ahead and
create a couple random numbers by using
the next and you can specify the the
limit here and you can also do some
other stuff so play around with that and
see what else you can do you don't have
to use this you don't have to use loops
but just once you get familiar with the
random class and how to use it go ahead
and move on to the next tutorial and
