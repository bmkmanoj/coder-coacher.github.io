video I want to start talking to you
guys about link building basics now as
we already know what Google and every
search engine is going to do is they
basically go and try to crawl every
single web page on the entire Internet
now one thing one piece of information
that they gather up are the links on all
of the web pages now why did they do
that why did they care about this well
because whenever you have a link to
another web page whether it's just a web
page on your own website or a web page
on another website or to another website
should I say is it's basically telling
Google hey this is a connection this is
how these web pages are connected or
related to each other so for example on
my profile page I have a link to my
YouTube channel Facebook Twitter so all
of these things are somehow related to
me to my profile now in terms of SEO
since we know that in general as a
general rule it's good to have a lot of
Link's pointing to sites or web pages
that you want to rank higher so say that
we have 25% of all the web pages in the
entire world pointing to the home page
of the new Boston then Google is
obviously going to think hey this is
probably a really important web page
we're probably going to want to rank
this one higher than you know just some
other one so again in general it's good
to have more links or as many links as
possible pointing to your web pages now
another thing that links do is search
engines use them to determine what type
of web page it is so links are made up
of two parts and let me show you guys
this see if I can find a link here all
right so basically a link is the URL
which is pretty much just the main
website whatever it is and you also have
a chunk of text inside so like this
right here so this text is indicator to
Google what is this page so if there
were a bunch of links all throughout the
entire internet pointing to my Twitter
they're going to have a bunch of
different text inside Bucky's Twitter
one
I say follow me on Twitter one might say
the Twitter of the new Boston but
basically whenever someone goes to a
search engine and types in Bucky Roberts
Twitter what part of the search engine
formula is is going through and looking
at that text and this is the visible
text in saying okay what text had these
keywords in it well a lot of them were
pointing to this link so this is the
first one that's going to display so
it's not only getting a bunch of links
to point to a certain webpage it's the
actual text inside so whatever keyword
you're trying to target it's good
whenever you're building links to have
those keywords inside all right so we
know that it's good to have a lot of
links we also know that it's important
to have the right keyword another thing
that's pretty important is to have links
on sites that are relevant to your
content so let's say all right I want to
increase the results of this page right
here my main videos page so I know that
I'm going to try to build a lot of links
I also know that I'm going to try to
build you know maybe Java tutorials I
know what keywords I'm going after
however I just don't want to stick these
on any website what I'm going to do is
I'm going to target websites that are
relevant to computer programming what
websites are that well maybe this
Wikipedia page about computer
programming maybe some programming
forums maybe Stack Overflow because
whenever you have a link on Stack
Overflow whenever someone posts that
they post it because it's related to
that community - computer programming -
computer science so again it's good to
try to build links on other sites
relevant to your site not just like you
know your friends social network about
bananas or whatever now one of the last
things I want to talk about is link
quality so we already talked a little
bit about link quantity if a bunch of
websites are pointing to one webpage
that web page is probably really
important but it's also the quality of
that link so just a real quick example
if I'm walking down the street and some
crack had to recommend some restaurant
to me I'm never going to go to that
restaurant I'm going to think that
crackhead is trying to lure me in
somewhere so they can kidnap me
I do not trust that crackhead now if I
was in my grandma's house and she
recommended a restaurant to me out like
oh that actually sounds pretty good I'm
gonna go check that out why is that
they're both people they're both
recommending the restaurants it's
because I trust my grandma now on the
internet every link is essentially a
connection or a recommendation so
whenever Google looks at these is going
to say okay you have a bunch of Link's
pointing to the new Boston but are they
from reputable sources maybe there is
some shady website that look like it was
trying to take your credit card and
there's a bunch of links pointing to my
website that would suck it would
actually hurt my search engine results
ranking however if there are a bunch of
links on a trusted website like Stack
Overflow Wikipedia these are websites
that Google trucks they have Google
trusts they have reliable sources so
those would be great links now if you're
wondering how do we know if a site is
trustworthy or not well if the site is
just well known and popular then you
know it's pretty obvious if it's been
around for a while and also any site
that ends in edu or dot gov if you can
get links on those sites those are
incredibly trustworthy sites a lot more
so than com
so again educational and government
sites I know like a lot of you guys are
just like trying to sell t-shirts online
and you know just sites that are
probably never going to get linked on
government websites so I know a lot of
that is impossible for a lot of you but
it does have a little bit of effect so I
just want to throw that out there so
again in general a couple rules what
we've learned is it's good to have a lot
of external sites pointing to the
webpages you want to rank I the keywords
inside the links actually matter and
it's good to have links on trustworthy
popular sites so there you go there is
the real quick basics of link building
there's a lot more recover but we'll do
that in the future for now thanks for
watching don't forget subscribe I'll see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
