wanted to talk to you guys to actually
get your help on something I've been
trying to figure out now as from now I
already gave away one computer in a
contest and I'm giving away one dell
dimension in another commenting contest
and two more adult dimensions in a views
contest but when I was trying to figure
out what's the next thing I want to give
away since I'm already gave away for
computers or I'm going to give away for
computers I started wondering if you
guys are getting kind of tired of me
giving away computers and you wanted
something else for your giveaway so
here's what I'm going to do I made a
pull on my website the New Boston calm
and you guys can vote on the next
giveaway the next prize you want me to
give away I have between a brand-new
computer in a brand new ipod touch so I
set up a poll already all you guys have
to do is go to my site the New Boston
calm and vote on the next item you want
me to give away in a contest so I'll
actually put a link on the right hand
side of your screen under the
description box so I need you guys to go
and vote on an item or if you want
another item there's a little space
where you can comment below and vote on
what you want me to give away but i just
wanted to do this indeed you guys's
input on if you're getting sick of
giving away computers or you want me to
keep giving away computer so i look
forward to hearing from you and again i
will put a link on the right hand side
of your screen under description box
where you can vote on the next YouTube
give away from the New Boston so thank
you guys for watching I look forward to
your votes and I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
