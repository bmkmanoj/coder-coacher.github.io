Java tutorial and this is where I'm
going talking to you guys about
something called assignment in increment
operators now these are neat little
tricks to have when you're working with
a Java they're going to save you a bunch
of time and help you out with numbers a
little bit so let's go ahead and make
two variables I make one call tuna and
set that equal to five - whoa
and make another one called bass in case
we need it I don't know if we are beset
equal to 18 now what the increment
variable does is allows you to add one
very quickly to the variable and you can
do this by pressing plus plus and then
the name of variable so right now by
pressing plus plus tuna we change tuna
which was five to six now let me show
you guys just so we can I have something
you have to take my word for it
print line and go ahead and put a tune
in there and go ahead and run this baby
and as you can see what was five now
equals six so that's how you can use
plus plus to quickly change variables
value by adding one now another thing
that you can do is instead of putting it
on and separate you can throw this right
into the system print line method and as
you can see you still get six now this
is called pre incrementing and what this
does is it changes the value of the
variable before it uses it but I want to
show you guys something else
whenever you use post incrementing what
this is going to do is it's going to use
this variable as five and then it's
going to change it to six so let me go
ahead and press ok and as you can see
once we do this it gets five and not six
so what this did is it changed variable
but it didn't do it until after it
already used it so if we were to print
it out again it would get six so let's
go ahead and do that save me some time
by copying this baby or get pasted there
so now that here's what's going to
happen this is going to change the
variable six but it's not going to do it
until it after it already outputs it is
five and now once at six is going to
show six right here so may show that as
you can see five and then it changed it
to six and then we just outputted the
regular variable and this doesn't only
work with a addition you can also use
this with subtraction by pressing - -
you can change it by subtracting one and
getting four and let's see what else
there is what else is there um you can
also do something else and this is
called an assignment operator so now we
can know how to use the increment
operator using two plus signs and also
using two minus signs to subtract one
you can also use the assignment operator
let me get some space right here to do
it if you want to do more than one and
instead of changing value of tuna and
say you wanted to add five to tuna sit
you a platoon ax equals tuna plus five
and what this would do is take that
number five add 5 to it and give you the
value of 10 which I will show you right
here 10 now this is a pretty simple way
it takes the new variable and sets it
equal to the value of the old variable
plus the new number but there's the
easier way you can do this what you can
do in sub tune equals 2 plus 5 you can
do tuna plus equals let's get a new
number 8 and what this does is take the
new variable you want to use tuna and
just a date to it so it's a lot easier
way than typing all that so now we
should get the number 13 and we do just
like that so that's called um I think
it's called assignment operator but I'm
not exactly sure it's how you can use +
equals to add this number to the old
variable to get brand new very
and also just like anything else you can
use this with subtraction to subtract a
from even with multiplication to
multiply 8 and if you do this you should
get the number 40 and you do so that's
how you can use basic increment
operators to increment one very quickly
using plus plus and minus minus for
subtraction and also assignment
operators so you can assign a value to a
new variable very quickly without having
a press tuna equals tuna times a or
something like that so those are just
some nice little shortcuts that you can
use so get familiar with them because if
you do it's going to save you a bunch of
time and if you don't then you're going
to waste a bunch of time so thank you
guys for watching my Java tutorial make
sure to subscribe to my channel and
again thank you for watching now see you
