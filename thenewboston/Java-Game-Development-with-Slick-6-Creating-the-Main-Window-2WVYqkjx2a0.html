is a six tutorial I think and in this
video I'm gonna show you guys how to
create the main window that's gonna hold
the game because right now all we did is
we pretty much started working on the
inner screen of the game but in order to
create that window you know a window
with a you know minimize maximize X and
you know just a typical window that you
see all the time on windows that's what
we need to build now so go ahead and we
actually do this in your main method so
the very first thing we need to do is
create an object called
an app game container which is really a
neat name I like that name and this is
basically the window for your game that
your game is going to go inside so let's
go ahead and give this object name app
game container you see how I came up
with that and what we need to do after
this is all of the code like to set the
I don't know screen size or excuse me
window size and to start the window all
of this needs to be in a try-catch
statement so let me go ahead and build
the shell for that first try-catch in I
always build my try catches and I get
that catch out of the way first because
you know that's the boring part
the part that we don't want to happen
slick exception which is slicks
basically custom error handling II and
anytime that we get an exception which
hopefully we don't we'll just go ahead
and have that e print stack trace there
we go how convenient is that so
basically I spell something around there
oh I just got to type some crap into the
try of course so now that we have our
try-catch statement set up the very
first thing that we need to do is we
need to actually create that window so
now we just you know said we're going to
be working with it
in order to create it but app or
whatever your object name is equals new
half-game container container there we
go that's a little bit better if you
spell it right now what this does is it
actually takes this main class is a
parameter an object of this class so new
game and we're gonna say game name ray
like that so what the heck is this line
for and why do we need it
well we're gonna say we're gonna be
creating a window that's gonna hold a
computer game what computer game is it
gonna hold well this new game that we're
making right now which happens to be
probably the best game ever hand blaster
so again whenever you make a window
slick wants you to put it in something
called
app game container so we don't complain
we just say okay that's what we're gonna
do so now that it made us you know make
that container we now have the power of
adjusting it so the very first thing we
want to do is set the size of the window
do you want it fullscreen do you want it
a thousand by a thousand well let's go
ahead and do that right now app GC dot
set display mode and the display mode is
pretty much the size of it it takes
three arguments the first two arguments
are link length and width which is 640
and I'll just make this a small one for
demonstration 360 whenever you make a
real one you may want it like fifteen
hundred by a thousand or something but
you know since I'm filming this on
YouTube I want it small enough so you
guys can see and this last one is false
this last one is actually I wonder if it
will pop up right here oh I know it
doesn't tell you that parameters but
this selection is actually if you want
it full screen um then it's not gonna be
false
we don't want this full screen we only
want a small so false it is so the last
thing that we need to do in terms of
creating the window is we actually need
to start the window or pretty much
create it on the screen now in order to
do this yeah GC which is basically the
window itself
start rate like that with empty
parameters so to recap one last time
anytime that we want to make a window
that's going to hold our game we need to
put it in the main method now the first
thing we do is create an object and then
we create a try-catch statement because
that's what slick recommends now in
order to create the window itself say
what game you're gonna be putting inside
the window how BIG's the window gonna be
and start basically just creates it
basically so that is how you create a
window in guys check it out we are
actually done with this class for now at
least but man before we have to create
or before we can test this out we got a
couple errors which says you know what
you told me that you had two states you
told me that you had a main menu and a
play screen and you know what Bucky you
didn't you freaking lied to me so I
guess you know if we don't want Eclipse
to get mad at us in the Java gods that's
what we have to do in the next video
we're gonna be creating the main menu
and the play classes so guys it's gonna
be awesome
and I'll see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
