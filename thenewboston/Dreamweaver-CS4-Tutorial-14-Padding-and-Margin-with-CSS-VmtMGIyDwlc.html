tutorial on CSS in this tutorial we are
going to be going over the difference
between padding and margin this is a
very important concept to understand
when you're dealing with CSS when I
first started I did get a few times i
would get confused between what the
difference between padding and margin is
but after this tutorial you will
understand it alright so let's click on
the p2 text class and let's go to block
actually go to box and here we're going
to see a few options we're going to say
width and height and float and clear but
we're interested in for right now is
padding and margin so let's first let's
give it a padding of 10 pixels and a
margin of 10 pixels we're also going to
give it black background color and a
white color so just in case you can
catch that click on background change
the background color to black and then
click on type and the change the color
white then click apply all right so say
ok and I'm going to edit undo so you
guys can see the difference here i'm
going to edit into and then i'm going to
redo and what you'll notice is that it
scoots over to the left 10 pixels and it
also adds some space right here
so what is happening is there's a margin
of 10 and the margin is this white space
right here and then there's the padding
and the padding is actually what's
inside the paragraph it it has nothing
to do with what with what's going on
outside of the Mira graph to show you
that i'm going to change the padding to
20 and click down here and you can see
that inside it just crushed everything
in a little bit more and now i'm going
to change the padding which is going to
affect the business sitting on the
outside so change it to 20 there we go
you can see it moved over even more and
so basically the difference between the
margin and the padding is you think of
margin as being outside of the paragraph
and you think of padding as being inside
and hopefully that makes sense to all of
you if not make sure to leave some
comments if you have any questions about
the beginner CSS feel free to ask and
hopefully I can answer it as soon as
possible thanks for watching the
beginner tutorial and I will now be
doing some advanced tutorials and you
can follow those too thanks for watching
