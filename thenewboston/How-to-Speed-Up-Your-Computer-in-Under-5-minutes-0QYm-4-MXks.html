tutorial and how to speed up your
computer or real quick so everyone has
been asking me how do you speed up your
basic computer operations and everything
like that so I'm gonna give you guys a
couple of short tips on showing guys how
to speed everything up and I believe
this is the same for Vista next piece so
uh pay attention and by the end of it
your computer should be performing a
little better first thing you're gonna
want to do is go to your Start panel and
go to all programs and from here you
want to go up to accessories and go to
system tools now in system tools you're
gonna have a whole range of stuff that
you can use to a speed up your computer
the first thing that you're gonna want
to do is go to disk cleanup and this is
gonna run through your hard drive and
clear it out of any unwanted or and
unnecessary files now you don't have to
really worry about Windows like
accidentally deleting in your pictures
or any of your program files or anything
like that because it's not gonna do that
the only thing it's gonna look for is
like temporary Internet files or old set
up files that you don't use anymore and
it's probably gonna empty the files in
your cycling bin and stuff like that so
go ahead and uh this is what this disk
cleanup does I'm not gonna press her
else it's going to start on me and not
want that the other thing that you want
to do in here is defragment your hard
drive now you don't have to worry about
this messing up or ruining your system
what this does is pretty much take all
the files and programs on your hard
drive and they're usually whenever you
load a program or something or install
it it usually puts it in your hard drive
in a bunch of different pieces and
whenever you load it your computer has
to go to each different space come over
here get some of your program files go
to another split space get some more go
to another space what it's going to do
is pretty much push it all together so
your computer doesn't have to look all
around your hard drive for those files
and it can just go to one space and it's
gonna be able to access that data a lot
faster
so remember this cleanup and disk
Defragmenter I know they might be scary
because you never heard of them before
but trust me they're not gonna ruin your
computer it even says the fragments your
discs so that your computer runs faster
and more efficiently so these are two
things that you want to do at least once
a month another thing that you might
want to do in it's gonna make a huge
difference especially if you surf the
Internet is get something that destroys
spyware spyware is like the king of
slowing down your computer so I got web
brew antivirus and this is one of the
best spyware killers out there users
submit all the spyware they find and
this just sweeps it all away from your
computer it's easy to use I recommend
getting Webroot again anti antivirus and
anti-spyware it's excellent program and
that keeps your computer up-to-date so
those are three things real quick that
you can do to get rid of any spyware on
your computer and also speed up the
performance and again if you don't want
to go out and buy this it's only like 20
bucks or something search for an anti
spyware or a spyware remover on Google
or download comm or something and I'm
sure there are a bunch of free ones out
there so again those are just some real
quick hints in on my first tutorial on
how to speed up the performance of your
computer so go ahead and do that and I
hope you learned something thanks for
watching and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
