29th java game development tutorial and
in this tutorial we are going to be
going over more of the key listener
class and what actually means and what
we can do with it and when we
implemented the key listener class it
gave us pretty much access to the user
information via the keyboard now when we
implemented this key listener class we
need to implement three methods and
these methods are pretty much the things
that you can do with a keyboard so there
are pretty much two different things
that you can do it or keyboard you can
press buttons and that's a method and
you can release buttons that's method
now there's one other method in this
that's called key typed and that has it
has to do with when you are giving the
typing action like clicking it real
quick but we're just pretty much going
to do nothing with this because it's
useless in games like 99% of time it's
just there because a they could put it
in there so why not so the first method
we have access to since we implemented
this key listener is we made a promise
that we're going to use this method
called key pressed so let's go key
pressed right there so let's go ahead
and name public void key pressed and
what this method does is it's going to
take a key event object key event in
that event is you pressing a key on your
keyboard so whenever you have e that
means the button press down it's pretty
much the event that happens so now what
this method says is all right whenever
you press a button on your keyboard this
is the method I'm going to call because
that's what I know how to do so whenever
you implement this key listener class
you have a method that pops up whenever
you press a button down this is the code
I want to happen so since we got to the
code let's give that something to do
well the key code first of all well let
me go ahead and type this line then my
Morse's inte key code equals e dot git
key code right there now let me give you
a little background information every
key on your keyboard has a key code and
this is kind of a weird way your
computer recognizes the keys on your
keyboard and actually my next kind of
line will be a lot easier the first
thing we're going to want to do is note
when they press down the escape key so
let me go ahead and I'll show you all
these key codes so let's go ahead and
put if that key code if the key press
down if key code is exactly equal to key
event dot where is VK underscore and
here is pretty much all the key codes
its VK underscore and they have some
weird things like n would be the N Z
would be the Z button on your keyboard
um undo uh they have things like alt tab
and let's just go ahead and make the one
for the escape ESC a.p.e
so this right here is the key code for
escape
so if key code is exactly equal to
escape so let me run you guys through
for a quick what's going to happen it's
going to take a key event whenever you
press down the button and that button is
going to be stored pretty much is e so
every button has a code and the code for
the escape button is VK underscore
escape and so you're going to say
alright if the button you press down if
that key code is equal to the escape
button so if you press down the escape
button what do you want to do well what
we want to do is pretty much just stop
our entire program and if you're
wondering all right why did I call the
stop method right here and we didn't go
to stop method in this class yet we'll
remember we inherited from this chord
class which pretty much gave us all
these methods and since we did we were
able to call this stop method right here
and all it does is set running equal to
false and what that would do is in our
game loop while you put while true or
while running it would set while false
and it would stop running this entire
code so that is pretty much all we have
to do for right there and that's just
pretty much saying all right if the
button you press down if the key code is
equal to the escape button then stop the
program but what do we want to do if the
button is not equal to the key code so
let's go ahead and make else for if you
press down anything besides the escape
button what do you want to do well first
of all let's go ahead and change our
message because that's pretty much what
we're here for
let's go ahead and pressed and put
semicolon because it looks nice and now
after this you can just add a little
plus key event dot get key text and key
code right there and what this is going
to do is it's going to what get key text
means is pretty much well you'll see
it's pretty much simplicity for if you
press them the J bun it's going to say
pressed H if you press down L is going
to go press L and that's pretty much the
key text and as a parameters you want
your key code of course and we set that
equal to the key code right here which
is pretty much your button anytime I say
key code it pretty much means your
button just key code is what your Java
calls it and the last thing we need to
do that's the only weird thing is
consume our keys now here's what consume
means and don't forget to put it on a
which is your bun what consumed means is
sometimes when you're working with your
keyboard and stuff aside from tab you
can also get some weird things with like
alt and stuff like that and what alt
does is if you remember in some
applications if you put all F or all C
or alt something like all F would make
the file appear so some keys can be used
in combination with other keys to do
something weird
and we don't want our computer program
to be waiting for other key combinations
that happen what we want to do is say
alright when you press alt it's an alt
when you press T it's T when you press F
it's an F so instead of for waiting for
other combinations of buttons and stuff
like that it just takes the button you
pressed which is the e and it just
consumes it so it says all right this is
e I'm going to eat it what up I'm going
to eat it up what's next
alright this is all I'm going to eat it
up what's next so that's pretty much
what consume does that's the only other
weird thing we have to go over for now
so that's all you get for this tutorial
there are two other methods we implement
again like I said whenever you press
them a key Java is automatically going
to call this key pressed method right
here and what it does is it takes the
buttons code it checks if it's the
escaped if it is it's going to stop your
program and if it's not it's going to
print out a little message that says you
pressed that button and then just going
to eat the button right up and not wait
for another combination or anything like
that so since we have key pressed we
need to give it an event when you
release the key and also we need to take
care of that other key type in last but
not least we need to do our draw method
to draw that message on the screen so
thank you guys for watching don't forget
