slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
taking a look at the properties toolbar
right here so let's go ahead and take a
look at what we've created from the last
tutorial you can see here that we have
form 1 let's go ahead and make this a
bit bigger here and you can see that
when we select form 1 that a properties
window comes up now there's a lot of
stuff you can do in here first off
there's the name and just like anything
else any buttons or lists or labels you
want to have a name for your form that's
going to be easy to remember
if you're going to be using more than
one form so we'll just call this one
main form okay so you can see that we've
got a bunch of options right here I'm
just going to go ahead and cover some of
the most important ones than the ones
that you're going to use so here we have
the back color where you can change the
color of the back of your form so let's
make this a bit bigger so you can see
what I'm talking about we can change it
to button shadow and you can see that
you got a whole bunch of options down
here under the system tab now we can
also take a look at the web tab which
has some other other colors that you
will find often on the web that's why
it's called the web tab now it has a
whole bunch of colors and we can also go
to the custom tab where we can select
one of these and create our own colors
so here we can have the background red
or we can do white so let's just go
ahead and change this back to button
face now we can also select a background
image now we can use the radio button
local resource and we can click import
and it'll go ahead and let us select a
picture so I'll just go ahead and go to
my desktop and we'll use a picture here
from my
YouTube page and we'll just go ahead and
click okay and you can see here that it
sets the background to that now let's go
ahead and remove that we can go ahead
and click clear here and then click OK
and you can see that the background
image is gone now we can select from
various options whenever we put a
background image on we can have a tile
Center stretch or zoom now let's scroll
down a little bit you can set the text
of that in the color of the text that's
going to be in your text box you can
select the icon so let's just go ahead
and use this icon and I'm going to use
this icon in one of the tutorials coming
close to the end where we're going to
create a favourites viewer you can set
the form boarder sock style which is
sizable at the moment you can set it to
fix 3d fixed single and basically what
that means is that they can't resize it
like this it won't let them you can
select fix tool window which won't let
them minimize or maximize they have to
either close out of it or just ignore it
their sizable tool window where they can
change the size of it there's a sizable
and let's go ahead and look at some more
of the properties you can set it to
maximize box true or false so as to
prevent them from maximizing the box and
you can see that when we run this
program let's say if we wanted to
maximize it it wouldn't scale up the
buttons properly or anything else and it
will just make it look ugly so if the
buttons aren't going to auto size then
you may want to set minimize maximize
box to true now you can also select
minimize box to allow them to minimize
it or not you can change the opacity so
let's change it to 50 and if we go ahead
and run this you can see that our forum
is almost see-through you can change the
size you can do it through the
properties or you can just do it by
dragging one of these dots right here
you can change the text of it so we can
just type hello world here and you've
got what's called the transparency key
so if we go ahead and select something
like this green this lime green and come
up here and change the back color to
that same color you can see what we get
let's go ahead and change the opacity
back to 100% so if we go ahead and run
this you can see that it gives us a form
that is completely clear except for the
button and the surrounding the title bar
and the surrounding edges so when we
click say hello it works perfectly fine
so there's a lot of stuff that you can
do in the properties I really I highly
suggest that you play around with those
see what you can do and just try out
some new things you can take a look at
the button properties and mess around
those and once you've done that a little
bit go ahead and move on to the next
