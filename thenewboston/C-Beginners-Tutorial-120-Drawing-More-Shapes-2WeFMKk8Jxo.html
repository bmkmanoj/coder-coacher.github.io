tutorial that I'm making for them in
Boston and in this tutorial on the
continue showing you how to draw two
more shapes and that will be the pie and
the polygon so this tutorial you just
going to need to have a panel and an
event or when someone clicks ahead let's
just go to that so just like in the
previous tutorial we have to create a
new solid rock which will just be the
color that we're going to fill our
polygon with and our pie so I'll just
make it be blue I guess alright and just
like before we're going to create new
graphics quality G and just for women f
to set equal to and a1 dot create
graphic so that we can draw what we want
on this panel so in order to draw a
graph which is the burger of Pi which is
the first thing I'm going to do we're
going to do G dot bill and then pie and
a pie is basically just a pie graph if
you're some of those like it's like hard
to explain this of a circle and there's
all the different categories inside of
it so that's pretty much that
so first thing we have to do here is
pass through the rock so it's gonna pass
through
SP for a solid brush and the next is the
x-coordinate where it was again I'll
just make it 23 now by 20 and the width
I'll just make it 60 by 60 or so to see
it then these next two things is the
start angle and that basically mean the
angle at which your pie is going to
start drawing so if you make it 0 it'll
start like right here you can imagine
that a pie look around this would start
like right there and if you made it like
I don't know 90 or something then it
would start or vertical so see what I
mean I will just make a deal for right
now for the star
right there and the smooth angle is
basically how much it will sweeper out
and if we make it 180 you will just have
a half circle that looks like this and
if we made it like 270 we would have a
circle that has like a chunk missing out
of it so it looks like that so I'm just
going to get to 72 the second part to
like explain it but yeah so you'll just
do anything so yeah that's like a pie so
yeah if this is 270 so it starts here
and then sweeps 270 degrees around here
so you get 3/4 of the circle and
obviously if we made a 180 or half a
circle yep and if we messed with the
start angle so if we and start angle 90
yeah it starts right there and then
sweeps around this way we'll just always
keeps around clockwise and the next
thing that we're going to drawing is a
polygon and a polygon calls for
obviously of raw speed and it also calls
for points and these points will be
where it will start so we would have to
make three points for a triangle so at
one up here one out here and over here
so we're going to create an array of
points so I was going to say point call
it points and we're just going to create
two new ones here I'll just do three so
new pony and I'll say zero and funky um
Chanel started yeah 0:28
then you point zero zero and then new 20
and it just works how I planned it we
will see a right triangle and I'm really
bad like putting in numbers here and
then if doing what I actually wanted to
but I could yeah perfect a right
triangle and you can obviously mess
around with these if you want to make
different things like if we wanted to
make there be like a square or something
then we will just add another point here
so if you wanted to make it be like a
six sided figure then you have six
points here and so on I'll decide
another point on to make a square I
think this will make a square yeah
square all right so that's pretty much
it for this tutorial so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
