video and this is actually probably
going to be a real quick video because I
actually just want to make this because
I forgot to tell you one important thing
about formatting I probably should have
mentioned this in the last video but
like I said I forgot so open up this
example again baseball salaries actually
open up any example it doesn't really
matter and go ahead and start formatting
some cells so we'll just change this
background to I don't know just like
this like puke brown color and I don't
know maybe we'll bold the cells and
change the text color to white why not
so anytime we want to take this styling
or formatting and apply it to another
cell what we can do is actually just go
to those cells and do the same exact
thing that we just did or we can use
this little tool right here this is
called the format painter and how do you
use it is basically this select a cell
that you want to copy the formatting
from and then click the format painter
so now as you can see your little cursor
turns into a little paintbrush so
basically your paint bucket is this
format so what other cells you select
now it copies the format from whatever
you have selected so again select a cell
click the format and as you can see
there's marching ants around that format
this means whatever you paint this
format is going to be applied to those
cells so paint boom good to go now since
this is such a short video I'll show you
guys one other cool kind of random tip
and that is how to protect your workbook
with a password so you want to do this a
lot whenever you're working with like
sensitive tax information or maybe
you're just making any spreadsheet and
you don't want anyone else to see it
because I mean it's longer their
business so what you can do is if you go
to file we'll say that I don't know
maybe I work for a baseball team and
this file right here has like
all the players salaries and of course
that's private information it's not
really its public anyone in the world
can look at it but will say that it's
private for this example and I have to
protect it so no one steals it so I'm
going to go to file and in this info tab
right here you're going to see a button
that says protect workbook that means
that you can put a password on your
workbook so you have to enter at any
time someone tries to open this file so
if you click it the option for that is
encrypt with password and as you see the
description require a password to open
this workbook that's what we want so of
course what we need to give it is a
password I'll just type apples okay and
ask you to re-enter it just to make sure
that you didn't accidentally hit a key
and you're giving locked out of your own
notebook and also as you can see it says
if you forget the password
it can't be recovered this isn't like um
an email or an account on a website
where you can just send it to your email
if you forget so make sure to write it
down and actually remember it so hit OK
and now this workbook which includes
every stylesheet in here or every
worksheet is now protected so if I close
out um I'll go ahead and save this
alright so now dududu I'm someone using
Bucky's computer I don't know maybe like
my little sister's using my computer I'm
just going to go to base flow wonder it
this is I hope there's no sensitive info
in here oh there's a password she can't
get to it she tries the heck she thinks
my passwords tuna but it's not a nice
try house and of course just to show you
guys that it does work if I am working
with it and I actually type in apples
then there you go
so pretty sweet that is how you use the
format painter and also how you protect
workbooks with passwords I know it's
kind of two unrelated topics but you
know it's kind of like a bonus tutorial
so for now as always thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
if you guys have any question
at all make sure to ask me on my form I
will be glad to answer them for you so
uh well until next video I'll see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
