third kind of nonlinear graph which is
called an ellipse so this is the
standard form of ellipse an ellipse X
minus K squared over a squared plus y
minus H over B squared equals 1 so we're
KH is your Center so for this equation
we have x squared over a squared plus y
squared over B squared equals 1 so for
this particular ellipse we have a center
at 0-0 its major axis is going to lie
along the x axis because we know that 2
is greater than B if B was greater than
to these I mean then two then a then
these two would be switched and its
major axis has a length of 2a and it's
minor axis has a length of to be that
probably won't make much sense now but
we're going to do an example so we have
x squared plus y squared x squared over
9 plus y squared over 4 equals 1 so a is
equal to you have to remember that this
is a squared and this is B squared so I
is equal to the square root of 3 b is
equal to 2 ok so for this one since a is
greater than B because nine is in fact
greater than for its major axis is going
to fall along the x-axis and its length
is going to be to a so the length of
this is going to be 6 so since the
center is at 0 0 I'm gonna just do that
and label that center so it's major axis
so
it's gonna go six in this direction and
six in this direction or no excuse me
it's going to go three in this direction
and three in this direction okay so it's
going to go one two three one two three
it's minor axis is going to be the y
axis because b is less than a and it's
going to be the length of to be it's
going to be the length of two times two
so it's going to go up to this way and
down to this way and if we connect the
points we get this oval shape because
since a and B are not equal it's always
going to look like an oval with one of
the axis is being bigger than the other
so now we're going to do X minus 3
squared over 25 plus y minus 4 squared
over 16 so first we're going to find out
what a so a is equal to 5 b is equal to
4 since a is greater than B our major
axis is going to be the x-axis and it's
going to have a length of two times five
so 10 our minor axis I'm going to put my
I from minor axis it's going to be along
the y axis and it's going to have a
length of two times B which is eight so
our Center this time instead of being at
0 0 it's going to be at if you remember
this is y minus K X minus K Y minus H
and our center is always KH so our
center is going to be three four so 1 2
3 up 12
34 and I'm going to have to add some
lines here because I'm going to run out
of room ok so its major axis is going to
go five to the right one two three four
five to the right and five to the left
so one two three four five it's minor
axis is going to go two up and two down
and our ellipse our ellipse is gonna
look like that and I know it's a really
bad ellipse it looks really bad that's
because i'm not using real graph paper
if you're at home and you're using real
graph paper your ellipses should come
out very egg like it should look like a
perfect egg so that's actually all we're
going to do with ellipses today make
sure you come back and we're going to go
over our last kind of nonlinear equation
which is called a hyperbola</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
