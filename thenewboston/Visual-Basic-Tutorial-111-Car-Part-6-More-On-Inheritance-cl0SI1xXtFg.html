slash on live gamer for the New Boston
in this tutorial we're gonna be looking
more at the car program now if you
remember from the last tutorial we
looked at inheritance and we're gonna be
focusing mostly on inheritance in this
tutorial and if none of this makes any
sense to you and you don't know what
code is on my screen right now then you
might want to go back and start from the
beginning of the car series so if you
remember we created this sports car that
inherits from car and we added weight
and get sports info so everything that
we can use in car we can use in our
sports car so let's come over here to
form on BB and you can see here we've
got show car info now we can show the
sports info or we can also just do two
string and now let's go ahead and run
this and see what kind of output we get
so we get show info info info we get the
car name which is nothing the color red
the number of doors is five and the
speed is zero now this is exactly the
same as it is in the car class you can
see that we have overridden the two
string function and how did have we have
it output the name the color and the
number of doors and it will work with
any other class that inherits from car
now we can also access any of these
other methods and functions so let's go
ahead and do that we'll go ahead and
change this back to dot show let's do
what was it called
the get sports car info
or get sports info okay so now will we
have them set the name of the car let's
just go ahead and use default sports car
now we could change this I mean not
change this we could put these into
other methods so that we don't have to
continues to change the code we can just
change the arguments send something else
to the arguments and we'll do that later
on but for now we're gonna be focusing
on inheritance so the evil sports car
car name and it's going to enter the
name of the car and that is a public
variable the car name so that we can
access it directly and we don't have to
make a property for it we could set the
color too so let's do default sports car
dot color and it will store the color
and that in color is a public variable
I'll skip the show info and we'll do
default sports car dot number of doors
and the number of doors is a property I
think yeah right here we've got the
number of doors property and just sends
back the end number of doors which is a
private variable so go ahead and
collapse that and we've got default
sports car dot number of doors and then
we get whatever they type in and convert
it to an integer so we'll go ahead and
minimize that and we've got accelerate
so we'll just change that to be false
sports car dot accelerate and I don't
know why we have that right there but
let's go ahead and minimize that so now
let's go ahead and run this and see what
we get if it compiles successfully we've
got our normal form we can set the name
of it so for our sports car let's do a
Camaro SS go ahead and click OK we'll
set the color to let's say orange
it okay their doors obviously - and
let's accelerate it by let's do a 140
miles per hour and then we will show the
info so we've got our Camaro SS our
color orange we've got two doors the
speed is 140 miles per hour we got 500
horsepower and the weight is 1,000
pounds and now we didn't even have to
write any code for our sports car class
because it's all inherited from car now
let's go ahead and show car info we'll
just do two string here and see what
kind of output we get from doing the
same thing so go ahead and run this so
the name - Camaro SS click OK set the
color to orange set the doors to two
will accelerate it to a hundred and
fifty miles per hour and then we'll show
the info we get the Camaro SS orange
color two doors and the speed of the car
and two string is pretty much the
showing the default stuff of the car
that every car would have so the speed
the doors and the color and the name and
every car has a horsepower and a weight
but for sports cars that is particularly
important it wouldn't be important for
say a minivan so we'll just go ahead and
click OK so if you haven't typed in this
code already go ahead and do that and
then once you understand this and you're
starting to understand inheritance go
ahead and move on for the next tutorial
and we're gonna be working more on the
car program</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
