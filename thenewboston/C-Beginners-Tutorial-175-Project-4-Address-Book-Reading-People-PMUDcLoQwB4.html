tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial we're going
to continue working in our address book
project and basically what we're going
to be doing is reading all of the people
that we've stored in our XML file so
we're going to have it do this one the
form loads so the first thing that we're
going to want to do is create a new XML
document since we're going to be reading
all the people so to say XML document x
stock equals the new XML document and
then we're just going to want to load
the XML document that we created so
we're going to say X doc load and you
can just say Pat since we've created a
path up here I'm going to say in the
path applause and then that have the XML
file which is inside of our address book
folder and then it's called settings.xml
all right and now we basically want to
loop through every single person node
and create a new person install it all
the information that's in here so we're
going to say kori XML node X node in and
then we just want to retrieve all the
nodes inside as people note right here
so we're going to say X talk dot select
nodes and then we're just going to want
to give the path to that person though
all those person nodes so we're going to
say people slash person if there are
multiple person goes alright so now each
time it loops through here we basically
just want to create a new person and
then we're going to add it to this
people list and then we're just going to
create a new item to add to this list
view so you can select all of the people
you added previously so first we're
going to want to create a new person
here so let's say person P Mutual's a
new person and now we're just going to
want to set all the properties of that
person like your name and stuff so it's
going to have to read that so we're
going to say kita name equals and then
we're going to want to select a node in
this person note in the first note that
we want to select is their name and then
we're going to want to get the inner
text of this to retrieve the person's
name so we're going to want to say X
node dot select single node and then
we're just want to select on that name
node so I want to select name and then
we're going to line it the inner text of
that to retrieve person's actual name so
we'll get atom for the first person ID
and then we just want to repeat this
process for all the different properties
so we want to set the email equal to the
email sort is going to read out the
email node then further address is going
to say from the address node and
property is called street address and
then finally for the additional notes
and we just called that node notes all
right so now we have ones for all the
text properties but what about for their
birthday remember we stored it in this
big number called file time number well
what we're going to have to do is
convert it back into a date time so I'm
going to say P dot birthday equals and
then we're still going to want to get
the text inside of here so that we can
convert it into date time so go ahead
and copy this right here and I want to
select the birthday node and yep we want
to get the inner text of it so we can't
just leave with that since it has to be
converted into a date time so I'm going
to say date time dot from file time and
it calls for a long in here so we're
basically just going have to convert
this string that we read into a long so
to do that we're just going to use the
convert class so convert dot two in 64
and remember in 64 is the same as a long
so basically just converting this text
right here into a long or a 64-bit
integer all right and now that we've
created this person we can go ahead and
add it to this people list or this
person will stop here so we can say
people oops
people add and then we've had that first
one just created Sookie and then we're
going to want to create new ListView
item and at this list view for that
person's name so we're going to say list
b1 items add and now we're going to want
to add that person's name and that would
be P dot name alright so now let's just
go ahead and test this out make sure
that it works so now I'm going to be bug
here we get all the people that we
created previously now if we were to
just create another person here like say
I don't know
yo email address let's make a Jo at
gmail.com cute address is that him and
his birthday is say January first two
thousand two thousand and then
additional notes will be there are all
right so now let's just add this person
Jo close it out open it back up and Jo
should still be there
yep with all his correct information jo
his birthday is correct there are none
there are no notes it's full name is Jo
and they're all right so that's pretty
much it for this tutorial so see you
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
