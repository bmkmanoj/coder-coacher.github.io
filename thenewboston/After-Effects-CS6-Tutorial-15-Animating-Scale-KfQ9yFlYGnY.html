right-click on a value and click on edit
value and then that brings this up where
you can basically use these drop down
menus to scale I don't really use this
too much I feel like you can do almost
the same thing in in the twirl down menu
here so that's just a another way if
you're more comfortable that way then be
my guest and use it that way and one
last way to to precisely increase or
decrease your scale if you click on your
object and hold ctrl on Windows and
command on a Mac and press the plus key
it will increase by 1% same a few press
ctrl and the minus key will go down by
1% so those are the ways that you can
easily scale those are all the ways that
I know and they work really well just
remember that the hotkey for scale is s
and that'll help out a lot so you don't
have to go twirling down all the time
and now I'm animating with scale is
pretty much the same as adding a medium
width position or opacity so you click
on the stopwatch here and then I'll move
move up to about 1 second I got it right
on one second awesome and justing say we
increase this go to 150
move to two seconds here somewhere
around to two seconds and then we can do
preset back to let's go to 50 great and
I can see that it's girls correct
it'll just scale up and down just like
animating anything else it's pretty easy
now you can also go into negatives in
your scale so let's let's go over to
this one where we went to negative and I
like K or I'll move my current time
indicator and hold shift it snap onto
the keyframe you know it's on the
keyframe when this over here is
highlighted so let me move one frame off
look it's not highlighted anymore using
page up and page down to move by one one
frame so now I'm on the correct frame
and let's go to negative fifty and watch
what happens
now it'll flip and rotate you can see
that
it goes down to nothing and then flips
on both accesses flips on the X&amp;amp;Y so
it's facing the other way and upside
down as you can see so let's delete
those key frames if you want to set your
reset your scale back to 100% without
typing and that a hundred percent let's
change this down to 50 real quick and
it's not a hundred percent you can go up
to the tools panel and make sure your
object is selected go up to the tools
panel and double click on the arrow and
oh I reset it back to a hundred percent
and those are the basics of scaling it's
scaling isn't really too hard it's good
for remember it's good to flip on the
axis when you go into axis when you go
into negatives and just to make your
image bigger or smaller and also
remember that most of the time you don't
want to individually change one of the
axis points you want to strain it
proportionally so none of this sure if
you squeeze the Pepsi logo or the New
Boston logo to like this the client
won't be too happy so I always hold
shift and then you can scale
proportionately
so I hope you guys enjoyed the tutorial
I look forward to seeing you guys at the
next one and have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
