distance formula and the distance
formula finds the distance between two
points so we have this point x1y1 x2y2
and that's what we just substitute in
for the two points we're trying to find
the distance between so distance is
equal to the square root of x2 minus x1
squared plus y 2 y 1 minus y1 squared so
we're going to do some examples so we
have this square root of
okay so the square root of two minus x1
squared plus y2 minus y1 squared so when
we solve this first we're going to do
what's in parentheses first so 2 minus 6
is negative 4 squared plus 1 minus 4 is
negative 3 squared so when we square a
number we get 16 plus 9 and then equals
the square root of 25 which if you
remember is one of our perfect squares
and it equals 5 and technically it
equals plus or minus five but if you
think about it you can't have a negative
distance there can't be a negative
distance between this point and this
point it has a distance so we kick out
that negative answer and we only take
the positive one so it's pretty easy but
we're going to do some more examples
just to be sure so we have the square
root of x 1 minus y 1 or x 1 plus y2
minus y1 squared so when you subtract a
negative you're really adding a positive
so that two plus three is six 6 squared
is 36 plus 5 when you subtract a
negative you add a positive so plus 10
squared which is a hundred so the square
root of 136 and remember we only want
the positive answer we're going to do
one more example here
square root of negative 3 minus 9
squared plus 4 minus 8 squared the
square root negative 3 minus 9 gives us
negative 12 squared is 144 plus 4 minus
8 is negative 4 negative 4 squared is 16
so and if you add those together you get
the square root of 160 so that's all for
the distance formula make sure you come
back and watch the next lesson where we
go over the midpoint formula</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
