video what I want to do is show you guys
in an additional way that you can export
modules and they're actually a couple
different ways but this is one of the
more common ones so I figured if you
ever saw the syntax then it wouldn't you
know throw you off so we've learned
before that anytime we want to export a
bit of code from a module then we use
this module that experts variable and we
gave pretty much our variable custom
name and value which in this case was
equal to a function now just like before
if we wanted to say export this chappy
function as well then we can give it a
name of chappie and that would be equal
to print Chaffey simple enough now this
may be kind of confusing and you may be
looking at this saying okay this is kind
of repetitive because we're typing our
code right here and then we have to go
ahead and pretty much type it all again
whenever we say we're going to export it
would it be better if we had a more
efficient way of doing this well check
this out I'm going to delete this code
actually let me leave right there for
right now all right so to clear things
up let me explain it like this this
module that exports this is actually an
object and in every single file that you
create it actually has a module Dodd's
 bit it actually has a module
that exports object by default so again
whenever you first create a module what
nodejs does is it throws this in even
though you know it's kind of behind the
scenes and it sets this equal to a blank
object so what we were doing in the last
tutorial is we're pretty much adding
name and value pairs to this object so
then whenever we wanted to import it it
goes and it looks for this object and
whatever is inside it
in this case avatar in print chapter
function then that's how it knows what
it wants to export or import if you're
looking at it from the other point of
view however since we know that now what
we can actually do instead of
just writing our functions and then
saying we want to export them one by one
we can actually write our functions
directly inside this object so how do we
do that well check it out of course
every function and we can also export
variables to just like a JSON object it
has a name value pair so if we want to
make that print avatar function we would
just call it something like print avatar
and set it equal to an anonymous
function and it'll just be a console log
and I'll just write the name haveth are
too lazy to type all the ratings and
stuff all right so again what this would
do is essentially the same exact thing
we could use actually let me just go
ahead and demonstrate this right now so
now what we're doing is we're saying
this is the code that we want to export
pretty convenient because we only had to
write this function one time so now we
can just say movies print avatar and
check it out it would print out avatar
now we can also do this with additional
functions let's say we had a couple
functions in here maybe print chappie
chappie we can use that as well and also
let me clean this up a little bit and
also if we just wanted to export plain
variables so say that we had a variable
called like favorite movie or fav movie
and we set this equal to like like the
matrix then we can do that as well so
again what we're saying right here is
any code inside this object is what gets
exported whenever we try to import it
somewhere else
so now we can just not do something like
console.log movies dot fav movie and
that'll work as well so again that's
what's going on behind the scenes
anytime they create a module it gives
you a blank module exports object by
default and you can populate it with
whatever you want fun
shin's variables whatever so hopefully
you guys understand a little bit better
and if you guys prefer this method then
you know feel free to use it so think
guys for watching don't forget subscribe
and yeah see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
