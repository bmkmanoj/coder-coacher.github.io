to use a ride she'll come on you can do
it go for the bomb you can do it come on
come on get it's right there it's right
there we've lost that food fail that guy
didn't know what she was doing this one
apparently did and there's a good
tonight and it wasn't about me oh okay
um hello if you do not know who I am my
name is Kyle and I played lots of call
of duty today I am using a blinged-out
m16 with a red dot and silencer and if
you didn't know i am using bling pro
kind of obvious stopping power ninja pro
and a blinged-out spas-12 with a red dot
and silencer I believe and I'm using
claymores and a stun grenade and stun
grenades okay um in this video I'm going
to be mostly talking about the m16 red
dot sights and holographic sights a self
debate eyes by my own opinion saying
which one's better um let's start off
talking about the m16 the m16 I would
probably say is the better burst fire
gun in this game definitely would
definitely was in call of duty 4 you
know it you don't have to be an idiot to
realize that that it was definitely and
most likely the best weapon in that game
good and call of duty for it was
basically the m16 and whatever forget
what the name of the first sniper rifle
is I know it's the second ones are 700 I
just can't remember the name of the
other one um and I'm actually going to
talk about really quick the famas versus
the m16 the from they both had do have
their ups and downs the famas a strong
point is that it has whose epic fail
right there the famas is strong point is
that it has a would be a very good or
very fast rate of fire while the m16 has
a slow I'm not going to say slow but
slower rate of fire the famas is
downside to its downside is the fact
that it does less damage bullet and
purple it so it takes if you're going to
miss a full burst into a person it's
most likely you're most likely going to
have uh you probably can get the second
burst out and possibly kill the person
because it shoots very fast but if you
don't get all three bullets into it the
person that's probably not going to kill
them unless it's in their head which it
would always kill them the m16 it makes
up for have in it makes up for a lot of
power that has the f16 is the powerhouse
of this game are probably one of the
powerhouses of this game when it comes
to bullet damage
m16 has does have a slower rate of fire
so the only problem that would have is
you may not be able to get the full
burst out somebody's using like and I
don't know some random submachine gun or
something like that but um that's
basically those are the only differences
besides the iron sights which is
obviously a difference between the guns
the iron sights for I'd have to say is
actually another strong point of the
loss personally I am a fan of the m16
I'm just saying um okay enough about the
m16 the mall so let's get to the iron
sights of our the sights of modern
warfare 2 the red dot sight which I
believe is the second attachment that
you get for 25 kills I believe is the
set I'd have to say is better for then
the holographic sight for multiple
reasons uh this is a personal preference
i'm not saying you shouldn't go out and
try the holographic sight though just
keep that in mind as I'm talking um the
holographic sight or the red dot sight
sorry the red dot sight um I just seem
to like it better cuz it takes up less
room on your actual screen so it's like
you're trying to kill somebody from long
range you're not going to have any
problems like there's not going to be
like a really wide gap of just of your
site they're just like blocking part of
what you're trying to see something like
that is probably have to say is the only
problem with the holographic set I mean
the yeah the hall yeah the holographic
sight um others then
um it takes up less room I'd have to say
that the red dot sight still is better
just because that one little thing could
mean whether you get a c-130 or not for
a Harrier strike or even a Duke maybe
but um enough about okay let's talk
about now that holographic sight
holographic sight um I don't really like
it it's mostly a personal preference on
that on that though um why I don't like
it it's just I think it's ugly don't
hate don't spam hate comments about this
I do think it's ugly um I don't really
like it or I just don't like the actual
thing itself just in general even a good
thing i have heard about it though which
i'm not sure if it's true or not is that
it has a slight auto aim to it the auto
aim i am not sure if it is actually true
or not but that's just something if
anybody could test or I've ever noticed
please leave a comment about that okay
and there you go a flawless game of
Search and Destroy of 7 and 0 with one
loss which being the only one I wasn't
there Kyle out
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
