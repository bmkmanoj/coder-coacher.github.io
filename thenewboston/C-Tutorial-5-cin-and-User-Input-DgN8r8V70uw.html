C++ tutorial and in this tutorial I'll
be teaching you guys how to use the C in
now as you can see in our last tutorial
we use the C out and um let's get rid of
all of this and let me tell you guys how
to use the C in which this is going to
do is let you assign the computer a
variable as you can see if I um redone
that last time we told the computer what
we wanted the variable to equal but what
if we want the user to tell us what the
variable can equal so again let's delete
that again and the first thing that we
need is a variable and let's get a new
variable it's going to be an integer
variable and I'm going to name it um
it's name it greg's
num for Greg's number so now we told C++
we want to make a variable that's
integer called Greg's num first let's
ask the user a question by saying C out
say um let's say how many do you want
so we're making a like shopping cart or
something and remember and close that in
quotation marks move this so you can see
it and end all statements with a
semicolon actually I want to put
I'm just going to put that on the same
light so I don't have to do it again now
so our program is going to read first
now how many do you want and that's it
next we're going to make the user give
the variable into this we put C in and
put the two opposite greater than signs
and then after that we put Greg's num as
you can see we already have a variable
named Greg's and num now want to ask the
question how many do you want whatever
the whatever number the user types is
going to be assigned to the variable
Greg num
Greg's num that's the same as button
Greg's num equal to 34 or 343 one
instead whatever the user types now is
going to be assigned to that variable
now let's uh just do
a basic thing to show you guys what's
actually going on here let's make
another see out function and let's just
see your new number is and on the next
line all we want to do is let's what do
you actually want to do to the number
say Greg's num equals Greg's num plus 20
because it's my favorite number
now I'm sorry that I use 20 and all of
its toriel's but it's my favorite number
so just deal with it
now what we have now to recap it's going
to ask how many do you want and whatever
number we type into the program it's
going to add 20 to that number and then
it's going to say your new number is and
again this doesn't output anything we
just changed variable and then in next
sense we want output it will say your
new number is
and then we'll put um we'll just output
dregs none and this should be good to go
I think so so let's just make let's just
end that line and let's see what we got
save it execute compile and run hope I
don't have any errors
don't look like I do
and here's our program says how many do
you want and I'm going to type six now
press ENTER and it says your new number
is 26 so look at this how many do you
want six your new number is 26 X out of
this and let's review this one last time
so it'll stick in your head we made an
integer called Greg's num and then we
asked the question how many do you want
this is just basic text doesn't have any
programming meaning next whatever number
we typed in we gave the value of Greg's
num and then we added 20 to that value
and outputted the new variable so this
is how you can use the C in function to
give data and assign a variable to
whatever the user says instead of just
making your own so this is one quick way
that you can interact with the user
using the C in so make sure to look at
this and study this and get very
familiar with this and in the next
tutorial probably going to be talking
about function so make sure to subscribe
to my channel and I hope you enjoyed my
