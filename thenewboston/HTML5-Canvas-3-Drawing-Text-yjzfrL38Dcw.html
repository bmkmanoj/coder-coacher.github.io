to change another setting or property I
guess it's called
fill style and what the fill style is is
it's basically the color of your finding
the font can actually be a pattern or
gradient but for now I just want to make
it very basic solid color and a cool
color that I like is actually deep sky
blue I know it kind of sounds like you
know a hippie emo color but you know I
tend to like even though I'm not you
know I don't think I'm a hippie email
and the next thing I want to do is I
actually want to change my stroke style
so context stroke style and remember
that I said that fill style was
basically the font color so it's the
font solid color now the stroke style is
basically the outline or the border
color of the font so for the stroke
color I want dark slate gray and you can
actually spell gray with the E or an A
depending on if you're you know British
or American or whatever so basically
what we did is aside from that little
mistake we basically referenced the
canvas in the context and change some
properties of the context or the object
we use to write on the canvas itself so
now that all the properties are shit are
set let's actually go ahead and start
drawing something drunk some text well
in order to actually draw text on the
canvas what you do is you put context
and this already knows that you're
working with this canvas because we
referenced it right here so any function
that we use like fill text automatically
gets written on our canvas so fill text
is a function that basically adds text
on the canvas now it takes three
parameters the first parameter is what
text do you want basically what do you
want it to say and I'll just go ahead
and write on what smells like tuna
now the second parameter is the second
two parameters are the X and y position
so for the x position which is left and
right let's just go ahead and put it at
30 and the Y position is 200 so 30
pixels over 200 your pixels down we want
you to write what smells like tuna so if
we go ahead and run this in launching
chrome right now that is the JavaScript
file and right here is the HTML file
what smells like tuna and what color did
I choose um oh yeah deep sky blue but
now let me go ahead and add that stroke
style or stroke text and what this is
going to do is it's going to add a
border around this so right now as you
can see we have solid deep sky-blue font
now in order to add a border around this
this is what you do I think I just
repeated the same thing twice it's
easier if we just copy this save it a
little time because I'm a little bit
lazy and instead of fill text just put
stroke text stroke text now you can
leave all the other parameters the same
in the stroke text is actually going to
be this color right here so if you save
this and refresh it check it out this is
deep sky blue and the stroke is dark
slate gray or whatever I did so that is
how you write basic text to the screen
in html5 so for now thank you guys for
watching in the next tutorial don't know
what I'm going to do I'm probably going
to play with old Dan for a little bit
but come back it's going to be awesome
and yeah don't forget to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
