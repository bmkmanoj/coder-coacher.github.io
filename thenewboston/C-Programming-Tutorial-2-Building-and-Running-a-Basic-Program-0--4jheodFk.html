story and in this tutorial we are
finally going to begin writing some code
and what we're going to be doing is
actually building a basic program and
all this program is going to do is just
output basic text of the screen but it's
very essential in understanding the
basics of how a C++ program is put
together and all the pieces you need to
have in place in order to run even the
most basic programs so there is my
introduction I hope you guys enjoyed
let's begin shall we
so the first thing that we need to do is
this hit the number sign and press I and
CLU de and move my cursor out of the way
io STR EAM and make sure it's in between
your less than and greater than sign now
what we're doing with this line of code
is again we're going to be talking about
include files and header files later on
but for those of you guys who just need
to know what we're doing is adding a
preprocessor directive in in essence
what that means is we're going to
include important files that are all are
already built into C++ and these files
are going to help us later on but for
now this line isn't really important
pretty much including files that we're
going to need later on so with that
being said let's go ahead and build our
first function before I even build my
first function let me explain you guys
what function is every single C++
program is made up of functions if you
don't have a function then you don't
have a C++ program and check this out
the main function that your computer is
going to look for is called main hmm how
convenient not the state the word ma I N
and for those of you guys who think that
ma I n is how you spell the state and ya
spell like the state but anyways let's
go ahead and build our very first
function go ahead and write int ma i N
and hit two empty parentheses now this
is pretty much called
what I say pretty much it's not pretty
much this is called the function header
but I often call it the title because
you know it's kind of like the title
here is your function name right there
main and here is the data type it
returns but we'll be covering data types
later on this pretty much is short for
integer so anyways we have a title of
the function which technically it's
called the header so now that it has a
head we need to give it a body and in
order to do that go ahead and add two
little curly brackets and some space in
between so here is the basics of how any
computer program works as soon as you
start your program it's going to look
for a function called main so that's
what we're building right here so that's
why you need to name this main because
again like I said it's the very first
function your computer is going to look
for whenever it starts running the
program and inside your function you're
going to tell your computer exactly what
to do inside of your function you're
going to have something called
statements and what a statement is is
it's pretty much an instruction so your
program is probably going to be made up
of well in this program is probably
going to be made up of the you know six
different statements or six different
instructions and these are basic
instructions of what we want our
computer program to do simple enough so
with that being said let's go ahead and
add one of these statements right now
again just like this include right here
there's something else that you
absolutely need your computer program to
have let's go ahead and add using
namespace I'll get right STD and this
means using namespace sexual transmitted
disease all right next line I'm just
kidding
all right this actually means using
namespace standard
in what this means again we're be
covering namespaces and uh you know all
this stuff later on but for those of you
guys who just need to know what this
means we're going to be using all of the
basic standard functions in our program
simple enough
alright so now we can finally begin
getting to the meat of this tutorial and
that's how to print basic text out on
the screen and this is how you do it
si o UT hit space and hit the less sign
two times and then go ahead and inside
quotation marks type whatever you want
to print out so alright my name is Bucky
and you need to end every statement with
a semicolon since whenever you give your
computer a bunch of different statements
or instructions and needs to know when
the first one is and when the second one
begins so they are all jumbled together
jumbled together so what we do is we
separate them by semicolons and we
typically put them on separate lines
this just makes it easier for the
programmer you and me to read so anyways
what we said now is my name is Bucky and
we want to output this to the screen see
out is the function that allows you to
display stuff on the screen so you know
that's all I need to say so let's go
ahead and let's go ahead and teach you
guys about one other thing and this is
how to make a new line and that's C out
of course print out to the screen and
don't put this in quotation marks per E
and DL this means end line and this is
the exact equivalent of hitting Enter or
return on your keyboard it moves your
text down a line so now that we're on
the next line of our program let's just
go ahead and now put something out so we
actually see this baby in action and
let's just go ahead and write my let's
go over and write I have an overactive
bladder and make sure you spell it wrong
or else your program is not going to
work just kidding
but anyways you're saying Bucky why tell
me about your bladder well guys if we're
going to be watching your tutorials with
me then you know we're going to have to
get to know each other so the first
thing I want you guys know about me is I
have no ver active bladder so there you
go and let's just go ahead and add one
other end line so CL end line so now we
have a program that prints out a line of
text that says my name is Bucky and on
the next line when we move down it says
I have an overactive bladder and then
just hit the enter key again that's what
it's going to look like so now we're not
exactly ready to run this program yet
what we need to do is system and in
parentheses go ahead and type pause what
this is going to do is actually pause
your program because if you don't have
this line your program is going to run
super fast and exit before I even get to
see anything at all and I'll run this
without this line to show you guys what
exactly is going on and the very last
statement or instruction we need to give
our function main is return zero and
you're saying all right what's this
return zero is just your way of telling
the main function that everything went
according to plan
check this out let me give you guys a
little preview in the future this int
means whenever we use this function it's
expecting an integer in return in built
into your computer your computer knows
already whenever it returns zero it
means everything went according to plan
so that's why it's n of all of our main
functions we return zero and that's just
our way of telling the computer
everything went according to plan
we're cool we're cool man all right so
now like I said that is our program in
order to run this here's what you need
to do execute compile and run compile
means change this code in code that we
can understand to ones and zeros
the computer can understand and run this
program so check that out my name is
Bucky I have an overactive bladder and
you can either X out of that or just hit
any button and it will X out now check
this out let's go ahead and get rid of
the system pause and see what happens
execute compile and run I don't know if
you guys saw that bit what it did is
pretty much just flashed on the screen
real quick and exited so that is why we
need that system pause right there so I
mean we're not as fast as a computer we
can't read that quick we need to pause
everything so we can actually see our
work and you know look at it take a
breath of fresh air and be proud of
something so that's why we need system
pause like I said so anyways that's all
I have for you guys for this story this
is the very basics bare-bones
of how we create a program in C++ now we
can begin going into the you know the
detailed stuff a little more you know
more about a I don't know I don't even
know what I'm saying right now what I
want to say though is if you want any of
this code then go ahead and click in the
link below and I'll save it for you guys
all on my forum so just go ahead and
copy and throw it in your program if you
guys are lazy but anyways thank you guys
for watching don't forget subscribe
don't forget to check out the next video
and I'll see you guys in later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
