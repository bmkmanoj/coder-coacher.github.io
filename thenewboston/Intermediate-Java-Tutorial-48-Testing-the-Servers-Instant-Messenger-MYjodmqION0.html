in in this video we're finally going to
be testing our server-side portion of
this chat application but before we do
that I just want to mention that in the
last tutorial whenever I was coding I
put this on able to type as a lowercase
T it actually needs to be an uppercase T
obviously so now go ahead and save this
class and if you don't have any error
messages then that means you you know
type everything successfully and if you
do then just go ahead and look at the
source code on my forum and you know
compare it and you guys can see what you
did wrong so anyways what I did now is I
made a new class called server test dot
Java and guys don't worry this is only
going to take like four lines of code
and what this is going to do is
basically going to you know run the
program so the first thing we need to do
is import one thing import Java X swing
jframe
right like that and now let's go ahead
and create a new object to access all
the crap inside the server class so
server I'll just name my object Sally
because she is a babe equals new server
looking good so now that we can access
all the stuff in the class arm we can go
ahead and kick off with that start
running method but before we do that we
obviously need to you know do some
housekeeping stuff Sally set default
close operation looks pretty good
so j-frame exit on close with free lunch
means you know make sure we close
whenever we hit the X and now the last
line of code we need for this
server-side program is Sally start
running because remember if we look at
the server class then the GUI was taken
care of in the constructor and the start
running method took care of all the
programming aspects so the GUI or the
user interface gets taken care of right
here and all the coding programming cool
stuff gets taken care of right here so
of course whenever you create a new
object that's when the constructor gets
called and we just need to run off the
brains of it in the start running object
so now hopefully that's all we needed to
do for our program to actually work so
now if I hit this button right here take
a deep breath I really hope it works
okay looking good
so here is our program right here
Bucky's instant messenger and again this
area at the top is where the user is
going to be able to type things in but
now it says waiting for someone to
connect and obviously you can't type
things in here until you are connected
to someone else because that's a nice
little safety feature that we added in
Bucky's instant messenger so now what we
have to do is we need to build another
program that's very similar to this but
instead of the server which is where
this program is going to be this one is
going to be on the client which is your
guyses computers and once we have that
program set up then what you can do is
have a connection and then start talking
to one another and it's going to be
awesome so guys we are 50% of the way
there and congratulations and guys like
I said one last time if you messed up
anything or you have any questions at
all then go ahead and go to my forum tnb
forum comm there's a link below and go
ahead and get all the source code ask
any questions about this and people will
answer you there so anyways thank you
guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe and well crack your knuckles
and ready to jump into the client-side</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
