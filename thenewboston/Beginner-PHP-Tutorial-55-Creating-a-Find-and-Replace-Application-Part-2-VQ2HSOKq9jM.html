if is set dollar underscore post the
first one to check is text then we use a
logical operator and and say if is set
dollar underscore post and search for
remember we're just referencing the
variables from here and we use another
and logical operator to now such or
check sorry if the replace with is set
okay so now we need to check where the
users have actually typed any data in
this line here will check or this
statement in here will check whether the
form has been submitted if that
evaluates to true we can start to check
if the data is empty or not so and
before we do that actually we can
actually create a shorthand way of using
these variables and this must be done
inside this if statement because if we
try to create a variable first and these
can't actually be found we're going to
end up getting an undefined index error
so text equals dollar underscore post
text if you're unfamiliar with this
terminology here if you go back and look
at the post and get tutorials you'll
understand what we're actually doing
here we're taking data from the form and
putting it into this app these are
variables here and then we want search
equals dollar underscore post search for
and it hasn't got underscore in there
and then we want replace equals dollar
underscore post and that is replace with
so let's just echo these variables out
to make sure that they that everything
is working up until now these will be
with no spaces in between so if I just
put one in there two in there and three
in there that's a really
way to check because if we click find
and replace
see that one two and three have both
been submitted through we've checked for
the form submission if we click it and
the fall hasn't submitted nothing
happens but if we do we return this data
so let's get rid of that that and that
now what we can do is check whether they
have actually typed anything in so if
not using the exclamation lock empty
text and not empty search and we use the
last hand not empty replace and do
something otherwise we want to say
please fill in all fields of the fields
so let's just type something here to
check the list check is working and when
you're going to type okay with capital
letters let's return to our index page
and type while in here we - in here and
not three in here and let's see what
happens so you can see now we've got
this error message that we've predefined
let's fill in one two again and three
again and we'll see what happens here
and we're returned with okay so we know
at this stage that our form validation
is working so inside here we can write
the code that actually is actually going
to process and return this so this
create a bit of space in here for
ourselves okay so the first thing we
need to do is we need to predefined a
variable up here called offset and this
is important with the substring function
because we once we find an instance of a
word inside our string the offset is
where we're going to search from once we
found one for example we may have the
cat sat on the cat
if we want to search for cat and replace
it with say dog or monkey as I used in
my last example it's gonna it's going to
find cat here and it's going to make the
replacement then it's going to need to
start from after this and also replace
the last instance of it and our while
loop is going to help us ensure that we
only loop through this string until no
more values have been found that have
been specified here so that's what's
going to happen now let's do it so let's
create our while loop remember a while
loop always performs this check going
into the loop as opposed to a do-while
loop which will search for the condition
at the end of the loop so we need to say
while substring I'm just calling this
giving this I felt my M variable named
substring while substring equals
substring so now we're you making use of
the function inside this while loop
substring will return zero if it can't
find anything therefore this will
evaluate to false so we need to search
inside text and we are in fact I've
completely messed this up because we're
not actually using the substring
function like I got a bit confused so
we're using the STR pause function
obviously the STR pause function is
going to return us the offset or the
location of a specific string where it
is so STR pause equals the function STR
pause researching in text we're
searching for this search value and
we're going to give we're going to
specify the offset here now because the
offset originally starts at zero
we're searching from
start of this text variable which
equates to this text here what we're
then doing is searching for what we've
specified in the form here and then when
it reaches let's say we were searching
for cat inside the cat sat on the mat
when it reaches the word cat and finds
it this STR pause variable here will be
equal to the location then what we can
do with the location is we can say well
I want this plus the amount of
characters in our search term let me
just give you an example up here so we
know what we do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
