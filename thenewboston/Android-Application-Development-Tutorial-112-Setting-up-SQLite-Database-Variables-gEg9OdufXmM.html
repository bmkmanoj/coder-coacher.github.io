Android tutorial for the new Boston what
we're going to do in this tutorial we're
actually going to set up our well maybe
I don't know how much time we're going
to have but we're going to set up our at
SQLite database now some of you guys
might not even know what SQL is or what
you know why we need a database so what
is SQLite database well basically it's a
way for us to save a lot of information
you can think of it as like a
spreadsheet like at you know Excel
spreadsheet something like that it's a
lot easier to store data data and manage
data you know pull data from your
database so that's why you want to use
databases and you can store a lot of
information it's a lot easier to
reference and all that good stuff so
let's get into it
the first thing we want to do is we want
to open our hot-or-not class this is
basically where we're going to do all of
our database stuff and we need to set up
some variables and we want these
variables to never change because we're
going to set up a database with columns
and you know stuff like that and we
don't want our column names to change
because then you know it'd be hard to
find that so what we need to do is when
you setup some values so we're going to
say public static final string and
basically we're going to use strings for
all of our database like IDs the column
names you know our database name our
table name all that stuff which I'll try
and explain as we go through this
tutorial for the most part we're
probably just going to set up our
variables in this tutorial and kind of
explain what they're going to do and
again public means that all of our
classes couldn't access this static
final means we don't want it to change
and that's final you know there's no no
arguing these variables are never going
to change and the first thing that we
want to do is we want to set up an ID so
we're going to say key underscore row ID
something like that we're going to set
this equal to be underscore ID and there
we go basically what this variable is
going to do is it's going to give us you
know the row ID every time we put
something into our database it's going
to create a row
starting at one and then the next time
we enter something into our database so
I'll be Row two Row three and we just
need a way to kind of reference that so
we're going to do do it through this
variable next thing we want to do we're
just going to copy this and paste it a
couple times
the next key that we want to have is
we're going to say he named something
like that and we're just going to set
this equal to persons underscore name
something like that again this is just
kind of a value that's going to
reference the person's name according to
you know the row ID and it's going to
get our the information from our
database and the key value is for our
name the next thing that we want to do
is we want to set up also our hotness
variable so we're going to say hotness
and we're just going to say like person
hotness I don't know something like that
again just a reference that we'll use
later next thing that we want to do is
we want to set up our actual database
the name and you know each database has
some tables within it the tables have
the rows which we set up here basically
a row each rail is going to have a name
and a hotness rating within the row but
we actually need to set up our database
now so again we're just going to hit
paste and this time we're going to say
private just so this class can access it
and we're just going to say database
underscore name and we're just going to
call this
hot or not DB something like that
that's our database name and then again
within our database we can have
different tables for this example we're
just going to have one table so I'm just
going to copy this because again we want
to be private whoops
paste it and a database underscore table
and we're going to have this be our
people table something like that and
lastly we need to give the database what
version we're working with so again
we're just going to hit oops this needs
to be private or it should be private so
copy and paste we want to give it a
version so we're just going to say
database version like this and you know
these references at the moment probably
won't mean too much we're just going to
set this equal to one and this is going
to be an int and right now again while
this we aren't using it we're just
setting everything up and we'll get into
using these variables in the next
tutorial but again what I want you guys
know when we're working with databases
we have a database name that's going to
reference our database within our
database we can store different tables
such as people table and what we're
going to do is we're going to set this
table equal to hold all these values up
here a row ID the name in that row and
the hotness in that row or value for
attractiveness so there we go we set
that up and I'll catch you guys in the
next tutorial have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
