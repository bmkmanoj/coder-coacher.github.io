headlights now actually installing the
front headlights is incredibly simple
whenever you get on pre-wired they come
in a package that looks something like
this and you also got these two plugs
right here these plugs right here are
actually plugs that plug into the back
where you would put the bolt now the
reason that you add these plugs is
because you add one on each side then
you add those before you add the bowl in
what these are pretty much a little
padding they're like a rubber feeling
and whenever you put it into your
bracket first of all it's going to fit
much more nicely and this is just to
ensure that first of all it gives you a
little bit of a turning lets you turn a
little bit for adjustments and aside
from that whenever you're tightening
your bolt if you tighten it too much
then of course this plastic would crack
but now you get a little bit of play if
you tighten it too much then it still
squeezes together a little bit before
your plastic starts cracking so it's
pretty much to protect the plastic body
so I know just go ahead and slide that
into your bracket take your bolt no
special bolt just normal one there we go
now whenever you're tightening it and
it's starting to give you pressure then
that's when you want to go ahead and
adjust it exactly how you want it and
then you can go ahead and finish
tightening it like so and then you're
going to get your position perfectly so
now your headlight is installed the only
other thing we have to do now that it's
mounted is we need to plug it into the
electrical now you can tell the
difference between your headlights and
your turn signals at least on this go
kart is because well first of all your
turn signals aren't going to be able to
plug into your headlights they have
different plugs so if you try to plug it
in it's not going to work so go ahead
and plug that in there you go it's good
tie down your slack to your frame and do
the exact same thing on the other side
and once
your headlights are installed we can now
move on to the turn signals</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
