5 I didn't get any sleep last night by
the lake there are way too many bugs
there's still a lot of bugs around me
and I would say I've been walking for
about ever since the Sun rose so about 5
hours from that direction right behind
me had to go at least a few more miles
the good news is I did get to wash my
clothes in the lake and also I brushed
my teeth
I know if you would call it brushing
your teeth but I broke off a little
stick basically and I cut the edge so it
was flat and I could clean my teeth with
it I still smell incredibly bad my teeth
feel grimy I'm not really thirsty i
boiled probably seven little pots of
water last night but uh I'm incredibly
hungry I did find out though when I was
walking alongside the lake
if you push up a rock underneath a rock
there a bunch of little earthworms under
the rocks and I could eat those little
earthworms I just swallow them like
pills
well I've been walking pretty much
uphill all day I came from down there
very steep very tiring and I want to go
up so I can get a better idea of where I
am hopefully I can look around but now I
came to this enough to figure out a way
to climb up that so I'm hoping I can go
around it because if the entire mountain
is like this homie
let me give you guys better view at the
entire mountain is like that there's no
way I'm gonna be able to climb it so
we'll see
well after walking for about three more
hours I finally reached the point where
I wanted to reach which happens to be a
massive cliff and I'm actually on the
edge of one now and even though I hate
being out here and I would pay anything
for someone to go and take me home right
now I have to show you guys this view
this is absolutely amazing so here's
what I've been climbing a huge frickin
cliff let me stand up I don't want to
stand up too much because if I fall down
here that will not be good news so
that's where I came from over in that
direction and look at this there's my
crap down there still as far as I can
see absolutely nothing but mountains and
I have no idea how some of these rocks
were made this is absolutely crazy but I
have to be very careful there freaking
little caverns everywhere you step big
rocks holes that I can fall into but
anyways this is where I'm at right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
