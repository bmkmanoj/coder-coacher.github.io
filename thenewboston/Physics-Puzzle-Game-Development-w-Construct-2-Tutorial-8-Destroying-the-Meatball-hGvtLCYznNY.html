game as promised the only thing that
we're gonna be doing is we're gonna say
when the meatball comes to a complete
stop then basically destroy it and give
me another bullet so right now we should
our Tower and we're outta bullets not
very fun so in order to do this we need
to head over to the event sheet and the
event for this or the thing we're going
to be checking for is we're gonna be
looking at the meatballs velocity so at
event meatball and this is actually
called compare under physics compare
velocity so it's gonna say it's gonna
give us a couple options for velocity
the XY or overall velocity in other
words the overall speed of the meatball
so what we want to do is we want to say
is this meatball less than or equal to
and this is where it's kind of weird 0.1
now why don't we just say is it equal to
zero well the reason that you never want
to do this whenever you're making the
game is because sometimes computers get
hung up and they store like the number 0
they treat it as a really small number
like point 0 0 0 1 so if we just put
equal to 0 even though the meatball
it'll it would appear that it's not
moving it could have an internal value
stored for velocity of like point 0 0 0
1 and the user would just look at it
back uh what do I do now so that's why
in this case you want to put less than
or equal to a value of something like
point 1 or something that's really small
set done so that's what we're looking
for and whenever this happens in other
words whenever the meatball stops moving
then what action do we want to complete
well all we want to do is destroy the
meatballs so meatball destroy so here's
the logic of this right now right now we
shoot the meatball and whenever it stops
moving or goes off the screen it gets
destroyed now whenever the meatball is
destroyed then what it does is the
cameras
grows back to the Canon and it also
makes it so you can fire another
meatball
sets it back to zero so now let's go
ahead and play this and check it out of
course like before whenever our meatball
goes off the screen we get another one
and now whenever our meatball comes to a
complete stop it disappears
automatically but I don't know if you
guys saw that but check it out it's kind
of weird because the meatball just gets
destroyed like instantly and it's kind
of a awkward like looking at it
disappear that quickly so what we can do
in order to kind of fix that is after
arm this right here after the meatball
gets destroyed well where can we put
this all right
so even though we'll move this around a
little bit what we want to do is on this
event where the meatball comes to a
complete stop do this add another action
and this is actually going to be a
system action and this is probably
easier if I just saw coat it first and
then show you guys what I'm doing so at
a system action and type wait and put
something like 1.5 and hit done and now
take this new action and if you click
and drag it you can put it right above
me Paul destroyed now all this action
does is it pretty much um it doesn't do
anything else for 1.5 seconds
so you're saying okay whenever the
meatball comes to a complete stop wait
for 1.5 seconds which gives the user a
little bit of time to realize like look
around their game and see the
destruction that they've done and then
destroy the meatball so now whenever you
play the game it just doesn't disappear
instantly straight our weights a little
bit and then the meatball gets destroyed
pretty sweet so that's what we wanted
and now we can fire another one it
doesn't disappear right now but right
then so of course we don't want
everything that happened instantaneously
or else it'll kind of mess with these or
in no games do that it's just too
confusing and that is also another
really hand
command wait so you know you're gonna
probably be using that a lot in your
game development but for now thank you
guys for watching and in the next
tutorial um well we got a few more
things to cover before this game is done
so I think guys for watching don't
forget to subscribe and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
