tutorial for you here in a Photoshop cs6
and my name is buddy Blackford we're
gonna learn about the duotone color mode
and it isn't just done' it's also
monotone tritone and quadtone so Wow
let's check that out real quick let's go
to image and the first thing you need to
do when you're about to change something
to duotone is go to greyscale and make
it a grayscale image so find your layers
press ok has to be a grayscale image
first now what the duotone does is it
adds a little bit of color and increases
like the tonal values of a grayscale
image so let's go to image mode go to
duotone and we've got these options here
we have do it monotone dual tone tritone
and quad tone now what those mean is
just think of the prefixes here mono
means one duo means to try means three
and quad means four and what it's going
to do is gonna allow you to add one
color two colors three colors or four
colors to your image now a common method
or a common use for this is to create
like a color cast or what like you see
on like instagram you'll see like some
filters for example the sepia filter or
however the hell you say that word so
you get a sepia tone to the image if you
would like to using this so let's go to
duotone real quick and if you don't know
how to use the colors very well they
have presets here so let's look for
something let's look for I'm looking for
Pantone if I can find it
there's so many here we'll just try this
one orange yep that's what I wanted and
and it gives you like this different
tone to your image here so that's the
Pantone one let's try this and you can
just go through and preview it and look
at these things and see what you like so
that's green and that one turned into a
quad tone oh there's this there there
right here
CBS so that's what this duotone meat
helps you do and it just basically puts
a cool-looking filter on your images and
that way you don't have to go ahead and
add adjustment layers and try to figure
out how you want this to go it's already
got these presets or these preset here
for you pretty cool so what else do I
wanna go over here oh yeah and bottom
down here is something called over print
colors and if you click on this you get
to adjust how the colors are gonna
display when the inks are printed so
it's a little confusing but you get to
go ahead and pick your colors here and
you know in a little while I'll go over
these different values and everything on
here so you can figure out what these
colors mean a little better so you can
see how the colors are there and if I
want to change them so I'll change it
like this or whatever you can see how
the colors are getting changed so I'll
hit cancel cancel it again you can also
go ahead and here and adjust the curves
to increase or decrease values so this
more magenta has been added obviously
you can switch up the colors by clicking
on here so now we've got more of a blue
and looks like I got to name it renamed
okay and then I could maybe adjust this
to make it more blue if I wanted but
that's how that works so let me I'll
just put something on there so we can
see what else is going
let's go to green that's good so like a
color like this would be good for like
like a World War two picture or
something like that they usually have
the green images so I'm just gonna hit
okay and then you can see that the image
has been changed we go to channels and
we have one channel called duotone let's
go ahead and pick a like a mono - or a
quad tone or something like that with a
quad we'll just add our own colors and
with it mmm blue what's that's okay
adjust this a little so it's not so so
heavy that and we'll try to make like a
quiet tone looking thing bring this one
down as well and this one doesn't need
to be that high hit okay we got this
kind of retro looking color and hit OK
Oh kind of got a name them that's one
thing just remember robin's egg blue
just like the old Crayola York ran red
okay and check out our channels and you
can see that it has now been changed to
quadtone you don't have a bunch of
channels that you can mess with in this
so that's one downfall to using these
but mainly you're not going to use these
to mess around with things you're just
using them for the color cast so that is
it for this tutorial remember that you
need to have this in grayscale before
you start adding the color mode and just
remember that and mess with the presets
and check everything out if you want to
so thanks for watching this one and be
sure to check out more videos on
