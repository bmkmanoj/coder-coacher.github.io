that I'm sure a lot of you guys have
been waiting for in this tutorial we're
going to start learning how to use
github
now I'm sure large a lot of you guys
already know exactly what github is and
what it's used for but for those people
who maybe you never even heard of it
before or maybe you did hear of it but
you aren't really sure what it is and
you don't really know how it's different
then get let me go ahead and explain
this real quick now of course we know
that git is pretty much a program that
allows you to keep track of changes in a
project and it's very good at that and
you can use it with projects like this
one maybe you have another project
you're working on and you can use it all
on your own computer
well what github allows you to do is
pretty much make public projects so it's
a website where you can pretty much take
any project that you're working on and
you can publish it for the world to see
so the reason that you would want to do
this is because now once you publish it
online anyone can go and they can look
at your files pretty cool they can
suggest some changes and also what they
can do is once they have and I'll show
you guys how to do this once they find a
project that are like ok this looks
pretty cool I'm going to work on it they
can just download it all to their local
computer make whatever changes they want
to make and then they can submit their
changes to this website right here so
actually today of course this is the
project for my mobile site that
everyone's working on today someone went
to this file in they found out that
there is a extra CSS link that pretty
much arm it was a bug it was a CSS file
that I forgot to delete so they deleted
it they submitted changes and I looked
at it and I was like you know what thank
you for finding it I'm going to go ahead
and incorporate this into the main
project so this was the old file this
was the line he deleted and now this is
the new cleaned-up one so it's pretty
much an area or a website where everyone
can see your project files everyone can
see the changes that you're making in
everyone can collaborate and work on
these projects together very freaking
cool so that's what it is
I guess my explanation was a little bit
longer than I thought but now that we
know what it is let's go ahead and
figure out how to use it now any time
you want to use github whether you're
publishing your own projects or just
helping out with someone else's you need
a github account and I'm not going to
talk you guys through making account
because you literally just press a
create an account fill out a username
and a password and I know it's just like
creating any other account on the
internet no explanation is really
necessary but once you have your account
set up and you're logged in this of
course is the github home page so let's
go ahead and first learn how to make a
new public project a new public
repository so in this drop-down right
here click new repository and depending
on when you're watching this video it
may be some routes but you're going to
find a button or an option that says new
repository and click that and it takes
you to this page now the first thing you
have to do is you need to give your
repository or your project a name so let
me just name this tutorials because I'll
put some like example files in this one
and just for anyone who's watching these
tutorials they can like play around with
them now well I would recommend doing is
giving a description to your project but
since this is kind of an example I don't
really need one but this would just be
like the new Boston's arm github
tutorials or something like that so
after that after you're done given the
name and an optional description if you
want you have to choose public or
private now public as you can see anyone
can see this repository anyone can see
these files anyone can download them and
suggest changes private is if you're
making a piece of software that is an
open-source maybe you work for a company
or I don't know you got hired to do
something and of course you don't want
the world to see your source code so you
wouldn't um make it private so then only
the people you give access to have
access to your files however for this
we're going to choose public and also I
should mention this whenever you have
private you
even account for these and the cost of
it is actually dependent on how many
repositories or how many projects you
want so I think the basic is seven
dollars a month but I really don't like
that because open-source the life suckas
alright
so public means open source that's what
we want to do that's perfect for these
tutorials now the only other how option
we have before actually create this
project is this initialize this would
posit ori with a readme now we want to
leave this unchecked and the reason for
that is because whenever we actually
created a repository before remember
that we did get in it and we initialize
it right from the command line and get
bash so we don't want to initialize it
this way because it's already
initialized pretty cool so pretty much
the only thing you do is give a name
choose public and create so check it out
we now have a public repository we now
have the basics on the basic outline of
a project so right here it's saying okay
this is pretty much giving you
connections to connect git bash to this
project so let's go ahead and learn how
to do that right now so actually let me
do this
I'll show you guys the bare basics of
exactly what we want to do because it's
open and what are you open by this maybe
yep all right so whenever we want to
make a public repository
I'm just copy this and this is just an
example I'll paste this and I'll rename
it to be RM Bucky's room mobile that's
what that stands for in case you didn't
know alright so where am I
so let's go ahead and get in that folder
so desktop v RM
our a so we are in this folder right now
now remember let me clear this this is
just a normal folder right now we didn't
initialize that we didn't add any files
nothing so the first thing we want to do
is initialize it in other words we want
to turn this into a regular get
repository so right now this has nothing
to do with github this is just how we're
making it into a regular get repository
so we can track the changes so the next
thing that we want to do is add all the
files and commit them so get add git
commits now just very first commit hit
enter and just put git log and it says
okay so this is nothing new nothing to
do with github all we did is we created
or we initialize a git repository on our
local computer and we committed all the
files so everything is up-to-date pretty
frickin cool so now what I would like to
do is I'll like to take this project and
publish it on github so that everyone
from around the world you guys can
pretty much work on this together so how
do we do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
