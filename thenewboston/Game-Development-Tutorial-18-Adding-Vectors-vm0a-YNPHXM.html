tutorial and game development and in
this tutorial I'm going to be going over
vector addition now what vector addition
is is if you add two or more vectors
together you get kind of an imaginary
vector that takes you from the
origination point to the final ending
point so let me show you guys what it
did here say our point was 0 0 this is
where we started right up here if we
went over 20 and down 20 we would end up
at this point through 2020 vector this
means over 20 and down 20 from that
point we went back ten so negative 10
and down positive 10 so we got a vector
of negative 10 and 10 from there so we
went 20 20 and then negative 10 10 so
what we do when we add these two vectors
together is it gives us this third kind
of imaginary vector and these this is
the vector we're going to try to figure
out the coordinates for so in order to
do this or in order to add these vectors
together what you do is take the first
coordinate of this and add it to the
first coordinate of this and it gives
you the first coordinate of this so 20
plus negative 10 is 10 and 20 plus 10 is
30 so this third vector right here would
be 1030 my bedtime so that is the basics
of vector addition if you add these two
white vectors you get this third red
vector and again that's from the
origination point to the ending point so
let me show you guys had to do that well
this was visually but using pygame and
Python so now we got this right here the
first thing we need is probably
variables for the vectors so after all
this i'm just going to mind vector 1 and
i'm going to set it equal to 20 20 at up
o of 20 20 and then get vector 2 and
said this one equal negative 10
10 so negative 10 10 and actually you
can set it equal to whatever you want
it's not going to matter for this
example but make sure your name it
vector 1 in vector to just because it
will be a lot easier to work with so now
we can go ahead and start building a
function that can add these vectors
together go ahead and build it in your
vector class and you do this go ahead
and define a function and we'll name and
add simple enough takes parameter of
self of course and just put 12 for those
of function variables make sure is only
one space good looking good looking good
and what we need to do is go ahead and
set another variable that's going to
store it answered so put self up an
answer or some or something i'm going to
name it some and what we need to set
this equal to the is the first thing we
need to do is add the two coordinates or
excuse me the first coordinates of each
of these one is at uppal and two of two
is at uppal each has two coordinates so
the first thing we need to do is take
the first coordinate of 1 which is 0
remember it's confusing but that's what
this and the first coordinate of 2 which
is 0 and that's going to give you your
some of your first coordinate and the
next thing we need to do is take the
second coordinate of 1 which is one and
add it to the second coordinate to which
is also that one and this is going to
give you um your some second coordinate
so this is going to give you your final
first coordinate and final second
coordinate by adding 20 and 10 20 and 10
and 20 and 10 20 and 10 and yes I met
negative 10 so after that we just need
to go ahead and return the Sun make sure
I spouter right return self some
and now we can just go ahead and print
it out so let's go ahead and print um
the sum is make sure you add your comma
thing what we call it add and then we
need to pass it the parameters of vector
one and also vector 2 so if everything
looks good make sure it and type
anything around and if I did find it out
later so let's go ahead and run this and
we'll see what our answers it says this
is from before don't mind that the sum
is 1030 so again how it got that it
added first 20 and negative 10 which is
10 and then added 20 plus 10 which is 30
so that's how I got the sum is 1030 so
that's your quick tutorial on how to add
vectors and again this is nice little
visual I spent many hours drawing this
so I hope you appreciate it so hopefully
you write your function to add vectors
and in the next story i'm preppy going
over how to do something else sweet
vectors and I know vectors are getting
kind of old but trust me once you learn
all these things you're going to be able
to create a sweet graphics in 3d since
that's what that's how you make 3d
graphics using vector so that's why I'm
teaching it to you guys and this is also
handy for movement in game development
too so again thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe to my channel
and I will see next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
