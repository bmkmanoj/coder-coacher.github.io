Roberts and in this little mini series
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
show you guys all the cool new features
and syntax that we got with es6 so I'm
going to break it up into a couple
different videos and in this first one
I'm going to be talking about the let
keyword so if you guys saw any of the
source code online you probably notice
that whenever you make variables you no
longer are using the keyword bar in most
cases instead you're using the keyword
let so why did we switch over to use let
instead of var well with var as I'm sure
you guys know there's a lot of scoping
issues and by that I mean whenever you
made a variable were declared a variable
using var it wasn't quite clear exactly
where you were allowed to access this
variable were you allowed to use it
inside functions inside if statements
what if you made it inside the if
statement could use it outside the if
statement I mean it was just confusing
and no one really could follow along
with the exact rules well with let's the
rules are very simple
whenever you declare a variable using
the keyword let that variable is
accessible from the same block that it
was the Claire so I'll show you guys a
quick example right now so let's say
that I had a function and I named it the
notebook all right so any of the
variables I put in here and let me just
make a variable called the notebook so
you made a variable called movie now
since we use let this variable is only
accessible from this block the same
block that it was declared and just real
quick I will explain this whenever I say
declared declared means that you're just
pretty much saying hey computer I'm
about to make a variable and whenever
you declare it it pretty much reserves a
bit of memory in your computer for it
now whenever you initialize a variable
that means you're giving it an initial
value so again declaring it is just
something like this saying hey computer
I'm making a variable and initializing
it
means you set it equal to some value so
that's all the differences for anyone
who I'm sure all of you guys knew that
but for I don't know maybe the few who
didn't there yo so whenever I say block
scope for saw what the heck is a block
for right now think of a block as these
curly braces right here so this block
starts here and ends here that means
that we have access to this variable
anywhere in this code so if I just want
to go ahead and return movie then I
could do that so now when I do something
like console.log The Notebook then this
isn't going to be a problem so check it
out we ran the notebook and since of
course we declared this variable right
here this function obviously had access
to it now what happens when I try to do
something like pretty much break the
rule so I'm going to go ahead and try to
log out movie just like this or remember
the only part of your code that can
access this variable is essentially any
code right in here between this curly
brace in this curly brace right here in
this block now I'm trying to print out
movie right here and I'm going to get an
error that's because this variable isn't
accessible from outside this block all
right so check us out we can actually
demonstrate this further by doing
something cool I'll say Good Will
Hunting so let me run this a bunch of
times now whenever I run this what's
going to happen is I'm essentially
printing out movie three different times
now this movie right here what it's
going to do is it's going to say okay
I'm going to look for a movie that I am
allowed to access am I allowed to access
this movie no since it was declared
using let only this chunk of code can
access it so what I'm going to do is I'm
just going to use this one since it was
the claret in the same block and by the
way
whenever you declare a variable and it's
not explicitly in between any curly
braces like this like I just put it at
the top then it's kind of the global
scope so the block is kind of you can
use it anywhere now of course we already
know why this little bit of code right
here prints out the notebook and that's
because it uses this movie variable that
was in this scope now here's another
cool thing if I get rid of this line
completely then whenever you try to
return the movie and print this out it's
actually going to print out Good Will
Hunting because what it does is it kind
of works like um like a family tree it
looks for the closest ones first so it's
going to look for a movie variable in
the same block and if it can't find one
then it's going to go to the next
hierarchy the next level so it says
alright there's no movie in this scope
so let me go ahead and go to this scope
and if it couldn't find one there then
it would have to go to the next one in
the next one
so there you go and you get my code back
all right now this is the last thing I
kind of want to point out in this little
part of the tutorial so even though we
declared and initialize the variable
right here called movie and then we ran
this function which declared and
initialized another value for movie
whenever we try to print out movie right
here it didn't use the notebook it
actually used this movie right here why
because it still didn't have access to
it even though we made the same or a
variable with the same name we still
weren't allowed to access it because it
wasn't in our scope all right pretty
cool so that's all scope is in block
level scope pretty much means you can
access this variable from the same block
that you declared it in now just iterate
that block doesn't have to be a function
I'll run another sample right here so
I'll say
Puppis function
this is just going to be the dumbest
function ever so let me make a couple
variables here just so I have something
to print out now say let's is horse
equal to true so we'll say that we're
testing if something was a horse or not
again the dumbest example ever oh
whatever
and I'll say let's saying and this is
just going to be a little chunk of text
I want to print out so I'll say bacon is
good so this program is absolutely
worthless but now just demonstrate
something real quick
so whenever I print out something and
I'll say I don't know for if then I'll
print out saying all right so I'm going
to have an if statement here and I
essentially just want to if statement so
I can show you guys that there can be
blocks inside of blocks so I'll just
test if is horse is equal to true now of
course it is equal to true so I'm
essentially just want to excuse to make
another block right here that's all I'm
doing and I'll say let's saying and
declare this variable again I'll say I'm
I am all horse so again the reason that
I wanted to print this out is because
again up here we saw that block like I
said essentially means the curly braces
that surround it but it doesn't have to
be a function so this if statement you
see these curly braces you can think of
this is a block now this block is
actually inside this block so you can
have blocks inside of blocks now I say
just think of it like curly braces
whenever you have to you know kind of
remember block but it doesn't explicitly
need to have curly braces for example if
you have a if statement that only has
one line of code then you can actually
omit or leave out those curly braces so
that would still be a block but for
right now just think of a block like
curly braces it's a little bit easier to
understand that way and before I run
this I'll give you guys a little
challenge so
what this function does is it prints out
this saying three different times it
prints it out right here
and then it prints it out inside this if
statement and then it prints it out
after this if statement so what do you
guys think is going to display on the
screen whenever I run this well if I run
this check it out the saying is bacon is
good I am a horse bacon is good
well we printed out the same same
variable three different times so why
did it change
remember this saying it needed to print
out a variable name saying so the first
place it looked was inside its own block
and that's why I found this right here
now whenever we printed out this saying
it didn't have access to any of the
variables inside this block since they
were declared using the let keyword so
whenever you say let it means let this
variable be used anywhere inside this
block now again we can leave this out
and whenever we leave it out if it can't
find it inside its own block then it's
going to look to its parent block right
here and in that case we would get bacon
is good and that's it that's all the let
keyword is now you guys know now it
makes sense think that's watching and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
