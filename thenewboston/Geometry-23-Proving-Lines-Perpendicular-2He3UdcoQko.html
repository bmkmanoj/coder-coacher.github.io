proving lines are perpendicular
now we haven't done any proofs yet
proving that lines are perpendicular but
we've talked about what perpendicular
lines mean they intersect to form right
angles and they have opposite reciprocal
slopes but today we're gonna use the
fact that they intersect to form right
angles to prove that these two lines abd
excuse me that BD is perpendicular to AC
so we're given that a B is equal to C B
and that BD bisects this angle right
here ABC so prove that BD is
perpendicular to AC so first thing we're
gonna do is rewrite our given a be
congruent to C be BD by 6
I'll just fit that right there this is
gonna be one of the longer proofs we've
done so I gotta save some room so I can
fit it all in here and the reason for
that is given okay so you're probably
wondering how do we prove that these are
parallel or perpendicular well to do
that we have to prove that they're right
angles but to do that what we're gonna
try and do is get them to be congruent
so first we're gonna try and get these
triangles congruent which is always a
good place to start if you're not really
sure where to go like which direction to
go in when proving something if there's
triangles you probably want to get them
congruent
so next week we're gonna take the
definition of bisect which we talked
about in our last lesson and rewrite or
write the next statement
so if VD bisects a B to C that means it
splits it up into two congruent angles
so this angle is congruent to this angle
so angle a B E is congruent to angle EB
C I'm sorry I wrote that wrong I didn't
write it in the same order that should
be C B and that's if bisects two angles
that are congruent we have two angles
that are congruent okay so now we're
almost there we have a side and an angle
congruent to a side and an angle and if
you look they share this side B E and
we've used this many times that B is
congruent to B and that's reflexive
property so now we can get these two
triangles congruent triangle a be
congruent to triangle CB e I'm just
gonna name them the same way I named
these two angles and that's by side
angle side and you have to remember that
this angle is the included angle of
those two sides see if we knew that this
one was congruent to this one that we
couldn't use side angle side for that
okay so now we can get like it was
saying we can get B EA I'm gonna use a
different color we can get this angle
congruent to this angle so angle B e a
is congruent to angle B EC and that's if
two triangles are congruent and then I'm
just gonna abbreviate this so I save
space corresponding parts are also
congruent so then if you look these two
angles right here have a special kind of
relationship they are they are
supplementary because they form a linear
pair which if you remember one of our
linear pairs is supplementary angles so
then we can say that the measure of
angle b e a plus the measure of angle b
ec is equal to 180 degrees and that's
the reason for that is if two angles
form a linear pair and i'm going to have
to review that two then they are
supplementary
okay so next we can say and you don't
know that this reason yet because we
haven't talked about it yet
but next we can conclude that angle B e
a and angle B EC are right angles now we
can conclude this because if two angles
are congruent and supplementary then the
angles must be right angles because if
we were solving this mathematically we
knew that their 8180 and since they're
congruent they're two equal parts we
would divide 180 by two and get them
both equal to 90 so that's why we can
say that these two are right angles
so if angles are congruent and
supplementary then right angles and now
we have one last step to say that BD is
perpendicular to AC because if right
angles lines are perpendicular because
right angles are only formed by
perpendicular lines so that's the only
proof we're gonna do proving that lines
are perpendicular but make sure you come
back and watch our next lesson where
we're gonna do more proofs using the
definition of a rectangle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
