basics of inheritance now I want to talk
to you guys about multiple inheritance
so this is basically a way where we can
inherit or get stuff from more than one
class so we can actually inherit from
like three different classes if we want
so right now I'm just going to be
showing you guys two but the concept is
the same no matter how many you use so
let's go ahead and make some simple
classes that we can inherit from and
might as well since it's always fun to
pretend we're making on a little
computer game so I'll make like um Mario
like if you ever played Mario on
Nintendo so what's one function that
Mario can do will say that he can move
around so move himself around and we'll
just make this printout something like I
am I don't know moving whatever who
cares alright so he can move around
something simple
anything you know this is just an
example so another class I want to make
is one called shroom so we already know
that whenever Mario eats a mushroom or
maybe he jumps on it what does he do you
can't jump on him because why would that
do anything he can't eat him because
they're huge almost the size of him huh
I really thought about that well in this
tutorial we're going to say that he eats
the shroom and probably should name it
mushroom because these rooms make them I
don't know like sound like a druggie or
something but whenever he eats shrooms
goes now I am big and this just because
formatting and all right so we have two
different classes right here each of
them have a function in them we have a
Mario class and he can move around all
Mario's can move around and we also have
a shroom class that whenever heats a
mushroom he grows into big Mario so now
what I want to do is I want to make a
class that can inherit from both of
these things so we're going to make a
special class called
big mario and we're going to create an
object from this class whenever mario
eats a mushroom now it would be kind of
stupid to rewrite these functions over
and over again for big mario since we
already wrote them one time so instead
of having to write or rewrite a bunch of
stuff over and over what I'm going to do
is I'm just going to inherit these real
quick so I'm going to inherit from Mario
and also shroom so what this does is
whenever we create an object from big
Mario it already has all the
functionality of regular Mario and also
shroom saves us from rewriting a whole
bunch of crap now check this out here's
another thing that I should probably
teach you right now this big Mario class
has two functions in it even though we
can't see them they're there because we
inherited them however any time you make
a class in Python you see that little
red line right there it says ok you
pretty much need to have something in
this class so I don't know that's just
some so you don't get a syntax error so
whenever you need to write something but
it's just kind of like a blank line that
you don't want to add any functionality
to it you can just write the word pass
what pass means essentially like I said
is if you need a line but you don't want
it to actually do anything like print
out anything or change your code at all
just write pass and it'll fix some it'll
pretty much handle the syntax error so
you don't get any exceptions but also
allow you to I don't know it's like just
look at it you guys can see it's how do
how do I explain how something does
nothing kind of a riddle but I just
tried it and I probably just failed at
it so now let's create an object from
this big Mario class so BM equals big
Mario and of course now what we can do
is we can call all his normal functions
so we can call move look at that it pops
right up so even though we didn't
explicitly write any functions in here
since we inherited from this Mario class
we inherited the function move and we
can also call what else did we inherit
eat shroom check this out
pretty frickin cool so another reason
that you might use this is let's say you
wanted on I think whenever Mario like
jumps on a flower he can shoot fire out
of his stomach this I never really like
thought about this stuff until I'm like
trying to explain it hopefully you guys
just played the game before also I'm
going to sound like a idiot
so whenever he jumps up whenever he
jumps on a mushroom he grows in whenever
he jumps on a flower he can shoot fire
out of its stomach so if you wanted to
like make a fire class then you could do
that as well and also inherit from Mario
so of course instead of having the right
move move move the function three
different times just inherit from it and
boom so that's another practical example
of when you would use inheritance but
for now I am probably going to not play
Mario because they would drive myself
crazy I'm going to do anything else
thank as for watching don't forget
subscribe and I'll see you guys next
