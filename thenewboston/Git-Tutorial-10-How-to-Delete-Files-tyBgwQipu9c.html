repository we know how to add files we
know how to commit but there are I want
to say like 3 more basic commands that
we need to learn and one of them of
course is we need to learn how to delete
files so let's just go ahead and I don't
know what are we going to delete let's
just go ahead and delete this third file
so maybe I accidentally created a one
too many files we actually only need the
first in the second one so this actually
I want to mention this there are a
couple ways that you can do this but I'm
going to show you guys the easiest way
and that's this if you type git RM and
then the name of the file which is third
dot txt and never you and when you hit
enter what this does is it removes the
third file so now if we actually go
ahead and look at tuna it's pretty cool
because not only did it remove it on the
repository it actually removed it on our
working copy as well so usually you
might think that you have to manage two
different systems well this one command
is actually really awesome because it
takes care of everything
and once you bang so the only other
thing I want to mention this so you're
like alright so it's tracking that
change I'm just type git status to make
sure everything's are and check it out
it said we deleted a file but we didn't
actually commit that change it and a lot
of people um you know it's kind of hard
to grasp because whenever you're just
working on your computer and you delete
a file it's deleted but what we actually
need to do
is we need to commit this change because
remember whenever we commit it it's
taking a snapshot of that point in time
so plug it commit and our message is
this is the point in time where we
deleted third dot text and you hit enter
and it commits that change so now the
cool thing is whenever we want to come
back to this point in time later you
know maybe we deleted that file by
accident and we want it back then we
just took a snapshot of that point in
time in that point in time is where we
come back to or that commit I should say
so again the command is get RM which
means remove and then the name of your
file which is you know third text or
whatever so anyways that's it really
short very simple now that we understand
the basics I had to delete files we're
ready to move on to the next topic and
well I guess I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
