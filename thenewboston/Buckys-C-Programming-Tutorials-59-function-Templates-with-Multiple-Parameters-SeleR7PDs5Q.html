welcome to your 59th C++ tutorial and in
this tutorial I'm going to be teaching
you guys how to use function templates
but instead of just a single parameter
like last time we're going to be using a
multiple parameter so let me go ahead
and explain you guys what the heck I'm
talking about first you know in the last
story I taught you guys how to build
basically a generic function to add like
two integers together or to add two
doubles together well in this tutorial
we're going to be able to work with two
different data types for example we're
going to be able to take an integer and
double and add those together or maybe
you know a long and an integer and add
those together so they don't have to be
the same data type all the parameters we
pass in we can work with two different
types of data in the same function so
we're going to set this up a little bit
different then we have before so let's
go ahead and first get two different
types of data to work with so let's go
ahead and make an integer variable X and
set this equal to 89 or any integer you
want and go ahead and make another you
know double variable it really doesn't
matter the data type as long as they're
different so pass it in a double Y and
set this equal to you know some fifty
six point seven eight or something like
that so now what we're going to be doing
is we're going to be building a function
to compare these two numbers and just
return whatever number is smaller so in
this case it would return fifty six
point seven eight so let's go ahead and
pass in those two numbers X and Y and
hopefully if we build our function
correctly it will print out the smaller
number right on the screen so let's go
ahead and set up this function template
right now so like before whenever we're
building a function template we always
need the keyword template but we need to
spell it correctly template just like
that and now unlike before where we just
had one generic class and we named it
Buckey or something we're going to be
working with more than one generic class
so make sure you name your classes
something that you know you can work
with later on I like to just name mine
first and second and by the way I might
as well mention this to you guys you
guys are going to see this a lot like
cap
t in capital u it's like kind of a
programming standard to use one capital
letter whenever you're making a template
class but I really don't like doing that
I like you know something a little more
descriptive like first and class second
um you know if you're in like a
programming class or you're watching
this because you forgot how to do this
for your job or something you typically
want to use one capital letter but
whenever I'm programming you're just
gonna have to deal with it so now that
we have a template this line is pretty
much saying this we're going to be
working with two data types but we don't
know what those data types are yet so
we're going to be giving them generic
names so first and second so whenever
we're building our function you first
write the return type which is first and
now our function name was smaller and it
took two parameters one number and we'll
call this one a and another number and
recall this one B in all our function
itself does is hello and all our
function does is it takes two numbers
and returns whatever one's smaller and
we can do that by writing one nifty line
of code if a is less than B then return
a if not return B so it's going to be
saying all right is a less than B if it
is return a if it's not return B so it's
basically going to return to you the
smaller number so now let's go ahead and
now that our function is working
properly let's go ahead and test this
and make sure it works as you can see we
compared eighty nine and fifty six point
seven eight and it turned that double
56.7 a into an integer and you're saying
all right we just compared two numbers
so shouldn't be giving us um just 56
point seven eight why did it chop off to
seven eight that's because of this
whenever we built our function template
it pretty much saw what type of data we
were passing in so we're saying alright
we want to get the smaller of two
numbers
we want to first pass you in an integer
89 and then a double 56 point seven
eight so I said all right make first in
anywhere you see first change it to an
integer so it said re I'm going to
change this to int this to double I'm
going to return an int because that was
the first thing we passed then so since
this return type was the first type of
data we passed in it converted this
double to an integer because remember
anytime you saw first it converted it to
an int we could have change this around
we could have you know passed this one
in first so it was Y X and whenever we
did that we would get 56 point seven
eight in that way we could have more
precise because in this case scenario
the first thing we'd pass then is a
double and the second number we pass
then was an int so whenever it's looking
at your template wherever it sees first
it's going to replace it with double and
that includes the return type right here
in the first parameter and the second
parameter would of course be an integer
so it will take a double and an integer
and since it returned a double that's
why we got back the double so basically
what I'm saying is this whenever we're
working with two different types of data
you need more than one generic classes
or pretty much placeholders basically a
generic or excuse me basically um a
generic class is just a variable for the
type of data instead of the value itself
does that make sense to you guys so
instead of having a variable for this
you have a variable for this simple
enough and these variables can only be
types of data like int double long yada
yada yada so basically people usually
build these templates to work with um
you usually don't see more than three or
four it's usually one or two but yeah
that's basically how it works anytime
you want to build a function template
that takes more than one type of data
you need to separate them into
more than one generic classes and then
you can use those generic classes just
like you would any other type of data so
hopefully you guys understand what that
means arm again if this is just too
confusing and you don't want to keep
track you can go ahead and build a lot
of overloaded functions and it's going
to work you know just fine but if you
want to use this it's going to save you
a little bit of coding and you know it's
a little more confusing to look at but
once you got it down you know it makes
your life a whole lot easier so thank
you guys for watching I don't forget to
subscribe if you have any questions just
ask me on my forum and I'll try to
answer them for you guys sometimes I'm
busy but I can usually answer them for
you guys so thank you guys for watching
and we can subscribe and I'll see you
