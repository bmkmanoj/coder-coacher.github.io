the novellas secret tomb and in here i'm
going to be giving you a step-by-step
guide of how to beat it um that's pretty
much it so let's go ahead and open this
and get started and the first thing you
do is run down in here in the first kind
of part is obvious you just have to pull
a couple levers and hop a couple things
but they're some pretty complicated
scenes in it where you have two
especially when you follow this guy and
I hate doing it but well I'll show you
anyways so make sure you pay attention
to these things right here they'll
pretty much show you what to do you
pretty much have to first unlock that
gate and this is the easiest one they
get more difficult as they go on so just
accept that and just run down here and
there's a lever right there go ahead and
press B and it's going to open it for
you and then you see this so go ahead
and hop on the block that just fell down
and put and one two and there we go so
we're up here and go ahead and run to
your left and this is going to give you
a next part of the mission so this is a
little more difficult you have to run
alongside not alongside on these beams
and pretty much just keep running in
circles until you get to that point
right there so the hardest thing in this
part is just keeping your balance and
making sure you don't fall off so take
your time if you need to go ahead a hop
there and you go down a little bit and
then well you pretty much see right
there what to do I like to do it fast I
don't know why so from here you can
either well you'll see just go ahead and
hop up here to the next level and you
can either go down there or just hop
right there and then your lever is going
to be right there and what this is going
to do if you see
is just going to move that gate open
right here so you're going to need you
to walk through that gate again it's
pretty much just following it right here
so don't be afraid to jump dad just go
ahead and jump and in by the way if you
fall down there's another lever you can
climb a ladder and pull another lever
and it can make you start the whole
thing again but I mean uh as long as you
take your time you should be good so
here's the last lever for this little
piece of the mission and go ahead and
open those and there's actually the case
you can't see a haystack at the bottom a
lot of people don't know and what you're
supposed to do is just jump right in
there and do a leap of faith down so you
know that's that's what's complicated
for a lot of people long do we have
listed some say in this it's so cold
what do you want delario lets that bat
see is paying us good money to watch the
endless and the dead won't try to murder
us I can't wait to go home to a linen
that of how much gold we made do that
you know we'll see about that but
anyways this is another tricky part of
the mission right here and what you need
to do is kind of find your way around
and well you need to open that door that
they just win so start out going to the
left and go ahead and climb here and
once you get over this doorway climb to
the left of this so just go ahead and
press the left in its yo will hop and
keep doing that until you get to a
little point and you're gonna have to
kill two guards up here so assassinate
this one I did make sure you ever well
weapon of choice so one of the gut and
yeah goodnight and now there's another
guard too right around this corner so um
you can assassinate them if you wait for
the timing right now so or you can just
go ahead and run it um impoundment face
80 times through their blade you know
whatever you prefer but I prefer to do
that so go ahead and run this and go
ahead and do this swing thing and it's
going to drop you down one of my
favorite things and pull the sliver
and now somehow whoever rigged up this
crazy mechanism for opening doors um you
know they have caskets dropping down to
one not can you just feel like a lock on
it or something would be a lot easier
but anyways that gives you a preview of
where you're supposed to go and that's
what we got to get to so go ahead and
before you climb the spore take note
that there's a what's called treasure
box down there so we could easily get
that but you know I have stuff to do so
I don't want my five video too long so
go ahead and run over this beam until
this plank or you can go the other way
but anyways this is the easiest way so
just go on this plank and just keep
pressing up until you climb it and then
hop over here on to this and now you
need to hop on that casket and hopefully
I don't fall because I do every time so
let's go ahead and pop all right there
we go so once you get on it make sure
let go of every button and this will
make sure you stay on it and don't keep
running over it so now you just see turn
to the left and go ahead and lift up
this lever and this is going to open up
the Great Wall a great door or whatever
they called it and the guards going back
whoa that was not supposed to happen
keep watch while I go look it's supposed
to be an easy job I told you we
shouldn't have come here if I hear
anything imma running to the other guard
post so help me God yeah yeah anyways
after this go ahead and off this plank
this is another thing you need a leap of
faith off of this too and go ahead and
therefore guards you have to kill you
can actually make a run right for the
door but who doesn't want to go play
really so go ahead and stab that guy in
back and now i'm probably going to use
my sword because I mean it's a lot
cooler than my blade so go ahead and
stab this guy in the chest one time and
now this guy oh you're gonna wait oh oh
nice didn't see that coming did you and
one more yeah I'm not even way to
counter I'm just gonna pound you in the
head oh come get some 00 kick me in the
balls now do ya and yeah I want to kill
the stack cool sir and let's see cool
kill foot wheel and counter right now
all right now and not bad Lake sweep and
now while I guess yours only three oh
yeah the fourth ones right in there so
go ahead and run to the fourth one and
this is going to leave you to a chase
which I'm going to be going over next
video so thank you guys for watching
don't you subscribe and see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
