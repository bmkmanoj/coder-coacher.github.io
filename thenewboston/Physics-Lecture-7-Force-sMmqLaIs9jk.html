amazing tutorial and in this lesson I
want to concentrate on the topic of
force because remember in the last
lesson I talked about a watermelon
dropping out of the plane and there are
different forces acting on it the force
of the plane and gravity it was bringing
it down but I never really went into
depth about what force is so let's go
ahead and define it before we move on
first of all force is a vector quantity
now remember any vector quantity has
both a quantity or some people call
these magnitudes basically the size of
something and a direction a direction
where it's moving so let me go ahead and
show you an example of force say we have
two trucks here's a truck let me try to
draw an awesome truck wow that is a
pretty terrible truck I try to make this
one a little better we have a truck
that's going this way and we have
another truck it's a little bit better
okay
maybe not and we have another truck
that's going this way now let fix my
arrow now these trucks are held together
with a chain and see this yep that is a
chain right there now one way that we
can measure force is in tonnes so we can
say that truck a might as well label
these bad boys truck number a was moving
left or we'll say West with a force of
five tons and truck B was moving east or
right with a force of three tons so
basically each of these trucks both have
a quantity which is five and three and a
direction which is left to right east
was however you want to name it so to
calculate the next arms I said next not
the next force the next thing we need to
do is calculate the force of the total
system the net force of these objects
put together now in order to do that we
typically use something called vector
addition and I'm going to be teaching
you guys about vector addition in the
next tutorial but it's basically taking
both forces and
getting them together so this is a
really simple example so we can just do
this one in our head whenever we have an
object moving five tonnes or pulling
this chain with a pressure of 5 tonnes
to the left and we tie it to a truck
trying to pull it three tonnes to the
right obviously
this truck truck number B has a weaker
force so we end up with a total net
force of two tonnes in the left
direction so again just remember that in
order to calculate the net force I keep
saying next net force and net force
pretty much means the total force of the
entire system what you do is you take
this force and you add it with this
force right here and adding forces is
actually not as easy just putting a plus
sign in the middle and guessing what
ways it can move like I said in the next
surah I'm going to show you guys an
awesome way to calculate the forces of
two different objects or more and that
is called a vector addition so that's
what you have to look forward to thank
you guys for watching and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
