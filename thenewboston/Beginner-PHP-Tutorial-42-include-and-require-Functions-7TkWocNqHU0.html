this is a video for the new Boston now
in this short series I'm going to be
taught or this short tutorial I'm going
to be talking about the include and
require inside PHP now you may visit
websites and think you know how do they
get the design or the template exactly
the same every for every page and the
answer is that there's a preset template
not necessarily including using include
or require it will be using most likely
but I'll be using some kind of way to
include this they know that I've got two
files open I got my index.php and I've
got header in PHP now headed into PHP
has a header one on with my page so if
we preview this in our browser it looks
like this now what happens if I want to
create multiple pages with the same
header in now let's just go and create
another file and I'm going to call this
I'm going to save this here in include
choir and I'm going to call this and
let's just say another page PHP okay so
I've got all in all three three pages
I've got index dot PHP another page dot
PHP and header.php now we're going to
later on in the tutorial discuss and
using PHP inside this file but for now
I'm going to say this is my template now
if I want to write let's say echo I'm
just going to create a variable here
called
string and on to echo my variable okay
so on the index page this is basically
going to echo string on here I want to
devour
and echo bar so my index page I'm
echoing string on my another page I'm
echoing ten now what happens if I want
to include the same header for both of
these files I want to have this my page
header on both of these files I can use
either the include or the require
function now for this purpose I'm going
to be using include and I'll tell you
why just later so we do include and we
create sort of like to either semicolons
of sorry either to single quotation
marks or double quotation marks you can
also wrap this in brackets I just tend
to prefer to use this method and I'm
just going to simply say header in dot
PHP if it was the directory and before I
do that if it was in another foot
another folder I would do that so
wherever your file is in this case it's
in the same location as these two pages
in the same directory so now what I've
done is if I go back to index page I've
actually included this file in the top
of my my page just by using this keyword
include and including the file I can do
that in another page as well so include
header Inc dot PHP and you can start to
already see how useful this is because
now when I go over to another page doc
dhp the head is exactly the same now the
reason we do this in general when we're
creating a website let's just say it's
no longer called my page anymore
it's called Alex's page now before hand
I would have had to go to index.php
change the header let's just say the
header was up here I would have had to
change this then I would have had to go
over to another page and change the
header there I've only had to change it
once and therefore because we've
included it it's updated on indexed up
here
and it's also updated on another page
dot PHP so we've created what's called a
template system where we've included our
header we can also include like a footer
and then a main body if you wanted or a
menu
it is limitless you can use as many
enclosures you want on one page now we
may want to create a page where we store
variables now let's just get rid of this
and let's just get rid of this now I
want to echo out var one on this page
and var two on this page okay
I'm not actually going to set var one on
this page or var two on this page I'm
actually going to set it inside the
header so I open up my PHP tags in here
and I type var1 equals string bar two
equals ten you'll notice how the colors
of changing this but just just because
of the nature of my text editor but this
is valid PHP code so now I have to clear
these up here let's just comment these
out for now and you can see what happens
when we refresh another page
nothing's displayed and when we come
back to index dot PHP nothing is
displayed now let's uncomment these and
refresh you can see string on that one
and you can see on another page we said
we have ten so back to original however
we've declared these variables we've
assigned values to these variables in
our header page which we've then
included now let's say we want to only
run this the rest of this page if this
file exists we want to check if this
file exists we want to kill the page if
we can't find this header file because
if we're echoing out variable 1 on this
page and variable 2 on this page without
this head of
it's useless because we haven't declared
our variables so for this we simply use
require rather than include and you'll
not notice any change to it whatsoever
let's just refresh it is exactly the
same thing and if we go back to index
dot PHP it is exactly the same thing
however let's change this back to
include and this change this back to
include and let's say we specify a file
here that doesn't exist so none or
doesn't exist dot PHP let's just copy
and paste this into here so doesn't
exist dot PHP doesn't exist okay so if
we refresh we get an error okay whereas
here we're echoing out a variable and we
can display this by saying bar two is
something and we here we can say but one
is that so if we refresh we're still
echoing out var one is but we're missing
the variable because this page doesn't
exist however if we were to choose
require okay and we refresh watch what
happens to this it disappears because
we've retrieved a fatal error and the
fundamental difference between require
and include is that require just handles
the errors differently so if we can't
find the file and we've required here it
kills the rest of the page we just kill
the page off so nothing else after this
line here is executed it kills it off
therefore we'll the reason this is
important is because if we needed
variables and we need this variable in
this case to display this whole sentence
properly
we require header ink dot PHP and on
here we require header dot Inc dot PHP
now because we've required it and it
does exist everything works out fine so
it's just a way with the require to
ensure that your you know you might be
including a core file that has a list of
variables that you need to use without
your program and because requiring
included useful in the fact that you can
include a long file with lots of
variables that you need to use on maybe
lots of different pages require ensures
that these variable this file does exist
therefore the files are required
includes more for design based choices
so for example you might want to include
a menu your website doesn't necessarily
have to run without with a menu you
don't wanna kill the rest of the page if
you maybe don't have the menu file
available so you just need to make a
logical choice whether use include or
require but for now that's both them
inside PHP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
