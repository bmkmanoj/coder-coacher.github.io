18th Python tutorial and in this story
I'm going to teach you guys about a
couple methods join lowercase and
replace so get ready put your boots on
and get ready learn the first thing I
want to be talking to you guys about is
join I told you guys in less soil showed
you guys how to do this and what it
pretty much does is take a sequence in
join it together in a certain way in a
common way to do this is to add a
character between every element in the
string so let's go ahead and make a
sequence call seq UNC I just felt things
out loud a lot just deal with it and
let's make one like hey there Bessie ha
so add one more so now let me convert
all these strings using my famous quote
press ENTER BAM
make sure we got it but not bad
alright now we have a sequence now we
can use something that acts like glue to
hold everything together so let me just
go ahead and name that glue and I'm
going to use just any word you can use
any character any word so now we have a
sequence and another variable that's
just a string and how you join these
together is first you type in what you
want to go in between the string this is
the wall imma show you the first thing
you would type is glue in this case or
the word you want to go in between each
of these elements the next thing you
would type is join now this is the
built-in method to join and lastly you
would write all right what's the string
or sequence that you want to join
together and ours is appropriately named
seq UNC sequence so now once you press
Enter we get hey again this sequence is
hey there Bessie Hoss and oh man I use
hostel ice I didn't even know I got to
think of more words by anyways glue is
hot so it goes hey
Hoss there Hoss Bessie Hass Hass Hass
should have thought that one through but
pretty much it takes your entire
sequence and puts Hoss in between it and
again that's what were do you want in
between it join and what sequence you
want to join and that's useful in a lot
of different things and I'll be showing
you that later um another thing I wanted
to show you guys is how to take any
random string and change it all to
lowercase and this is useful also a lot
so let's put R and STR for a random
string now let's just type something in
top of my head I wish I had no sausage
and as you can see I capitalized pretty
much um random words and characters in
here now line press ENTER and now we
have a random string that has various
capital letters on it if we want to
change all of these the lowercase all
you would need to do is type what you
want to change in the lowercase period
lower and then your parameters would be
empty because it doesn't take any
arguments
so again random string dot lower will
change it all in the lowercase as you
can see even if the first letter isn't
capitalized it will change both those
letters so I and H and no those are all
lowercase now so that's how you do that
using the lower function or excuse me
method and another thing the last method
I want to talk to you guys about in this
story is something called replace and if
you can't guess what it does I'll give
you a hint it replaces something so
let's go ahead and make a string I'm
going to name my truth because um I
don't know because I'm bored and let's
just say the truth is I love old women
do I hmm I'll let you decide and now we
have a string that says I love old women
but say we wanted to use a replace
method what we do is this type in the
word truth type in replace against
again replaces the built-in method and
your arguments for this the first
argument is what word do you want to
replace well I want to replace women
what do I want to replace it with uh men
and then again I love old men WTF
what what this does is you can see it
takes any arm word from the string and
you can use it to replace it for any
other word and this will work and if you
had like I love old women and young
women it would replace both of those
women for men so this is a no I guess
you can I guess you could use it for a
dating website or something but um that
is how you use the replace function to
again by function on your method there's
so join lowercase and replace are some
simple methods that you can use for
Strings in the next one I'm going to
show you guys some cooler string methods
so pay attention I'll play around of
this a little bit and thank you guys for
watching I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
