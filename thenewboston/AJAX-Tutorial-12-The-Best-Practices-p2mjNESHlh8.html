Ajax tutorial and now that we basically
built a very simple Ajax program and we
saw what Ajax was all about and how all
the pieces work together what I want to
do now is basically start from the
beginning and teach you guys about it in
a new kind of way and by that I mean I'm
going to be teaching guys not just how
to do it not just okay here's the code
copy it but I'm going to be teaching you
guys why we do each thing and why it's
very important to set it up in a very
specific way and it's going to give you
an awesome understanding of Ajax and
you're going to learn all the best
practices in everything in detail for
example you know how is like alright you
know this thing has different states
just go ahead and don't worry about it
copy what I do well I'm going to be
talking about all that in detail and by
the end of this you know next little
four or five videos you guys are going
to be a pro in basically learning you're
guys are just going to be a pro just you
know trust me on that one but basically
let me start off by saying this the very
first thing you want to do whenever you
build a web page in Ajax is you want to
kind of set it up like this let me just
go ahead and put my dog pipe this isn't
the important part HTML and I always do
this because I'm super lazy HTML and let
me go ahead and put a head probably
should have done this before but you
know I think that you guys wanted to you
know sit here and see me do it all all
right so the point of this little
example is this whenever you build and
this goes for any Ajax or web page
you're building that uses Ajax what you
want to do is you basically want to
create a template or you want to create
the part of your website that's static
the part that doesn't use Ajax in the
part that you know is not going to
change for your user and then after that
what you want to do is you want to put
your placeholders in now the
placeholders are for the dynamic part
the part that Ajax changes now in the
last tutorial what we did is we just put
an empty div in the empty div of course
changed and that gave the effect of you
know some
changing for the user so let me go ahead
and finish this and then I'll go ahead
and explain a little bit more so script
and actually if you use a html5 way back
in XHTML you needed that you know type
slash JavaScript but now the default
script for most modern browsers now
actually is just JavaScript so you don't
need to explicitly say that you're using
javascript in the type so just go ahead
and link to um I'll make like a little
program saying like my favorite movies
or something so I'll make a movies
JavaScript file script and also another
thing I want to mention is make sure
that you don't just have a single script
tag like that kind of like a image tag
or anything like that you want to have a
script tag like this because pretty much
everything is effed up because of
Internet Explorer 6 in our Explorer 6
has these rules where you need to write
your script tag like this so if you see
anyone do it differently whenever you're
working with Ajax make sure you do it
like this and the next thing I want to
put is body onload equals um great list
and this would just be you know list of
my movies or something I don't know okay
and I'll just write here uh are my
favorite movies oh man you guys are
going to like this list and add a break
and right here alright so let me explain
this so so far
basically what we did is we can see
where this websites going I'm going to
say okay here's a list of my favorite
movies and let me just run this so you
guys know what's going on and under this
I'm going to dynamically make a list of
my favorite movies using Ajax or
basically a JavaScript file</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
