fifty third c-sharp tutorial that I'm
making for them in Boston and in this
tutorial I'm going to show you how do
you be wrapped and the out keywords so
all you need for this tutorial is a
button and an aged integer and just
study equal to three and have a method
with a return type of void and have it
pass through some sort of age integer
alright so up until now we've only been
dealing with methods that do not change
the actual variables that you pass
through so for example if we were to
modify this age variable right here
let's just say plus two equals five then
it won't actually change this age
variable if we were to call the method
and pass this variable through so we
just called this modify method and past
age through then it wouldn't actually be
changing this age variable basically
what it does is it creates a new integer
called age and sets it equal to whatever
variable that you pass through so if we
were to pass through five right here
then it would create a new integer
called age inside equal to five but if
we were to pass through age it set this
integer age equals with this centigrade
which is equal to three so this
basically just represents three and then
if we were to modify this variable it
won't change this variable so if we just
have a message box to show age to string
and we're just going to see three
because it doesn't actually change this
age variable when we modify this one
alright and yeah we get three but what
if we actually wanted to change this
variable or make changes to this
variable inside of this method well what
we could do is use the wrap keyword we
just might correct right there so now we
make changes to this variable it will
make changes to this variable so instead
of creating a new variable basically
what it does is it uses this variable in
step so whatever changes are made to
this barrier this variable will be shown
in this variable now in order to pass
this age through right here we're just
want to type wrap right before it
alright so now we should get eight in a
message
box because it's initially set three we
pass this through as a reference and
then it went changes this page right
here the changes will be shown in this
right here yeah all right and whenever
you're referencing some sort of variable
you need to make sure that it's actually
set equal to something so if we just
have it right here and don't set equal
to something we're going to get an error
saying use of unassigned local variable
age that just means that it's not set
equal to something so we're just gonna
set equal to three again and since
you're referencing something you can't
just pass through something that the
variable represents so we can't just
pass through five right here you
actually have to pass through our
variable so I'm gonna change that to age
and there's another keyword that you can
use and that's called out and it's
similar to reference but it's not the
same so here to stay out string name
right here then we don't have to set
name equal to something we can just pass
through an empty or a variable that
doesn't isn't set equal to anything so
if it's a string I was college named my
desk and we could pass through name
right there and wouldn't have to set
equal to anything
see there's no problems however when you
use out inside of our method we must set
this name equal to something so we set
name equal to Adam inside of here then
the changes will be seen in this string
Adam so if we would have a message box
show with our live the name inside of it
we would get Adam since whatever changes
are made to this string will appear in
this string
sensor even out key word and again
whenever we're passing a variable
through we're going to have to say out
in front of it so I just have name
displayed in here and we should get Adam
yep eight and Adam because it is the age
is Adam seven all right so that's pretty
much it for this tutorial on using you
and the out keyword so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
