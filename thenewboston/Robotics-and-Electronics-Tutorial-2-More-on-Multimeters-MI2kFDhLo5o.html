turn it on what you see is there's a
bunch of different things that you can
measure right here you just need to turn
this dial to whatever you need to be
measured so I'm going to go ahead and
let's measure say we want to measure
something like volts so let's go ahead
and turn it there and as you can see it
is now measuring volts another thing
that you guys might want to take note of
is that there are sometimes many
different of the same options for
measuring the same thing for example
this and this this both measure volts
the different is if you can see that
little wavy line under the V 4 volts the
wavy line means AC and this is kind of
the electricity that comes out of your
wall we don't want to measure that what
we want is DC in a symbol for DC is this
little straight line with a little
dotted line under it so this measures AC
volts and this measures DC volts if you
wanna have a setting like this that has
a straight line and a curvy line that
means that doesn't matter if it's AC or
DC you can use it on either one if I
remember wavy line means AC straight and
dotted means DC straight and curvy means
ac/dc ac/dc nice and what we're going to
be primarily measuring is probably volts
in this little horseshoe looking thing
and that means resistance so make sure
your multimeter or multimeter has those
settings so once you have your
multimeter set to volts and make sure
it's the DC volts instead of AC volt
what you need to do is plug in your
probes or your leads so take your black
lead first which is right here and plug
it in to come the one that says C om
this is where your black lead is always
going to plug into so plug in there
right there
you have a couple of different options
to plug in your red probe what you're
going to want to look for is what you're
going to be measuring since this is the
only one that says volts as you can see
there's a V it measures your resistance
to you're going to want to plug this red
one and right here into the volts one
and now you're ready to start measuring
with your probes right here and that's
what we're going to be doing in the next
tutorial so make sure to check that
tutorial out and I'll see you guys next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
