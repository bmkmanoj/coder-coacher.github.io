development tutorial and here is what we
built so far this awesome program with
buttons and then if you rotate it left
all the buttons fit in awesomely perfect
so I mean we put this on the App Store
made millions and you know we're having
a good time but we've been getting a lot
of complaints that these buttons are
just too small I mean check it out we
have a lot of empty screen space right
here so we decided you know what in
order to make this awesome program even
awesomer and yes awesomer is a word we
decided to enhance the size of these
buttons to a you know kind of take
advantage of this empty screen space so
go ahead and quit have this iphone
simulator and go ahead and hop into
interface builder and here is how you
change the size of the buttons go ahead
and click a button and then for your
width and height in your size attribute
go ahead and type in something like 125
and actually we're going to be changing
this for all the buttons so might as
well yeah you actually have to sit
through and watch me do all this so
quick complain it
and I wish I had something cool to talk
about while I was doing this but I don't
um go and see shrek tomorrow with a hot
chick and yeah probably gonna meet her
fam and all right definitely all right
now you're done changing all the widths
and height the 125 go ahead and
rearrange them again probably going to
need to move these babies up to fit
these ones in in BAM look at this I mean
check it out this is just a better
program you know we have bigger buttons
it's easier I can finally use my thumb
instead of just using my index finger
the whole time and yeah it so let's go
ahead file save and then go ahead and
Xcode build and run until we get looking
good looking good so far no bugs harder
rotate left ah no no no not cool that's
not what we want we want them evenly
spaced out you're saying art is there
even enough room well yeah if we rotate
to the other way and there's enough room
to fit for Bach I mean it's six boxes on
there then when you rotate it this way
there should be room enough to put six
boxes with a you know without having to
overlap so what we want is to eliminate
this overlap right here so you're saying
all right so this is another tutorial on
changing the view size autosize and crap
no I mean we can't do it like this
because it's just too confusing what we
need to do is manually position each in
every button on our screen exactly how
we want exactly exact pixel location we
want it so to do this we actually need
to do it via code so let's go ahead and
back in our classes and in our yeah get
rid of you and in our interface I mean
we didn't even type in anything yet so
really my mouse batteries law hopefully
I can get through this tutorial all
right now for our interface since we
want to be changing the location of each
button manually we need an outlet for
each bun so go ahead and put UI button
and just name it button one and yet you
think i'm going to type that five more
times I don't think so so go ahead and
copy this and change it so one two three
a four a five and a six and then nice
little jingle out of that all right so
now that we have the 6 button properties
we got to go ahead and make the property
did I say that right now definitely
didn't but you know what i mean and
non-atomic and retain that shizz and go
ahead and make iboutlet and then go UI
button and then go button 11 to
automatically pop up I don't know weird
but go ahead and add a pointer of that
don't want to forget forget that kids
all right and do you think I'm typing
all this again H know so two three four
five six you actually do that one a
program to myself just make little songs
three four five six all right now go
ahead and build and run this see if we
didn't mess anything up so far all right
looks good so let's go ahead and cancel
out this and now go ahead and cancel out
of your interface builder open it up
again because you know we all like that
old interface builder we want a brand
new one so now that we made six outlets
we can go ahead and connect them each
using the file owner so let's go ahead
control this is button one this one over
here my friends this is button to in
this one down here is button three times
140 150 + button six BAM stop what was
my time alright so now we got all the
outlets connected to each button and
make sure yep looks good looks good
looks good alright so now from here what
we need to do is actually you know what
I'm going to be typing some code but
it's probably going to take some time to
type and a lot of the stuff is just
redundant so I'm actually going to do
this store a little bit differently the
safes you guys sometime
I'm having me having to watch me type a
bunch of worthless coat i'm going to
type it all out for you and then once
i'm done typing it then i'm going to
talk through so I talk through what
everything means I think that'll be
better for this tutorial so yeah in the
next tutorial I'm going to be explaining
how to reposition the buttons manually
on the screen and you know enough this
story just close out of it just hop
right to the next tutorial so I thank
you for watching don't forget subscribe
and yeah definitely check out the next
door</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
