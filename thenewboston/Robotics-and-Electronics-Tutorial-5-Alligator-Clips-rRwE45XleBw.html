your next tutorial and how to build a
robot now in this story I'm going to
teach you guys how to make connections
between components now we are already
having one component the power source
and just to let you guys know I'm just
stepping forward but whenever we're done
building our robot and we want to
connect everything permanently we're
going to use a soldering iron which is
pretty much going to melt the two metal
parts together to form a permanent
connection that you can't get rid of but
when we're testing components we want
something that's temporary and you can
just put it on and put off and it
doesn't work put on some routes you
don't really want to melt the wires
together or else you're going to
probably mess up a bunch and you're
going to have to cut all the components
out so the answer to not soldering
everything together
is something called alligator clips and
alligator clips get their name because
they have little teeth on them that can
clip on and clip off of things like
little alligators American I was kind of
fuzzy both and how they work is this say
that you have two components right here
instead of soldering them together that
would form permanent bond that would out
I'd have to cut one of these wires what
you do is just clip it in unclip it and
you can clip to things like your
batteries and other stuff so that is why
alligator clips are useful when using
electronics now you wouldn't want to use
these in your permanent robot because
first of all it would get expensive and
second of all when your robot would move
around there probably shake and they
probably loosen their grip a little bit
fall off and they'll be a pain but um in
case I didn't say these are real cheap
they're only a couple bucks each you can
get them off Amazon or Ebay or anything
like that these are only like a couple
bucks I think and what they do is grip
and hold on to stuff temporary water
testing and you're going to thank me if
you buy these so I recommend it highly
now what we're going to be testing these
alligator clips for today using our
multimeter is something called a
resistance and this is your guyses first
electrical concept
now the famous analogy they use is all
of your components are going to need
electrical current and this is what
gives it power in that your components
the ability to work the electrical
current
but not all your electrical current
means the full nine volts and the holes
are voltage but they go hand-in-hand
that we're going to need what resistance
does is it resists the electrical
current and limits the amount that it
allows past with um I have alligator
clips we don't want to limit the
resistance at all these are just
connections what these do is pretty much
connect one component to another so we
don't want to be limiting the electrical
current at all so whenever we test for
alligator clips for resistance we want
the lowest resistance possible and I'm
going to show you guys how to do that
right now so when you're testing for
existence the very first thing that you
want to do is go ahead and turn your
multimeter on to resistance now this is
the little horseshoe shaped symbol this
way you don't need to know this but
resistance is measured in ohms and in
that little horseshoe shape right there
this is going to test for resistance and
give you your feedback in ohms Oh hm s
now let me show you guys how to actually
set it up as you can see now your
digital multimeter is now going to read
o l or it might read open or anything
like that what this means is you have an
open connection and that these probes
are even making a circuit oh they aren't
even touching it all so this is what you
want when your probes aren't touching at
all when we hook the alligator clips on
each of these probes we're going to get
some kind of resistance in that what
we're going to be looking for so now go
ahead and take your probes and hook one
end of your alligator clip under the red
one and one end of your alligator clip
under the black one now as you can see I
can see but you probably can't I'm
getting a reading a very small reading
of resistance on my multi
Peter now let me show you guys what that
is right now so as you can see this wire
is fluctuating between somewhere between
point zero and point one ohms now what
this means is we have a really good
alligator clip that's a really good
conductor of electricity and it doesn't
resist the electric current as much as
it could so this one is keeper</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
