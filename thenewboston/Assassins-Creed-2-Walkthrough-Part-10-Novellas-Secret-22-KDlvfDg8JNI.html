guards well as up guys is Bucky and
welcome to the second part of novela
secret and this is my least favorite
part of this mission because you keep
following this guy which is in the drum
but first of all he clean keeps closing
doors on your face which is extremely
rude and second of all you have to keep
finding an alternate way and it's just I
mean sometimes it's complicated and you
always have to be exact especially on
the jump coming up that i always miss so
um let me go ahead and you can see that
the first alternate path is you have to
jump around that and you swing on that
and now yep that's the one I always miss
embarrassing so now I have to go back
around and I guess that's good for you
guys to see what you do if you miss you
just turn around go back up to the top
and the cool thing about this mission is
you can't like fail it and restart it
for some reason he's always just like
wait and he's like hey did uh did he
follow me yet and he's just like if you
miss a jump or something he just waits
for you to catch up them so this must be
the dumbest guard ever but you know for
a game it's pretty cool so again there's
a first gate closed jump on this and if
I miss this junk in then I'm gonna be
pretty mad so just take your time like I
did the first time and there we go i got
at that time so let's go ahead and just
run over here and you can see that each
further point you get that he's going to
be waiting for you and it's pretty much
just follow exactly where the red cross
hairs are so go right over that and now
you can see them right there so start
following them and he's going to close
that on you to that son of a and what
you want to do here is you want to go to
the edge of the balcony and you're going
to fight some nut pillars but pieces of
wood and you're going to want to go
ahead and climb those in you're going to
have another swing at the end so just
after you climb these two jump on that
swing you see right there and this is
going to swing you into that little path
and I can just follow them and keep
chasing them again
again I guess he was waiting for you so
now he's going to close that go the
right and there should be some stairs
somewhere around here I just did this
mission like two seconds gone there's
like a staircase and I like going crazy
or some more let's see whoa that's
embarrassing so anyways there's your
staircase right there maybe i'll edit
that part out of the video but probably
not and let's go ahead and now you see
on the other side of the gate he's
waiting for you still he said hey I
didn't catch me at sucka seeya and then
so you tried to catch him and you see
right here he neither are left of that
or straight on the ground if you go left
I think you can assassinate him that's
what i've read but i'm gonna go on the
ground and he's gonna slam me out just
like that and now you get a little
prompt that says like killed the
assassins or something so he's out of
breath he must have asthma and what you
need to do is go up here and in this
little cubbyhole and if you cool thing
you can air assassinate from here has
what I call it if you wait for two
assassins to get close you can use your
double blades and kill two at once but
I'm in a rush and I want to kill these
guys so let's just go ahead and start
killing them so it was going to be one
of the gut and one of the back for good
measure yeah good night and let's see it
slap across the face and go to bed and
yeah I could take about the guys on come
on fight back effect yeah that's why I
thought would be with my blades and I
just uh I just Muhammad Ali until you
fall down and one left and one of the
jugular there we go so now from here you
pretty much I mean it's nothing tricky
you just have to go around where it was
that right heck was it usually point
there it is just go ahead and jump on
that and you're gonna have to pull it
out just interact with it and this
mission is pretty much over from now
just
I mean it's all simple stuff now just
follow you know I don't even think you
have to kill anyone else you have to go
to the checkpoint and it's going to
eavesdrop on this for you so I'll let
you guys listening fitting it Spiritu
sancti the shame that Super Bowl said
money at st. man Padre Bernardo it's all
here swords staves axes armor both our
men will want for nothing I take this
gift to mean the Pope consents He gave
His blessing to the operation as long as
nobody's killed
we're all set for the duomo in the
mornings in on it the baits been laid
easy captain knock his full brother
keeps changing his plans see we'll need
to be on hand to make sure Giuliana
right LT would ever say church tomorrow
what is it jack of all do you think they
suspect something impossible let me
deity or two out again or too stupid to
even notice likely a bit of vote do not
underestimate our enemies Francesco I'll
have you already forgotten how your son
was murdered burn will suffer no such
surprises this time is throw you have my
word montauban I should be off aha cream
eye doctor to sign on when that is
embarrassing gentlemen tomorrow the New
Sun rises over financing may the father
of understanding guide us may the father
you guys yeah yeah so we don't go ahead
and start whoopin but right now what we
need to do is go to the assassins tomb
well flip some head and leave these
boxes it's like the one in the villain
outta touring I think you've stumbled
onto one of the assassins tunes and
feels uncle mentioned yeah whatever say
so go ahead and loot these boxes and
then after you're done looting the mall
you can go ahead and raid the tomb this
is gonna give you one of the pieces I
think it's one out of six if I'm correct
so go ahead over to it press B to open
it clink and I will take this
and there we go so now it says what are
they called with those pieces call it I
don't know I guess it's not going to
tell you and then just from here just go
over exit and that's it for this mission
you're done so I mean it's pretty tricky
but just think your timing should be
good so thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe and I'll see you
