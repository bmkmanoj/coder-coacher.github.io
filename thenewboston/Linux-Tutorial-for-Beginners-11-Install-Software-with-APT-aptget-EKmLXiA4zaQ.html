video I'm going to show you how to
install stuff using the advanced package
tool other words apt so whenever you're
you know working on the server from the
terminal a remote location you just
can't open up a browser go to whatever
website that you know has something you
want to install and click some big
button because um this terminal is
pretty simple
so what Linux did is they included this
tool called apt again like I said
advanced package tool and this is pretty
much their built-in software installer
so using this tool we can install
packages or whatever we want from the
internet now before we even start using
this tool it's always a good idea to
make sure that it's up to date so if you
use s you do and I know I didn't talk to
you guys about users but I actually
talked to you guys about that in the
next video
but this allows us to run this tool with
administrator privileges just think of
it like that it actually stands for
super user do so what I want to do as a
super user well let's just say apt-get
which is the tool we want to use but
right now we just want to update it so
we're not you know downloading like any
like Java or PHP or anything like that
we're just updating this tool right now
so let it do its thing oh just a dumb
whenever I was editing my last video I
had a big bowl of ice cream and
apparently well it was delicious let's
just say that all right so let me just
clear all that stuff out and before you
start installing crap on your computer
you probably want to make sure that you
don't already have it installed so say
that I wanted to install Java on this
computer
well first I'm going to just write Java
- version now since this is already
installed it's going to say ok this is
what version of Java you have if you
don't have it installed let's say um I
don't have PHP 5 installed it's going to
say I'm currently not installed and it
gives you a little hint of how you can
install it but that's
now you can check if you already have
stuff installed on your computer so
let's just go ahead and I'll now install
um sudo apt-get install PHP 5 so in
other words make sure you run this with
superuser privileges apt-get install in
the name leader package and you just
have to know the name of it go online
and find it um you know there's not like
a big App Store for all of Linux so hit
enter and it's going to say ok this
package is going to take up this much
amount of memory are you cool with that
yes go ahead do your thing
don't that a dunk done mm-hmm don't do
the dumping ok it's just all in and are
right that paused the video I didn't
think you guys wanted to see just wait
there and see the entire installation
but that's all it is
sudo apt-get install and whatever the
package name is that you want to install
now another question that people have is
like I'll show you guys with someone
asked me on my form so they went online
and they downloaded pycharm and they had
installed on their computer but they
weren't exactly sure how to run it so
after they ran it and they were just
using a Bluetooth desktop they had a
folder like this first pycharm community
and inside here okay try click on that
but that's a ping so how the heck do I
run this thing well in order to run
shell scripts or um and this only
applies if your program is set up this
way but there are some times where you
need to run a shell script to kick off
your program so in order to do that show
you guys that do that real quick all
right
so we just want to write CD so we make
sure that we're in our home directory
and then we're going to navigate to
wherever the script is that we want to
run and if you download a program from
the internet that setup this way they're
going to say that this is where the file
is this is where the program is that you
need to run
so they said that it was in PI charm
community whatever whatever whatever in
the directory called bin now if I just
write LS we can see that PI charm Sh
this stands for shell script and it's
just a program that you can run from the
terminal but basically in order to run
this what he needed to do is here we
wanted to write bash PyCharm SH this
pretty much means run this shell script
that's it hit enter and then it's going
to kick off so there you go this is
going to take a little while to open and
that's just because that this is a
pretty big program and again um you're
not going to be able to do this like if
you're have a remote connection to some
server because this is a you know a GUI
program with an interface this is just
for desktop but that's how you would do
it but I yeah that is how you install
stuff using apt and also how you can
download desktop programs and run their
shell scripts a bunch of random
information but there you go think guys
for watching see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
