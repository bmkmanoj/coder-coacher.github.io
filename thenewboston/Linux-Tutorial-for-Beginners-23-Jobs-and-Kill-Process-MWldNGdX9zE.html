know what I actually forgot what job
number it is so in order to actually
view those and I'm just kidding I don't
forget I know it's one but in order to
view your jobs if you just type the word
jobs it's going to list all of the jobs
that are currently running and again
don't really freaked out about what is a
job what is a process a job is just a
special type process that we can do some
cool things with it's just another way
to categorize them so we have this job
right here which is essentially a
process that's running in the background
and the job is one one well can't talk
today so you're like alright that
program is cool but you know what I
actually want to stop it so all right
what did Bucky teach me control see what
the heck man control see wait a minute
he told me whenever we have something to
run in and I hit control-c and then it
stops it well that doesn't work because
that only works whenever that process is
in the foreground whenever we're working
in it from the terminal but we move this
to the background and I'm messing on my
terminal there we go so since we move
this process to the background we don't
have direct control from it from the
command line that's what we wanted well
what if we actually want to terminate
that job or end it well what we need to
do is we need to move it back into the
foreground in other words we need to say
hey terminal actually we want to control
this so how do you get it from the
background which it is right now to the
foreground or just type FG percent and
then your job number so if it was job
number five you would type five since
this is job number one we're going to
type one so we're going to say hey this
program that's running in the background
bring it to the foreground and now as
you can see we are now accessing this
program X logo so now what we can do is
hit control C and you see it closes it
so basically you only can access or run
commands on processes or jobs that are
in the foreground
once you move them to the background
then yet you can do other stuff with a
shell but you can't run commands on it
so I know it's kind of weird but after
like two times playing around with it
you guys are going to get the hang of it
it just sounds a little bit wanky right
now so here's another thing that I want
to do so let's go ahead and launch X
logo again and this is just going to go
ahead and launch it in the foreground so
we can go ahead and run commands on it
right now
now in order to freeze a process or in
other words pause it what you can do is
you can hold down control Z so as you
know this just stopped it or froze it
now this is different than the control C
control C pretty much just terminates it
or quits out of it completely so control
Z this pretty much just pauses it now
take note of what happens whenever I do
this I'm going to go ahead and click
this ex bond and I don't know if you can
hear my mouse click in but I'm clicking
this X button and nothing's happening
why isn't anything happening well
because this program is essentially
frozen it's like literally frozen in
time stopped so it's not going to
respond to anything we do so in order to
get it back what we can do is well a
couple of things the easiest way to
actually unpause this is just the bring
it to the foreground so we can see the
job number right here which is this
program so if we bring to the foreground
by using foreground % 1 then it closes
why did it close because we had all
those clicks on it and they didn't
respond because it was paused but then
we unfroze it handled the clicks tomato
tomahto potato potato
all right there we go so again just to
recap one last time on our computer we
have a bunch of programs that are
running and in Linux we just refer to
these things as processes now whenever
we're launching and killing these
programs from the command line what we
can do is we can either work on it
directly and that means
this is on the foreground and we can
pretty much type commands and access it
or if we move it to the background then
we let it continue running and then we
can do things with our show now when
it's in the background remember we can't
run commands directly on it if we ever
want to access that process again we
have to move it back into the foreground
and there you go
now another cool thing I want to show
you maybe this is going to clear things
up is since a job is essentially just
like I said a special type of process
you can actually run all these commands
like freezing it stopping it killing it
using the process ID instead so you can
either use the job ID which was that one
or the process ID which was that two
seven one zero or whatever so let's go
ahead and do that so X logo let's go
ahead and run this program in the
background so there you go this is
running in the background right now now
let's just go ahead and type PS and this
is going to list all the processes so X
logo remember it's running in the
background right now it has the process
ID two seven four four so what if we
just want to kill this right now well
what we can do is we can actually type
kill two seven four four and this is
going to kill that process so that's
pretty cool way that you can just avoid
that job thing completely if you aren't
really from you know familiar
comfortable with that yet and just to
show you guys something else cool so
let's go ahead and pop up that program
again and run it in the background and
there you go and now let's go ahead and
write PS so now it has to 74 nine it has
a new process ID well what if I just
want to freeze this and not actually
kill it or quit out of it completely
well what I can do is this I can write
kill and instead of just typing in the
process ID I can write - stop so now
once I write - seven
4:9 this is just going to go ahead and
freeze it so I think they should use the
keyword freeze instead of stop it's a
little bit more clear but right now this
is frozen so if I click this nothing
happens now if I ever want to unfreeze
it then what I can do is this instead of
stop
alright cont so stop me it's freeze
contour continue means unfreeze so let
me run that and since I clicked it a
bunch of times it handles the clicks and
it unfreezes it now take note of just a
couple things here ctrl C is essentially
the same thing is kill so whenever we
have a program like X logo and I hold
down ctrl C on my computer then it's
essentially just the same thing is
killing it I don't even know if you guys
saw that
so there's X logo and I'm going to hold
down ctrl C and I kill that now the last
thing I want to mention is whenever you
use kill and you send kill signals and
try to stop these processes you can only
send kill signals to processes that you
own so if you're looking through your
system processes and you try to kill a
bunch of those and it's not working it's
because you do not own those if you want
to kill those programs then what you
need to do is you need to run it using
sudo or super user privileges so again
that's your real quick overview on
processes again 99% of them they work
behind the scenes you really don't need
to worry about their system processes
but now you guys are turning into super
Linux awesome users so yeah again a lot
of this gets easier you know just use it
a couple times and you know you're going
to get the hang of it but for now thing
guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe yet I added tomato tomato see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
