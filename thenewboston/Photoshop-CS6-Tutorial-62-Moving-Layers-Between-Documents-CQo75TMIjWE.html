Photoshop cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy blackford today
we're going to be learning about moving
layers in between documents so say
you're working on one document and you
need to bring something over that you
have in a separate document into this
document that's what I'm going to show
you how to do so I've got this bug
picture here and then I've got some of
these layers here that I want to move
one of these layers over into this bug
document so all you really need to do is
convert this into a view where you have
two windows so go up here to a window
and then go to arrange and then either
choose title all or one of these views
besides consolidate all to tabs so I'm
just going to go to - up vertical now I
can easily see what's going on here
I'm going to select the layer that I
want to move over which is called Rowlf
and that's this layer with the
goofy-looking kid in it and I'm going to
drag it over on to this document panel
so I'm going to go like this and you can
see it's over there because the cursor
changes into a white arrow with a plus
and now it is in there so that's how you
do that
easy enough now if you hold the shift
key while you're dragging the document
or while you're dragging the layer into
the new document it's going to align it
in the center of that document so that's
a little helpful tip you can also just
move over selected portions of your
layer so if you make a selection so
let's just use the square here and we'll
make a selection over here and then use
the move tool and move it over to the
other layer now it only oh wow that
didn't work like I wanted it to to make
our selection oh we've got our selection
there I got my move tool ah
it's not just moving the selection it's
moving everything for some reason trying
to figure out why all right I paused it
real quick and then I figured out what
was going on so make our selection and
um the layer it needs to be rasterized
so if i restaurants the layer now i'm
able to bring it over and just bring
over a section of or a part of my layer
so that's how you move layers in between
documents really easy and a basic tool
that you will use a lot so thanks a lot
for watching this one so you guys in the
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
