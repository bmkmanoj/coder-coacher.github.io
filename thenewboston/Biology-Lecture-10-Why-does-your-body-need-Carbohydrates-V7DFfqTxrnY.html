biology video and in this video what I
want to do is I kind of want to explain
to you guys why you need carbohydrates
in your body because I was actually
watching in the last couple videos that
I uploaded and I talked a lot about
different types of carbohydrates in the
chemistry and however bonded together
but still I didn't really explain why
you need to eat carbohydrates or why you
need to eat food that have carbohydrates
and why they are important in biology so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
take a step back and give you guys a big
overview and hopefully this will explain
you guys why they are important and why
we're studying them so what happens is
whenever you eat food food has a lot of
carbohydrates and they usually have a
lot of um polysaccharides which are
pretty much large chains of
monosaccharides or large carbohydrates
so let me just pretend that these are
monosaccharides so you pretty much have
a big chain of those strung together and
that's what happens whenever you eat I
don't know a piece of bread or something
so then you eat the piece of bread you
eat the food it goes in your stomach and
now inside your stomach you have these
large carbohydrates so what does your
body do that
well what your body and your stomach
starts doing is it starts breaking these
apart or breaking this large
carbohydrate apart into these smaller
carbohydrates such as glucose now why
does it do that well your body can't
really use that or your cells can't
really use that in any real you know
particular kind of way so what they need
to do is they need to break it down into
something called glucose because glucose
is a lot more useful in your body then
these large strings of polysaccharides
so what happens is the glucose which is
these little things right here they get
absorbed into your bloodstream and they
start pumping to all the different cells
in your body so just remember that cells
really love this glucose because it's
super useful they use it for energy and
other stuff in cells in your body can't
really use these really big
polysaccharides
not they can't really use any really big
carbohydrates because they're just not
useful so then what happens is your
cells and I'll pretend that's a cell
right here has all this glucose floating
around it and it could use this as a
source of energy and we'll talk
specifically about how cells can convert
glucose to energy later on but just
remember that that cells use glucose as
a form of energy so an interesting fact
other than this is they also use it for
the carbon molecules that are inside but
basically what your body starts to do
whenever it breaks all those complex
carbohydrates up into glucose is that it
uses it for energy but of course your
body just doesn't I don't know it's not
like putting a bunch of fuel on a fire
and watching it blow up your body just
doesn't use all of the energy at once it
needs to store it so then it can use it
over time if it just used it all at once
then your body would need to be
basically constantly eating all the time
and you obviously know that that's not
the fact so what your body does is it
uses all the glucose that it needs and
whatever glucose it has leftover it
stores in a polysaccharide called
glycogen so say that this is a glucose
this is a glucose this is a glucose
whenever you know your body needs to
store energy it stores it in a
polysaccharide called glycogen so
glycogen is pretty much glucose that
your body put in a polysaccharide
because it doesn't need the glucose yet
it just needs to use it later on so this
is how it stores it so then whenever
your cells need energy later on like
okay now I need energy again because I
don't know maybe he's but maybe Bucky's
exercising and walking his dog we're
going to need some energy here what it
does is it breaks down this glycogen
into individual glucose molecules and
that way it could break it up and use
the glucose as energy so basically
that's what happens and I'm going to
explain you guys one more time whenever
you eat food food has large
carbohydrates that your body brain
up into smaller carbohydrates
specifically glucose is what we're
talking about in this tutorial now your
body needs glucose in the cells because
it uses it for energy and we're going to
talk about how cells um turn glucose
into energy later on but just remember
that cells love glucose because then
that way they can use energy and also
the carbon in glucose and whenever your
cells have all the energy they need for
now they don't want to get rid of that
extra glucose so what they do is they
store it in a polysaccharide called
glycogen that way your cells can use
whenever they need glucose they can
break this up and use it later on
so another the last thing I'm going to
throw you guys before you know I pump
your guys bring full of too much
information is plants they actually
store these glucose molecules in
something called starch so remember
humans story as glycogen plants store it
as starch and if I ever say like
whenever you eat bread you eat starch
that's kind of correct but later in your
body it's going to be converted to
glycogen but anyways arm that's all the
info I have for this tutorial thank you
guys for watching and we can subscribe
in the next tutorial I promise we're
going to be done talking about sugars so
thank you and I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
