name is buddy Blackford and today we're
gonna go over working on the color panel
and the color panel is just this panel
up here and the top right color if you
don't have it just go to window and go
to color and I'll just turn it back on
so just turned it off hockey is f6 and
the color panel probably will have RGB
here so I'll put it back on there real
quick and you'll probably have something
that looks a little like this
so the color panel is used to pretty
much pick your different colors
depending on what type of color profile
you're working with such as our GP
grayscale CMYK and it gives you like a
great way to manage your colors as well
I'm using swatches and things like that
and these are swatches which are just
little preset colors that you can pick
from and save and everything like that
we're just gonna stick with the actual
color panel and not the swatches panel
this time and I'll go over a few things
with you from there
so I just wanted to show you the color
options real quick we've got first our
grayscale slider and this allows you to
pick from black to light from zero to a
hundred percent so this is a hundred
percent black is all the way to the
right and zero is white so I'll just put
it on 65 I don't know what it's there
that's what it was on before I don't
know how I got 67 there we go
65 and then the next one we have is our
DB sliders and these are your main
regular sliders that you'll be mostly
using and as you move these around you
can create different colors here when
when this pops up it means it's not a
web-safe color but keep it in the area
here and you can create a whole bunch of
different colors so let's just check out
the other ones we got HSB sliders and
this is hue/saturation
brightness and these all have up to 255
for our value and it looks like we're on
percent here so it's going to be zero to
a hundred percent for these so the hue
has 0 to 360 as you can see and it goes
by degrees and these other two go by
percent so let's go to the nice one CMYK
and these are also on percent so zero to
a hundred percent here and this is cyan
magenta yellow and black k stands for
black so let's go to lab sliders you get
L a and B and the Elat so yeah these are
called lab this is one of the other
color profiles that you can use so if
you like go to your modes here you can
use lab color and if you're using that
then you want to use the lab color swamp
or lab color sliders here so then you
got your main color here you can do the
amount grayscale in the color and then
here's how you change your colors here
using these sliders so that's pretty
sweet
we've got our web color sliders and they
give you a hexadecimal values so if
you're a coder you'll know what the
color is that you're picking out and if
I move these they go to like their
different values here and then these are
web colors so you can you adjust a
amount of color and different types here
using clicking on this little spectrum
line here the next section I want to
show you guys is the spectrums and let's
come over here and we can come down here
to the RGB spectrum CMYK all these we'll
start with the RGB spectrum when you
click on that it converts this a lower
part here to the spectrum that you chose
so when I clicked on RGB it converted
the lower portion of the color panel
here to the RGB spectrum and clicking
anywhere in it will
the active color that you can use and
when you are changing up these colors
you can see the color as well over here
and this is the color that you're going
to be used when you're doing something
such as painting or something like that
now let's go and check out these other
ones we got CMYK and it just changed it
you can barely notice it when it changes
but it does change the colors
we've got grayscale and then you could
definitely see what's going on there and
then oh my bad clicked on the wrong
thing and then we've got current colors
which is going to go from the the hue
and saturation of your orange here so as
you can see there but when I clicked on
it it changed it to the white because I
went way too far so if I go back and
just change it to some other color it's
gonna when you click on it it's gonna
change your color swatch that and then
it's gonna go based on the color that
you just clicked so I click that now
it's based on that if I click over here
on white as you can see I click on white
and it goes to more like of the shades
of the whitish pink that I got there now
if you're working on something that's
only for like a website or something
like that I need to have web-safe colors
you can restrict this so that you can
only have web-safe colors here so if you
click on make ramp web-safe it's only
going to show you the web safe colors
and that way you know that you're not
gonna screw up when you and have like
colors that aren't available on the web
if you want to be able to change your
colors a little bit easier I would
recommend double-clicking on the color
box here and then you can use the Adobe
color picker to pick your color so you
got the slider here which I'm sure
everybody knows about doing this but
this is how you pick your colors you can
enter in your values here lab values RGB
hue saturation brightness or the CMYK
and also here's your hexadecimal value
here I'll change that around and you can
see all these are changing
and the hexadecimal value is changing as
well so click here to change it to only
web colors you can see how different it
is
so the Adobe color picker and RGB and
the CMYK have more than just then the
web safe colors here so that's it for
this tutorial and thanks for thanks for
watching this one I just went over all
the ways to use your color panel here
and it's good to know some of the basics
about using it so that you know how to
use in case in case you weren't aware of
the different options that are
everything like that so I look forward
to seeing you guys in the next tutorial
have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
