Photoshop cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and we're
gonna learn how to create a liquefied
mesh and you probably noticed the
liquify are the load mash or saved match
buttons on the liquefied section so open
up your and an image and just go to
filter and liquify and these are the
buttons that I'm talking about load
match load last mesh and save mesh now
basically these are just predefined sets
that you have already created in they've
already created in Photoshop in the
liquify effect and it's gonna save how
much you've moved around the mesh and
that way you can load it into later so
let's go ahead and do that so I'm just
gonna apply that the let's go apply the
pucker tool and we'll apply it to the
face and if you have your show mesh
button on you can see the different mesh
here and I'm gonna change the mess sighs
- will change it to large I'm gonna
apply this effect here I don't want the
backdrop on and you can see how the mesh
has been affected I'm gonna apply it to
the fish - to give the fish a small head
okay and now I'm gonna go over here to
save mesh give it a cool name and I'm
just gonna save it in my assets there
and I'm just gonna save it as below and
then hit save
that wasn't even bloat that was a pucker
- oh well alright so I've got that going
on I'm gonna hit can't restore all real
quick now I'm gonna go to load mesh I'm
gonna pick out my mesh that I just saved
I'm gonna hit open and you can see it
has applied the mesh that I've saved
which is pretty cool that way you can
save measure
and apply them later on pretty easy to
do you can always go to load last mesh
if you need to do that sometimes I don't
know why I just loaded this because I
just saved the other mesh but oh well
sometimes the Photoshop is a little
buggy and apparently it was it bucked
out at that time because everybody saw
that I just made the mesh what I had
before so let me try it again will blow
do that and I hit okay and then I'll go
control-z let's try and see if we can
load the same mesh again there we go
it's when you got you got make sure you
hit okay to commit the changes and
everything you can't just save the mesh
you got to actually commit the changes
so that's how you create a mesh and then
how you apply it so that's all I wanted
to show you in this one thanks a lot for
watching and have a good day everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
