tutorial in in this lesson we're just
going to be making this website look a
little bit prettier because this is so
ugly looking I think I'm going to throw
up if I don't do anything to it soon so
go ahead and hop over to your CSS file
and remember we have two big boxes here
that's what she said a left box and
right box in the left box just go ahead
and reference it by a left box ID let's
just go ahead and first float this baby
to the left which basically means push
it to the left whenever they're spaced
now let's go ahead and give a padding of
20 pixels just so our form whenever you
make a box around it a border around it
rather then it isn't butted right up
against the border so let me just add my
border at something and noticeable 3
pixels solid and red so this is pretty
much going to make a box that fits to
the size of the elements and it's just
going to be pushed to the left now let's
go ahead and do that same thing with the
right box easily actually you know what
I think it would have taken less time if
I didn't even copy that but yet
definitely with all these mistakes
incorrect okay now our right box what we
want to do is add a few more properties
the first thing we wanted to do is float
this baby to the left which basically
means okay this box is already going to
be pushed against the left just push
this in next place available we want to
give this one a set width because by
default it has this stuff in it but some
of you guys might not put anything in
there at all so if we don't give a set
width and it might disappear as a little
line on some browsers or not appear at
all on other browsers so let's just go
ahead and give it a set width of like
250 pixels that should be enough and now
what I want to do is in order not to
have it but it up immediately against
other box we want to give it a margin
but we only want to give a margin on the
left hand side so March and left of 20
pixels is going to give a space between
this box and the box to the left of it
which was appropriately named left box
now let's go ahead and give some padding
20 pixels would do just fine and give it
a border that is the exact same as this
one but I
to make this one blue blue so let me go
ahead and save this and check it out all
right so let me move this so you guys
can see so basically what we have is
this red one is the left box that has
and you see the padding around of 20
pixels and this right one is called the
right box in this margin left is this
what gives us is twenty little pixels of
padding right here or margin padding
something else many ways now that our
website is looking pretty dang good I
think what we can do is hop over and
start coding the functionality to it
because check it out what this program
basically gonna do is it's going to
store a variable for us and technically
their I don't even know if they're
called variables I think they're called
like a key in values or keys but it's
basically like a variable so whenever
our user goes to the website they're
going to enter something like a username
and a password now whenever we store
this it's going to go ahead and save it
on their computer well there are
different ways that we can save it I'll
talk about that later on well what we
want to do is we want to save this
information so then you know if they go
to other websites or excuse me go to
other websites or web pages or if they
browse around our website we have that
information stored and they don't have
to enter their username every single
time so in order to store that we need
to use something called the web storage
API and that's what this Save button is
going to do so right now it doesn't do
anything but in the next story I'm going
to show you how to code it so thank you
guys for watching I'm going to subscribe
and I will see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
