paste that down and modify each one
accordingly so we don't need to change
the emotion class they all belong to the
same class we'll do a sad face and a
wide smile and now that we've done that
we can go ahead and refresh the page and
we see we've got these three buttons
which are all clickable now we've
completely done the front end of things
with regards to you know the HTML that's
displayed but inside ext is which I've
also included on my page obviously in
addition to jQuery is how we're going to
handle the clicking of each button and
the placement of it inside the comment
area so inside e^x tedious or XJS this
is where we're gonna write out our
jQuery code so the first thing that we
want to go ahead and do is actually wait
for jQuery or the document to be ready
and this is when the Dom is accessible
and it's been initiated or initialized
so we use document here and then dot
ready that's just a I guess an event on
on to this selector here and then we run
this function and the contents events
inside of it okay so the first thing
that we want to do once we've loaded our
document is ready we want to go ahead
and assign an event handler to each
emotion con class or each element is
associated with this particular class so
what we do is we go ahead and use a
selector and we use a dot for the class
name and then we write in Moshe Kon
emoticon yeah then we assign an event
handler and this is click obviously with
the buttons that we have we go ahead and
actually click on them so that's the
event handler that's handling that and
then inside we have a callback function
as well and then inside of this this is
the code that's going to run when we
actually click on one of these buttons
now we need to find a way to first of
all get the value of the text area so we
can append this particular value onto it
for example when we click this we're
going to receive the value attribute
which is a colon and then I an ending
parenthesis same with this a colon and a
start
answers and this and addy so we want to
grab the particular value associated
that with that as well as the value of
the text area so we need two variables
the first one is the text area Val and
the second one is emoticons
val val and we are going to for the text
area val is quite simple we want to go
ahead and just reference the common area
or use a selector to select the common
area and then use val to obtain the
value and that's the value in between
this text area here so here and that's
everything that the user would have
typed in that session so let's go ahead
and grab the emoticons values so once we
press a button we need to find out first
of all which whoa we don't need to find
out which button has been pressed but we
want to only grab the value of this for
the button that's been pressed so we
need to go ahead and reference well we
don't actually this is the way that we
would usually do it
emoticons dot attribute and you take the
value attribute from there and the value
attribute room that is here so it
essentially takes this value that your
first of all displaying to the user and
now we're grabbing it however what this
selector does is is it selects all
elements on the page with the emoticons
class so what we're actually doing here
is we're selecting a smiley face a sad
face and then a wide-mouthed face so we
don't want to use this but this we want
instead we want to use this and this
means that whichever emotion con is
clicked we get the attribute associated
with the currently clicked element so we
can go ahead now and just alert these
out in turn to check that we've got the
everything correct so I'm gonna go ahead
and alert textarea Val and then also
going to go ahead and alert emotion Con
Dao so essentially what I'm gonna do now
is refresh I'm gonna type something in
here so some thing in here and I'm gonna
go ahead and click this smiley face the
first thing we should see is the
contents of this text area and the
second thing we should see is the smiley
face and we'll do the same for the sad
and the massively happy face as well so
something in here we've correctly
retrieved the value of this text area
and now you see that we've got a smiley
face and we press ok and that's it press
the sad face the text area value and
then a sad face and then last but not
least something in here and then the
massively happy face so now that we've
done that we know that what we can do is
we can append this emotional value on to
this text area value ie at the end of it
and then we can go ahead and substitute
the the you know conjoined values so
text area then mo Chacon we can place
that back in the text area so what we
want to do is we want to say comment in
here so that's the divil that we're
referencing or the the text area that
we're referencing and we want to say the
vowel and then we can place a particular
value in here for example test this
we'll just place if we click in here
that will just place test in here now
what we want to do is when we click a
button we want to grab the text area
value append a smiley face to the end of
it
and then we will go ahead and then like
re put this back in so essentially what
we do is if we type something when we
click the smiley face this would create
the temporary content as this and then
it would remove the contents before that
and just place this back in so hopefully
that makes sense it's simpler than it
sounds and simp definitely simpler than
I've explained it so the value that we
want to put in is obviously the text
area Val and then we want to append on a
space and then the emotion con
thou so we're just repotting this
textarea value back into the box Val
will actually remove all content and
then just reap at this content in if we
were to use something like append it
would act I guess in the same way but in
this case we're using Val and then after
that as well we'd want another space and
we're gonna deal with these spaces in
just a moment because remember at the
start of the tutorial I mentioned that
we don't want to add a space if there's
no contents inside so let's go and have
a look at this and see what we have if
we go ahead and type in hello and click
a smiley face you see that we get a
smiley face with a space here and a
space here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
