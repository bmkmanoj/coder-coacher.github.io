waters actually not that bad
my little bath for today
all right now that I have a few minutes
let me go ahead and show you guys what
supplies I have been lugging around with
me this entire time so I'll start with
my clothes right now I just have on flow
me hold the camera like this I just have
on my bathing suit and my sandals
thank God the sandals float because
these rocks are the most fricken
slippery rocks ever and if I didn't have
these sandals that floated then they
would be lost somewhere probably on the
bottom of this little Lagoon or whatever
the heck you want to call it so that's
awesome that they float just found that
out and uh anyways for clothing aside
from what I'm wearing I have two steel
toe boots not hiking boots they weigh
about 70 pounds each and two socks that
smell terribly right now I have a hoodie
this is the shirt I was wearing and
here's my underwear but we really don't
need to see that and for supplies oh
another thing I forgot I had those jeans
that's what I wore in two before I went
swimming I changed it to my a swimsuit
and for supplies oh just look at all
these supplies about four of them for
survival I have a parachute cord which
is supposed to be like really strong
rope my knife in the knife case this is
actually a really good knife I didn't
have to use it yet for anything but I
probably will soon my little pot right
here I'm going to need to boil some
water eventually and good thing that
Joby got me this pot where I can boil
about an ounce of water at a time
however this thing weighs about about 70
more pounds thanks gel B and I got this
Flint hopefully I can start a fire with
it now for recording of course I have
the camera I know you guys can't see it
both let me see if I can get a shadow of
it anyway so just a regular handheld
camera and I have this right here this
is a outdoor camera but it's waterproof
so anytime when it's raining I'm going
to go ahead and use that it's a GoPro
it's called
in this and you can also wear it on your
head this is actually a head strap right
here so if I am ever going to like climb
a rock or cross a river or something I
can actually attach this camera to my
head
so I don't know maybe I'll do that if I
get ambitious and of course this is just
my case for this camera that I'm holding
right now and aside from that camera
gear the tripod which by the way that
tripod absolutely sucks to carry around
because it's not like a walking stick I
have to be careful not to bang it up
against anything so I pretty much have
one arm that I can you know swap
branches away and stuff and this is just
my case that I have all my batteries in
for my camera and also all my memory
cards the cool thing is the camera I'm
holding and that camera they take the
same type of SD card and I won't show
you those because if I get those dirty
either my batteries or my memory cards
that have all my footage I'm going to
absolutely flip out so those are same in
the bag but I have I think I have let's
see 12 24 32 gigabyte SD cards and about
I don't know a lot of batteries but
anyways the last thing I have is this
compass as we saw earlier and by the way
let me see if I can open it with my
teeth by the way Joby thank you again
for getting me probably the crappiest
compass ever I swear this thing must
have cost like 20 cents but anyways
that's the gear that I have and I don't
know if I said this earlier or not but
I'm probably just going to stay here for
tonight
I don't want to move because this is
like the first decent place that I found
and I know if I move it's just going to
be crappy but tomorrow morning probably
as soon as the Sun comes up I swear that
fly
I'll get Oh freaking had it too but
anyways what Oh whenever the Sun comes
up I'm going to start moving and even
though Joby told me to follow this river
obviously is not the best idea to take
advice from Joby so I'm probably going
to head out and go perpendicular to the
river crabby either east or west and
I'll see what that brings me but for now
uh that's probably it for it tonight so
uh oh I'll see you guys later see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
