tenth c-sharp tutorial that I'm making
for the move Austin and in this tutorial
I'm gonna be showing you a route XML or
so the in previous tutorial we only read
XML files that were on our computer so
we at the users navigate to that file
and then select it well in the previous
tutorial I told you that didn't have to
put the path to the file in your
computer it can also be a URL to the
file so i upload the xml file we're
working with in the previous tutorial to
read calm so as you can see right here
on this webpage you just have our xml
file so now we can just pass the URL to
that XML file through instead of hacked
the file on our computer submission
works just the same so I'm going to
comment these out the Open File dialog
if we already know where the file is so
now we should get Adam because on this
webpage right here people person and
then Adam earn the name note about them
so should it work just like before we
should get Adam and a message box yep
let's go change this to age we should
get between the message box because
inside of this age node we have 15 so 15
here yep and as you can see it was a
little bit slower than reading it like
off your computer and that's just
obviously because it has to download the
web page to keep that in mind if you
ever plan on reading off for web pages
so Baca computed alright so up until now
we've only been looking at having one
person so we only have one person stored
inside of this people note well what if
we had multiple people so if we had
another person let's say named Bob say
they're just 18 and the email is a week
Bob so instead of having to deal with
only one node right here now to deal
with two so if we were to just use this
code or we had before then we're just
going to get only Adam because it will
select the single node and then it will
I'll just go to the first one and we'll
go to the second like all so now we're
only going to get Adam we won't get Bob
as well now we only get Adam so what
we're going to have to do is create a
for each statement to loop through each
person node inside these people know so
what we're going to do here I'm going to
say for each XML node so just a note so
for each one of these person nodes also
called know in X doc select node using
the Select node method and this will
just return an XML node list so it'll
just basically be an array or a
collection of XML nodes and now we just
have to give it a path to that node that
we want it to look for so sense is
multiple person nodes we're going to say
people slash person so we're looking for
multiple person nodes so I'm going to
say people slash person so now it will
return a collection of all of the person
nodes instead of this people know right
here so now we're going to have a
message box display a name for that
person so we're going to say node that
XML node dot select single node and then
since we're already inside of this
person over here we don't have to say
people slash person since we're already
inside there we can just say name so
select this name node and then get to
inner text of that so you get the person
so now we debug here put this button
select that XML file we should get one
for atom and one for Bob atom and Bob
and it's the work if you have a guilty
people if you have like thousand people
and we'll read it just the same so
another person here is Rick and you're
another person named yo you get all of
them we wouldn't we get we get all of
them so this is really handy for having
Rick you'll exchange XML file or
something Adam
perfect so that's pretty much it for
this tutorial
so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
