Android tutorial for the new boss and
we're going to do in this story what
we're basically going to get a map
working so the first thing I want you
guys to do is open both your layout and
your main file main Java file and these
are the two classes that we're going to
work with the first thing that we want
to do is in our XML file right now we
don't have any kind of Google map
reference so what we're going to do
we're actually going to delete that text
that's in there just delete that and
then we're going to go over to the
website where we got our key and we're
just going to actually copy this
reference right here that they give us
and this is basically for the XML layout
it's a map view which is actually going
to be used to see your map and when we
change our our key later when we're
actually signing our project to the
market we're going to change this
reference right here which with this
code once we get a new code I should say
for the for the market anyway so we're
going to go back into our XML file and
we're just going to hit control V here
and we have our map view for the most
part set up we might also want to add a
reference so we can refer to it in Java
so we're just going to say ID equals
quotations at plus ID /m V format view
main something like that now we're
pretty much done for now in this
tutorial with the main XML file the next
thing that we want to do is we want to
set up a reference and also set up this
Java class and the only thing that we're
going to pretty much change is it's not
called an activity anymore it's actually
going to be a map activity so you guys
want to make sure you change that
otherwise it's not going to work and
then we just have to import that and
implement the method from the Mac map
activity and we're pretty much good to
go again it won't work if you have the
activity we need a map activity so
that's pretty much the key point for
this for this tutorial and then we're
also just going to go into our imports
and delete the activity one because we
no longer need
since we're working with map activity so
there we go we're pretty much good let's
just set up a reference real quick so
let's make it a variable up here map
view map we're going to call it and
import map view nothing new again for
the most part here but we're just
setting up the setting up all the good
stuff view bad D and then if
everything's set up right we can run it
and we're just going to hit and we
should get something like this so pretty
neat pretty cool all that good stuff but
let's say we want to enable a zoom
function within our map so we're just
going to set that up real quick
pretty simple we're going to say map dot
set built-in zoom to be true and now
when we run our application again all
right for some reason I thought when we
ran it there to be two buttons for a
zoom like zoom in and zoom out but you
know I guess we don't but now we have
the built-in zoom available where we can
you know scroll or use two fingers that
zoom in zoom out all that stuff so
pretty much that's it for this tutorial
pretty simple for the most part and just
to mention if you guys are getting like
a gray grid which you know might appear
the first time you run it anyways so
just wait a couple minutes and if it's
still a grey grid a gray grid you want
to probably go back to the previous
tutorial and make sure you get another
another key for your application and
just change your key reference to make
sure it works
maybe you type one letter and wrong when
we're trying to get our key or
certificate for the fingerprint so just
make sure you go back type it in
and do it that way and hopefully I'll
get rid of the gray grid that you guys
might be having so thanks again for
watching guys and I'll see you in the
next tutorial where we're going to do
some more map crap so see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
