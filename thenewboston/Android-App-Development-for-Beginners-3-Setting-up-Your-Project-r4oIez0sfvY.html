video and in this tutorial what I want
to do is I just want to make sure that
everyone's Android studio is set up and
working correctly and the best way to do
this is actually build a really simple
basic Android studio project and run it
and if we get any errors if we come
across any issues I'll show you guys how
to fix them as well
so the first thing that you always do
whenever you create a new project is
just click start a new Android studio
project you guys probably could figure
that out
now I'll talk you guys through this um
real quick but again this is just an
example to make sure that everything is
working correctly so if I am kind of
running over everything kind of quick or
if you don't fully understand everything
that I'm doing don't worry we're gonna
be coming back to everything cover it in
detail later on but again let me explain
just real quick what's going on now this
of course the application name is not
only the project name so it's not only
you know whenever you're browsing your
computer you can identify which project
you're working on but this application
name is actually the name of the app
whenever you put it in the Google Play
Store so again for this one we can just
keep the default name because this is
like I said a really stupid example just
make sure things working we're not
actually going to be selling this
however when you do develop an app that
you are eventually going to sell take
some time and think of a good
application name because it doesn't
matter now the company domain again
yours is probably going to be like I
don't know what it was to start with
probably like example org or example.com
or something but the company domain is
how you identify each application now as
you can see whenever you type in a
domain name okay come on cursor the new
boston.com
does cinnamon alright calm you see that
the package name fills in automatically
and this is called a reverse domain
notation so whenever you were going to a
website you would type the name followed
by dot-com the package name is com dot
the new Boston
the application name so again this is
just an identifier to say okay there's a
lot of apps named my application on the
Google Play Store how do we know which
one is buckey's well that's the one with
the com the new Boston so again this is
just the name of your app your website
and then once you fill in both those
things it fills in the rest of the craft
for you so well I've got like phlegm in
my throat so click Next and this is
actually a easy screen to understand it
says okay you're developing an app for
the phone and tablet this is all we're
gonna be doing for this tutorial series
I'm not going to show you guys how to
develop anything for the TV or where now
where is pretty much anything that you
can wear on your body like um I don't
know if they have like glasses yet but
this is like smartwatches and stuff like
that so again this is Toros series is
just going to cover how to make apps for
the phone and tablet so select that and
also I probably should mention this the
minimum SDK you probably either want to
put 8 or whatever the default is now
this is um well you guys know like the
different versions of Android that came
out of course the later ones are the
newest ones but the reason that you just
don't want to go ahead and develop for
the latest one is because a bunch of
people still have these older versions
so if you say ok well I got you know I
don't know maybe got KitKat so that's
great but whenever you put your app on
the Google Play Store check this out
it's only gonna run on 25% of devices so
if you go all the way back to Froyo this
was a really popular SDK
whenever you develop apps for this and
it's going to run on pretty much all
devices unless someone has like an old
ancient phone now if you're like ok well
with that logic and understanding let me
just go ahead back to the original API
right there and I should be good to go
well you don't want to do that either
because whenever you make an app that's
compatible with all these ancient
operating systems it's going to involve
a lot more code and a lot more testing
and
gonna be pretty much pointless because
no one even has these anyways so again a
good median for this is to go to API
eight at the time of this recording
again this is probably gonna change as
time goes on but right now I'll stick
with API eight and this make sure that
you cover pretty much every device that
anyone would have and you don't have to
write any useless code so let me just in
my seat a little bit here so now our
next choice is okay add an activity to
mobile so we probably should understand
what the heck is in activity of course
this is like the two-second tutorial so
I'm just gonna explain it really simple
oh ok probably should edit that out
you know are we just leaving in to lazy
alright so right now just think of an
activity as a screen so if you're making
an app for I don't know a website the
home screen would be its own activity
the About section would be another
activity so again it's a little more
complex than that but for now just think
of an activity as a screen on your app
or a view so for this demonstration
we're just gonna have blank activity so
what this is going to do is it's going
to set up a template app with one screen
on it perfect for testing so now of
course we need to give our activity a
name why do we need to give our activity
a name well that's just because whenever
you're making an app with a bunch of
different screens you obviously need a
way to identify all of them because if
you want to say okay switch to the home
screen switch to the I don't know my
profile screen well this is just how
your app is gonna identify each one and
know what's going on and we'll talk
about the layout and all these different
things later on the layout is pretty
much how things are positioning on the
screen and all this other stuff is kind
of um you know that's not the point of
this tutorial we'll cover that later on
but for now just remember that this main
screen is called main activity simple
enough in finish</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
