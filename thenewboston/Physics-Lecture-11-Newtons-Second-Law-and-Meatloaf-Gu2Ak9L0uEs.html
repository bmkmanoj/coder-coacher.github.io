11th physics lecture and in this lecture
I want to talk to you guys about
Newton's second law so here we have
Newton over here and he's looking more
and more dumb each time but his second
law says something like this the more
inertia an object has the more force is
required to accelerate that so what the
heck does that mean well let's go ahead
and take a look at a modern-day example
by looking at two objects with different
amounts of inertia aka
different amounts of mass so say we have
one meatloaf and this has a mass of 8
kilograms and say we have a smaller
meatloaf with a mass of 4 kilograms well
we're sitting at the table and your mom
asks you to pass them to her aka to
accelerate the meatloaf
towards her in this direction say she's
sitting over there well according to
Newton if you have an object with twice
the mass as another one
aka meatloaf a has twice the mass of
meatloaf B then you would need 2 times
the force or twice the force to
accelerate it at the same rate is the
less massive one so if your mom asks you
to pass a meatloaf tour you would
measure each one this one has a mass of
8 and this one has a mass of 4 and
according to Newton's second law you
would figure okay meatloaf a takes 2
times the force to accelerate at a
constant rate or a rate equal to
meatloaf B so I'm going to choose to
accelerate meatloaf B to you or pass
this one to you because it takes less
force it's going to be easier makes
sense well probably not because you
don't use physics a lot with Meat Loaf's
so let's go ahead and take a look at the
proper formula the boring stuff so the
formula to calculate force well first of
all so the symbol is upper case F and
the formula is M a
in other words force equals mass times
acceleration now I know I didn't talk to
you guys about the units of force yet
but a real quick you know hint about
what's coming in the
feature the unit to measure for us we
typically measure it in something called
Newton's I'm going to be saving that for
the next tutorial I'm just going to be
calling it force right now so whenever
you want to calculate the force or how
much effort you need to put into
something and I shouldn't even say
effort because then we get into work and
we're going to be talking about that
later on but you take the mass and you
multiply it by the acceleration of
something so say that we have a bowling
ball right here put three holes in it
and it's just sitting there it's going
zero meters per second and we'll say it
has I don't know we won't even give it a
mass because we'll change it up a little
bit so we wanted to figure out the force
that will take to accelerate two
different bowling balls that are at rest
now the first bowling ball has a mass of
five kilograms and we want to accelerate
it from zero to three meters per second
well this according to Newton's formula
force equals mass times acceleration
would equal a force of 15 and I won't
even go into the unit's because I'm
going to be talking about the units of
force in the next lesson so mass times
acceleration equals 15 now say we had
another bowling ball of eight kilograms
and we wanted to accelerate it from zero
to I don't know two meters per second
well what we need to do is multiply the
mass of this bowling ball which is eight
times the acceleration when you go from
zero to two just to simplify it times it
by the velocity which is two meters per
second we would get a final force of 16
so if someone asked us to you know throw
some bowling balls at them we would want
to throw this one at them because you
know less force it's probably a little
bit easier to do so there is your very
simple explanation of Newton's second
law again one more time the more inertia
an object has the greater the force
needed to accelerate that and since mass
is
related to inertia we can figure out the
mass of something and how fast or how
much we need to accelerate it and come
up with the force so in the next
tutorial I'm going to be talking to you
about the unit of force which is Newtons
and a bunch of cool stuff to go along
with that so thank you guys for watching
I'm going to subscribe and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
