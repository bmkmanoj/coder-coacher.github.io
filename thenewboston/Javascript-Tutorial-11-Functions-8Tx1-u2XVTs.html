tutorial in JavaScript today I'm gonna
be teaching you guys how to write a
function in JavaScript now what a
function is is a certain block of code
that you can reuse as many times as you
want it's just a symbol for a bunch of
code and it saves you from typing the
whole entire code or script again and
the syntax for function is function now
after you write the word function press
a space and write the name of your
function you can name this you can call
your function whatever you want I'm
gonna call mine say hi and then your
right to empty parameters you can either
will be learning what you can put in
here for now but for basic function you
can just leave that empty now on the
next line you write your curly braces
now inside your curly braces you write
whatever you want your function to do in
my function I'm just gonna want to alert
will just have it say hey now brown cow
so anytime we use this function all it's
going to do is spit out the words hey
now brown cow
so let's go down here and let's use our
function and how you call your function
or use it is you simply type in whatever
this is right here whatever the name of
your function is that's how you call it
so now right here we just had a function
and we says anytime we type the word say
hi then we want you to do this alert
hey now brown cow and then it says all
right we told you what the function is
so let's save that and refresh and as
you can see it says hey now brown cow
and this is pretty simple but sometimes
when you have a long function in here
like you don't just have one alert box
but you have a whole bunch of code with
like 10 or 20 lines it's a lot easier
instead of typing the whole code again
all you have to do is output one word
and execute the whole code for you so
say you're typing along and you had
another alert like are you still
watching this
remove my box and then any time you want
to call your function again you can just
call your function later in the process
notice that it does not have to be
directly any time exactly after you name
your function you can use it exactly
after or you can have a bunch of code in
between and use it 200 lines down if you
want so now we have a function called
once a simple alert box then we're gonna
call or use the function again so let's
save this and take a look at what it
looks like first it called our function
hey now brown cow press okay gives our
alert box are you still watching this
press okay and it moves on Vivint oh
that's why I didn't work because I put
say instead of say hi so let's save that
now sure it'll work this time
hey now brown cow press okay and moves
on you still watching this now I press
okay and then give us a sorry last
function so make sure you didn't do what
I did and name irate cuz that was pretty
embarrassing actually
so now that you guys learned how to do a
function and learn how not to mess up on
your names study this and study your
function and in the next tutorial I'm
going to be teaching you how to do
something now it's pretty cool with your
functions thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
