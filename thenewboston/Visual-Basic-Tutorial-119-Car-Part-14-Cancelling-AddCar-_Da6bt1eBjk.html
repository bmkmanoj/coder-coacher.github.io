slash on live camera for the new boss
Tim and in this tutorial we're gonna be
continuing with we're gonna continue
working on the car application so we'll
go ahead and just open it up here we'll
wait for it to prepare prepare the
solution okay so if you remember from
the previous tutorials we created the
form that will allow users to add cars
to their list now what if they want to
hit cancel and not add a car well we're
gonna I'm gonna show you how to do that
today and if none of this is familiar to
you you might want to go back and start
from the beginning of the series so what
we need to do is let's come over here to
our new car VB class and we need to
create a variable so we'll just call it
will create as and we're gonna make it a
balloon and we're gonna go ahead and set
it equal to false at the beginning and
now let's come down here to the button
add car event handler and if I click the
button add right here it's gonna go
ahead and add their car to the list so
I'll just type it will create equals
true so if they click Add it's going to
be equal to true but if they click
cancel let's go ahead and type me dot
close we don't have to set the value to
false because it's already false so
let's go back here to form our BB and
you can see here that when they create a
car or that's not it
let's do
button create car right here okay so
when I click create car it's gonna go
ahead and do all of this stuff right
here now let's go ahead and add an if
statement right underneath add new car
show dialog so if add new car dot we
will create is equal to true then we
want to go ahead and create this new car
so we'll just end if right here so it's
only going to run if that is equal to
true now what we can do is let's just
take all this code right here and we
will copy it or we'll cut it ctrl X
let's just go ahead and paste it under
create car so now we have taken this and
put it in another sub so that we can
call this sub wherever we want and it's
not limited to only in button create car
so we'll just type create car and when
you eat right there so whenever they
click that it's going to create a car so
we'll go ahead and run this and see if
it works so we'll click new car we'll
set the name of the car to GMC Tahoe
we'll set the color to green the number
of doors will be five the horsepower
will be let's just say 200 we'll go
ahead and click add you can see that we
have our Tahoe right here and we can get
the info of it now okay at another car
and this car will call it Honda Civic
we'll set the color to blue set the
number of doors let's just make it a two
door I'm gonna set the horsepower to 180
and if we click cancel you can see that
it does not add our car to the list
because it the boolean value is set to
false and because it was set to false
it's
not going to complete that operation so
go ahead put this go to did code in if
you have it it's very simple you can
play around with it change it I
encourage you to changes to see what you
can do to make the program better and
then once you've done that go ahead and
move on to the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
