tutorial and today I'm going to be
teaching you guys how to use the switch
statement now what the switch statement
is this it's a lot like the if-elsif
statement but some people think it's a
lot easier so that's why I'm going to be
teaching it to you guys today so let's
go ahead and type in the variable I'll
call this country and we'll set it equal
to USA now the syntax for a switch
statement is this type in switch and
type in the variable that you want to
test and in this condition we're in this
condition were type in country so that's
what we want to test so that's where
we're going to use and now since this is
going to have a bunch of lines
we're going to want to use the curly
braces so go ahead and type those in now
so you don't forget about them later and
now you type in case
and you type in whatever this variable
right here is going to be equal to so I
see in the case of that it's equal to
USA and then you enter a colon make sure
you enter a regular colon and not a semi
colon
I know if you guys can tell on the video
but it's just a regular : so your you
say in case the variable country is
equal to USA you want you to echo your
in USA
and then we need to break it what this
means multi guys later up break means if
I don't forget and now you give it
another condition I organize the cells
easier see say in the case the variable
is equal to Japan : of course
after every variable after everything
can be equal to you put a colon so in
case it's equal to Japan you want it to
echo here in Japan going and then break
it and then the last case is always
default and this is kind of similar to
the last else statement says if none of
these conditions are true then the
default is what you execute so for the
default for this I'm just going to let
go you messed up
and it's going to tell us that we messed
up and of course we'll end it with the
break and now I'll finally tell you guys
what break me is because I bet you're
just been dying to know what break means
is once you execute a statement then
there's no need to go through the rest
of this so say we're going to test this
and it's going to equal it right here so
now that we already found that it was
equal to USA there's no need to Det to
test Japan or for the default or
anything else so we're just going to end
it right right then this means all right
once you get to this and you find
something break it and stop doing the
rest of code because there's no need for
it
so right now we have the condition USA
and it's equal to country so if we save
it take a look at it as you can see it
says you're in USA
but what if our condition our variable
sorry was equal to Japan now if we saved
it in the case that is equal to Japan it
should echo you're in Japan so we saved
it and as you can see you're in Japan
it's what echoes and lastly what if it
was equal to Paris now Paris isn't named
in a country but so we tested this it's
not USA it's not Japan so it should take
a third last resort you messed up so
save it refresh it and well would you
look at that we messed up not really but
it's just what it executed so now as you
guys can see a switch statement is an
alternative what some people think is a
lot easier then is if else--if statement
so now that you have some more options
you can see the difference between the
two so that's all that time we have for
right now hope enjoyed Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
