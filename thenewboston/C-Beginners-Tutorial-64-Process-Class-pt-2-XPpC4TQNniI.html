tutorial gonna make you board the move
Austin and in this tutorial I'm assuring
you how to use the process class a
little bit more so all you're going to
need for this tutorial is a button and
once you have this button on your form
is go ahead and double click on it
you're also going to need to be using
the system Diagnostics game space
because the process class is located in
there so once you have that it's go
ahead and type out the process now in
this tutorial I'm going to be showing
you how to get all of the processes that
are currently running and to do that
you're going to use to get the processes
method and the get processes method
returns a process array so we're going
to use a for each statement to loop
through all the processes that are
currently running and then we're going
to display the name of those processes
in the message box for each process key
inside of this process inside of all the
processes running number is going to do
P dot processor name we're just going to
display that inside a message box so
what this will do is it get all the
processes running then using this for
each statement through a loop through on
all of the processes that are currently
running and then print out their name
each type of message box
so we should get a message box for each
of the processes running and yeah here a
whole bunch run I'm not going to go
through them all because I have a lot
running but you get the idea now you
could obviously do anything you want
with this process that with us for each
team so we could do like P dot kill and
of kill all the process is currently
running but I wouldn't invite doing that
because you have some like processes
running such as no windows explorers in
each somewhere let's explore that we
exceed yeah Windows Explorer I mean you
wouldn't want to end that that would be
bad they would be able to like access
all the stuff
is a so don't kill all the processes
that are currently running but you could
do something else like you can check to
see if a process is responding and in
order to do that you're going to do the
name of your process dot responding and
this will check to see if our process is
responding or not for example um if like
if like when your programs is frozen or
something then it would say it's not
responding and it returns false and this
returns of Google's servers and have to
do up to string to the string all right
so now what this will do is it will loop
through every process and make sure that
it's responding and if it's a strictly
responding you should just get true in
the rest of the box and all of the
methods or all the processes it should
be responding so we should get true for
every single elements and I'm not going
to go through them all they're all
responding so for example if you wanted
to kill all the processes that warp
responding you could just do if P
desponding and then just add there is
say it's not responding and you just
want to kill that process so what this
will do is it will just go through every
process and if it's not responding and
I'll kill it so it will just kill all
the processes that aren't responding
yep and shouldn't have killed any cuz I
think all the processes were responding
alright so the last method that I'm
going to be showing you is the get
process by name and the get process by
name will basically just um get a
process by its name so we just type in
like a string here so just want to give
it processes name will this get
Skype down or is it Skype so we can just
type in Skype right here and we'll just
print out the name of that process and
message box stop that show and then
we'll show this process and we sure this
gets Skype and a message box yep because
there's only one instance of Skype
running for example through didn't
Chrome however Google Chrome there's I
don't know how many but there's a lot so
if we just type in Chrome then we would
get a tour so yeah
multiple and this returns a process of
Rae because like I said before like I
just showed you it can return multiple
if there are multiple processes of the
same name so that's pretty much it for
this tutorial and that's pretty much all
there is to the process class so see you
