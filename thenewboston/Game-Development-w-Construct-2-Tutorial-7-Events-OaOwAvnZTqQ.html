video and this one is actually very
important because I want to talk to you
guys about events one of the most
important concepts of not only
constructive about game design now what
an event is is the thing that makes a
game fun to play it's something that can
happen in your game that triggers a
result so in this game we're going to
have a bunch of different events and
every single event is going to be broken
up in two parts the first part is called
the condition it's the thing that
happens the second part called the
action is the result so I'll give you
guys a couple examples one example is a
condition like pressing down on our
mouse well that's the condition what is
the result or the action of that well it
fires a bullet alright let's talk about
another event arm the condition would be
what happens if the dude our player
comes in contact with the monster well
the result of that would be our player
dies so this is how we determine when he
shoots a monster give him a point when a
monster runs into him he dies once he
reaches the end next level those are all
the things Oryx using all the things
that make a game fun to play and all of
those things are events and all of them
we put in the event sheet so again this
is your main layout where were there you
can see a tab at the top call it event
sheet that's where we're going to be
making the brains of the game now
another thing I want to point out is
this is kind of a boring concept but
you're going to need to know it later on
your animation in all games and also
even like when you're watching a movie
or anything it's not a true animation
it's not movement what an animation is
is just a bunch of still images put
together rapidly so when you look at
them one after each other they look like
a movement or video so actually if you
ever watched a movie there's actually
about 30 images every second and then
once they play them on together it looks
like the videos moving so again
animation on a computer is a little bit
different than movement in real life so
just remember that and also
I know I'm overloading you guys with
tons of information right here but this
is kind of important most monitors
computer monitors they refresh their
framerate which pretty much means put 60
images a second so remember that and you
guys are going to see later in this
video why I just told you guys that
random piece of information so the first
thing that we could do is pretty much
make well I don't even know what we're
going to do let's say that we want to
say is the did the user click with your
mouse if they did fire a bullet so let's
go ahead and create a very simple event
right here in order to do that just
double click anywhere on this event
sheet and whenever you do that it adds
an event so anytime you want to add a
new event or check if something is
happening just double click and now
let's go ahead and tell it right now let
me think of an event that we can do
first let's say that um the player wants
to look at the mouse okay so for this
event we actually click system right
here because we're not actually testing
um it's kind of hard to explain right
now but we're not actually checking if
something ran into the monster or the
player or the bullet what we're checking
for is just if the person who's playing
the game did something so whenever
you're getting input from the player the
player or the input isn't part of the
game it's part of the system so now what
exactly do we want to check for well
what we want to do is choose every tick
right here in this tick is basically the
framerate so instead of having a
different frame like you would in a
movie a tick which is going to happen 60
times a second in this game is pretty
much on the frame rate of the game so
whenever we say check every tick what
this is going to do is it's going to
check for this event every 60 times a
second so it's pretty much constantly
waiting for something to happen well now
we got to give the other information so
let's go ahead and add
in action here so every second what do
you want to do well what we want to do
is have the player probably click that
to fast have the player look at where
your mouse is on the screen so that way
he can rotate so if I have it up here
he's going to be looking up if I have it
down here his gun is going to be pointed
down pretty much where do you want the
player to aim the gun that might be a
little bit easier to understand so the
result of checking this every second is
the player is going to perform a certain
action well what's he going to do well
it's actually some of these names are
weird but what we want to do is set
angle towards position and whenever we
double click that it says okay so every
second look at where your mouse is and
set the player pointing his gun in this
position so now we have to give it an x
and y coordinate where it's pretty much
saying okay well what angle do you want
the player to point the gun well for the
x coordinate and this is it's kind of
helpful if you know programming or
JavaScript particular what we're going
to do is put mouse X and hit enter and
for Y just hit mouse Y and hit done and
now it's probably going to be really
easy to see if you just read this so
again this first thing right here system
is pretty much saying okay from the
computer or you know whatever thing
you're running this on your phone or
whatever every single tick which is
pretty much equal to constantly so
constantly check for where your mouse is
the X&amp;amp;Y coordinates of your mouse and
set the angle of your player towards the
mouse so it's probably really easy if I
just show you guys so right now if I put
my mouse up it's constantly refreshing
and saying okay set the angle of that
player and have them point towards the
mouse and even though it looks like one
continual motion this is actually
checking 60 times every second so
therefore
you know we could set it like um just
like once every second but then he's
going to be all jerky so that's why I
want to teach you guys about ticks and
how to pretty much make a very basic
event now I know that was a lot of
information and you guys are like wow
this game is going to suck events are
going to take forever to make but trust
me once I do like to other ones you guys
gonna make wow that was actually
incredibly easy so um in the next couple
tutorials we have to add a bunch more
events like what happens when a bullet
shoots a monster what happens when a
monster runs into a player and then
we're going to be also adding um several
actions for well I'll tell you guys
later I don't want to throw everything
at you you guys understood enough in
this tutorial so thank you guys for
watching and also if you have any
questions at all just ask me on my forum
bookies room org slash forum I'll be
happy to answer them for you there so
thanks and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
