video I am going to talk to you about a
few easy ways that you can defend
against man-in-the-middle attacks now
the biggest recommendation I have is
just never to use free public Wi-Fi I
mean even if you go into some place in
you're like ok they have a nice long you
know maybe a WPA passphrase and their
WPS pin is inactive this looks like a
pretty secure Network
even if you think it's a secure network
you still have no idea who is managing
that router that access point it could
be some dude and he could just be wait
in there waiting to claim your sensitive
information so if you use public Wi-Fi
then at least do not use it with your
sensitive information and I mean your
bank account login your email login so
on and so forth now for those of you who
need to use public Wi-Fi there's just no
way around it maybe you do for your job
then these are a couple of things to
look out for first of all whenever you
go to a sensitive page such as a login
page you need to make sure that it has a
valid HTTPS certificate now on the
website that we made in the last video
you saw that whenever we went to WWE
Beca com it wasn't the real bacon comm
so we're never going to see one of those
nice green certificates and I'll show
you guys what they look like so this is
the Bank of America webpage right here
and this is for my phone and this is
from the tablet so any big company and
not even a big company but any decent
size company their website is going to
have this green validation or
certificate on their website and this is
basically saying this website is who we
say they are that's why these
certificates were made up now I want to
say not every website because maybe your
friend has a forum and I don't know
maybe someone's working on like a tiny
little website those login pages may not
have it but all of your big websites
Facebook your bank's your Google's your
emails keep an eye out for these and if
you don't see one do not go to it
another important thing you can do
especially on your home network is lock
out any unauthorized users and you do so
by using the techniques that we learned
before make sure you have a really
strong passphrase make sure that you
disable WPS and as you continue watching
the series you're going to learn about
more vulnerabilities and how you can fix
them and that is because for some reason
a lot of people believe that whenever
they have a phone or whatever and
they're talking to an Access Point that
there's just some kind of direct
communication between the two but they
don't realize whenever you're using
Wi-Fi like I said before it's almost the
exact equivalent of shouting your
information out to anyone that will
listen so make sure anyone you don't
trust anyone but your friends in your
family they can't even access your
network if they tried I mean as a
general rule of thumb look at this guy
do you trust this guy I don't I mean you
have to think would you trust them with
your 13 year old daughter no you
wouldn't so why would you trust them
with your Wi-Fi network which is even
more important because you know that
this guy's just gonna be like oh I'm an
old guy I just want to get on my iPhone
and check my doctor's appointment
sorry Hoss no free Wi-Fi for you and as
we continue this series I'm going to be
explaining like I said a bunch of
different things that you can do to
protect yourself and your network
against man and metal attacks such as
DNS spoofing and it's different for if
it's your network or you're just on the
network so for network administrator's
there are intrusion detection software
that you can use and for individuals
like I said we're going to be going over
all of these techniques but for now I
thank you guys for watching just want to
give you guys some real quick ideas so
there you go see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
