is go to your oncreate and all of the
code that we write is going to go right
in here
because remember whenever we say ok
button you need to listen for something
it's a good idea to tell it that as soon
as we create our activity because we
don't want to tell the button you know
to start waiting for something whenever
we're about to close it so we might as
well set everything up as soon as we
create that activity so of course the
very first thing we need you guys
probably could have guessed it is a
reference to that button now remember
this button or at least I named mine
Bucky's button so now let's go ahead and
get a reference to it through code so
now we can just use button and I'm just
going to name my variable the same thing
as the ID and I don't know that's just a
lot easier for me to understand and
there's no issues with that or anything
so I'm going to name my variable in Java
or my object Buckley's button and what
we need to do is we need to typecast
this to button and it's fine view or
find widget by ID in the ID is resource
ID and then you just type the ID of it
which was Bucky's button or whatever you
named yours if you named your something
different then make sure to write that
right there so now we pretty much went
to our interface we got that reference
to the button and we now can treat it as
an object pretty stinkin sweet good
really why do I always burp during my
disorder all right so now of course what
we need to do is we need to take that
button and set up the event listener we
need to tell the button hey dude you got
to sit and wait for something to happen
so that's all we're saying pretty easy
so Bucky's button and on it we're going
to call a method called set on not long
click listener on click listener long
click is something else I'll show you
guys that in the next tutorial if you
want so set on click listener and inside
here again
let me clean this up all right so this
onclicklistener
is saying okay this button is going to
wait for someone to click it now inside
here what we're going to do is we're
going to pass in that callback method
which pretty much means after someone
clicked you then do this now the thing
is we can't just throw the method in
here directly we need to stick it inside
an interface and this is just a standard
programming practices an interface is
really simple to set up is just a
collection of methods pretty much and in
order to make an interface just write
the word new button and the interface is
ah actually just popped up now it's not
gonna oh it's popping up oh yeah there
we go all right so on click listener now
after this just add your brackets all
right now within here again this is
where we have our callback method and
the method for whenever the button gets
clicked this is what we want to occur is
public void on click and we have to pass
it in view v all right so again what's
going on here is this is our reference
to the button this is our event listener
pretty much saying OK button sit and
wait for someone to click you so it's a
click listener they have different types
of listeners and again inside here is
our callback method and it needs to go
in this thing called an interface and
that's just because I don't know it's
just the rules of Java so now within
here we can actually type anything that
we want to happen but remember what I
said I'm going to do is I'm going to
change the text on this view right here
so the idea of it is Bucky's text and
again this is just going to take two
lines of code textview and I'm just
going to name my Luckies text and set it
equal to the same thing we did up here
but we need to typecast it to a text
view object first
and then we can just do fine view by ID
are dot dot e dot both keys text that is
song I love singing should do the Tyler
tutorial as of musical alright so now
that we have a reference to this all we
have to do is we need to call one last
thing set text now of course what this
method does is it takes whatever bit of
text you pass in and I'm just going to
pass it like good job boss and sets that
as the widgets text so now let's go
ahead and run this bad boy and see if it
works and by the way while we are
waiting I want to ask you guys this
I have to get a new phone in like the
next week or two and I don't know if I
should get um note 4 or odd Nexus like a
Nexus 6
so Samsung Note 4 I looked at them today
and they are freaking awesome or a Nexus
6 which I kind of like because it has
standard Android on it so I don't know
let me know what you guys think so there
we have it the coolest I have ever
created alright so hopefully when I
click this check this out and it works
this app is gonna sell for a million
dollars uh-huh
alright so one last time what we did two
second tutorial we created an interface
in the interface was awesome and once we
had that interface we reference both of
these things so we could tweak them with
our code and we set up a listener on the
button that said hey button dude you're
gonna listen for something to happen and
it's like ooh look look up and Bucky and
then go a tell you a button this is what
you want to happen when someone clicks
yeah so we click the button and it did
it and that my friend is event handling</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
