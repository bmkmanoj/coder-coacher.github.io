welcome to another amazing chemistry
tutorial and in this lesson we're going
to be talking about ionic bonds so what
the heck is an ionic bond an ionic bond
is basically whenever you have two ions
a cation and an anion and they have
opposite charges so remember the old
rule opposites attract
they're going to attract each other and
form a bond pretty weird huh so let's go
ahead and take a look at an example of
when this would happen this happens a
lot whenever we're making salts and
we'll go ahead and talk about table salt
so table salt has two elements in it
sodium and chlorine now sodium which is
na how they came up with that is beyond
me but it has an electron configuration
of 1s2 2s2 and this is actually
important I'm not just writing this down
for fun 2p 6 and 3's 1 now let's go
ahead and take a look at this four
valence electrons
remember it's how many electrons are in
the outermost energy level it has one
valence electron its outermost energy
level is energy level 3 and in that
energy level it has one valence electron
now if we go ahead and take it a look at
another element let me find a good color
for chlorine now the symbol for chlorine
is CL in the electron configuration for
this is 1s2 2s2 2p6 and the third energy
level is also the valence energy level
for chlorine but this one is 2's -
excuse me 3s - and 3p 5 so let's go
ahead and take a look at how many
valence electrons are in chlorine well
the third energy level is the outermost
energy level and it has two plus five
which is seven valence electrons
now remember getting a full or completed
valence energy level is the goal for all
elements that's what makes them stable
and that's what makes them happy so if
we take a look at sodium we would get
this
it would either need to gain seven
valence electrons so it could fill that
third energy level or it would need to
lose this one and if it lost this
electron right here the second energy
level would then be its outermost energy
level and it is already full and
completed now for chlorine it would
either need to gain one electron so the
third energy level which is the valence
energy level right now is fold up fill
it up and completed or it would need to
lose these seven right here and that's
kind of hard to do lose a bunch or that
many electrons so what happens whenever
you combined sodium and chlorine you
have this electron it hops over to
chlorine so this electron is no longer
here and chlorine has one additional
electron on the outermost energy level
so that's what reaction takes place well
excuse me my thing I'm going to sneeze
in like five seconds so what happens
again is sodium loses one electron and
it becomes a positively charged ion and
remember we call positively charged ions
cations and we're going to go ahead and
write it just like this n a with a plus
is a superscript now what happens the
chlorine is since it gains that electron
and now has more electrons than protons
and it becomes a positively charged ion
or excuse me a negatively charged ion
and we call negatively charged ions
anions remember that n 4 negative just
like that so after the transfer of
electrons chlorine is now negatively
charged and sodium is now positively
charged so since this is a positively
charged and I messed that up let me find
a good color other than black since this
is a positively charged ion and this is
a negatively charged ion positives and
negatives are going to go ahead and
tracked each other into that ionic bond
which we see right there so again an
ionic bond is basically two or more ions
that attract each other because they
have opposite attractions
and that's basically it that's the
concept behind an ionic bond and there
is another type of bond but we're going
to be talking about that later on so a
cool thing to take note of and I know
I'm you know recording this on my screen
so I can't show you with my camera or
anything but if you take a chunk of
sodium which looks like a little piece
of metal basically and you put it in a
jar of chlorine gas and now chlorine gas
is a kind of a green and yellow colored
if you put them together then it's going
to start glowing and stuff is going to
start reacting and you're going to end
up with the element let me change my
color again and a CL and this element is
called sodium chloride and this is
actually table salt that's something you
can eat because chlorine gas is actually
it'll kill you if you breathe it and
sodium straight sodium isn't that great
for you either but if you combine them
it just makes table salt which is
actually pretty cool so anyways that's
the basics behind behind
ionic bonds a lots of salts actually are
made using this way and that's enough
with ionic bonds we're ready to move on
to another type of bonding which we're
going to be covering either in the next
tutorial or the one after that so thank
you guys for watching and don't forget
to subscribe and I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
