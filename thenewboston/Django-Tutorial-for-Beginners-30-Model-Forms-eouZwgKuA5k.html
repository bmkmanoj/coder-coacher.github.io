video what I'm going to do is I'm going
to show you guys how to use model forms
and before I even talk to you guys about
what those are I just want to mention
that I know you probably noticed the
design of my webpage changed a little
bit that's because I just designed it to
make it look pretty real quick and I
didn't really add any jingo
functionality or anything special so
none of these new links or buttons even
work so all of these things right here
and the reason that I did that is
because I know that this is a jingle
tutorial and that's what I'm supposed to
be teaching you guys so I don't want to
waste a bunch of your time you know
having you sit there and watch me make
these designs and bootstrap when I'm
sure that you already know bootstrap so
I figured I might as well just go ahead
and make the design save you guys some
time so there you go and actually the
design of your website it doesn't really
matter to Jango so design it however you
want as long as you follow along with
these tutorials you guys are going to be
learning the basics of Jango so in this
tutorial like I said model forms what
are model forms and why do we need them
well model forms help us speed up
development whenever we include forms on
our website and they do this by saving
you a bunch of time by a generating the
actual HTML code for the forms be taking
care of basic form validation so for
example whenever we have a form and we
need the user to input the album name if
they just don't type anything at all
it's going to say hey this can't be
blank you need to write something in
here so on and so forth and the last
thing is they actually take care of
saving that data to the database so we
looked at how we can do this manually
using that database shell or command
line and we also looked at how we can do
it in the admin panel
well now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to make a form in this tutorial
where the user can type in all the
information for a new album and then it
can go ahead and save it all behind the
scenes we don't have to worry about any
of the hard work so first things first
go ahead and hop over to models dot py
and we need to import
one other module in that Strome django
core URL resolvers imports reverse
alright so what we need to do is this
you know how I said that in this example
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
make a real basic form that lets the
user type in the album name and the
artist in the genre and also a logo and
they hit submit well whenever they hit
submit and it adds it to the database
where are they going to be redirected
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to
actually redirect them to this page
right here I think it'll be cool if
after they submit the form then they are
kind of taken to that album page so they
CRE I need to add a song now tomato
tomahto so that's what we're going to be
doing in order to do that just go ahead
and import this we just did now above
this two string function we're going to
add another one so that's def get
absolute URL pass itself and what we're
going to return is essentially the
details page of the album that we just
created and I'm getting error because I
just made this function and I didn't
write anything in it so what we're going
to do is we're going to return reverse
and the first parameter is the view name
so that was music detail now remember
whenever we use this detail view what it
takes is the primary key of whatever
album we're trying to view the details
of so how do we pass that in well the
primary key is kind of a hidden field
right here and in order to pass it in
just right key W args
in other words keyword ours and we just
want to use the primary key of whatever
this object is whatever one we just
created so self pk so there you go so
whenever we create a new album it's
going to add it to database is going to
give it some primary key like five or
six or seven hundred Ivor
and it's going to take it to this detail
view with whatever number the primary
key is simple enough so the next step in
this process is a hop over to your views
and make myself a little bit of room
alright so we're going to add a new
class that essentially creates this for
view but in order to do that we actually
need to import it so generic I'll just
do this from jingo views generic edit
import to create view alright so
basically whenever you want to make a
form to create a new object what you
need to import is this create view now
there is also update view might as well
go ahead and import those right now so
update view this is the form for editing
an object and there's also delete view
so this isn't an actual form that you
can see because whenever you delete an
object you don't need to fill out a form
you just hit delete and then it
redirects you somewhere but we'll take a
look at that in the next tutorial for
right now we are really just worried
about this the create view so whenever
we create our class to add a new album
what we're going to do is this class
album create we're going to inherit from
create view so the first thing it says
is alright you're trying to create a new
object what type of object are you
trying to create well just like before
we need to specify it right there so
model equals album are you're trying to
create a new album that's fantastic now
the only other thing you need to write
are what fields do you need so what
attributes do you want me to allow the
user to fill out now you need to specify
these because sometimes you just don't
want to put all the fields in there
maybe you want to I don't know like make
a crawler that gets the logo
automatically or just fill in the genre
behind the scenes or something but in
this example we're just going to allow
the users to type in every single thing
so in order to specify that just to
write fields and you put those as a list
so
they're going to be able to type in the
artist the album title was this one your
honor on an album logo logo alright so
that looks pretty good right there now
the last thing we need to do in terms of
setting up kind of in the code is over
in URLs we need to assign a URL pattern
to this view right here so borrow Orden
of the basics of it a regular expression
and what I'm going to do is this album
has it shown new weird colors add dollar
sign and use dot I won't create as view
of course just like before because it is
a class we do need to convert it to view
and the last thing is the name so the
name of this is going to be equal to
album - or - add here what I should
probably do is this I had a little
comment above so you guys can see the
URL structure so this is music oh boom
ad right like that and the reason that
we don't need to specify a primary key
is just because we're creating a new
album so it doesn't have a primary key
yet after we add it and after we create
it that's when it's going to be assigned
a unique ID
aka primary key so now we got a form
generated but what we have to do after
this is we actually need to make a
template that we can plug it into so
that's what we're going to be doing in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
