Blackford and today and Photoshop cs6
we're going to learn how to make channel
masks from your native color channels
here so we're going to make a color
matte or a channel mask from either the
are the red green or the blue channels
so go ahead and go to your channels
panel and just single out one of your
color channels now what you're looking
for is the one that has the most
contrast between black and white or the
channel that pretty much it has the most
black or white in areas that you want to
mask out so when I'm looking at these I
pretty much want to just mask out this
whole entire moon and this red Channel
looks like it does a pretty good job of
it I check out the blue channel you can
see there's more black and everything in
there and in the red Channel not as much
so I'm not duplicate the red Channel and
here we go I got this right here going
on so if I try to use this right now as
the color channel all this extra gray
and everything is going to show up um as
different opacities and the whites are
going to be different opacity then like
these gray areas so what we're going to
do is add the threshold adjustment image
adjustments and threshold and you can
see now that it makes a nice crisp black
and white image and if it's not perfect
just adjust the threshold down here to
where you want it to be as you can see
it goes a little different as you move
it around you can check and uncheck the
preview to see what you're looking at
just hit OK and now you've got a new
alpha mask created right from one of
your color channels and that was quick
and really easy you don't have to do any
selections or anything really so that's
how you do that now when you're working
with
more advanced images you may get some
extra artifacting or pieces of black
that might show up where you want it to
be white all you need to do is just like
any other channel here any other channel
mask just go with your brush tool and
just paint that stuff out so if I wanted
to add some little things here or
something like that and I wanted these
little squiggles to be in my mask that's
all I had to do is go ahead and paint on
my channel mask so use your paint brush
to clean up things and or some of your
selection tools so that's how you're
going to do that it's really quick and
really easy to do so thanks a lot for
watching this one really quick tutorial
really quick tip and hopefully guys you
can use it to speed up your process see
you guys later at the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
