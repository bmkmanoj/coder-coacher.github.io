your fourth walkthrough of left 4 dead 2
and start out by throwing this pipe bomb
right here and that should clear out a
path to a the guy in case you forgot I
forgot to give you an introduction what
we got to do is take this coca-cola and
deliver it to the guy that's stuck on
the roof and in return he's going to
blow up a truck for us so you know fair
trade get some coke blow up a truck so
what happens all the time or you can
just take the coke and run him be like
SIA I have myself a coca-cola party so
give it to geez Louise I never heard
someone want some coca-cola's of that
and
that so you shoot your rocket down goes
up the big tanker truck and what that's
going to do is give you half the next
part of the mission so I mean is the
only way to get through five games
coca-cola so go ahead and blast some
these zombies and yep bless yeah I see
on the roof up there just stand-in there
don't know what you're doing so go ahead
and reload and you probably need to jump
down here and wait for your teammates so
let's go ahead and wait for them you
know maybe want to look around a little
bit so now that all three of them are
down you can proceed and I see them kind
of low on health right now so here is a
good example I broke both my ankles this
icy hot in this health package it oh
yeah that makes me feel much better
after a zombie ripped off my jaw I'll
just use this band-aid to fix it so
anyways go ahead to next part and this
is actually the last part of the mission
this is the mall and what we need to do
Jacob's online what we need to do is
pretty much kill a whole bunch of
zombies and then the safe room is
actually in the mall itself so go ahead
and kill these zombies and they pretty
much leave you the way until the safe
room so if you get hurt kind of fall
behind and if you have a bio bomb or
another pipe bomb now is an awesome time
to use it because this is the last large
group of zombies so I didn't even know
there was a smoker there so if you have
11 killed this hunter real quick
all right killed that guy and like I
said this is the last group of zombies
so don't hold hold on to it for another
horde just go ahead and throw it now but
yeah like I said stay behind if you're
hurting if not you can just run forward
and lead the way and I think snake for
protecting me in just basic killing
right here yeah I see this guy on the
roof don't think I died cute well you
got that for me did you yeah your pain
in my book so below that guy's arm off
then keep walking forward and you can
actually see the safe room for right
here but let me look at that how did I
get blood on outside of the tent you see
that I don't what it what I like come
out and then we back around and then
kill this jockey real quick and now that
you killed him you're able to see right
to my right that's a safe room right
there and I ran out of bullets I'll have
to go commando using my pistol right
here so just pop it caps our problem
caps in those guys in those suits really
you're gonna start choking me those guys
in the suits are fire protected so if
you throw a multi Adam it won't do
anything so go ahead safe room close the
door and there we go oh yeah we got
plenty of room for you guys in here come
on
you can come in to save you from those
on oh you were zombies anyways close it
and you're done so thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe okay I
got the most kills as usual and I'll see
you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
