buddy here with another Illustrator cs6
tutorial and this tutorial we're gonna
teach you how to use the eyedropper tool
and you might think that it's a little
easy to use so if you have been using
Photoshop before but this hi dropper
tool is a little more advanced than the
one in Photoshop where you just you
can't just like select the color and
then select another color and I'll put
it in there for you it doesn't work like
that it's a little different in
Illustrator so I'll go over it for you
so the eyedropper tool is over here in
the tools panel down here and you can
see it because it's got like a dropper
tablet and the eye key is the hotkey it
makes it easy to pick up a color from
one area and apply it to another area
and it also picks up colors of the
strokes and it applies them as well and
it'll also pick up attributes such as
the stroke size and everything like that
too so we better go over it and show you
what's going on so the easy way to do
with this is go ahead and pick your
color pick your pick out to different
I'm sorry make two different shapes and
have different colors on them now I've
got a brown with orange and then I've
got a thick stroke here and then a light
blue with a dark blue stroke here but
the throat stroke is thin so I'm gonna
go ahead and I can click on the color
that I want to use which is this blue
I'll click on that and then you know
that it's correct and you have it
selected by the colors down here in the
bottom and if you want to apply these
settings to the other color to the other
object hold down alt and you can see the
eyedropper will change and click and it
applies the same stroke and the same
width and it also applies the colors I'm
gonna hit control Z so the way I did
that was click to get the color oh my
bad
that's what happens when you have
something selected you click and then
you pull down all and then click where
you want the color to go to
the other thing you can do is take your
pointer - or your selection tool select
the object that you want to have the
color changed so I'm gonna select this
now I take my eyedropper tool and I go
ahead and just select the color and it's
just gonna automatically change that to
the different properties and everything
there is one more I'm gonna deselect so
I don't have anything selected select my
eyedropper tool again I'm going to go
ahead and click the color that I want
which is gonna be the blue here and then
I'm gonna hold down shift and click
actually you have to click down here in
the tools panel you have to click the
color there click there and then hold
shift and click hmm why isn't that not
working it's got it there to work okay
okay we've got a hold
shift okay so select okay I was doing it
backwards select the color that you want
to get taken away and then go over to
the color that you want to get added
hold down shift and then click and then
that way you can add the color in
without messing with the stroke or
anything like that so if I wanted to do
the stroke I could click on the stroke
and then that would work that way and it
added it that way too
so that's how you can do the components
separately now there's also other
options you can use in the eyedropper
tool that I wanted to show you and you
can like take away different things so
double click on the eyedropper tool and
it brings up your eyedropper options
we've got point sample for our raster's
sample size and that's usually what you
want to have or you can have a three by
three average or a five by five average
to get an average of colors you do that
when you're like working with skin color
and the skin color actually has a bunch
of different colors in it
so you want to take an average of the
colors if you're just trying to get one
type of average skin color now you can
change here what the eyedropper actually
picks up and everything like that so if
you don't want it to pick up fill or
anything like that or if you don't want
it to pick up the stroke uncheck stroke
and you don't have to have it pick up
the stroke when you're clicking and then
when you're up or when you're applying
you can also take that off as well
as you can see the eyedropper picks up
character styles and paragraph styles as
well as well as transparency and the
focal fill so the fill its going to pick
up the color transparency and over print
so that's it for use how to use the
eyedropper tool sorry for a little bit
of confusion with the shift-clicking and
stuff like that hopefully it made sense
and I'd like to thank you guys for
watching the video give a thumbs up if
you liked the video and I look forward
to seeing you in the next one I have a
good one everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
