and have a look we've got a reporting
currently set to eat all so we are
reporting errors back to ourself as
we're developing now what happens if I
want to report errors strict errors for
example well this doesn't include a
strict so what I can do is I can specify
to say and E underscore strict now what
this is going to do is this going to
incorporate strict errors so what we're
talking about is code that will might
run but let's have a look at the
definition it might run but it it's it's
the runtime notices enable PHP suggests
changes to your code which will ensure
the best interoperability and forward
compatibility of your code so it's
basically giving you messages about your
code itself rather than errors that you
might be coming across so you don't need
to include this but maybe it's a good
idea if you want that kind of error
reporting to show however we've used
this Amberson here but what we can do is
we can say let's say eat or and use this
symbol to say well we can say ampersand
as well we can say not including a
something else so we could say not
including he notice I've just noticed as
well this example is actually written up
here um so yeah I wasn't looking at it
back our instance so err reporting a or
and II notice so what you could do is
you could specify it like this which
will show all errors except for notices
and coding standard warnings so it's not
going to show coding it's not going to
show notices and the coding standards
warning is the e strict part of it so
remember eel doesn't show each strict
now if you wanted to show code standard
warning so coding standard warning sorry
you could just do this so you've got
ease strict here
so it's up to you what level of output
you want you can mess around listen once
you've got your application may be built
bigger you can turn this on have a look
I mean and keep it on anyway but it's
good idea to fiddle around and see what
you can come out with on this especially
if you're getting a blank page you can
change this to say just eat or so when
you finish developing on your web server
you should probably always turn this off
and why the reason being is that if
errors do occur in your page especially
East Ric notices you don't want your
viewers to or your visitors on your
website to be seeing East Ric notices
nor do you want them to see errors if
you've maybe trying to include a file
somewhere for example if you're trying
to include a file somewhere and it can't
be found and you're returning an error
what's happening is then they're
understanding the structure of your
website so for security reasons it's
probably best to turn our report into
zero either in your local web server
when you release this to the public so
you if you would say have paid serve it
paid hosting you might not be able to
get access to PHP to ini
however you can use a couple of
functions to change values and that's
what I'm going to go over just now so
what happens if we want to dynamically
update this value inside PHP now let's
close PHP dot ini and we'll have a look
inside here so what we can actually do
is let's get rid of our side content as
well what we can actually do is we can
specify error reporting either like this
so we can say error reporting zero and I
don't think it's working on my
installation at the moment yeah and
let's just get rid of that see what
happens yeah okay so error reporting
zero you can then change it to say e all
and then refresh the page and you can
see oh no we're not getting that back
maybe we could
now okay so it's not working on my my
installation just yet
however you can use error reporting and
maybe on like a public server you can
also use things like ini set' is a great
function to up update values in your PHP
ini so you can say pip I and I set error
reporting II all so then I don't think
this is going to work either for my
installation though but um the idea of
this is that you are dynamically setting
your ini file or you're just using the
error reporting function on its own to
change these values I think with the
ayah nice set you don't need to include
these so it's just like that regardless
of whether it still works on my note
doesn't so that's a bit about error
reporting and how you can produce either
produce errors or hide errors from
either yourself or the public and a bit
of information about why you should turn
it off as well as some examples of
setting this up on the fly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
