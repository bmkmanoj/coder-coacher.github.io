21st video in project Lisa and in this
video I'm going to be teaching you guys
how to create this drop-down list right
here never saying this is going to be a
pretty dumb video because I already know
how to create a drop-down list it's like
the first thing I ever learned well
actually this is no ordinary drop-down
list although it may look like one at
first glance what this is is a smart
drop-down list now what this is is
basically whenever a user searches for
items like youtube they can go ahead and
search all categories or they can go
ahead and search a specific category
such as I don't know arm computer or
let's go ahead and make sense say
they're searching for a YouTube t-shirt
so they would go ahead and search
clothing and accessories now when they
go ahead and hit search it takes you to
your search page and you get all the
results however if you notice the
category gets passed through the URL and
the default form option is now clothing
and accessories so not only does it
search the clothing and accessories
section of the database but also retains
that value and this just makes it a
whole lot easier to navigate your
searches and I'm going to be showing you
guys how to pretty much include this
feature on the website right now so
before you even get started with that
the first thing that we need to do is
some housekeeping stuff remember when
you made the header in search code and
we said right here is where whenever we
build our links this is where the
function needs to go well guess what in
the last couple tutorials we built our
links so let's go ahead and copy this
function and that's where it goes so
basically hold on got H in my ear there
we go so basically our links are going
to get outputted right in between this
right aligned div so they go right here
exactly where we need them to be and now
what we want to do is this space right
here was reserved for the list of
categories this is where we make pretty
much our category drop-down menu that I
just showed you guys at the beginning of
this video now that's the function we're
going to be creating in this tutorial
however we didn't name the function yet
obviously because we didn't create it
yet so
go ahead and name this create category
list and that's where we're going to be
making so basically the header and
search code this function is one hundred
percent complete this function is one
hundred percent complete the only other
thing we need to do is code create
category list and we'll be good to go
now what I did in between the last
tutorial in this tutorial is I actually
made one more function now I didn't want
to make a video of me coding this
because it's basically the same exact
thing over and over and over again and
it takes like 10 minutes the code and it
would just be incredibly boring so what
this function is it's a super easy
function it's called number two category
you pass it in a number from zero to
whatever and it basically tests what
that number is and it returns a string
or a category so basically if we pass
the function in the number 21 it would
have returned the string tools and home
improvement now I'll show you why I
needed to make this function later on
basically it makes it a whole lot easier
whenever you're working with categories
but now let's go ahead and learn how to
create that smart drop-down menu right
here that retains the value so let me go
ahead and code this baby right under top
right links and right over a number two
category so the first thing we need to
do or the first thing I always like to
do is add a little comment and i'm going
to go ahead and write creates category
options hello for search bar there we go
now of course what did I name this great
category list so function create
category I'm actually just going to copy
that because you definitely don't want
to have a typo whenever working with
functions or else it's going to call the
round function so of course it doesn't
take any parameters and the job of this
function is basically to create the HTML
that's necessary for making up this
drop-down list now the first very first
thing we're going to do is we want to
look at the URL and see if the user is
searching in a specific category right
now now the reason we want to do that
isn't because we want to query the
database that only searches for clothing
and accessories but we need that we need
to see if they're searching in a
specific category because if they are
then we want to make that option the
default option the first option that you
see I got to stop saying that the first
option that you see whenever you create
that form so basically if clothing and
accessories they're researching in then
that's the value that they want to see
in their form so in order to do that you
just need a simple if statement so if
and another thing this is kind of
security I like the data check all my
stuff first of all because if you notice
when you say category equals seven right
now that seven is a digit we don't want
them to a you know pass in any
JavaScript or PHP or malicious sqo into
our database so what I like to do is I
need to confirm that this is indeed a
numerical value because of course
whenever I talk about security later on
I'll show you guys how you can actually
hack websites doing that but for now
check it out c-type underscore digit is
a built-in function that basically you
pass it in a variable and it returns
true if that value is a number and if
it's like a stray
or if it's just some random characters
it's going to return false so we want to
do is we want to get that value from the
URL now the value from the URL is called
get category now again this is only
going to return true if that number in
the URL is a digit or a numerical value
so if that number is indeed an American
numerical value then what we want to do
is go ahead and take a variable X I just
named that up I mean I made that up and
we want to set it equal to this thing
right here copy and the reason i put on
my entire if else statement on one line
is because this is a incredibly simple
one and whenever I make really simple
if-else statements I like to put them on
one line I know it's just easier for me
to see else let's go ahead and set x
equal to 999 actually we don't even need
a x equals 9 99 so basically if the
category they're searching for is a
numerical number because of course what
other number would it be then we're
going to set equal to whatever number it
is so in this case let me just go ahead
and make a search real quick search for
computer now computer category is 9 so
in this case X would be equal to 9
however if they're just searching for
all categories or something X would be
equal to 999 which is just a random
number i set x equal to because no
category is equal to 999</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
