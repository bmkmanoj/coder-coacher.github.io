and welcome to your very first tutorial
in the r programming language now my
guess is that if you're watching this
video you already know what R is and
what it's used for but for those people
who maybe just heard of it before and
they wanted to check out a video to
learn what it is let me go ahead and
take a few seconds and explain that well
R is is it's a computer programming
language made specifically for
statistics and I'm talking about with
this program you can do things like
graph charts and graphs and a whole
bunch of stuff let me actually go ahead
and show you guys a couple examples and
before you guys are like alright see you
later Bucky I'm not a math nerd I'm not
going to school for statistics I'll
catch you in the next video wait just a
second for anyone who has ever
programmed and is actually interested in
ever graphing charts or graphs or
anything like that you probably want to
stick around and learn this because it's
not just for math majors or people that
are you know obsessed with statistics or
anything like that this can be useful in
any program and actually the software
that we're going to be using to learn is
actually incredibly powerful and you can
make awesome charts graphs in look at
this thing I don't even know what the
heck it's called but it's graphic that
was created in this program and it's it
looks confusing right now but it's
actually very powerful and really easy
to use once you get the basics of it so
hopefully I got you guys a little
interested in it so the first thing that
we actually need to do is download the
software that allows us to run our so if
you go to this website right here cran R
- project org then you can see that
there are a couple different links here
and downloading it is actually you know
really really easy if you ever
downloaded anything in your life you
probably know how to do
but let's just go ahead and I'm running
Windows in if you uh if you have Linux
or Mac it's going to be easy free but
I'm going to show you guys how to
download it on Windows and I don't have
it on my computer so I'm going to click
install are for the first time and
la-la-la-la-la have to click something
else right here download are for Windows
so oh great
don't tell me this is going to take like
a minute now I got to tell you guys like
a story or something
alright oh I know a story so last night
arm
it was raining out and I always keep my
garage door open um but I don't know
just cause like I like to air it out
because it's kind of like musty and
stinky in there but anyways I closed my
house my garage door is still open and
it was raining so a skunk decided to
walk in my garage because you know get
out of the rain Hey Bucky's garage is
open because he's an idiot I'll just
walk in there so I opened the door
because I was going to actually close
the garage door and I saw this skunk and
I just looked at them and he looked at
me and he's like what's up and
thankfully he didn't like shoot me or
spray me or whatever or whatever it's
called so uh he just saw um I closed the
door slowly as not to spook him and he
ran away so you know thank God for that
alright so pretty awful story but now
that our is downloaded let's just go
ahead and double click that Exe file and
also I want to mention if you go to
Bucky downloads or wherever your
downloads are it's going to be where is
it this thing right here the files car
are - in whatever version it is so go
ahead and double click that and as you
can see it says hey dude you want to run
this heck yeah we do so run that yes
okay and you're pretty much going to
select all of the defaults so next next
and if you don't know what type of
operating system we have then um the
thing is if you have any rate um like
recent computer you probably have 64-bit
but if you don't know then just go ahead
and install all the files I know I have
64-bit so I'm just going to go ahead and
click Next and next next see I told you
guys this was incredibly easy and
another thing I want to mention is since
this is basically the core program once
we have this on our computer we can use
the our programming language however
what we're going to be doing is we're
going to be actually um downloading
another program that allows allows us to
work with it a lot easier it's a piece
of software called IDE and that's what
we're going to be using to actually do
all our tutorials in so we really don't
need this desktop icon right here
because we're going to be using
something else this is just the base so
you can go ahead and uncheck that click
Next and zip it boo boo put a boom oh
yeah you guys like my background oh are
you looking at I'm gonna cover those bad
boys up alright I like here but uh I
think my Dreamgirl is a rachel mcadams
or natalie portman I can't decide which
one I want to date once I do you know
probably settle down probably going to
be Rachel McAdams Rachel if you're
listening
all right come cheese I need a new
computer someone sent me a new computer
this is taken away to sticking along
alright so finish this and check it out
we now have our on our computer so if
you don't believe me just open up your
programs and you can see our x64 which
means 64-bit three one oh boom roasted
alright so in the next video what I'm
going to be doing is now that we have
our installed in our computer says
alright you can do crafts with our now
I'm going to be showing you guys have to
download the program that we're actually
going to be using that makes our 10
times better
so thank you guys for watching don't
forget subscribe and I'll see you guys
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
