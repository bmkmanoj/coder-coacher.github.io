slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're gonna be
learning more about graphics now if you
remember from the previous tutorial we
created this program that wherever you
click it draws a square and then if you
animate the square it'll go ahead and
move it backwards and if you click it'll
create a new square and start animating
that one backwards too and if it hits
the line I mean it'll go back to the
other side so if you don't know what
that is then you may want to move back
and learn how to do that first that is
not you don't have to know how to do
that
but it's good to have a basic knowledge
of graphics before you move into this
tutorial right here so whenever they
click animate rectangle what we want to
do is let's just comment out time or
animate start so it will animate a
square for us
we'll have it do something else so we'll
just type G dot draw a line and let's
just do pins dot black and now we're
gonna need a point of type system dot
drawing dot point so we'll just create a
new point object and let's just make it
10 across and 15 down and now for the
point two we're gonna create another new
point now a point is basically a
coordinate on whatever object your
graphics was created for so see 50
across and 90 down so what am i what I
mean by this is it's gonna be a point on
form 1 because we set G equal to me dot
create graphics and me just refers to
form 1 so this point is going to be a
point on forum 1 10 pixels pixels across
and 15 pixels down and we have to create
a new point a new object and the point
and this point is going to be 50 pixels
across and 90 pixels down
so we'll go ahead and run this and you
can see that when we click animate
rectangle is going to draw a line for us
so we'll go ahead let's change this to
one hundred across go ahead and run it
and when we click animate rectangle it
draws at point ten across or it starts
from the top left corner goes ten across
and 15 down and then the second point is
100 across and then 90 down so let's
look at another way to use points so
let's go ahead and comment this out and
what we need to do is come up here and
it will create an array of points so
we'll call it poly points poly for
polygons as point we don't need to
create a new point because we're making
an array of type point we're not making
an object a point object so now let's
set some values in our array of points
so for each index of the array we're
gonna have to create a new point object
and you can see here that the arguments
it takes x position and y position so
for the x position let's just do ten ten
and then we'll create some other new
points so new point 20 20 new point
twenty ten and then it will make one
more new point at let's say 40 across
and 50 down well there we'll go ahead
and close it off with a curly brace so
now we have an array of points now we
can use this array to draw a polygon so
we'll just type g dot draw draw a
polygon and you can see that it takes
two arguments
our pen and our points so let's just go
ahead
instead of draw polygons let's do fill
polygons so you can see it'll fill in
the whole polygon for us and you can see
better what it looks like
so what you brush is dot black and then
we're gonna need an array of points you
can see here that it says points and
then it has empty parameters as system
dot dot drawing dot point so points is
an array
it's what the array is called inside of
the fill polygon method we don't know
what this actually does but all we need
to do is pass a brush and an array of
points and it will do everything for us
so we're just going to use the array
poly points so go ahead and close that
off now if we go ahead and run this you
see that we click animate rectangle it
fills in this polygon for us so let's go
ahead and make it a little bit bigger so
point one is ten by ten let's make this
one thirty across and fifty down and
then we'll do forty across and 100 down
so maybe you'll be able to see the
polygon a little bit better so you can
see here that it drew one two three four
points and they are at points ten ten
thirty across and fifty down which is
one of these I don't know which one it
is forty-eight across and 100 down which
is this bottom one and then we got forty
across and fifty down so go ahead
practice a little bit with filling
polygons and drawing lines by using
point objects and then once you get
familiar with that go ahead and move on
to the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
