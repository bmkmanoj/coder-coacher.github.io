sixth iPhone development tutorial and
now that we got all of our code bill
what we want to do is go ahead up to
here build and we want to build it and
this is gonna pretty much build it and
make sure that we don't get any errors
if you do have an error go back and fix
it but it should be good if you follow
my tutorial correctly so now as promised
now that we've got all that tedious work
done we can go ahead and jump into
buckey's button view controller or under
your resources file whatever your
project name is view controller dot xib
double click that and it'll pop up your
interface builder for you so go ahead
and I'm gonna arrange everything nice
and neat and now we can go ahead and add
all those labels and text the screen so
the first thing we want to do is add a
label to the top of screen remember and
go ahead and just expand this a little
bit there we go and you actually want to
go ahead and delete this text because
remember we're gonna have the buttons
titles pass in whatever title is it
pop-up for text so we don't want
anything there by default just keep it
in the top so now we have a label a
blank a label with no text on top of our
screen so now let's go ahead and add two
buttons go ahead and add one right there
and go ahead and add another one right
there it looks good it really doesn't
matter where you add on your screen and
go ahead and add a title to each of
these buttons go ahead and you know
double click it by the way to add a
title set this one to blue and set one
this one equal to red and now go ahead
and using your attributes and if you
can't find any of this toolbars make
sure tools inspector that's where they
all are
so go ahead and change the text color of
this to well it already is blue isn't it
text color
blue and change this text color to red
so now we have blue text and red text
pretty sweet huh and actually if you
click the button and click a red it adds
that little red border around it so now
I have a pretty sweet blue button and a
pretty sweet red button and a label at
the top so we have three objects on our
screen so what exactly do we do from
here well what we can do from here gets
kind of tricky so you might want to
listen up remember that we have these
two classes right here called view
controller actually there are two
classes is one class called view
controller now whenever you create your
interface builder that class is the
files owner whatever class you make is
the files owner of that nib file of that
xib interface builder file so this file
owner is pretty much that class so for
saying all right why is this important
why do I need to know will file owner or
any of this suffice well since we know
that files owner is the class and since
we have a bunch of objects on screen I
mean check this out we have a bunch of
code in our class we have a bunch of
outlets we have some actions and we help
all these objects on the screen how
exactly do we link each object each owl
and stuff like that well check this out
anytime you want to link an object to an
outlet and remember with an outlet you
can actually change what's on the screen
check this out we have an outlet in our
class that we built specifically for
this this label right here so what you
want to do is this anytime you have
outlet in your class and you want to
connect it to any object on your screen
go ahead select file owner hold down
control on your keyboard with a finger
or anything you want I prefer a finger
drag file owner until it hovers over
that label and once it's on that label
let go of it with your mouse and now you
can see all your outlet
and now you can pick what outlet from
that class
aka what outlet from that files owner do
you want to use so if you have 800
outlets you can pick what one you want
to use we only have one outlet and
that's labels text so that's how we
connect it now check this out in order
that when you click a button an action
gets called here's what you need to do
go ahead and select that button I'm
gonna select the blue button and now you
see where there's button attributes if
you go ahead and click this tab right
here you get button connections in the
button connections tab is how you can
connect a button to an action now here
is all the stuff yeah amazing huh
this is all the stuff that you can do
with a one button I mean it's pretty
much this you can touch a button you can
drag inside a button you can hold down a
button and drag on the outside you can
touch a button twice tap your nose do a
circle dunk a basketball and then you
know touch the button again they pretty
much included every possible thing that
you can do a button but what we want to
focus on is touch up inside this is your
basic tapping of a button now since
we're already working with a button
here's what we do take whenever we tap
this button go ahead click down hold
down drag it over to files owner right
here and let go no need to hold down
control in this and now this will give
you all the actions possible that what
you want to happen whenever you tap that
bun we want whenever you tap this fun
use the clicked action right there and
let's do the same thing for red the
button connectors touch up inside drag
it over to files owner what action do
you want to do whenever you click this
fun that clicked method we did right
there so now what we need to do from
here is go ahead and save it and now in
our Xcode right here let's go ahead and
build and run this so it pops up and now
we go ahead and click blue and blue pops
up we click not
we click red red pops up blue red red
blue BAM that's our program that's how
it works
pretty sweet so again one last time let
me go exit out of this iPhone simulator
what we did is whenever we clicked this
blue button what happened it called this
clipped method right here and it passed
in blue that blue button as the sender
so we said all right we pretty much want
to take that blue button in this case
and get the title of it and store it in
an object called title of button and now
we want to get the new label text from
it and pretty much the new label text is
equal to the title of the button and now
take that new label and replace it with
the old label and then release it when
we're done so get the title of the
button create a new label from it set
the label text equal that label make
sure it prints out on screen and then
release it when we're done
so that's that that is how you build
some simple user interactions and trust
me by the end of these stories you're
going to be a pro you aren't even going
to be thinking about this is just going
to come so natural and easy to you this
stuff is gonna make perfect sense so I
