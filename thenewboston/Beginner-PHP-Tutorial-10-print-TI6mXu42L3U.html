this is another video tutorial produced
for the new boston this time we're going
to be talking about the print language
construct in PHP now you can see that I
am using the previous echo example here
from the previous video talking about
echoing out data to the users browser or
string data to the users browser now
print does not differ whatsoever just
for the purposes of this tutorial I'm
going to just change this text to hello
with an exclamation mark so I'm also
going to change this to print you can
see my text editor has highlighted this
blue again so we can see that this is
this is a language construct and it's
still valid however when we refresh we
get exactly the same result as we do
with echo now you may be thinking while
they're two different now print works
slightly different to echo in the way
that it is an actually an older way to
in a more sort of traditional way if you
like to print data out basically I mean
to the browser in this case so it's also
slower to use and an echo and if you
wanted to be really petty it also has
more characters so people tend to find
it's quicker to use echo also when we're
using print traditionally we would use
brackets as it behaves more like a
function even though it still is a
language construct so basically in short
it's a lot better to use echo and the
main reason for this is it being a lot
quicker using less system resources so
even though you can use print and later
on in the tutorial series we will come
across things like print are which
aren't in fact
too tightly related to print itself but
you will maybe come across print at some
point in programs however if you're
programming sort of from now on we're
going to be using echo and it's probably
better to use echo as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
