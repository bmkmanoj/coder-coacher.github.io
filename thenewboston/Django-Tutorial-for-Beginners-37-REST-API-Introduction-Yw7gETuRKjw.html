little mini series that I'm going to
start making right now I'm going to be
showing you guys how to make a REST API
so if you guys don't know what a REST
API is let me explain it real quick
again I'm sure the majority of you do
but I'm going to explain it in real
simple terms so let's pretend that you
had this startup idea kind of like I
don't know Twitter or something so you
made this website and you set up all
your code and you connect it to the
database and everything was working fine
but then you got more users and they're
like hey it would be cool to have an
iPhone app so you started making this
app and you're like alright now I need
to figure out how I phones can connect
my database online that's going to be a
pain in the butt but whatever next thing
you make is an Android app so you have
to figure out how to connect your
website's data from there and then let's
say you want to make some weird software
application for the desktop learning all
that stuff is going to be a pain in the
butt and confusing and incredibly
complicated or what you can do is you
can actually avoid all that by creating
a REST API so nowadays whenever you are
starting a website or some startup this
is actually one of the first things that
people make so what it is is way that
you can have any device in the world
access your website's data through this
common kind of format and the one that
we're going to be creating is Jason so
JSON it's just a data format it's not
specific to any device or whatever and
once we have this way to communicate
between any device in your website then
you can go ahead and make Android apps
iPhone apps software you can actually
use your API for your website that's
what a lot of people do and it's going
to allow you to grow super fast and
again like I said 99% of the startups
nowadays this is actually one of the
first things they create so let's go
ahead and get started so what I did
already is I actually just cleared
everything out I want to start from
scratch since we can't really you know
build on what we already learn it's kind
of like starting from new so you
actually need to install the rest
framework first so all you have to do I
already have installed but you
sorry pip install Django rest framework
and just go ahead and run that or if
you're using pycharm then you can
actually do it from the settings like
you install your other packages but once
you have that installed then go ahead
and start your project or you can
install it after it really doesn't
matter so after this I'm just going to
go ahead and create one app and for the
sample application what I'm going to do
is I'm just going to store stock
information so that way if you want to
connect to it and see okay what was the
price of Yahoo today what was the price
of Facebook you can do that and then
later on if you want to make like iPhone
app or Android app you can do it really
simply so this was just the first idea
that popped in my head but you can do it
if you're making a website like Facebook
or Twitter or YouTube or just stock data
whatever you can dream up this is going
to work so I'm going to go ahead and
just start a simple app so Python
managed up you I start app companies
maybe I should name it stocks but I
don't know it's going to have a bunch of
company information so there you go all
right so before you started with the fun
stuff we just need to take care of some
kind of housekeeping and that is pop
open your settings and we need to
configure everything so down in your
installed apps again make sure that you
have the rest framework installed so
rest framework and also we need to let
Django know that hey we created this app
right here companies so you just go
companies app companies config all right
so now Django knows that we are using
the rest framework and we have app
called company's looking good mate so
now what we can do is we can actually
hop over to companies models and just
start making your class of you know
users or blog post or in this case I'm
just going to have stock data so I'm
just going to say class
stock models model</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
