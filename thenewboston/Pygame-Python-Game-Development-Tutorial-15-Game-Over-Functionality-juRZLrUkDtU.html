Python programming dotnet with another
tutorial for the New Boston where we
left off we're working on our PI in here
we can go left right up and down and
crash into our barriers but obviously
our code is a little messy most
importantly right now at this point we
don't have a game loop so to speak so
that's what we're going to fix up in
this one also obviously the message the
screen was no good I mean it just idled
there for two seconds it went away we
really need basically two handling so
one is a handling for just a game over
and then there's a game exit right so
game over doesn't necessarily mean game
exit right now it does and we don't
really want that so now what we're going
to do is we're going to convert to it a
game loop so to speak so right above
while not game exit will define game
loop and empty parameters now highlight
everything from this while not game exit
all the way to the bottom and just hit
tab and what that's going to do is it's
going to tab over that in all of that
code and so for anyone who's not
familiar you can highlight blocks of
code and you can hit tab and that moves
them over and conversely if you want to
move them back you can hold control and
then the opening square brackets which
is this right here
right so control plus that and that will
move the code over um so once we've done
that now we've got game loop and then in
theory what we should be able to do is
just call game loop down here so we
would say game loop so we call game loop
to run and that's it but we do have to
move down any variables that we intend
to change because right now these
variables are acting almost like
constants so that's okay we can
reference these variables but we can't
actually change these variables so
anything that we don't need to change we
can leave up here so like white black
red that's not going to change so we can
leave that up there in theory we can let
display width and height change like
down the road but for now we'll leave
that right there
but what can change is game exit right
lead X&amp;amp;Y can change lead X change lead Y
change can change and then the rest of
the stuff we will
changing so highlight all that ctrl-x to
cut it and then we'll come down into
game loop and then we'll paste it in and
then we're going to have to tab some of
this stuff over again so we'll just tap
that over and now we have all of the
necessary variables or at least we
should so let's go ahead and save and
run that really quick and make sure that
worked out okay so our little guy is
able to move now it's crash you lose go
outside you fool man okay so so we got
that working and now we've got plenty of
time so I think we can go ahead and add
the next thing I would like to add so
right now we've got the displaying of
the message to screen we're really like
what would be nice is to have some sort
of like game over functionality so what
we would do instead is so like when we
run this and we run off the screen
it just says this message but maybe the
person would like to play again so like
what I've what if the player wants to
play again so we've got game exit equals
false and then we should also probably
have a game over and then start that as
equal false and then instead of like
this will still stay true but then we'll
have like okay so you've got while not
game exit so this game over question
should still occur under wall not game
exit but then we need another loop
that's going to be Wow game over equals
and in this case true so we're going to
say wild game over equals true we want
to run a specific block of code so while
game over is true we want to do a few
things first of all we're going to go
game display fill and we're going to
fill the background with white then
we're going to send a message to the
screen and we're going to say a message
to scream and the message is going to be
a game over press which price press C to
play again
or Q to quit okay so we'll do that and
we'll make the color here we'll make it
red and come back down here and we fix
this okay and so that's our message to
screen and then we want to go ahead and
do a PI game dot display update so we
can see that message whoops so we can
see that message and then finally we're
gonna we're gonna have an event loop
right because just like down here we're
having an event loop for the actual game
the game over is kind of like a sequence
right and then we also have like main
menu that can be a sequence as well so a
game over plus C press C to play again
our cue to quit update and then we're
going to come down here and we're going
to do basically the same thing we've
done here so we're going to ask a for
event in PI game event dot date and then
we're going to say if event dot type
equals PI game dot keydown and all caps
and then we're going to ask if event dot
key equals PI game dot capital K
underscore Q that's quit right so if
that is quit then we're going to say um
well we have a few things to say first
of all we want to say game exit equals
true and then game over has to equal
false so if if we never said it it would
be really easy to be like ok well if the
if event key is quit then we just run
game X and equals true right no because
this is a while loop so we already asked
while not game exit and now we're in
this while loop so this loop will run
indefinitely until game over is false
so we have to set game over equals false
in order for this game exit equals true
to trigger and exit the game for us so
just keep that in mind now we have to
handle our other event which is C to
play again so if event dot key equals Pi
game K underscore C
what do we want to do what we want to
run the game loop right we just want to
run that function over again which just
so it just revert back to itself
basically so we run game loop and it all
starts over again
so basically we're calling game loop
within game loop so kind of an
interesting thing there but anyway so
now that should all be good oh oh we'll
get rid of this - we'll get rid of this
basically all of this right here well
get rid of it let's see I don't think we
need any of this these three lines right
here so get rid of that the other stuff
we've already been updating okay so
let's save that run it see how well that
works out a syntax error one amateur if
event dot type double equals
whoops double equals still and I think
that's the only one so let's run that
again and so now we have our game here
we can move around and we'll hit the
wall we just got a straight exit let's
see oh I know we did so we didn't set
game over equals true when we at a fail
so right now it's just game max it
equals true in reality we need to call
this game over equals true like that so
let's run that one more time okay plan
and boom so now it says a game over
press C to play again or Q to quit so
let's press C and look at that we reset
and we're ready to play again and now
let's try Q I'll press Q and that's it
so the game exits so now we have like
you know a game over vs. game exit which
is absolutely necessary it's not the
prettiest so I can't at that message
remember we centered that message that
was a great idea wasn't it but here's
the problems we centered as according to
the top left of the basically when you
put a text object your even though it
doesn't look like it to you or maybe you
can visualize it at least there's
actually a rectangle around the text
object and so when it goes to center
that text object is going to Center as
anything else would by the upper left
corner so in this case that upper left
corner of G is perfectly centered but as
you can see the message is
well were to the right so that's not I
mean ice that doesn't look the best so
so we're going to fix that too in the
future but anyway the functionality is
there so first I kind of wanted us to
just at least get the functionality down
and then we can worry about some more of
the aesthetics and stuff like that but
we'll get to that don't worry so anyway
that's it for this tutorial I hope you
guys enjoyed as always thanks for
watching and stay tuned to the next
