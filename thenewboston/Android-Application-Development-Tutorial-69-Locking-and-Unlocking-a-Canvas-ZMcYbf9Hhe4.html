tutorial we're finally actually gonna
get something on a canvas and something
within our activity that's gonna display
now that we have our threads set up and
it's gonna start when the this
constructor is called from our graphics
surface class it's gonna you know start
this thread this thread and it's going
to use this run method so we're going to
define what is what a thread actually
does in this tutorial so first thing we
want to do is create a while loop so
it's just gonna loop through and kind of
update our canvas so what we're gonna do
is say while true for now actually let's
just create a variable we're gonna say
while is running and then we have to
define what this is running variable is
which is gonna be boolean so we're gonna
say is running and we're gonna set this
equal to true to start out with so this
is gonna be true and it's gonna do
whatever is within this while loop so
there we go we have our loop setup now
now the first thing we want to do is
check if our surface is valid and again
that's what this holder does and one of
the methods that this holder can do so
we're gonna set basically an if
statement to check if you know the
surface is valid first thing you guys
want to do within here is put an
exponent what does that expression mark
think that's that's what that's called
basically put that first and then we're
gonna say our holder now we're gonna say
dot get surface and then hit dot is
valid I'll explain this in a second but
just hit enter and continue beneath that
and then after that this is where the
magic is gonna happen down here we're
actually gonna get our canvas and start
working with it now let me explain what
this if and what this continue is and
what this expression marks doing
basically the expression is saying not
so if this is not valid
we're gonna continue again we don't have
to put brackets if it's only doing one
line for if statement so if if the
surface is not valid it's just gonna say
continue now what continue is it's
pretty much like a break when we use
switching case because once it hits the
break it's gonna break out of the switch
in case loop or whatever and you know
this will break out of our while loop if
it hits this break statement and it
won't get to the magic down here what
continue does is it allows us to still
continue within our loop but it's still
not going to hit this this magic down
here until you know our surface is valid
once it's valid this statements gonna be
false and it's gonna skip over this
continue and it's going to get to the
magic so it's just gonna loop through
here when the surface is not valid keep
looping right here until it once the
surface is valid again it's gonna skip
down here and do the magic I know I said
that in like five different five
different times the same thing but just
kind of want to get you guys to
understand that now what we're gonna do
is we're gonna set up a canvas again we
need to paint on this we're gonna you
know not everything happened and we're
just gonna call it canvas just like our
previous previous time we worked with
the canvas and you have to import canvas
I must have already done that or
something and what we're gonna set this
canvas equal to is our holder and we're
gonna walk the canvas to start out with
so we're gonna say walk canvas so
basically what's happening is we have
this master piece we have this great
idea and we want to paint it so we're
gonna lock our door and then we're gonna
paint on our canvas and then we're gonna
unlock our door and show the whole world
what we what we came up with basically
is what we're we're doing within this
within a sloop here so we're locking the
canvas so no other classes no other
activities can access this canvas that's
the point of locking it no other threads
can get to it and so once it's locked
this is where we're gonna start painting
on it or drawing on it I should say so
we're gonna say canvas dot
draw RGB then we're going to put some
random values in here so like to those
to have it be pretty blue here hopefully
I think that's how it works I don't know
so basically we're just drawing the
background color here and now that we
come up with his masterpiece this
background we're gonna unlock our canvas
and display it so we're gonna say now
our holder dot unlock canvas and post
and it takes a canvas within its
parameters again this is what we set up
here so it's gonna unlock our canvas now
and post it and that's basically it for
this tutorial we set up a run method and
we start our thread here while we create
our thread and then we start our thread
which is gonna go through all this stuff
so let's just make sure it works and
we'll kind of clean up this thread and
I'll show you guys some other stuff you
can do in the next tutorial
getting pretty late so sorry if I'm like
falling asleep on you guys here but
hopefully we don't get any airs you guys
whatever you have to define that in the
manifest there we go we have our canvas
displayed everything's working properly
with the surface view and our thread and
all that good stuff so seems to work and
I'll catch you guys in the next tutorial
