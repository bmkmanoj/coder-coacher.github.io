the back tires so before you even touch
your tire we want to do is you want to
make sure that your doe car is jacked up
enough so you can get the tire on there
if it can't fit on there for example
it's too low then just go ahead and
obviously Jack this up a little bit more
so you have room slide it on now the
next thing you want to do is you want to
make sure that your tires going on in
proper direction click put it on this
way or do I put on this way
doesn't even matter well yes it does if
you go ahead and look at the tread on
your tire most tires have a arrow-shaped
tread now unless it's like racing slicks
or something weird like that the tread
on your tire is going to go in a
specific way as you can see this tread
looks like an arrow that's pointing down
so you want to make sure that the tread
is pointing forward so just like that
forward is over here now we'll go ahead
and lift your tire on magnets so make
sure it's nice and even and by the way
make sure that your parking brake is on
right now and now go ahead and hand
tighten your lug nuts
now most tires on your car or on your
whatever whatever the vehicle you have
they have lug nuts which is like a big
bolt that goes over the lug stud but on
this one right here they actually have
washers why why they decide to go with
that idea I don't know but they have a
regular washer and a lock washer and
then they just happen none so go ahead
and hand tighten all of those now that
these are hand tight we can go ahead and
grab a tool and start tightening them
with the tool so whenever you have four
studs what you want to do is you want to
tighten them in this order opposites
first so this one then this one and then
the two ones other than that this one
then this one so one two three four now
the reason you want to tighten opposite
ones first is because it lets your tire
go on more evenly now just for you know
extra information whenever you have five
because ciders usually have five or four
lug studs you want to tire tighten them
like a star
so one two three four five so that's the
rule so let's go ahead and start with
this one right here and I got the wrong
size socket awesome all right this one
should work a little bit better so let's
go ahead and tighten this one first
there we go have the opposite one there
we go this one and lastly this one are
so now all of our lug nuts are tightened
now you see whenever you're changing a
car or something as you can see I have a
little bit of trouble there because
whenever I would start spinning this or
trying to tighten it my tire would turn
with it now things have pretty big
treads I can just go ahead and hold on
to it and get a good grip but usually
with cars they don't have as biggest
transition it's usually a problem trying
to tighten it in your tire spinning so
that's the case just tying them as much
as you can with a tool and then you want
to lower your jack and once this is on
the floor it won't spin at all because
you know you can't move your entire car
so once this is on the floor after you
lower your jack you want to tighten them
again in the same order so now that our
rear tires are installed we're writing
along to the next part and guys I should
mention this I know I didn't make a
video on how to install the front tire
but it's pretty much the same exact
method so you know I don't think I need
to tell you guys how to do every single
tire it's the same as this one something
guys we're watching don't you subscribe
and I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
