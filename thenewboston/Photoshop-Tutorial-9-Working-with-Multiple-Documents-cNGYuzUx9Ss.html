welcome to your ninth video I cannot
believe you guys are still watching
these tutorials congratulations and
here's a fun fact I actually recorded
this tutorial about five minutes ago
but then I went to edit it and I noticed
that the mute was on my microphone so I
recorded the whole video and I had no
audio frickin ridiculous I anyways in
this video what I'm going to do is I'm
going to show you guys some really cool
tricks when working with multiple
documents so we already know how to work
with one document right here but say we
want to work with more than one document
so let me just go ahead and open up
another one a Statue of Liberty and if I
open a picture on my sister it doesn't
really matter which documents you open
now of course just like panels on the
right hand side anytime you want to
switch between documents just go ahead
and click on the different tabs easy
enough but clicking takes a lot of work
and burns a lot of calories and we want
to put those calories towards something
more useful like watching TV so in order
to do this the lazy way go ahead and
hold down control on your keyboard and
hit the tab button and once you hit the
tab as you can see it cycles between
your documents without ever having to
touch the mouse super lazy and that is
super awesome because lazy equals
awesome now say that you don't just want
to see one document at a time but you
want to work with multiple or in other
words you want to view more than one
picture at a time whenever you're
working so in order to do that we need
to change the layout of our interface
now anytime we want to change the layout
go to window arrange and if you look
closely at these options you can see the
icons give you a little preview of what
to expect so for example this 3 up
horizontal is going to stack each of
your documents horizontally pretty cool
now my favorite one whenever working
with three is three up stacked that kind
of sounds like an insult well you just
got three upset oh then you uppercut
them in the face so if you click that
you get one on the left and by the way
this is a puppy
I'm getting its six weeks old and I have
to wait till it's eight weeks to pick it
up but this is going to be my new
freaking bloodhound puppy love it
already
but anyways one image on the left and
then two on the right-hand side and of
course the default is called consolidate
all to tabs doesn't really sound like it
insult boy he just got consolidated off
the tabs like what and they'll probably
drop kick you if you said that but
anyways that is how you rearrange your
layout and another cool way that you can
rearrange your documents is just the
switch the order of the tabs now you
probably want to switch the order of the
tabs maybe you took five pictures of
someone hopping over a box in
chronological order so you don't want to
have them like one three five two four
you want them one two three four five so
in order to change the order of your
tabs just go ahead and drag them and
drop them left or right so now Hass is
first if I wanted this last and just go
ahead and put it last there you go
now the last thing I want to show you
guys how to do is how to make a tab a
floating window so say that I wanted
this puppy to be its own separate window
kind of like we did with the panel's
just go ahead and hold on to the tab
drag it drag it out into this gray area
and drop it now whenever we drop it as
you can see it's its own floating window
just like a Microsoft Windows
and by the way if you guys ever saw um
Microsoft Windows 8 does not look that
great to me but anyways we'll see how it
goes so the reason that you may want to
make one a floating tab and I actually
do this a lot whenever I'm working with
multiple documents that I want to
combine together is you can make one a
floating tab and drag it onto another
document and check it out now we get two
layers or two images in the same
document but already I'm getting ahead
of myself I shouldn't even be talking to
you guys about layers yet
that's a tutorial for another day so
just forget I ever said that so for now
I just want to say thank you don't
forget to follow me on Google+ add me
and the cool people circle and once you
do you're ready to move on to the next
video so hopefully and my sound was
working in this video and
see you guys in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
