does somewhat of the same thing but
specularity is pretty much the like if
you see like a hotspot in an object that
has a light on it the specular intensity
is pretty much what that is it's almost
like reflection so if I turn this up you
can see that the picture gets hotter and
I turn it down you don't see that
hotspot in the middle anymore and by the
hotspot if i zoom in here you can see
over on this edge here or that where
that light is really hot that's the hot
spot I'll set that back down to what it
was at 50 and lastly the another thing
that affects how much light your object
is getting is is going to be the
intensity of the light so if you come in
if you double click on the layer there's
an intensity section here and if I lower
that then the light is going to have be
less intense and if you go into the
negatives it's going to suck out light
which is kind of weird but it has its
uses
put that back onto 100 and of course if
you have a layer that's blocking another
layer from receiving light and casting
shadows on it or something like that
then that of course is going to affect
the brightness of the light of the layer
there is another factor that comes into
when you're determining how bright
something is going to be and that's
called ambient
now if I come back down to the material
options again there is this section
called
ambient and this is the the amount of
light that is already on the scene
and this JPEG isn't really affected too
much by the ambient at all so it's hard
to show on this one but also if you have
another type of light on there
called ambient light this this type of
light illuminates the entire scene
regardless of where the light is so
there there's a another example of the
the light going on there so if I bring
the intensity of this ambient down to
like two it's going to be a lot less but
I'll go over ambient lighting later on
and it's if there's not much to it it's
pretty much what I just showed you but I
still go over it later so if you take
into consideration all those factors the
final brightness of the layer is pretty
much the sum of its diffuse value the
specular and the ambient the ambient
light that's going on around there now
lights don't have an opacity they have
an intensity so if you press T on your
keyboard you might think it might go to
opacity but now it goes to intensity for
a light and that's the easy way to
change that and you can go past a
hundred and you can go into the
negatives so be aware of that factor now
lights can be moved around and animated
just like your camera and the the light
has also a point of interest
just like your camera so if I go into my
two views here and check out my light
there is the point of interest and if I
wanted to I could move that point of
interest around see if I can actually
grab it
there that's how you use the selection
tool and then that'll move your point of
interest around actually and it's
different from the other points of
interest or anchor points or anything
like that where apparently you don't
need to use the Pan behind tool I was
just thinking that because I know
everything else is like that so that's
the introduction that I'm going to give
you for lights lights do not need to be
made 3d because they are only pretty
much useful in 3d layers 2d layers
ignore lights and they'll be rendered
without the light even affecting them so
just keep that in mind so go ahead and
you can try to play around with the
different lights if you want and in the
next couple tutorials I'll go over the
cool stuff that you can do with lighting
and how it makes your 3d scenes look
that more realistic and better so just
don't be like me and smash your head off
any lights while you're going around
working and stuff like that so I look
forward to seeing you guys in the next
tutorial and I'll see you guys later
have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
