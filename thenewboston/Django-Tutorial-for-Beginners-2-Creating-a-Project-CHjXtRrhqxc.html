Jango downloaded and installed set up
properly on our computer what we can do
now is we can create our very first
Django project so this is going to be
the process that you go through anytime
you want to create a new jingle website
and that is this go ahead and navigate
to wherever you want to create your
Django project files and I'm just going
to stick mine on my desktop why not and
type Django admin so this is a tool that
we got whenever we downloaded jingo and
it allows us to do a bunch of cool
things and in this video we're going to
be using this to create the starter
files and these are just the core files
that you have to include in every Django
website so the command for that is just
start project so that's what that does
now the only other thing you need to
type after this is you just need to give
your project a name and this is just the
name of the directory so usually this
would be something like the new Boston
if I was creating it for my website or
like hockey website or something like
that but for this tutorial series I am
just going to name it something super
generic website so there you go hit
enter and I will show you guys what it
did so what that just did is it created
this directory website and if I double
click this we can see that it made some
files right in there now I am going to
talk to you guys about what all these
files are but I'm actually going to open
up an IDE and do it because they will be
a little bit better and I'm actually
using jetbrains
or excuse me well yeah JetBrains is a
company that makes PyCharm and this is
the coolest IDE in the world so if you
guys want to use the same one then you
can but you don't need to you can
actually just follow along with this
tutorial using notepad or sublime or
anything you want and it's going to work
fine but if you want to follow along
with me then just go ahead and click
open and navigate to wherever you just
made it and mine was in my desktop
website so hit OK alright mate so that's
a little bit better I like having all my
files on the left hand side and then the
content on the right so I can show you
guys
both things at once but this is
JetBrains and by the way real quick if
you guys are using Arm PyCharm then what
you can do is if you go to file new
project and click Jango then oh sorry I
got whooping cough then you can just go
ahead and give a name and it just does
the exact same thing as we just did but
if you don't then go ahead and use the
command line and boom roasted good to go
so the first thing I want to mention is
this this root directory this one aka
this one that just got created you can
actually name that to whatever you want
it the name doesn't really matter it's
just whatever you want to name it it's
just the container for all of the files
inside so you know it doesn't mean
anything special to Jango however the
files inside here their names are
important so we see that we have this
directory right here which is the same
name as its root directory so that's why
I said you can rename this one the
parent one if it gets a little bit
confusing but keep this one the same so
before we get to that let's go ahead and
talk about this file right here manage
py by the way never edit this file never
try to add anything to it don't delete
it just kind of ignore it all this is
this managed up UI it's a program that
comes with Jango that lets you do a
bunch of cool stuff to your project and
it allows you to do things like access
the database and create users for your
website and will learn how to use this
later on but again this is not a file
that we're ever going to want to touch
or manage or edit or anything like that
so that's what that is now if your guys
are like alright well where is the code
that we're going to be working with well
we're going to be working with some of
the files in this directory and we're
also going to be creating some other
ones so go ahead and expand this and
I'll talk to you guys about all of these
so the first one this init py all this
is is file that tells python to view
this directory as a python package now
there's actually nothing inside here and
that's because you don't even need any
code in there again like I said it just
says hey python
this isn't just the normal directory on
your computer this is actually a Python
package so you know just view it as one
now the settings dot py file what I was
going to do before this tutorial is I
was like are I'm going to go through all
the settings and explain each one one by
one but then I was like if I do that
then people are probably just gonna be
like all right going to bed now Jenko
sucks this is boring so instead of just
trying to explain all of these settings
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
actually explain every single thing as
we kind of need it and get to it I think
it'll be a lot better that way and it'll
make a lot more sense than rather just
trying to pound everything in your brain
but real quick this file is just the
settings in configuration options for
your website so like the overall
settings for your entire website just
think of it like that now this is next
one URLs dot py these are the URL
declarations in other words it's kind of
like the table of contents for your
website that's how people always explain
it so what I mean by this is whenever
you go to a website and let me just I
have up here alright so whenever you go
to a website you type in of course the
website's name and then some URL after
it so whenever I type account it gives
me my stream whenever I type forum then
it gives me the forum whenever I type
videos or go to this URL then it shows
me all the videos so again this part of
the URL tells my website how to behave
or what it's supposed to do now most of
the time you're going to give it URL and
it's going to return a webpage but
sometimes it doesn't return a webpage
sometimes if you go to the URL like
logout dot PHP then it actually just
performs some functionality and logs the
user out and doesn't just you know give
you a webpage so again what this file is
is basically saying ok look at whatever
URL the user requested and then perform
some functionality and there's a lot
more to it than that but that's the
basic overview of it talk more about
that later in this last one w/s
gie this stands for a web server gateway
interface and it's just a special type
of web server and we're going to learn
about that a lot later
um don't even worry about it right now
but that's the basic overview of a core
Django project so again every single
website that you have is going to be
composed of all of these files and again
you never touch this one and we're not
going to be using this one a lot or this
one so it's actually a lot easier so
once we start getting into actually
developing it you guys are going to see
exactly what these do and it's going to
make a lot more sense but yeah that's
the overview of it and just to leave you
guys with something cool whenever you
install Django and set it up like this
it actually comes with a webserver and
it's not a full-featured web server like
you would actually want to host all
actual web site with it but it comes
with like a mint little mini web server
that you can use for development so if
you just want to boot it up and check
out what our website looks like right
now then what you need to do is you need
to navigate to wherever you created your
project so I'm already in my desktop I
want to go ahead and navigate to website
and just type ls' and make sure that you
see this your projects name in manage py
that makes sure that you're in the
correct location and again what we're
going to be doing is we're going to be
using this manage tool to boot our web
server so let me just go ahead and clear
out of this to make a little bit
prettier now in order to do this type
Python manage py and actually you don't
even need that manage py so this is a
tool that we can use it comes with a
bunch of different features what we're
going to be doing is run server so again
we're just going to start that little
development server that came with Django
and it says Don tada alright so starting
development server at HTTP 1 to 7 0 to
0.14 8000 so if you just open up any web
browser right now then you can go to
this location and you should see this
right there
so again django came with a test server
and right now we have
homepage looking beautiful and actually
what I do is I actually bookmark this so
that's why I have it right there in that
way I just don't have to type in the URL
all the time and that's what I recommend
doing since you're going to be going to
this page a lot but anyways look at that
our very first Django website but uh
yeah in the next tutorial we're going to
be splicing this up and it's going to be
cool so I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
