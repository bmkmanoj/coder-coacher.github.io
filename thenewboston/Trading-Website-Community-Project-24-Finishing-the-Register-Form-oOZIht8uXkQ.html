and hop right back to user name what I
want to do is I want to add that input
section that section where the user can
type texts so go ahead and create the
shell for that right now now what type
of section or form element is this well
it's just a section where the user can
type texts the class equals input and
that's just for styling purposes now
every each one of these elements is
going to have an ID and a name so the ID
is equal to user name and the name is
going to be equal to user name now what
we're going to do is we only want to
allow the user to type in 20 characters
on here because we don't want them to
have user names of like 150 characters
long so go ahead and there's a there we
go there's a property called max length
that you can pass into XHTML and it
pretty much if the user tries to type
more than 20 characters then it's not
going to type anymore so we give a max
length of 20 and that only allows the
user like I said to type in 20
characters no more so now the only other
thing I want to do is I want to add the
hint now the hint if you remember
whenever we're styling and CSS whenever
you hover over a field it has the option
of popping up a hint or not you can have
hint or you can't have it so for example
username and passwords have hints but
email doesn't have a hint and this is
just you know a little tip that you can
give the user in order to clear things
up so let's go ahead and make at a
paragraph and I'm going to name the
class hint that's what we styled it as
and let me just go ahead and my
paragraph so I don't forget and the hint
for this let's just say 20 characters
maximum and we might as well tell them
letters and numbers only I think that's
appropriate for user names so there you
go there is the very first field now
let's go ahead and hop down to email now
foot
now let's go ahead and just steal this
baby right here now email is also pretty
much the same input where the typist
text the class is input now the ID and
name instead of user name it's going to
be email and email now the max length
let me just go ahead and set that as 80
right now to be honest I have no idea
anyone with an email of longer than 80
but uh if we find that some people are
complaining because they have emails
longer than 80 and they can't sign up we
can just change that later on really
simple so I actually don't want to add a
hint for email because you know you
don't want to say like letters and
numbers only because it's pretty obvious
that you know I don't know you really
don't need a hint for email but the last
thing that we do need to worry about is
this password field now for this
password field right here we already
went ahead and we make the label so the
next thing is the input section so let
me go ahead right up to the user name
and steal their input and right under
label and put now check it out for a
password you actually don't want the
type of text you actually want the type
of password now whenever you do this and
you type in your password it's going to
type little asterisks ha's so like
nobody sitting next you can see what
you're typing in so the class is of
course input the ID and the name
password password and for the password
let me just go ahead and give it a max
length of 20 as well and for the hint
I'm just go ahead and copy this hint
because it's going to be kind of the
same now the hint for the password field
is 20 characters maximum we won't so
you've letters and numbers only because
hey if you want to throw a dollar sign
or you know an @ sign or something in
your password and go ahead and feel free
now the last thing that we need to do
and I should have done with this before
actually I'm going to go ahead and
finish off my form before I add the last
thing before I add that button I just
want to go ahead and put that last
ending form tag now of course the last
element that we need to add is that
button the button to submit
form now we already styled a class
called button so we have to remember to
use that whenever we use the form now
whenever you're working in a form and
you want to add a button you just go
ahead and add an input but the type is
equal to submit now whenever you press
this HTML knows that this is the button
to submit the form now we might as well
give it a name equal to submit and an ID
equal to submit I always like to fill
out name and ID good housekeeping now of
course the last thing I wanted to do
well second last thing is I want to go
ahead and set the class equal to button
because whenever i do this that's what's
going to make the button look pretty the
default pun realizing that pretty and we
spell that time you know styling button
so might as well use it and the last
thing and I for real mean it this time
is the value of your button now the
value of the button is basically the
text that you want the appear on the
button so basically the text for this
button is going to say submit for the
search button it will say search for the
login button it'll say login we could go
ahead and make a register but I don't
know some it just sounds a little bit
better so they'll let actually you know
what I think we're good I mean what we
did is we went ahead and created all the
header and search code with one mine
then we added the image on the left hand
side in on the right hand side I
probably have a couple errors somewhere
in here but I'll find that one I test it
so in next tutorial what we're going to
do is now that we created a form we need
to go ahead and handle the information
in the form so that's where you have to
look forward to in the next tutorial so
thank you guys for watching and I will
see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
