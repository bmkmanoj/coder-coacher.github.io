design of your top fragment done and set
what we need to do is we need to add the
brains behind it of course for every
fragment it needs a layout what you just
did and the Java class so in your Java
folder right here
go to your package that holds your main
activity and we want to add a new class
or right-click your package new Java
class now for the name of this I'm going
to name my top section fragments looking
good hit OK and check it out and
actually what I like to do is I like to
arrange all my Java files on the left
and all my activity or layouts on the
right alright so this is a file that I
just created and of course I don't need
that stupid comment but what we actually
do need to do is we need to import some
stuff so import Android OS dots bundle
import enjoy dot support dot V for dot
app dot fragments and I'll explain all
these um as we need them in a bit but
import Android dot view layout inflator
two more ones real quick import Android
view dot view who in import Android view
dots
whew dot actually I missed it whew group
there was now there are some rules that
we have to follow to create a really
basic fragment the very first rule is we
always need to extend fragment so we
always need to inherit from this
fragment class and that just tells our
app hey this thing that we created is
actually a fragment all right so another
thing that we need to do is we need to
override on create view so if you hit
alt inserts override methods make sure
this is sorted all right on create view
hit OK now of course what this does is
it says ok so we know that this is a
fragment however whenever you use it in
one of your activities what does this
fragment look like what of the what
pretty much layout are you using so you
can actually get rid of this because we
don't need any of that so essentially
what we need to say is we're going to be
using this XML file that's all we're
going to say so in order to do that
we're just going to store it in view and
it's a little bit different to UM tell
your app that you're using one of these
layouts for a fragment what you need to
do is you actually need to use inflator
dots inflate and again this is just a
method to say this is what layout we're
using for this fragment why they named
it inflate out now it's kind of a weird
name but that's what we're doing so
we're using our dot layout dot what is
my name
top section fragment which is pretty
much a reference to this file right here
and just some housekeeping stuff you
need to pass it in container and this is
just a review group object I got passed
in risk passing it through and not
flouse
false come on geez Louise alright so
after this we just turn view which is
pretty much essentially a reference to
this that's all we're doing so again
those are the rules whenever you create
a class that uses a fragment first it
needs to inherit from fragment and
second it needs to override oncreateview
all right so we have one fragment
created one part of our app so the only
other thing we have to do well it's not
the only other thing but what we're
going to do next is we're going to
create that bottom half which is the
good part the picture which we're going
to meme a Phi so let's go ahead and
first make the layout for it and this is
actually really easy a lot easier than
this so right-click a layout and click a
new layout resource file and for the
bottom fragment I'm just going to name
mine bottom underscore picture
underscore fragment and I also want to
change this to relative layout as well
in hit ok so now let's actually do this
through the designer because I don't
know we really don't need to change that
many properties on it so the very first
thing that I want to do is I actually
want to say okay we're using that one
image of me of Bucky so on the entire
relative layout what we can do is we can
actually go to background property and
if you click these dots it lets you
browse your resources and they are
actually under here so you can collapse
color now in drawable remember that's
where we stuck it in mine is named Bucky
so I'm just going to click that so this
is a reference to this image and hit OK
and now the background of this fragment
is me right there now I know it look
stretched out right here but it doesn't
really matter because this is what's
going to happen
remember this entire thing it isn't the
screen that the user is going to look at
it's only part of the screen so whenever
we take these fragments and we stick
them
on the mainactivity what we can do is we
can say okay for this fragment right
here make it square so we can give a
fixed height in width so even though it
looks stretched out right now it's going
to look fine whenever we actually place
it on our activity so that looks pretty
good now the only other thing that we
need to put on here is two text fields
so let's go ahead and drag one right on
top middle and drag another one on the
bottom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
