your 15th JavaScript tutorial and in
this tutorial like I said we're going to
be going over a kind of more complex
if statement so in the last tutorial I
showed you guys how to make a basic if
statement and we pretty much gave it a
test and if that test was true it ran a
bit of code but if that test was false
then it didn't do anything well now all
we're going to be doing is telling it if
it's false instead of not doing anything
give it another option so if it's true
do this if it's false do that so before
we said if it's true do this if it's
false do nothing and now we're saying if
it's true do this if it's false do that
so pretty simple we're pretty much
making it do something no matter what so
let's go ahead and make well let me show
you guys the basic syntax of this in
order to make an if-else statement and
that's what this is called if-else we go
ahead and write our if statement and
we're going to give it a test right here
if that test is true we're going to run
this bit of code right here let's say we
have document right um and just write
like I love Hot Pockets good enough so
now if this test is true we run this bit
of code just like we did before this is
exactly identical but now let's stick
another piece onto this we're going to
go ahead and write the word
else now go ahead and add brackets for
this and instead of doing nothing if the
test is false it's going to do this bit
of code right here so document right
um I love now let's give it something
like I love strawberry so this is an
unhealthy and this is healthy so now we
got kind of a contrast going on there so
now let's go ahead and give it a really
simple test let's just go ahead and test
two numbers can't be easier than that so
if two equals two and remember we can't
use one equal sign we have to use two
because we only use one equal sign
whenever is setting a variable equal to
a value whenever we're just testing two
values to make sure they equal each
other we use two equal signs so right
now we're saying our a if two equals two
do this if two doesn't equal to do this
so let's go ahead and save it and
refresh it and see what it says
I love hot pockets so that's why the
first one got executed but what if they
didn't teach other what if saying all
right if two equals 65 well we know that
two does not equal 65 just doesn't make
sense so it's going to say all right if
two equals 65 do this well it doesn't so
I'm not going to do that so I guess I
have to do this I love strawberries so
let's go ahead and save this and see
what we get I love strawberries just as
we thought so aside from having just two
values equal each other we can have two
variables equal to each other for
example if we had a bar a blue equal 43
and var red equal 76
then we can go ahead and we can test if
blue is equal to red which they aren't
so it's going to say I love strawberries
right here check it out I love
strawberries but if they are equal to
each other 43 and 43 well not have 743
check it out I love hot pockets so again
this is more common to compare two
variables against each other you can
also take a variable and compare it to a
number at forty three equals forty-three
just like that I love hot pockets so
aside from this what you can do is you
can use all your other comparison
operators too if 43 is not equal to 43
then let's see what happens it says I
love strawberries
so you're saying all right if 43 is
different than 43 do this well I'm not
going to do that because they're the
same so if they're the same go ahead and
do this and that's why I print out I
love strawberries
now let's go ahead and test our greater
than less than and 587 and 43 so if blue
is greater than 43 or let's go ahead and
type red right there
so if 587 is greater than red go ahead
and do this
if 507 587 is not greater than red go
ahead and do this so since it is greater
than red and 587 is more than 43 it's
going to go ahead and print out I love
hot pockets if I go ahead and save that
right there I love hot pockets and of
course we can do less than less than or
equal to greater than or equal to double
equals not equals in all those good
stuff but anyways that's the point I'm
trying to make an if-else statement is
basically this let me go ahead and cut
this and if statement pretty much takes
a test and if it's true it runs a bit of
code if it's not true it doesn't do
anything
what if else statement does is it pretty
much gives you that second option if
it's not true instead of not doing
anything run this bit of code instead so
either way your computer is going to get
stuck at doing something whereas before
if it wasn't true
it could escape take the easy way out
and do nothing so there you have it a
basic if-else statement and why they're
useful in what they do so don't forget
to go over your comparison operators
make sure you understand all of those
and make sure you understand the basics
of an if-else statement you pretty much
are giving your computer a decision
you're either going to do this or do
this based on the test so now that you
understand that you're ready to move on
to
next topic and that is things might get
confusing but it's actually nesting so
it thinks might get a little rough but
trust me you need to understand the next
topic it's going to be extremely helpful
to you so thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
