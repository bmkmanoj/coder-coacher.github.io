illustration cs6 tutorial my name is
buddy Blackford today we're going to be
learning how to use smart punctuation
and then maybe we'll get on to more
stuff later if it doesn't take that long
to go over so what smart punctuation is
is it turns your text into
professional-looking type and instead
using just straight quotes all the time
you can use smart quotes and you can use
en or dashes instead of hyphens as
dashes and basically there's a couple
options and I'll get over those and show
those with you so you just need to
select any type tool so I'm just gonna
select the the normal one and then
select any type that you want to use I'm
gonna pick pick this first line here
because it has quotations in it oops I
accidentally didn't select the actual
stuff there we go
and I went ahead and selected that then
let's go to the type menu right here at
the top and then we're gonna go to smart
punctuation
now you can appreciations with smart
quotes or smart spaces or anything like
that
we've got expert fractions we've got
ellipses which are these dot dots and
then here's the dashes so that's a these
are the different options that we have
the next thing we got is replace in and
then we've got either selected text only
or the entire document now I selected
something so I pretty much probably
wanted to do selected text only so I'm
going to hit OK and then it shows you
what's made it says two quotes were
changed okay
so now the quotations in this are a
little bit better they they point
towards the actual sentence of where
it's quoting and then the first quote
goes is different from the second quote
besides having just to straight down
quotes if you look at these quotes here
after the word day they kind of look a
little messed up so let's go ahead and
just let's just apply this to all of
them
if it works out smart punctuation I'm
gonna go to an entire document and head
okay and now you can see that the quotes
have been changed on everything and then
the actual stuff looks the actual what
do you call it paragraph looks a lot
better so you guys can go ahead and mess
with that the next thing I want to show
is hyphens so let's go ahead and I'm
gonna try to add like as a word in this
sentence that's really long and maybe
punctuation and that didn't work I was
trying to get something that might be
hyphenated but I don't think I had the
hyphens on and this one in this so let's
go ahead and start adding those so let's
go to the paragraph panel we've got
window and tight and then paragraph we
do have - a on let's go to the options
and go to hyphenation and here we've got
a hyphenation panel now a hyphenated
word can get pretty much hyphenated at
any point that you want to set up in
here words have to be longer than six
letters this is what I have set up words
have to be longer there's six letters
and then I'll - eight after the first
two letters and before the last two and
then you've got a - limit of how many
you can have and then the zone down here
is a pretty nice slider scale here
either you can have it so that there's
fewer hyphens in the document or you
have better spacing let me try adjusting
the I'll just hit okay let me try
adjusting this to something like
justified so if we get some hyphens I
want the whole entire thing to be it
doesn't look like we have any I'll try
this again let's try it here well I
don't know I'm not really too sure why
it's not hyphenating anything but I
think it's cuz there's so much space in
the document I'll try one last thing and
if it doesn't work then that's okay all
right let's just make a huge word see if
that works
nope it doesn't there's just too much
space within this so it's not gonna
punctuate or it's not gonna - it
correctly but now you know where the - a
box is so that's pretty nice and you got
a little bit you know a little bit more
so basically you just got a couple tips
I just gave you in this tutorial you
know how to use smart punctuation and
you know how to use the how to edit the
- - ations now so I really recommend
using smart at least quote using the
smart quotes because it makes your text
look more professional so thanks a lot
for watching the tutorial I'm gonna end
it here and go ahead and subscribe if
you wanna check out more videos thanks a
lot everybody in have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
