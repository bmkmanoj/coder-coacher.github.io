JavaScript tutorial and this story I'm
gonna be teaching you how to change the
value of an array and add an element to
the end of an array so as you can see
before any time we wanted to output the
value of array would just put it in an
alert box whatever we wanted it to
output and as you can see just output it
it on-screen for us but what if later on
in our scripting we were typing some
code down here then we decided that we
wanted to have a new value for that
element well in case you guys can figure
this out yet or in case you guys just
need to see it to believe but all you
have to do is simply type in whatever
just like a variable and just set it
equal to something different so now if
we alert this let me just copy this to
make it easier JavaScript scan marine
along here and says alright we have an
array right here first the value is
Gregg so that's what I'm gonna output
and then it's gonna say alright you want
to change the value to Bobby
alright now will spit out Bobby even
though it's the same variable since it
reads from top to bottom it's first
gonna alert Gregg then when we change it
it's gonna alert Bobby so let me save
this as you can see Gregg for our first
then our second and alerts the word
Bobby
now from here on out any time you type
code later on down your script the VAT
the second element of that array is
going to hold the value of Bobby now
that's how you change elements in your
array just by simply typing this part
again and changing this part right here
but let's say you want to add an element
to your end of your array to do that is
even more simple all you have to do is
type in the next element of the array so
I already get 0 1 2 now we just need to
type in 3 and type in a new value for it
as you can see is long as it has the
value of the next element it doesn't
need to be directly connected to your
array it doesn't need to be all in a
cluster so now if we copy this and we
alerted this out on the screen
it'll first alert Gregg and then even
though it isn't directly connected to
all these other elements we still have
the third element with a value of Tina
so let's save this take a look a little
looks like first it says Gregg press ok
reads the rest of the script and even
though their scripts in between there it
still shows that as long as we have
value for number 3 it'll output it on
the screen
so this is how you can add elements to
the end of your array without directly
putting it in the array with your other
elements so study this tutorial and make
sure that you learn all this because
it'll be coming in use a lot later on
it's also useful when you decide to do
some script in and then decide to add
elements later thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
