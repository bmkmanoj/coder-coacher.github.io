and in this video what we're gonna be
doing now that we have these images
styled is I'm gonna show you guys that
once you hover over an icon you can have
the option of making a pop-up menu
appear and I actually have this on my
website where whenever you hover over it
my social network it says who left a
comment on your post or who liked your
picture or any notifications that you
want so I'm gonna show you guys how to
do it and you can actually do it for
every single one of these say if one of
them was for I don't know your picture
notifications or your video
notifications by anyways let's go ahead
and get to it so again one more time
whenever you hover over them you can
either have this as a drop up menu or
just you know some little anything that
appears really so let's go ahead and
give me some space now go ahead and put
links class notification icons so
basically these are going to be links
right here in whenever they have the
class supplied to them and we're gonna
be doing this in HTML notification icons
what we want to do is we want to give
them a span now the span is that pop-up
box so you see that pop-up that just
popped up that is the span element so by
default whenever we first load the
webpage we don't want it to display all
we only want it to show when the user
hovers over it now I'm gonna be showing
you guys how to do this in CSS so the
first thing we need to do is
display:none now again like I said this
is going to be the default display
because we don't want those menus
popping up as soon as the page loads we
want to wait to the user hovers over
them so now let's just go ahead and
style it font size 12 pixels color and
this is of course the color of the font
not the color of the menu or anything so
font is white the bottom is 45 pixels
now what you want to do is remember that
this entire the bottom isn't right here
where the tip of my mouse is the bottom
is actually the bottom of the webpage
and since our our footer is 40 pixels
tall we want to put this either at 41 or
you know
45 I think it looks pretty good at 45 so
again make sure to set the bottom or
else it's going to appear at the bottom
of your webpage in overlap which is bad
now the width of this is 150 pixels
looks pretty good now the position is
actually pretty important
position:absolute now you want to make
sure your position is absolute because
if you have just a bottom inner right
then the position would be the same you
see how whenever I hover this over this
Facebook icon the menu appears centered
right over this icon well if I put a
fixed position then whenever I would
hover over this one the menu would
appear to the right and whenever I hover
over this one the menu would appear way
over here so whenever we give an
absolute position it uses these icons is
a reference so the little pop-up is
centered over it every single time
so remember position absolute not fixed
now for the border and this is just the
regular border one pixel solid and I'm
just gonna give it like three three make
sure you got enough three three two more
okay and it's like I almost the black
but not quite now the border radius is
let's just go ahead and set this to
three pixels and again I don't know if I
said this before but you see how the
corners of this are not exactly square
they have a little curve to them well
that is where your border ad says border
radius pretty much means how curvy do
you want your corners
but you know that would have been way
too long a property to type out and the
padding of this is five pixels since we
don't want our text button up against
the side and the margin left this is
actually pretty important the margin
left you want negative 70 pixels now the
reason that you want this is if you
didn't have this then whenever you hover
over this icon it would align with the
left hand side so um you see how the
left you see how this box appears in the
Center right now that's because I moved
it to the left 70 pixels remember the
entire thing is 150 pixels wide so when
you move it to the left 70 pixels that
gives you pretty much the center of it
actually 75 would be the center so we
can do that be a little bit cleaner now
for the background I also want to make
this semi-transparent so I want to give
it about 40% opacity so the background
equals rgba and the color is black zero
zero zero is black and for the opacity
zero point four is 40% opacity so right
now we styled a pretty cool pop-up box
but the thing is if we just loaded this
in our browser then it would never
display because we always have the
display set to none now what we want to
do is we want to display this whenever
the user takes their mouse and hovers
over it so how do we do that well guys
this is probably the easiest thing that
I've ever taught you guys this is
actually a cheating kind of way to do it
copy this which is the same element but
instead of styling it again what we want
to do is we want to style this link on
the hover property so this is the
default link and when you hover over it
what do you want to change well the only
thing we want to change is this display
instead of displaying none display it as
a block now when you display none that
means that nothing appears on the screen
however when you hover over it is going
to display block which just means a
block is just a block level element and
it just means that it appears on the
screen so once we save this and of
course this is my old one but now
whenever we hover over it whenever we
hover over this link what's going to
happen is it's gonna go from
display:none to display block which
pretty much means show up on the screen
so display:none display block boom
roasted so that is how you get this
little hover box over your links
never they have the property
notifications icon but anyways thank you
guys we're done with the little itty
gritty mane styling so in the next
tutorial we're gonna be styling pretty
much all the good stuff so thanks for
watching and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
