and in this video I'm going to teach you
guys how to let the user log out so just
remember this one thing from the last
video whenever you want to allow the
user to log in basically never mind all
this validation crap the only thing that
you have to do is you need to give that
user a session variable this is of
course a special variable that sticks
with whoever is on that computer until
they close the browser so of course
let's think about this so if that's how
they login then how would they log out
well the only thing we need to do is
pretty much delete this variable when
this variable doesn't exist anymore that
must mean that the user is logged out so
let's go ahead and make a new page and
save this as and guys easiest script
you're ever going to learn trust me log
out PHP save it and the first thing of
course we need is PHP tags like that now
let's go ahead and pretty much steal
everything that we need now whenever we
work with the session variables we can't
just automatically delete them wherever
we are in the script whenever we work
with the session even though we're
deleting the variables we need to start
the session first this pretty much is
saying okay load all the session
variables that we may have or prepare to
do something with a session now after
this once you start the session you can
then alter the variables create new
variables or do you know whatever you
need to do in this case we want to
destroy all the variables so the
function for this is session underscore
destroy that's it how sweet is that so
basically right now what we did is we
said okay we're going to work with a
session we're going to do something to
it so start it up get ready for it now
destroy all session variables now what
this does is it pretty much cleans your
computer from all session variables
logging out the user now this is a
script that's all you need to write to
log out the user however just to enhance
the user experience what we want to do
is whenever they click logout we don't
want them stuck on this log out page
because then they're just going to be
looking at a blank white page what we
want to do is we want to redirect them
back to the homepage so let me go in
just copy this right here because I
don't want I want to type as little as
possible in this tutorial now this of
course is a redirection script and the
homepage is index dot PHP and guys go
ahead and save this and if you think
there is more furyk you know what i
watch the tutorial for this that's it
well sorry guys let you down but that is
it in order to log out user one more
time start the session destroy all the
variables and just to make sure that
they're happy and they're not looking at
a blank white page go ahead and redirect
them to the homepage because you know
why not so anyways that's it hopefully
you guys enjoy this very short tutorial
and in the next tutorial we're probably
going to be tackling their main account
page so thank you guys for watching I'll
see them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
