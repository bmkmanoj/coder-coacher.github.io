to your third get tutorial and in this
video as promised we're going to be
creating our very first git project so
let's go ahead and do that right now
so go to your desktop and create a new
folder new folder and you might as well
name it tuna because why the heck not
now
typically whenever you're creating a
project you're probably going to use
this folder to store a bunch of you know
website files or maybe a Photoshop files
if you're a graphic artist or maybe I
don't know like if you're using it for
school then a bunch of Microsoft Word
documents but we're just going to create
a silly little you know tester document
right here something easy for us to
understand and maybe I'll be putting
some text files in there or something so
this is going to be our project that we
want get to manage so how exactly do we
tell get that this tuna folder is the
one that we want to work on because
right now when we open a bash you're
just sitting there and back you know
what I'm get I keep track of changes in
files I'm ready to my thing but Bucky
you got a lot of crap on your computer
how am I supposed to know that this is
the one that I'm supposed to be working
with well let's go ahead and tell git
that that tuna folder is the one that we
want our project to be at so the very
first thing that we need to do is we
need to figure out exactly where git is
looking right now and in order to do
that type the letters P W D and hit
enter so right now get is looking at C
which is the hard drive users Bucky and
of course that's not where we want to be
right now we're in Bucky folder we want
to be in this tuna folder which is in
the desktop so here are some simple
commands that I'm going to teach you
guys and this is just how to really
easily navigate arm on your computer so
the first thing that you guys should
always do is type CD tilde now CD
may means change directory and it pretty
much means change folders now tilde
means home and what is home mean well go
ahead and hit enter and then it takes
you to whatever um bash thinks is your
home directory on your computer so now
hit PWD and hit enter and apparently my
home is C users
Bucky so that makes sense because you
know right now I'm logged in as Bucky so
this would be home unfortunately it's
not exactly this tuna folder so how do
we navigate to that well the first thing
I want to you guys is how to move
backwards in forwards so right now we're
in see users Bucky if we ever want to go
back one directory to this users type CD
which is change directory space dot dot
now if you hit enter what that's going
to do is it's going to take you back one
directory to see users so you see how
when you're going to see users Bucky
we're now on see users so if you ever
have to go back or up one that's how you
do that but let's go ahead and get back
to Bucky and this is how you do that so
right now we're in see users where are
all the folders that we can hop to well
if you type LS and hit enter that lists
all of the folder so all users Bucky
default these are all of the folders so
let's go ahead and go back in Bucky so
CD Bucky alright so now you can see
we're in Bucky again so let's see what
we have right in there right now LS
so in Bucky we have all of this crap and
check this out
inside Bucky is our desktop and that's
where we want to be so CD desktop all
right now we're on our desktop which is
right here but we want to be in this
tuna folder so open up bash again and
put CD tuna and hit enter and now check
it out we are insi users
Bucky desktop tuner tuner oh that's kind
of funny but anyways that is how you
navigate to where you want to be if you
ever want to go back CD ah if you ever
want to go to a specific folder CD and
then the name of that folder and if you
ever just want to list all of the crap
inside that folder LS and of course
there is nothing inside tuner right now
so that's why this gives you you know
pretty much empty but anyways
right now we are inside this tuna folder
and that is where we want to be but we
didn't tell bash yet to create a git
project or the technical team for
technical name for project is actually a
repository so if I say repository
instead of project I'm saying the same
thing it's just you know technical
language versus me just trying to
explain it so how do we turn this tuna
folder into a git project very easy get
in it and hit enter now what in it means
is is short for initialize or start
empty git repository so initialize them
to get repository repository in everyday
language means start a git project so
that's all we did we started a git
project in this tuna folder and even
though you can't see any noticeable
changes right now this tuna folder is
now a git project and everything we put
in here get is now going to be keep
keeping track of the changes in those
files so pretty freakin cool
pretty easy guys right so in the next
tutorial I'm going to be proving it to
you guys and we're going to be creating
our very first text file
add in there and also if those Unix
commands were kind of confusing like CD
da CD Bucky how to navigate around your
you know how to navigate around computer
via the command line then if you guys
have any questions you can ask me on my
forum it's in Bucky's room and I'll put
a link below and also if you have any
other questions about get all together
then go there and ask a lot of people
are very willing to help you out so
thank you guys for watching don't forget
subscribe and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
