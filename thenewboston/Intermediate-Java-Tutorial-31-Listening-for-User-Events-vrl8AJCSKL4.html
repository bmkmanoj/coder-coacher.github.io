and in this video like I said we're
going to be adding a list selection
listener basically what this applet is
going to do is wait for the user to
click one of these options inside the
list they don't care if it like if they
like click the title or something they
only want to wait and see if they click
one of these options inside the list
like this one or this one now in order
to do that what we need to do is add a
list selection listener so go ahead and
write the name of your list which is
main list and I easily could have type
that and add a method called add list
selection listener to it just like that
now inside this parameter let me see if
it will tell you in the documentation
well I'll just go ahead and tell you
it's my kind of what I'm here for isn't
it what we need to do is we need to add
an anonymous inner class basically the
functionality to wait for the list
itself so the first thing you do is add
a new list selection listener and by the
way I don't really like anonymous inner
class it's just like a class inside of a
class inside of class and there are
easier ways to get around this but for
now what I spell something wrong a list
selection listener I just think I'm not
done coding yet so inside here we add a
method called value change so public
void value changed
and inside this parameter you pass in
the event which is list selection event
and we'll just name this event alright
easy enough so basically what we have
going on here is we added a listener to
that list basically a bit of code that
sits on that list and waits for
something to happen now whenever a user
pretty much clicks anything on that list
then it's going to call this method
value changed now what do we want to
happen inside value changed well what we
want to do is basically say okay
whatever option you clicked on go to
that website simple enough but we need
to do in kind of a weird way so the
first thing you need to do is make an
object just name my object and set it
equal to main list which is the list
that you know we're listening on and
we'll make a method called get value man
I wanted to pop up get value selected
now or wow I'm a set up get selected
value there we go
now what this method does is it gets the
title of the website so for example what
this is going to do is if you click on
the New Boston org what get selected
value does is it is going to grab the
string the New Boston no org so that's
what this um line of code does and it's
going to store it in this variable
called object so now what we can do is
remember the point of this program is
pretty much to have the browser take us
to that URL so basically what we can use
with that information is going to say
okay
this title the New Boston org is
associated with a URL so wherever you
see this title associated with the URL
that's where you want to go so next what
we need to do is we need to make another
um variable that's going to hold the URL
object in
we'll just name this new document set
this equal to website info because
remember website info is the hashmap
that has the information of the title
and the URL so you guys are going to see
once I'm done
get object so right now if you guys
can't tell what's going on what we did
in this line like I said is we grab the
title of whatever was not just say it's
the new Boston not org so whenever we
grab the title of the new Boston org
what this line of code does is it's
going to say okay we want to get the
pretty much we want to get the URL where
the new Boston org is associated with
now the URL of the new Boston org is
HTTP the new Boston you know back
suspect that's the full URL that your
browser can go to so now now that full
URL is stored in variable called new
document why why do you need to store it
in the URL instead of a string because
in your Java program it can only go to
URLs you can't go to a string you can't
go to a string called what website do
you want to visit you can't go to a
string called tuna fish sandwich you can
only go to a valid URL so that's why we
need to convert it into a URL object so
before we can just say okay go to this
URL what we actually need to do is
figure out what browser or what the user
is using to run this applet so in order
to do that and once you guys see this
bit of code you guys are going to
understand what's going on applet
context
browser equals get context all right now
hopefully I don't have any errors
now what this line of code does is it
gets applet context so for example if
I'm running this applet inside Chrome
which I am right now
then it's going to say okay the browser
is equal to Chrome
that's essentially what it does and why
do I need to do that because whenever
I'm going to a URL you just can't say go
to a URL it needs to say what do you
want to use to go to that URL so I want
to use that browser which is Chrome
in my case maybe it's different you know
if you're an Internet Explorer which
hopefully you aren't show document and
the new document is this
so let me guys type talk you through
this one last line and you can see
what's going on so well I might as well
talk you guys through what we did we
basically added a listener so anytime a
user made a selection in that list it
said okay run the method value changed
so this month method gets ran anytime
the user selects something so whenever
they selected you know the New Boston
org
what happens is the first thing it did
is get the title which is the New Boston
org the second thing it did is it got
the URL from that title because remember
in our XHTML file each one was
associated with another one or in the
hashmap rather now once it has that URL
converted from a string it could go
ahead and find out what browser you're
using and use your browser to basically
take you to that URL and in order to you
know take someone to a URL you need to
use the method show document which
basically says ok show the web page
itself so that's what that does and if
you're saying okay where the heck did
you know all of this crap come in
something's not making sense here well
the reason things aren't perfectly tied
together right now is because we didn't
grab the in fro info from the HTML file
so
in the next story what I'm going to be
showing you guys how to do is actually
stealing the info from the HTML file
that we made in the very first tutorial
and we're going to be populating this
hash map and ArrayList and once you do
once you learn that you guys are going
to be good to go learn all about you
know making a browser within a browser
so thank you guys for watching and
subscribe and I'll see as the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
