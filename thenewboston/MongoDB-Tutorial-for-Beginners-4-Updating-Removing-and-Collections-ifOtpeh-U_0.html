learned how to make a really simple
database and how to insert documents in
other words players into our collections
so you probably noticed if you go to DB
players find Crick T then what happened
is I showed you guys that this was the
command to pretty much get all the
documents in your collection and display
them so you're looking through and
you're like are a yep we definitely
insert all those but wait a minute I
noticed something funny's going on
alright whenever I inserted everything I
threw in their position all of this
stuff their number position number
however when I'm trying to display them
back I'm also getting this thing right
here this weird object ID what the heck
is that I did not insert that so why is
it displaying it to me well behind the
scenes whenever you insert a new
document Mongo automatically adds this
object ID to each individual document
why does it do this well it's pretty
much a unique identifier so in other
words you can identify each document
uniquely well why would you want to do
that well let's say that you had arm
this is a really good example right here
but let's say that you're storing user
information for your website and you had
two users and they were both named Brian
Williams and they're also both born in
Pittsburgh well whenever you try to find
one then it's going to give you two
results but you're just looking for one
person so in other words if you have a
unique ID for each document then you can
just reference each one individually now
we can actually use this for a couple
handy things let's say that we wanted to
remove Craig Adams I don't know maybe he
got traded to another team whatever
maybe he retired we needed to remove him
from our database well we can run a
command that says remove Craig Adams
however what happens when we have three
Craig Adams on
it's going to remove a mall also if we
just say remove one how do we know that
it's this one that we want to remove
well in that case we would actually want
to use the unique identifier right like
that so let me actually go ahead and
clear this and I'll show you guys how to
remove people so if you go DP what
collection while you're using the
player's collection and what we want to
do is we want to remove an item from our
collection in other words a document
well inside here you can just write what
object and give it two parameters so
again remove deletes a document from
your collection and the parameter that
it takes is called the selection
criteria so select this document and it
removes it whenever you run it so now if
you just go to DB find players we have
all of our players like before however
Craig Adams is not there this is beau
Bennett so removed Craig Adams now
actually let me go ahead and run that
again because I will show you guys
something
got the hiccups now in the middle of my
frickin tutorial great alright so that's
pretty much how you remove on something
from your collection you pretty much hit
remove throw in the selection criteria
and you run it so what do you do if you
just want to update a little bit of
information say that let's see what the
brand insider here
so Brandon Sutter should me actually
let's do it tube open it
alright so both Bennett he plays right
wing but we signed them for our team and
we found out that he is actually um
allergic to play right wing because I
don't know me
maybe he got struck by lightning and he
can't shoot from the right anymore so we
want to move him to left wing so what we
want to do is we just want to update a
little bit of information his position
right there so how do we do that well we
first need to go
and we need to be able to select this
player in some fashion so just like
before we copy this and this bit of
information is going to allow us to
uniquely identify beau Bennett so select
this hit copy and then we can actually
clear out this all right
so anytime you want to update a document
you go to DB players update now update
takes two parameters the first parameter
is like before the selection criteria so
inside as an object paste in this
selection criteria so this means that
first you want to update this document
which is Bo Bennett now after this you
need to write the new updated
information so add a comma
since we're separating parameters and
throw-in we clean that up a little bit
more and throw in the new object so
before he played a right wing say now he
plays left wing and we'll say just for
fun that he changed his name to bob
bennett why not
so if you run this then it says we
updated it so if you verify that by
going DB players I think we can just use
a find one since you should be the first
check it out his name is now bob bennett
and he plays left wing and let me just
display everyone so you guys can see for
effect all right so all of our other
information is the same however
where is he all right
however beau Bennett now has updated
name and an updated position so that is
how you not only delete by update
information now two other commands I
want to show you guys are this any time
I try to show you guys one more command
for this tutorial so obviously I was
playing around with it I was changing
players around I change Bo's name to bob
Bennett I deleted Craig Adams my
collection is pretty much all weird now
so what I want to do is actually just
delete that entire collection and use
this one again because this is all the
good information how do I do that well
I'm just going to go to DB players which
is the individual collection in that
database and I'm just going to call drop
so if I run this then what I can do is
show collections and I no longer have
the players collection so for the rest
of these tutorials I'm going to show you
guys a bunch of commands and I'm
actually going to be using all of these
players for example I'm going to show
you guys how to sort through them how to
you know um select them like find all
the players that are greater than 30
years old all that so let me just select
all of these guys copy all of them now
remember any time that you want to
insert multiple documents at once you
just on whatever collection you're using
call insert and you pass it in to an
array so now inside our an array let
make sure that there's no comma after
the last one and run this
so we now inserted all 25 players
now if we call find there we go so we
now have a collection of 25 players that
we can use in the future tutorials if
you guys want to use you know like
information from an API or you have your
own Jason information that you want to
follow along with that's fine but for
now thank you guys for watching don't
forget subscribe see you guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
