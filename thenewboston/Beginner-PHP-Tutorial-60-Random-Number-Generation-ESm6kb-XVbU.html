org and this is another video for the
New Boston now at some point when you
program in PHP you are going to need to
generate random numbers now the first
thing we're going to do is show you how
to generate a random number how we can
specify a lower and an upper limit and
then I'm going to talk a bit about why
you might need to specify generate
around a number so when we use the rand
function which looks like this
we can either supply no arguments at all
or we can supply two arguments
now we're first of all going to look at
supplying no arguments so if I wish to
just echo round or in fact create a
variable called round that we can use
later on in our program then now random
number and PHP is automatically seeded
so there's no need to do anything all
you have to actually do is cool round
now at the moment because we haven't
supplied our arguments this is going to
separate a random number between a
minimum and a maximum amount and the
minimum amount is I think 0 or 1 and the
maximum is a pre-specified amount so
let's just take a look at the preview of
this in our browser you can see that
we've now generated 30,000 150 now
10,000 631 180 so we're going lower
towards the lower limit back up to the
higher limit and we can keep refreshing
and we'll have a random number now this
is unique so every time you refresh it
will automatically reseed and we will be
we will be generating perhaps the same
number twice now if I was to look at
this I can see that there's obviously an
upper limit because we're not going in
to say the millions but there is a way
we can find out this upper value so if I
say max equals and it's a get R and Max
function now what this will do is this
will specify the maximum amount of
a little maximum integer that this
random value can be when we've specified
just round on its own so let's say put a
forward slash in there and then max so
essentially what we're seeing is the
random number out of the maximum so
let's have a look at what that's
produced you can see now we've got nine
five five two out of 32,767 32,767 in
this case is the maximum number that can
be generated and the number that has
been generated is nine five five two so
you'll see that as we refresh this value
will stay the same
however the random number that's being
generated will will sort of increase
decrease and change so what happens if
we don't want to use all this and we
just want to echo out a random number
between a specific amount let's say you
were creating a dice game where you user
how to roll a dice randomly so I'm going
to come down here and I'm going to
create a form the action is going to be
this current page out which is the next
top PHP and the method is going to be
post and what I'm going to do is I'm
simply going to create one button and
that's a submit button with the name
roll and the value roll a dice or is it
die I'm not too sure we'll say roll dice
it's a irrelevant here okay
so inside PHP let's just get rid of all
this for now we want to first of all
check if this button has been pressed
this is something by now you probably
should know how to do so we're saying if
is set dollar underscore post remember
we use a post variable here and roll
and oh that's it actually that's what we
need to do because we're clicking a
button so if the button has been clicked
we can say clicked just to test this for
now clicked okay so let's refresh our
page we can click on this and it will
come up with click so you sort of get
the idea of where this is going
what we're going to do is we're going to
generate a random number between 1 and 6
when we press this because a dice has
six sides
so let's um create a new variable called
round and we'll call that equal that to
round now we're going to echo out you
rolled a and then we're going to append
on this random number now as it stands
at the moment we have clicking the
button it's giving us a massive number
which is irrelevant to a dice so the
program is pointless however if I was to
specify just two arguments in here we
can specify a minimum and a maximum or a
lower and an upper limit limit so we can
say between 1 and 6 now so I've said 1
for the first argument 6 for the second
now this is an inclusive value so we
could we could be occurring a 1 we could
be echoing a 6 but we're not going to be
occurring and if you less than 1 or
anything more than a 6 and obviously the
numbers in between so let's have a look
here let's refresh at the moment it says
you roll a 4 we can click it again you
rolled a 2 you roll a 6 you roll a 4
year old a 3 a 1 so we've pretty much
had every value and we can keep clicking
that and it will never go over 6 and it
will never be under 1 so that is one fun
use if you like for the random function
now what are the other reasons we might
use it now when we're uploading files we
might want to specify a random a random
array or if you like of numbers and
characters and letters and things like
that anything really now the random
function is really useful because it's
going to produce a more or less random
value every time which you can combine
with other random values and let
of your choice and even md5 hashes which
you can look at on one of my other
videos so the random function is great
for doing what it says and if you do
need to use a random function all you
need to do is cool round you can specify
a lower in an upper limit a minimum a
maximum limit if you'd like to call it
that or you can just leave it blank and
you will be generating a number with a
predefined upper limit so that's the
random function in PHP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
