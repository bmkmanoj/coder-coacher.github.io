with a video tutorial for the new Boston
in this video we're going to be using
the remove attribute to undo say below
re-enable this button if you like and
we're gonna be focusing in on this
remove attribute surrounding this of
method that we're creating and
essentially what we're doing is we have
a check box with the label I agree
when we click on this the continue
button is enabled and we can go ahead
and click it we also disable this check
box as well so you know not really well
too much of a practical application but
there are practical applications to this
but I just wanted to create something
more sort of a pliable to real life to
demonstrate the remove attribute
function so this is essentially what
we're going to be creating let's go over
to our text editor and start writing it
okay so the first thing that I'm going
to go ahead and do is inside of my body
area I'm going to create the check box
itself and then also the button as well
so I'm going to make the button to be
auto I'm going to create the button with
the attribute disabled which will
automatically disable this button so
let's go ahead and first we'll create
the button I'm going to obviously create
an input with the type of button button
I'm gonna set a value to this just
continue and I'm gonna set a property
disabled I will just show you first in
the browser it looks like this we can
click on this button if we go ahead and
set the disabled attribute to disabled
and we refresh you can see that the
button is now disabled so that's in the
state that we want it we're going to go
ahead and give this button an ID of
continue which means that in jQuery we
the we can then reference this as
continue obviously you can use a class
or you can select a button you know as a
whole but in this case we want for very
specific uses it won't belong to part of
a class it's just a single item with a
single ID
okay so now that we've done that we just
have our disabled button on our page I'm
gonna go ahead and just surround the
checkbox in and paragraph tags so we're
gonna say input type equals and check
box and then next to this I just want to
write I agree so now we have this
checkbox here which we can check and
uncheck again I'm going to give this an
ID just so we can reference it and this
is just gonna be called agree so what's
gonna happen now we need to think of how
we're gonna you know set about this
process we're gonna click on the check
box once the check box has been checked
we want to in a we want to enable this
button and disable this button so let's
go ahead over to ext J's which I've
included on my page as well as jQuery J
s and in Jake in ext ojs we want to
first of all wait for the document to be
ready so we say document dot ready and
inside we have our function so this is
going to run when the document is ready
we want to bind an event handler let's
just pull this down a bit to make it a
little bit better we're gonna want to a
bind an event handler to this checkbox
so when it changes we can check for the
status on and then we can go ahead and
enable this button by removing this
disabled attribute so let's go ahead and
select our agree checkbox agree checkbox
and then we want to bind the event
handler change to this and inside of
here will be a function which we pull
down and in here we can just test this
by alerting out check for example so now
when we refresh and I click this you see
that we get this we get this button this
alert dialog box just up here so now
that we know that once we check it we
can perform you know an initial
operation and the first thing that I
want to do is I want to go ahead and
disable the current element so let's go
ahead and well actually we'll grab the
state first and we'll have a look
so I'm going to say state is equal to
this referring to the currently selected
object or element and I'm going to say
that and that will take the value from
this that the state essentially in
actual fact let's go ahead and say
attribute value and I'm going to alert
out the state so now when I click on it
you see that we alert on when I click on
it again you see that we are like
nothing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
