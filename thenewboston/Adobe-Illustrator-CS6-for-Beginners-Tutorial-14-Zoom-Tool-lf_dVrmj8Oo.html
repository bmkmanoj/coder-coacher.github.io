another Illustrator cs6 tutorial today
we're gonna be using the zoom tool to
change our view and stuff like that so
working with the zoom tool it gives you
more than one way to control exactly
what you see in Illustrator and it
doesn't change like the image but it
allows you to view the images at
different magnifications so the zoom
tool is all located over here on the
left and you can tell by the magnifying
glass you know that you're zooming in
when there's a plus sign on the glass on
the magnifying glass and when there's a
negative sign that means you're going to
be zooming out now could take it to the
negative sign you hold down alt and then
the plus sign will be already there by
default so you don't have to mess with
that so there's a couple ways that you
are able to zoom in using this tool
you can click and drag and make a box
and then you can zoom around that
particular set of items and then it'll
zoom in at like a set amount you can
also just click and it'll zoom in that
way if you hold down alt and just click
it'll zoom out that way and you can also
zoom out alt clicking by dragging a box
as well
now if you remember there's a couple
other ways that you can zoom in you can
use this magnification bar down here um
then I'll zoom in from the center and
then you can go up here to view and then
zoom in and zoom out and now you can see
that there's hotkeys for zooming in and
out ctrl + + actually it's just ctrl +
my bed and then ctrl - and both of these
zoom in and zoom out you can also click
on fit fit our board to window and then
set everything back to the default size
where it fits right to the window or you
can come down here click on fit on
screen and it does pretty much the same
exact thing a cool thing about the zoom
tool is that you don't have to be on the
zoom tool to actually use it so let me
click on some other kind of tool like
this paintbrush tool I got here
and let me click on something that we
can actually use here we go the magic
wand tool you can see that it shows up
and then if I click on something it's
gonna click on everything in a collector
magical magic wand tool does excuse me
so if you hold down control and then
press spacebar and hold spacebar it'll
switch automatically to the zoom tool
and that way you can click in and out if
you hold control spacebar and alt it's
gonna go to the negative zoom tool where
you can zoom out so that's a quick way
that you can switch between these tools
real quickly and have the zoom tool will
hand it for you to use now a cool thing
about when you zoom in on vector images
is that they're always going to stay
nice and crisp let me click off this and
let's start zooming in on this vector
image as you see as i zoom in it's not
becoming pixelated or anything like that
at all that's because the vector images
are infinitely scalable and will always
look crisp and clear no matter what your
zoom magnification is or how big you
scale them up now if we change our view
to a pixel preview anytime you zoom in
past six hundred percent so let me go to
four hundred real quick well you can see
our already how this looks like it's
pixelated and stuff like that it's like
making it like it's a raster but it's
not actually a raster it's just a
preview you go past if you go up to six
hundred percent you're gonna get the
pixel grid so that's something that you
probably would want to know just so you
can check out the pixel grid now just to
get that off just go to view and just
click on pixel preview again and you're
off of it and everything's nice and
looking nice again so that's that's one
of the that's the probably one of the
biggest advantages of using vectors is
the infinite scalability and the ability
to zoom in on them and have them be
crisp and clear the entire time makes
working with them way easier and a lot
better if you're working on some artwork
and you want to pretty much see what the
printed results of your artwork are
going to look
like you should always stay at a hundred
percent this will give you the best look
and feel of what your artwork is going
to look like so if you are printing out
a letter or something like that or a
piece of paper or something haven't had
a hundred percent to get the best up
view that you can get even if it's too
big to fit the screen because that just
means that not all of its going to print
off correctly so that's it for this
tutorial about zooming and zooming out
and stuff like that thanks a lot for
watching and hopefully you'll learn some
nice cool tips about doing that
especially that little shortcut where
your whole control and spacebar when
you're on any tool to change it into a
zoom see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
