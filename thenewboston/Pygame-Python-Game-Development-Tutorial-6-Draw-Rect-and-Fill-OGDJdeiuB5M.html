game tutorial this is video number 6 so
where we left off we were done in the
background explaining RGB and I told you
guys we're actually going to draw to the
screen well first of all I've already
showed you guys how to draw it at the
screen and that's with Phil but more
commonly what you're going to see people
use to draw things on the screen is dot
draw rect so let me show you guys real
quickly drawing of rectangles or even
like circles and stuff like this is
screen but we're gonna do rect for now
so underneath this game displayed I
filled out white think of the fill like
if you're gonna fill something in the
background
you're basically say you had you know a
picture okay a picture of a tree right
that you're showing me filled that
picture with white well you basically
clean the slate so what most people
you're going to see do is they're using
fill as a sort of like wipe the slate
clean so you can use fill you can also
have like a background image stuff like
that we're gonna keep it simple for now
and just have fill white so that's kind
of like our clearing and then between
fill and the display update is where we
render all the other graphics or show
the graphics them to render it at the
very end so we'll come down here and
we're going to do is draw a rectangle so
well to draw a rectangle we're gonna do
pygame dot draw dot rect and here the
parameters are where we want to draw it
what color do we want to draw it and
then the coordinates and the way that
the coordinates work is is it's asking
where is the top left of this object and
then how wide is it and how tall is it
and I'll explain that in a second too
cuz height will confuse some people
probably so pygame dot draw it out rect
where do we want to draw it well we know
we want to draw on the game display
right our surface so we draw it on the
surface what color do we want it
well-ordered we're going to make it
black because our background is white or
we can make it red but we'll make it
black for now I'll make the other thing
show you guys in a second red so we'll
make it black and now we specify the
rectangle and that's going to be in a
list so we're going to use these square
brackets and create a list so again
first of all it's the starting X&amp;amp;Y so
let's just say not sort of in the middle
so we'll say 400 um and 300 so the X is
400 y is 300 then how tall do we want
this object to be and how why do we want
a subject to be well um I'm sorry it'll
project its width and height since its
primary X Y so we'll just say for now
let's say 10 and 10 so let's go ahead
and save and run that and there we have
our you know white background now we've
drawn this little black box now just to
make sure I tell you guys the right
thing I'm guessing its width and height
I'm not positive on that so let's go and
run that and get our answer yeah so it
is width and height again right height
again so we've got 10 wide and what do
we say 100 tall yeah so then width and
height so also let's talk robe quickly
um let's draw one more so we'll copy
this and I'm going to paste this down
here and instead of black we'll make it
red and instead of a hundred we'll make
it 10 so sit on that and see how was
first of all first it drew the really
tall rectangle right and then after that
we filled it with red now some people
might be slightly confused by why is the
red square here where and this extends
down because didn't we say we want it to
be a hundred pixels tall and the way
that coordinates work basically is
everything goes from like when you say a
coordinate is zero zero if we're talking
about zero zero on surface zero zero is
actually up in this like top top left
corner and then when you add to Y you
actually go down so when you specify we
specify the top left coordinates of the
box and
say it's going to be a hundred pixels
tall that's 100 pixels down and that's
not negative that's positive motion for
the y axes so that confuses people
sometimes but just keep that in mind
so we do that we're going to go ahead
let's change this back to 1010 let's get
rid of this red dot there and now I want
to show you guys a kind of a superior
method to drawing rectangles so if
you're gonna be drawn a rectangle this
is actually better way to do it we're
not going to do this just because it is
a little more complex to do the
reasoning behind why we would do this
for graphics acceleration but I do want
you guys to understand that this is an
option and that is using fill so as you
can see we used fill here and we only
threw in one parameter and that was
white but there's actually another
parameter X there's a few parameters you
can put in here but another one is
repped so we can come down here and if
you don't put any rectangle parameters
in here it just assumes you want the
whole surface but you can't put reps
parameters in there so what you can say
is you can say game display dot fill and
now I say we want to fill it red and I
will say the ret equals and this is a
list it's exact same format is this list
so the top left x and y-coordinate we're
going to say we want that to be 200 by
200 and then how big this box you want
to be lets say we want 50 pixels wide 50
pixels tall let's go ahead and save and
run that now and you see how we have a
big red box over here and a black box
here so this is our original little
black box and then we've got a red box
here that we just drew and the red box
was drawn actually using fill and so a
lot of times wrong I see people using
fill to draw shapes to the screen but
you can and fill can be graphics
accelerated so we can do things that
makes this much quicker for processing
as compared to drawing rectangles to the
surface so anyway that is how we can
draw things to the screen so that's it
for this video and stay tuned to the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
