to make a video real quick because I
keep giving a lot of the same messages
and comments in my videos and stuff so I
figure I make a video to keep you guys
updated on what's going on my channel so
let's just start it the first question I
am getting a lot is what's the next
contest and when is it going to be well
actually i just bought a whole lot of
cameras and camera gear because i'm
going to start making videos like a
little skits and stuff um you know aside
for my tutorials or in addition to my
tutorial so the next contest is probably
not going to be until October but it's
going to be awesome I don't even know
what it is yet I haven't decided what
I'm going to give away so if you got any
ideas leave a comment saying what you
want me to give away and i'll give it
away but unfortunately i'm probably not
going to be able to afford anything into
october so then is when i'm going to
have the next contest the next a
question i got a lot after i posted my
last test video is what kind of cameras
did you buy i bought two HTTP vixia hv30
s if you can see right there and these
are high def cameras so you should be
seeing this in high def look at the
quality it's amazing and i also bought
two shotgun mics or article yeah shotgun
mics so uh and those are for skits i'm
going to be making in near future so
again like i said i have to pay these
off first because i put them on my
credit card so I'm aside from that and
another thing a lot of people are a lot
of you guys are probably going to ask
this um I edited it in Premiere Pro and
i exported to after effects I now
probably mess with the contrast in there
and I output it as a quicktime file in
my compressor with an mpeg-4 so that
should answer all your techy questions
and the last thing the last question i'm
getting a lot is
you guys were worried about when I
posted that promo for blender that you
guys thought I was going to stop making
3ds max tutorials well I'm also going to
continue with my 3ds max tutorials the
only problem is as soon as I posted in
my um whenever I said that I was like
going to be making 3d tutorials I got so
many responses to people saying do
blender do blend or do blender it's free
every other programs too expensive so
that's why I want to do 3d max because
it works best with after effects but
also i wanted to do blender for you guys
who uh i don't know i guess a lot of you
guys want to use blender so i'll teach
you guys how to use that so to answer
your questions yes i'm doing blender and
i'm also going to keep going with my 3ds
max tutorials after all it's one of my
favorite program so how can i stop so
that's that for this video again just
want to make a real quick video keep you
updated on my channel but if you have
any other questions just leave me a
comment and ask me and if a lot of
people ask me the same question i'll
make a video video response answering
your questions so for now that's that
thank you guys keep subscribe and keep
promoting my channel and i promise you
i'll keep having awesome good ways and
awesome stories and in near future i'm
going to have some pretty cool and funny
skits so thank you guys for watching and
I will see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
