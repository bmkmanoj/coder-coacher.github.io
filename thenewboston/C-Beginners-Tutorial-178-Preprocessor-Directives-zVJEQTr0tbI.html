tutorial and I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to use some
preprocessor directives so all you need
for this tutorial is a button and once
you have it on your form just go ahead
and double click on it alright so we've
already learned two preprocessor
directives without knowing it first is
region and the second is and region
which pretty much just go hand in hand
but anyways remember with region and n
region you can basically just region off
code so we just had a bunch of code in
here like I don't know and we didn't
want to look at it we could just
minimize this right here and we wouldn't
have to look at that code anymore and
also it just cleans up your code a
little bit so if you had like I don't
know 30 constructors or something and
you didn't want to look at all those
then you could just put them inside of a
region and you can also name your region
so if you wanted to just like name your
rican like your name or something now
when you minimize it you'll see that it
says that inside a little grey box
instead of um just hash mark region
alright so the next preprocessor
directive that we're going to be looking
at is defined and fine is used for
basically defining a symbol and when
you're using both define and undefined
which we'll look at in a little bit you
must do it before every other code so
you can have preprocessor directives
before it such as the other defines and
other undefined but you can't have like
using statements or namespaces or
anything like that so if we wanted to
define a symbol right here like Adam we
could do that
mouse call Adam one but symbols are
basically used or if statements or
preprocessor directive if statements to
be exact so you can say like if
something is defined then do something
else well before we do that we're going
to also look at the undefined so you can
just do a hash mark and
define and then undefined a simple so
undefined Adam one and now it just finds
it up here and then it undefined it so
if we were to say if Adam is defined
then it would be false since we
undefined - Adam right there but we're
just going to delete that so we'll be
true all right so let's say that if adam
is defined then you just want to have a
message box show saying my name so it's
a adam is define alright and we can't
just use regular if statements we're
going to have to use the preprocessor
directive if statements so we're going
to want to put a hash mark and just put
it and then following that we're going
to want to put a symbol to see that we
want to test
so is Adam one defined yes it is because
you can see this code right here is it's
not gray but if Adam wasn't defined if
we were to go up here and undefined Adam
on fine
Adam 1 then this code becomes gray right
here because unusable it's not this
doesn't return true so we'll never get
to this code right here and it's asking
for more closed curly braces but we're
just going to put the end if inside of
here so it would never get to this
message box and it would actually get to
these so we're just going to put right
inside of here and if and now I'll just
end this if statement and usually when
you're using MDF you're just going to
want to put I'm Adam 1 to remind
yourself what you're actually ending or
what if statement you're ending or in
here so if we were to debug it would
never get to that message box that show
code since um Adam is undefined
yep it never got to it but if we were to
delete this undefined right there it
will get to this coder here and we're
going to message box the show yep
perfect
adam is defined and you can also do else
if and else inside of here so or else if
you just do Ella and else
I don't know something else is defined
like Bob one is Bob one defined then if
Bob one is defined then we're just going
to have a message box shows saying Bob
is Bob is defined but since this is else
it'll never get to it since once it says
one is true it Jill it'll just end it
because that's the same at all else if
statements so once the first one is true
it will just stop going there and won't
get to the second one so we'll just say
Bob is defined it is defined but Adam
isn't defined so if we were to on define
Adam right here just delete that then we
can see it we'll get to this code since
Adam isn't defined then we'll go through
this elsif right here and Bob is defined
and we can use else as well so we can
say else and then we can just say a
message box show and nothing is fine so
over here nothing is fine but since Bob
is defined it'll never get to this else
right here all right
and one more thing that I'm going to
show you before we end this tutorial is
the Aires and Tom you can basically just
throw errors with these as well so if
you want to have an error do it you just
do a hash mark and then you just put air
error and then just the name of your
area whatever you wanted to call it like
Adam is defined so if Adam it to find
will get an error so free to go up here
and define Adam 1 now we get an error
saying Adam is defined and you can also
do warnings as well so you can change
this to a warning and we'll get a
warning saying Adam is defined all right
so that's pretty much it for this
tutorial on preprocessor directives so
see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
