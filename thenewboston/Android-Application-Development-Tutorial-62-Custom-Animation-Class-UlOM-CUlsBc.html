Android tutorial for the new Boston and
you know what you guys are ready for
you're ready for some graphics you know
some simple animations some stuff for
you're going to need for games and all
that other all I got other great stuff
so let's create a new class real quick
and call it GFX I don't know for
graphics and you know as always what we
need to do is we need to go into the
manifest and define this new class I'm
going to just select one of these
smaller ones here
copy/paste GFX and save that as well as
go into our menu and also do GFX here
just get everything set up and this this
little series here within this greater
series that we're doing is probably
going to take a few tutorials just to
get everything going and kind of getting
you guys to understand the basic
concepts of graphics you don't see a lot
of like game tutorials online because it
gets pretty complex and it's kind of
hard to you know describe everything
that's going on so it's going to be
fairly simple we're just going to be
working with animation simply at this
time I don't know how much time I'm
going to go into the gaming stuff I will
on my channel at my bring back but just
because I come on teach you guys Android
in its entirety for the most part I
don't know how much time we're going to
have for all this good stuff but we're
going to do graphics and we're going to
say extends activity just as always and
there we go we got an import activity
and we're going to also do the oncreate
method
so you guys should know how to do that
by now and click that and hit OK and
then what we're going to do is basically
set up a new variable which will be a
variable that we're going to define in a
different class that we're going to
create ourselves so we're going to call
this my bring back and again class name
should be uppercase so we're going to do
my bring back like this and we're going
to call this our view that's the name of
the view and this is the type of
variable it is
right now it's giving us an error
because it's like hey I don't know what
class this is coming from what are you
talking about we're going to define that
in the next tutorial but basically what
we're doing is we're setting up our own
custom view that's going to hold our
animation so now what we're going to do
is say our view which is that variable
we set up that can work within this
whole class we're going to say new my
bring back and then we're going to pass
in this so again as of now this means
nothing the computer is like what's
going on you're confusing me going crazy
but you know it's going to all work out
here so we're going to say
setcontentview
now equal to our view and there we go I
mean we're pretty much done with this
tutorial cat all sorts airs no one knows
what's going on but basically basically
all we all want to show you guys is we
can create a new class and pass that
class in and kind of you know define it
as well as you know you guys might get
familiar with this new that we've used
before and also what this is and kind of
passing information along and how it
relates to the actual class so this is
these look this little series is going
to be pretty beneficial for you guys but
as of now I know it's kind of confusing
so I'll catch you guys in the next
tutorial have a good one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
