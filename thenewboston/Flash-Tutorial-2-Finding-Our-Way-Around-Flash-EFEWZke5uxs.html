tutorial today we're going to be
discussing the interface of flash and
learning what everything actually means
so when you open up flash go ahead and
create a new flash file ActionScript 3.0
this is just basic flash file and when
you first open it you see a bunch of
crap that you don't really know what
anything is or what to do with it and
that's what we're gonna be talking about
today just getting to know flash and
getting our way around so at the very
top you see the main menu bar and some
basic commands such as file where you
can save your documents edit view and
also the help 1 if you're familiar with
any computer program or ever had a
computer before in your life do you know
what these basic ones do but there's
some that you don't quite know what they
are and we're gonna be talking about
those first one we're going to talk
about is inserted now this lets you
insert new symbols and also lets you
insert new layers what you don't know
what they are yet but this is where it
is just let's see insert new pieces into
your flash file modify lets you change
shapes it like it lets you rotate them
and change the size of your image as as
long as as well as some other stuff that
we'll get into later text is pretty
obvious it just allows you to use text
and changes size or style or align it
anything with a basic text command and
commands this is more for advanced and
we won't really be using a lot of things
under commands but control we will be
using anytime we have an animation and
we want to test that we can either use
this to test the movie or Tessa scene
here's some basic control commands like
play rewind go to end now debug we won't
really be using that much either for the
basic story oh that's more for advanced
and the next section I want to talk to
you guys about is of course this big ol
section in the middle called the stage
now anytime you see this ye right here
that's where you're going to be actually
making your drugs and the animations are
right on this the gray part next to it
it's called the workspace no nothing you
draw in here is actually going to show
up when you play your animation there's
just extra space to give you a little
more room to work with
to the right side of that scene you see
all your panels now what these are are
just for more advanced techniques that
we'll be learning later and all of your
panels are organized under this windows
tab right here this is a list of all of
your panels now if you want to rearrange
them you can click anywhere on the grey
spot and move them around to anywhere
you'd like now say you want to move back
anytime you want to move back to your
default workspace just go under your
windows click workspace and click the
fall this will bring you back to your
normal workspace now
on the left-hand side of your screen you
see all the tools and this was what
we'll be using the most and these are
just for all your basic tools for
drawing animations and we'll be covering
all of these in the next tutorial and
the last thing I want to talk to you
guys about is right up here this is
called the timeline now what the
timeline is is it makes frames and
movements and portions of your
animations it's pretty much like a big
old slideshow in each of these little
boxes as a slide in it so each box
represents an image in your animation
and when it's all played together it
looks like actually moving animation and
of course we'll talk about more of this
later when actually find out how to make
a animation so in the next tutorial I'm
going to be talking guys about this
basic tools and we're gonna be making
our first drawings and if you missed
anything I went over today you can go to
my website the new boston comm and I'll
have everything I cover today thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
