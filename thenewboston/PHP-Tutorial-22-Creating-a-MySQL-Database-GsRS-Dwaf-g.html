tutorial in PHP and in this tutorial we
are finally finally finally going to be
creating our very first database and to
do this I'm going to be using something
called PHP myadmin
and let's go ahead and go ahead and get
started
enough of the small talk so to do this
go ahead to wherever your website
hosting is mine's at host monster which
is excellent by the way and go ahead and
type in your domain name mine is the new
Boston there it is right there and enter
your password and let's go ahead and
login and you guys will probably see
something a lot like this wherever it is
you're going to want to go to the thing
that says MySQL databases and this is
where we can create our first database
now when you're creating a database for
the very first time the very first thing
you do is give it a name so I'm going to
name mine game and go ahead and click
create database and it gives you this
little confirmation created the bit the
database game go back but the thing is
the name of your database is not
actually the name you typed in that name
you typed in you're never going to use
again this is the name of your database
and you need to know this and remember
it because whenever we reference it or
call it in our PHP script this is the
name that we want to use so that name
you typed in forget about it completely
MySQL will automatically generate a new
name for you and that's the one that you
want to use so right now we have a
database and it's pretty much an empty
database but we have no way to access it
it's pretty much like a database and
empty your room but we need a key to get
into that room and to do that you have
to create a user without a user you
can't use it that's why the name of the
user so let's go ahead and create our
username that we can add
to a change our database I'm going to
make a user called Bucky and I'm going
to make my password password as you can
see it's a very weak and I will be
changing this by the way if any you guys
try to hack into my site and change my
dad base just uh for the sake of this
tutorial I'm going to use it type and
password again and go ahead and put
create user I think I pressed it yep now
once you create this it will give you
another verification added the user
Bucky with the password my password go
back and as you can see once this goes
back just like it renames your database
it's also going to rename your user so
you're going to want to go ahead and
remember your user the new Bo Bucky even
though we type Bucky this is the one
that we want to use and you're going to
want to remember this so write it down
because they're more likely pretty easy
to forget so the only thing that didn't
change is a password that one stays the
same so now that we have our database
created we can add tables to it and
start adding information to it but that
is the tutorial for next time so for now
get your database made and make sure to
write down the name of it and make sure
to write down the name of your user and
make sure that you're watching these
tutorials and high def trust me it'll
make a world of difference so thanks for
watching and remember if you're not
already please subscribe to my channel
and stay tuned for next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
