function and then we just pull down our
brackets there as we usually would write
a function however obviously we don't
give a name to our function here we just
leave it as function okay so down here
is our or function or plugin contents so
in this case the plug-in is just
literally going to replace or create a
target based on what it already is so
what I'm going to go ahead and do is
just say alert I'm going to I'm just
going to alert working out so what we're
going to do is we're going to test our
plugin that we've just defined here and
we're going to alert out if it's working
so inside ext JSI I want to go ahead and
test this and I'm going to test this
using all a tags so the first thing we
want to do in jQuery is obviously wait
for the document to be ready and inside
here we create our function so I want to
apply this to all a tags so I want to go
ahead and use the selector to select all
a now what I can do is as opposed to
using a someone else's function or
something part of the jQuery library we
can actually go ahead and call our own
function and that is target --blank and
don't forget the parentheses as well
okay so now that we've done this what
should happen is is inside here
obviously we've included plug-in where
we've defined our plugin and here we're
actually calling our plugin this should
just simply alert out working so let's
go ahead and refresh and you can see
that it just instantly alerts outworking
obviously there's no you know
functionality to this it's not you know
what we want it to do but now that we
know that we've called it through EXT is
here we know that it actually works
because we alerted something out so if
you do complete this process every time
you go ahead and create a function or
anything in jQuery really you'll know
that something's working based on an
event in this case it was just to alert
something out so with regards to the
actual plug-in structure now we've
completed it so we've essentially gone
and created a jQuery plug-in however
will obviously go through and we'll
a bit more about how this particular
plugin works and you might learn
something along the way as opposed to
actually creating a plugin yourself so
the first thing we want to go ahead and
do is actually get the target of the
current element so in this case it's all
a tags so we want to go ahead and say
var target so we're creating a new
variable called target and inside of our
plug-in we can use this as we would
normally in jQuery to reference the
current element that this plug-in has
been appended to or the element that's
using this plug-in so we can use this
and what I'm going to do is I'm just
going to go ahead and get the attribute
target so in this case what we can now
do is alert out target and we can start
to see inside of our browser what kind
of output we get based on what we've
supplied as the target now at the moment
the target is undefined we haven't
actually created a target to this so
when i refresh you can see we get this
undefined message he'll this undefined
result here now if I go ahead and
actually add a target but leave it blank
you'll see that we get nothing so we've
got something blank so now we're
starting to think what we actually need
to check for in order to modify this
target attribute and in here now I'm
going to go ahead and use underscore
blank and that will just output
underscore blank and then obviously I
can do the same for something like self
and when i refresh we get self so we now
know that what we want to do is we're
checking for three things first of all
we're checking if we're checking if the
target actually is undefined or if the
target is defined but equals nothing but
we also need a list of targets that we
can supply in HTML and then actually
check these and we're going to be
creating them as an array
so the targets that we have were we're
allowed to use we're going to be putting
these into an array and checking whether
they equal it and if they don't equal it
so for example if we'd supplied self
here we don't want to then go ahead and
change this to blank if the users
defined it as self which we will put
into our array so for now let's go ahead
and just get rid of all of this inside
plug in J s I'm going to get rid of this
alert once again and I'm going to go up
here and I'm just going to define a
target array so we're going to create an
array with potential targets that could
be inside of here now there's four in
total and this doesn't include using a
target to open something in an iframe
and we're not going to be taking that
into account in this example but if you
are loading content into an iframe using
a link and you are using this plug-in
you might come across problems so that's
something to go ahead and look at
yourself so the four options we can have
is first of all blank remember we don't
want to replace this with blank if the
target already equals blank so you know
we don't want to go ahead and use any
more processing power to change this if
it already equals blank you also don't
want to change it if it equals self and
then again the same with parent and top
as well so these are the other potential
values that target could be so now that
we have this we can use the jQuery in
array function to actually check whether
the target is inside of this target
array and if it's not inside the target
array we you know we don't want to do
anything okay so now that we've done
this we'll go ahead and create an if
statement and we'll take into account
the three issues that we came across the
first one being if this is undefined so
at the moment in this current state the
target is undefined so the first part of
our condition is if target is equal to
undefined and obviously what we want to
do here is apply target blank so if the
target is equal is is undefined we want
to etat we want to apply the target
underscore blank because that's what the
plug-in
however we're going to use the or
operator to check two more things the
first one being that target is equal to
nothing so the first one target
undefined is in this state as it is now
the second is if target is equal to
nothing so at the moment this is equal
to nothing and in this case if target
equals nothing now we could be clever
and we could say we want to trim this
target value so we'll go ahead and do
that now I hadn't planned to do it but
we can use jQuery trim to trim the left
hand and the right hand whitespace of
the target</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
