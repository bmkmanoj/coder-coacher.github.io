objective-c tutorial and in this store
we're going to be covering typecasting
and also assignment operators but before
that I want to talk to you guys about
some things first of all this weekend
I'm going to Myrtle Beach
so if you're one of my hardcore
subscribers looking forward to videos
this weekend I'm not going to be posting
any this weekend but come Monday or
Tuesday have should have some new ones
up and also people have been asking me
why when I'm doing these tutorials am I
looking to the left-hand side of my
screen or the right-hand side I guess if
you're watching on video well actually I
have a script um in notepad or I guess
it's called like text whatever it is on
a Mac but it's my script of topics I
follow so I don't forget to teach
anything in the tutorial so that's why
I'm looking to the left hand side of my
screen right hand side if you're looking
at in the video so let's go ahead and
get started in our tutorial that's my
last tutorial I had leftover I messed up
had to start recording again
accidentally set a customer it so I have
to restart the first topic I want to go
over is called typecasting and it's
pretty much not pretty much what it is
is converting one type of data to
another so in the last tutorials we
learned that you can only do certain
kinds you have to follow certain rules
depending if your data is float or int
but what if you want to follow the
integer rules with your float or vice
versa what you need to do is convert
your float to integer or your integer to
your float so let's learn how to do that
so say you have this float and you want
to assign a number to it but you want to
you have this integer and you want to
convert it to a float for whatever
reason what you need to do is before you
type in your integer variable go ahead
and type float in parentheses and then
go ahead and write your integer like I 3
or something so now I 3 is equal to 10
an integer variable but if you put float
in parenthesis behind it it's going to
take it and this can convert it to a
floating point decimal so now whenever
you divide by
I you can divide by anything like eight
or something now since there's a flow in
the expression then the answer is going
to be treated as float because remember
whenever you take an integer divided by
an integer it gives you an integer
answer in matter what but if one of them
is floats and that's why we did this
converted that first one to a float then
it's going to give you a flow answer so
let's log this down NS log percent F and
let's go ahead and print that baby out
and see what we get so build and run
save all and we get unused variables in
1.25 so now unlike before where it's
just an integer variable we get more
specific more accurate data since we
converted it to a flow nice enough so
pretty much anytime you want to convert
a variable to another data type I'll go
ahead and put what data type you want to
convert it to before it and again this
doesn't work with anything you can't
like convert characters and numbers you
can't convert the letter B into an int
but you know within a reason so now that
we have that part of tutorial done the
next thing I want to go over is well let
me go over another example this say you
have a new int called Bucky and set it
equal to armed int and then you can type
in a float just like this it doesn't
have to be just variables you converter
you can also convert whole numbers such
as like twenty six point seven seven
now we all know 26 point seven seven is
a flow not an integer so what would
happen when we typecast it or convert it
that's all it means whenever I say say
typecast I'm saying is fancy words for a
convert what happens when we convert
this to an integer well let's go ahead
and log this and I'm going to copy this
because I'm lazy like this why when I
paste this does this move up
not cool man not cool soap renowned I
and print out Bucky and let's see what
we get
building a run save all and now we get
an even 26 so again like I said not only
can you convert variables you can also
convert just regular numbers so that's
pretty neat trick so the last thing I
want to go over with you guys is now
that we have this variable Bucky and
it's equal to 26 I might as well use
this to go over assignment operators now
assignment operators are pretty much as
a short-handed technique of doing some
pretty common program with techniques so
if we wanted to add five to the variable
Bucky here's what we know how to do so
far
Bucky equals Bucky plus five so now what
does is take the value of Bucky which is
26 add 5 to it which makes it 31 and
then assigns it to the variable Bucky
again so it pretty much takes Bucky
which was 26 and now makes it 31 so let
me go ahead and print this out just so
you guys believe me nice build and run
save all and check this out now Bucky is
equal to 31
well actually check this out people did
this technique so often Bucky equals
Bucky plus 5 they're like I wish I
didn't have to play Bucky twice because
programmers are really lazy so they
figured out a way to kind of create a
shortcut to do this and check it out any
time you want to add something to the
variable and then change it itself
here's a nice little shorthand technique
of doing this instead of Bucky equals
pluck Bucky plus 5 pull Bucky plus
equals 5 and this is the exact same
thing it's just a short-handed technique
it's called using an assignment operator
and look at that 31 this means the exact
same thing and if you're saying all
right so can you only do that with
addition or what you can also do with
anything first let's go ahead and put
multiply right there
and now let's build it save and now we
get 130 so what this is equal to Bucky x
equals 5 is Bucky equals Bucky which is
26 times 5 which is 130 and you can also
do this division multiplication anything
you could usually do with a variable so
that's a nice little short-handed
technique and we're going to be using
that a lot in the future it saves you a
bunch of time typing extra variables and
well that's pretty much all of those
save you time typing variables and now
when you come across it in a program and
you're like what kind of operation is x
equals 5 I haven't seen that in math
class well now you know so that's all I
got for you guys for this tutorial thank
you guys for watching and make sure to
check out my blog so thank you again
don't forget to subscribe and I will see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
