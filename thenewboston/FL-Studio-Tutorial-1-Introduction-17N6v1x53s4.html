is bucky roberts and welcome to your
very first tutorial in FL studio now
before I even get talking about what the
heck FL studio is I want to go ahead and
mention this whenever you're watching
these tutorials either on youtube or on
my website make sure you're watching
them in full screen and also change your
resolution to 1080p try looking at that
little video player you're gonna
probably get a headache so again I
recorded my whole desktop so watch it in
full screen and watch them in 1080
resolution and everything should be
crystal clear just like you're looking
at your own computer so now that we got
that out of the way I want to talk about
what the heck is FL Studio well if you
just clicked on this video and you have
no idea what this program is it's
basically a piece of software that
allows you to make beats on your
computer and I'm not talking about the
vegetable if you want to learn how to
make beats like grow them so you can eat
them those are in my farming tutorials
later on but if you want to make like
hip-hop beats or maybe some music that
sounds like dubstep or rap beats for a
rap song this is in my opinion the best
program out there to do so now with that
being said it's not the easiest to use
and that's just because it has so many
features it's so powerful and it's
pretty much a very professional program
but it is the best it gives you the most
control and well that's that so now
you're wondering all right sounds pretty
enticing how the heck do I get it well
you can either download it online or you
can buy a CD and you know install it
like you installed your operating system
but let me go ahead and talk to you guys
through how to get the demo in maybe if
you want to buy the full version you can
do that as well so go to google and type
in FL studio I don't want to give you
guys the website because you know how
different companies buy out other pieces
of software and the website might change
well just go ahead and type it in Google
and click on the first result and that's
going to take you to whatever the FL
Studio website is now if you just want
the demo then on the home screen and
again depending on when you're watching
this maybe you're watching this like
three months after I made the tutorial
the demo maybe on a different link or on
a different part of the website but go
ahead and click demo and this is going
to give you pretty much a trial version
now I am using a version that I paid for
but if you download the demo you're
going to be able to follow along with
all my tutorials no problem the only
difference between the trial version and
what you're going to watch me you know
make tutorials on the full version is
that on the trial version you can save
projects but you can't open them again
so if you have a beat that you're
working on and it's going to take like a
few weeks to make you need to buy the
full version and that's one of the
differences between the trial version
and another thing there are a lot of
different functions and features in here
some of them may be locked or not
available if you're just using the demo
version so for these tutorials they're
going to be pretty basic and we're not
going to be getting into any really
in-depth stuff but if there's some
feature that's locked or you can't see
that means that you're just you know
you're still working with the travel
version so you're probably going to need
to buy it eventually so now you're
saying alright so I want to know how to
buy the software and you know you're
like alright are you really going to
talk to me make it tutorial about how to
buy software I know exactly how to buy
you go to shop and then you add to cart
and buy it well I want to tell you guys
a problem that I had in a ma it's
probably going to save a bunch of you
some you know a headache or something on
the website you can go to shop and
download and you pretty much buy it
online then just download it but
whenever I did this I put in my credit
card and my bank was like whoa whoa whoa
this company right here whoever owns FL
studio' they're overseas in some weird
country so it wouldn't let me buy it
online so I'm like I want the software
but I can't download it from this
website what do I do
so what I did is I actually went to
amazon.com and I typed in FL Studio and
you can buy it here off of Amazon and
they just send you a CD in the mail and
you can just install it no problems
whatsoever the exact same software so
again if you tried to buy it online and
your bank doesn't want you paying some
company overseas then just go to
amazon.com
you can buy it there but anyways that's
my boring story about buying software
and again like I said if you download
the demo you're going to be a lot able
to follow along with these tutorials
just fine so in the next video now that
we have the software or hurt hopefully
you downloaded it some way and you know
got it installed and everything on your
computer I'm going to be talking guys
through the interface all of these menus
and buttons and I'm also going to show
you guys how to make a very simple beat
so thank you guys for watching don't get
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
