and this is a video tutorial for the new
Boston and today we're going to be
talking about arrays inside PHP now an
array is a way to store data inside one
variable and it's basically a collection
of data so for example if I wanted to
store a few numbers I'm going to say 1 5
10 20 now if I want to store these
inside one place where I can access them
that would be you know more useful than
having to break them up somehow to use
them individually it also works well
when you want to loop through and take
elements of an array so if you don't
quite understand what an array is then
follow the examples listen as carefully
as you can watch as carefully as you can
and you'll you'll start to grasp why
they might be useful now in PHP I'm
going to create an array by using a
variable and I'm going to do this by
creating the variable standard and
assigning I'm going to assign it an
array to it so I've called this variable
food now I'm going to use the array
keyword I'm going to put two brackets
and then obviously I'm going to end my
line
now the two the two clearly broccoli
bracket so rounded brackets are where
you're going to put each element of your
array in now an element is or a value of
an array is automatically assigned a key
and the keys start from zero and then
they go on and on not so if I was to
create first of all food here pasta this
is key zero of our array this is the
data held at Kesey row and the value of
key 0 is pasta and Behrman we can put
numbers in these as well but we can't
mix them so they have to be all of one
data type so food equals array of pasta
Pizza salad and I've just separated
these with commas and I have put them in
single quotation marks so now we have
three elements to our array at key 0
here
key 1 and key too so if I want to access
say pizza I'm going to say echo food and
this time I'm using square brackets this
is accessing the key of the Iranian side
here the element of each array and I
want to say 1 now 1 you'd think normally
would be relative to this one but
obviously this is 0 this is 1 this is 2
so we're echoing out key 1 of the array
food and we know it's an array because
we're using square brackets so this will
simply echo out pizza so let's refresh
and you can see that set out pizza the
same as if we change this to 0 that's
going to echo out pasta and if we change
this to 2 that's going to echo out salad
now there's a quick way to see I mean
that's basically a raise on the round
these are these are just normal arrays
that were storing data in now if I
wanted to say see all elements of the
array I can use the print R here the
print R function and all I do is put the
name of the array in now this gives us
it in a way that we can really
understand how this is working so if we
refresh you can now see a clear
demonstration of how the array works and
how they each value is stored so we
start off with this array keyword that's
just there and if but just out of our
demonstration if you were to just echo
out the array on its own all your
display with is this array keyword
you're not given the elements of the
array you need to access them
individually using the square brackets
but for now if we're just using the
print our food this is just basically
showing us
each key of the array so remember it's a
key 0 P 1 and Q 2 and the value pasta is
assigned to keys ero the value of Pizza
is assigned to key 1 and the value of
salad is assigned to key 2 so we can see
these and access them however long
however and many things we add on so for
example I could add and on to the end of
this and let's just say vegetable and I
refresh you can see that that's LM added
an a key of 3 with your value of
vegetable so this is just basically how
arrays work all you really need to know
at this point is that you can store many
different values inside one data type
and then they can be accessed
individually but later on we can look at
things like associative arrays which
give us a bit more flexibility and where
we assign not keys but we assign our own
our own of keys in in a specific type if
you like that allow us to use
associative arrays their advantage and
also multi-dimensional arrays but this
is just basically arrays as a whole
now I've just had a thought you can
actually assign values to arrays by you
by this so if I was to say food now
we've got 0 1 2 3 go into the assigned
and a key at key 4 I want to assign
something else so I could say fruit so
I've assigned a key for the value fruit
now obviously I could have just done
this in here but if you wanted to do
this and say a loop or something like
that and this is would be the way to do
it late obviously later on in PHP you'll
understand why this method is a lot more
useful than this method here so let's
just go ahead and print our and then
array of food which is how we've stored
it and refresh and you can see that at
the end we've got key 4 here and we've
assigned the value of fruit and we've
done that in a complete
different way but individually it is
useful in some circumstances so that's a
basic arrays in PHP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
