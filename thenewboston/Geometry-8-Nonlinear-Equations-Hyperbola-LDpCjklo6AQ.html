last kind of nonlinear equation we're
gonna talk about which is the hyperbola
now it comes in the standard form x
squared over a squared minus that minus
is really important because that's how
we tell an ellipse apart from a
hyperbola so minus y squared over B
squared so for this particular hyperbola
or for this particular standard form of
a hyperbola the center is at 0 0 but if
if it isn't if it doesn't have a center
at 0 0 its Center is going to be K H so
it has two asymptotes at y equals plus B
over a X and minus B over a X and you're
probably a little confused about that
but you'll see it in a second when we
graph an example and it's going to have
vertices at a comma 0 so at a 0 and
negative a is 0 so let's do an example
so we have x squared over 9 minus y
squared over 4 so a is equal to 3 B is
equal to 2 and it's asymptotes are going
to be at y equals positive B over a and
negative B over a so and it's gonna have
vertices at positive a 0 and negative a
0 so first we're gonna graph the
vertices and the center so the center is
right here and I'm just gonna graph that
so you can see it because
this does not intercept to set its
center just like a high part just like a
circle and then the ellipse doesn't so
I'm gonna graph both its vertices so 1 2
3
this is vertice 1 1 2 3
this is vertice 2 so it's gonna have
asymptotes at 2/3 X so we're gonna start
at the origin we're gonna go up 2 over 3
down 2 over 3 and I'll go I'll do 1 more
in each direction 1 2 over 1 2 3 and
down 2 over 1 2 3 so it's gonna have an
asymptote right here and if you don't
know what an asymptote is it's a line
that your graph cannot cross and I'm
actually gonna do a dotted line so you
don't get confused and we're gonna have
one at negative 2/3 so 1 2 3 and this
one goes like that
and now if you look this has this is the
form of a parabola and this is the form
of a parabola so we're gonna have one
parabola that opens up this way and
follows its asymptotes but never crosses
it and we're gonna have the same thing
this way
so that's what a hyperbola looks like it
looks like two side-by-side parabolas
and you can also have a hyperbola that
opens up and down so now we're going to
do another example we're gonna have Y
squared over 4 minus x squared over 9 so
if you remember Y is always over B
squared and X is always over a
weird so our a is 3 our b is 2 so it's
asymptotes they're gonna be at 2 3 X and
negative 2/3 X like was my equals and
its vertices are gonna be at are gonna
be at negative 3 0 and 3 0 okay
but the thing to remember about this one
is that the X comes or the Y comes first
and this X is negative so first we're
gonna draw in our asymptotes and our
vertices so our Center is at 0 0 still
our vertices is going to be gonna be
I made a mistake on the vertices it
should be 0 3 &amp;amp; 0 negative 3 because
these two switch order so these two are
going to switch order so it's going to
be 0 3 0 3 because when we have Y first
it switches our hyperbola from going
like this to opening like this because
if you remember when you have a negative
in front of an x squared it reflects it
down and so our asymptotes are still
gonna go the same way
so our asymptotes are still gonna go
like this
except this time in order to follow our
asymptotes parabola is gonna have to
open up like that so that's all we're
gonna do with nonlinear equations
today make sure you come back though cuz
we're gonna work on some proofs dealing
with triangle inequality</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
