your fourth java tutorial and in this
story we're going to be writing a basic
hello world program but before we get
started let me point out to you guys one
thing now I told you guys at the point
of downloading Eclipse was check for
errors and whenever you get those error
messages it's going to say what line
that the error is on so we can fix it
but the thing with eclipse and it's odd
that it comes default like this
by default it comes without showing the
line number so before you get started
let me show you guys how to do one thing
that I know a bunch of you guys are
going to send me messages ask me how to
do in your window tab at the top go
ahead and click on preferences and then
your preferences tab is going to pop up
go ahead and expand your general editors
text editors and once you click that
it's going to have something that says
show line number go ahead and click show
line number and go ahead and click apply
now if you guys could guess what this
did it wouldn't surprise you show the
line number right there now we have our
line number so whenever we get errors
which we're bound to get we're going to
know where to go and we're fix them now
as promised let me get to the basic Java
program in which you've all been waiting
for now in Eclipse once you create a
class I already starts writing some of
the code for you and it creates a class
now again I know I told you guys unless
Stora but let me stress why a class is
important in Java everything begins with
the class so if you don't have a class
then you don't have Java or excuse me
Java I don't know what the heck you have
if you don't have a class but you need
one in Java so again everything we're
going to be writing in this story is
going to be inside your class semicolons
so make sure you're not typing out here
or anything like that in I'm going to be
telling you guys exactly what class is
later but for right now all you need to
know is to type inside it so just bear
with me here now inside your class the
first thing we're going to make is
something called a method now what
method is is
basically a recipe on how you want to
run your program now the first thing
your computer does when it runs a Java
program is it looks for a method called
main and if it doesn't find the method
main it has no idea where to start so in
your computer in Java built-in is the
instructions to your computer all right
the first thing I want you to do is look
for main and start there and from there
I'm going to tell you what to do so
since that's case the first thing we
need build is a method called main so
let's go ahead and do that so before I
even start with that I wanted to you
guys what the basic layout of a method
is before we can even start building
main now I told you guys method is
pretty much like a recipe so let's go
ahead and pretend we're writing a method
now say we have a method called bake
cake what this would be is the method
header right here again the method
header is pretty much um a substitute
for the method and name so bake cake is
the name of the method and this is also
called the method header now inside your
method or inside your recipe if I will
go and continue that analogy is all the
steps that you need to take bake that
cake so for example one would be mixed
batter and the next one would be put in
oven and you probably have some other
stuff ever at eat the eff and cake sorry
for cussing but again this is called the
method header in the instruction of how
you want to do things is called the
method body and all this together the
head in the body that's called the
method who would have guessed it so now
that we know pretty much how to name a
method and how to put statements inside
a method and what they are let's go
ahead and write a basic method and again
I told you guys all about main before so
let's go ahead and do it go ahead and
write public static why is it political
it up oh this is oblique public static
void
main and then in your main put
parentheses input string Arg s and 10
put square brackets now again all you
have to pay attention is this is your
main method right here all this stuff
I'm going it's important and I'm going
to be telling you what it means but I
don't have time in this tutorial to tell
you what it means so again this is um
what I named it bake cake this is all
this is and I know that you see a bunch
of different keywords and trust me just
bear with me you don't need to know them
right now so just copy as I do and as I
say is that even saying I don't know but
just follow on now that we have a name
of our method we need to give it some
instructions and all we want this method
do is print something out on the screen
so let's go ahead and write system dot
or period what I write period right
there oh that's kind of American system
dot out dot print line and after this
you want to go ahead and add parentheses
and write hello youtube and i know i
spelled YouTube wrong but who cares now
right semicolon now let me tell you guys
what I just did print line is a built-in
method and what this is going to do is
print a line out on your computer now if
you're saying that you're probably
asking all right how come I needed to
write system out then if this knows how
to print a line well print line can
actually is pretty versatile method it
can actually print line to a database or
print line to your network or print line
to other things but right now we want to
just print it to our system so again I'm
pretty much just telling you how to work
with eclipse right now so just bear with
me right here now once we have our
method built we want to go ahead and run
this so go ahead and click this little
button on the right hand side of your
screen and it's going to run the program
go ahead and you get this click OK and
at the bottom right here you get
something called hello you I too
and again that's what oppressed so that
is how you build a basic method using of
course your class what you need your
method header in your method body and
again your method header in your method
body together create something called a
method who woulda guessed it so that's
your first tutorial on how to create a
hello YouTube or hello UI tube program
and I know you you guys don't know what
everything means right now but I don't
have time to go through every one of
these things every one of these things
these keywords right here actually takes
an entire tutorial to describe so um
just bear with me
just stick with me for now and now that
you guys know how to create a basic
program I can begin teaching you the
more complex stuff and yes Java is a
entirely completely complex program so
just follow along with me for now type
this out and once you got your program
working you're ready to go on in the
next tutorial so I want to thank you
guys for watching this story make sure
to subscribe to my channel if you have
any questions to send me a message but
if not just move on in my next tutorial
so again thank you guys make sure to
subscribe and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
