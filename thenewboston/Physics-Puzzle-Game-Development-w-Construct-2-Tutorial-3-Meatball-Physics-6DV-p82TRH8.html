the cannon behaving how we wanted it to
what we can do now is start shooting
meatballs out of it now this is gonna be
a couple of steps so let me explain you
guys exactly what we're gonna do see the
first thing we're gonna do is we're
gonna say whenever we click first spawn
a meatball or create a meatball right
here now once it's created get to
position or in other words the angle of
the cannon and fling out the meatballs
or shoot it with a certain force out of
the cannon so the first thing of course
we need to do and that's a little like
step process is create a meatball right
at the tip of the cannon so in order to
do that we just need to add another
event and then this event is actually a
mouse event because it's going to be
determining the clicks and it says on
any click so basically when we click
with a mouse at all what do we want to
happen well all we want to happen is is
well I click action rupture said that
and for the cannon and this is actually
under miscellaneous
it's called spawn another object
basically create an object where this
object is so spawn another object and
says okay I need a little bit of
information first of all what object do
you want me to create and of course we
want you to create a meatball and it
says on what layer well if you look up
here the game layer everything is a
happening on this game layer one all the
cool stuff and for this image point I'll
tell you guys what this does in a minute
but for right now one and this is
actually pretty important to remember so
remember that our image point is one and
what this does is basically says where
exactly do you want me to create this
meatball object in the back of the
cannon and the front top bottom well we
said image point one click done so now
what we need to do is go to the layout
and then this cannon object tell it
where image point one is so if you
double click this you can see that we
have one image point right here and
that's
point zero and that's the origin and we
don't want the meatball created back
here routes we're not gonna see it we
actually want it created right at the
tip of the canyon right in the mouth
wherever you I don't know the opening I
don't know what like canon parts are
called
so we need to create a new image point
and whenever you create one it is one by
default because remember computers start
counting is zero so this new one is one
now in order to move this to the tip you
can just go ahead and hit six on your
keyboard
because remember eight moves it to the
top four left to bottom or six moves it
right to the mouth and check it out our
image point one is now right where we
want it properly so now if we close out
of this that'll automatically save it
for us and if you run this game then it
should work so I'm gonna go ahead and
click and we now have a meatball that
just gets created click click click
click alright so now you know this would
be a good app right now for just making
like um I don't know like spaghetti or
something but we actually want these
meatballs to fling around come out with
some force and instead of just plopping
on the screen now the first thing we
always need to do before we actually
start firing this thing out of the
cannon is we need to add a new behavior
to it so click on this meatball so it's
selected and over on the left hand side
hit behaviors and this is gonna let
allow you to add a new behavior to the
meatball and what we want to do is since
it doesn't have any yet just add a new
one and scroll down and you're gonna see
physics right here and as you can see in
that little description it says simulate
realistic object physics now what this
means in everyday terms is pretty much
treat it like a object like real life it
now has gravity we can now put on second
alright so basically it now has gravity
we can now shoot it out like a bullet
it just doesn't appear on the screen and
stay in one place like you were just in
empty space so actually if you run this
game right now we can see that that one
falls down all right so of course the
and I'm using the little quotes with my
hands even though you guys can see it so
now our meatball is affected by gravity
but we didn't tell it to shoot out of
the canyon with a certain force yet so
let's go ahead and do that now now that
it's actually being treated like a
real-world object so the cool thing
about this is before I do that since
this already has gravity applied to it
unlike our shooter game that we made a
couple um video series is go it isn't
gonna shoot in a straight line it's
actually when you aim it up here let's
say it's gonna go up and just like a
ball would if you threw it in real life
it's gonna go down
realistically instead of just a straight
line like a bullet so in the event
sheets what we need to do is we actually
need to add an action to the mouse click
event so right now we're just saying
okay when you click the mouse create a
meatball right at the cannon but now
what we want to do is we want to say
actually take that meatball and shoot it
out with some force so if we add an
action right here and we click the
meatball then if you scroll down and you
see physics there's actually a bunch of
them under this physics we want to put
apply force at angle and this is
basically gonna ask you a couple
questions the first one is the force
itself and it can be kind of confusing
unless you've been like working with a
little bit but the higher of course the
faster it comes out so just set this at
a thousand actually just set it at 900
for right now now the angle of this is
we pretty much just say well it's
dependent on the angle of the cannon
whatever the cannon angle is that's what
angle we want you to shoot the meatball
out of so in order to do that just type
in the name of your object which is
cannon and look at that the first one
so now when we click done we're
basically saying whenever we click the
mouse create a meatball right at the
cannon before and also shoot it out at a
certain velocity dependent on the angle
of the cannon so now whenever you run
this of course our first ones gonna drop
and actually it looks pretty funny right
now so it's now shooting meatballs and I
don't know if you guys can see but there
is a little bit of a curve there it it
it doesn't just go arm you know straight
down just like actually if I fired that
up you can see that the meatball is
gonna come down right here due to the
effect of gravity right there so that is
pretty freakin sweet we got you know a
nice physics real-world meatball so if
you ever threw a meatball in real life
at someone it would act the same way and
of course if your force is ever too high
or too low we can adjust that later but
for now our meatball is good to go thank
you guys for watching and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
