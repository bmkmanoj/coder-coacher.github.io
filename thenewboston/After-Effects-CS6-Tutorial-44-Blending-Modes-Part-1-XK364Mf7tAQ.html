After Effects cs6 tutorial my name is
buddy Blackford and this time we're
going to be learning about blending
modes I wanted to tell you guys this
story first I thought you might find
funny it involves Bucky and I we went to
our favorite bar and we had a few shots
because we like to order shots all the
time the Pittsburgh Penguins were
winning and for every goal that they
scored we had to do shots I think they
scored like 5 and that one and then we
did some a bunch for celebrating and we
were feeling pretty good and a few girls
walk in to the bar and they come up and
talked to us and a song that Bucky
really likes called a selfie came on and
it's like let me take a selfie or
whatever and so he got up he was feeling
good and he started doing the disco so I
mean it was pretty freaking hilarious
and just thinking about it right now I
just as want to laugh and I mean the
girl the girls thought it was hilarious
and after that we we eventually they
came back to our house and we played
some beer drinking games and stuff like
that and we've been friends with them
ever since so now that you guys know
that Bucky has the dance moves and can
get the girls with them you guys should
be envious of that well let's get on to
the tutorial I mean we can stop Bucky
doing the disco here and I've got a
video a little bit of video footage here
and then I've got this squish and I have
added a four color gradient to the
squish which if you want to follow along
is in effect color car where is it
generate generate four color gradient
and the reason why I picked that was to
help show how the different blending
modes work on different colors and
things like that so I made one of the
colors white and one of the colors black
and then I picked two colors in the
in-between so to get to blending modes
you need to come down to this toggle
switches in mode section
click it until you're on this part where
it has the mode drop-down and these are
all the blending modes here no there's a
whole there's a whole bunch of them and
I'll try to get to try to go over
everything and I'm not completely sure
how everything totally works but I have
a really good idea and each of these
sections here are divided by a line and
each of these sections have a common
theme to them like this section darkens
all these ones will darken the pixels
and all these ones down here we're
lighting the pixels and so on and I'll
get over it
I'll go over that for you so I guess we
might as well get started a blending
mode basically takes the layers that are
on top and mixes them with the layers
that are on bottom and it's going to do
that from the one that's the the object
that's on the top and the layers now if
you're in 3d view it's going to start
with the what's closest to the camera
and end with what's back farthest from
the camera and I noticed that when I'm
telling you guys things on here I move
my hands around even though nobody's
even watching and I'm not usually a hand
guy but I guess it helps me speak in my
tutorials I guess so if you want to do
some more reading on blending modes you
can go to Wikipedia and they have a
section here on different kind of
blending modes and you can listen you
can read about them and figure out how
they're created and you can maybe be a
professional on blending modes there I
usually just a have an eye I have a
general idea how they work and then I
experiment to see what looks cool
now the modes over here we're gonna the
top ones here I haven't found too much
usefulness for dissolve or dancing
dissolve and normal is just if you don't
want any blending mode at all this
second section here is the darkening
blending modes which will darken the
pixels in some way so make sure you have
the mode that's on top or the object
that's on top of your footage selected
and click on the blending mode and we'll
hit darken and you can see that um the
the white section here has been pretty
much taken completely out and you can
see how it goes over the top of the
footage here on these other colors and
the darken part the black part is pretty
much black no I'm sorry I'll come
through a bunch of different ones and
you can see how they pretty much work
but maybe I can move this over top now
I'll just keep it over here like it was
this is multiplied with multiply the
color values of the selected layer which
is the squish are scaled down by the
color values of the layer underneath
which is the video footage and that
result results in a darkened image and
it'll clip off at full when you're at
full black which is down here and as you
can see with even at full white it's not
going to completely disappear</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
