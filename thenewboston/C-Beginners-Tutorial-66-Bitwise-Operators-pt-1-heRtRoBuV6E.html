c-sharp tutorial that I'm making for
Drew Boston and in this tutorial I'm
going to be showing you how to use
bitwise operators a little bit so all
you're going to need for this tutorial
is a button and a short and just shut
set that short equal to three right now
so in previous tutorials we looked at
fits just a little bit but in this
tutorial I'm going to show you how to
fix just a little bit one so in order to
better understand bits go ahead and open
up a calculator go to view and change
that to program now as you can see right
here in this panel we have the different
ways that we can represent numbers if
you represent them at hexadecimal
decimal octal which we're not going to
get into and binary and um we're going
to be looking at binary for right now
and first we're going to be looking at
how to represent numbers in binary so
how would you represent a one well we're
going up with decimal appears and type
in a 1 and then go back and binary so
we'll convert it into binary so a 1 in
decimal is a 1 in binary
well how we represent a 3 because
there's no three character in binary
there's only on a 1 or a 0 so if we type
in 3 as you can see we get 1 1 well
we're going to be looking at the invert
operator today and what the invert
operator will do is it will invert this
or since there's only on two ways you
represent them in a 0 or a 1 it will
invert them to whatever it's not so
since it's not a 0 it will convert it
into 0 and that's another thing that
they call the invert operator they call
it not so since this is not a 0 it will
convert it into a 0 and same thing with
this
however in front of all binary numbers
there are a bunch of zeros and the way
to get the number of zeros in front of
this number here is find out how many
fits there are in a number and since we
are working with a short right here and
there are maximum of 16 bits in this
number we know that there are 1400 right
here because if we added these two it
would makes 16 so since there cannot be
any more bits there must be 14 zeros
right here so we reduce the invert
operator it would convert all of these
zeros in front of here to 1 and it would
convert from these two ones are here
into zeros and like I said before since
these zeros with not be a one who
convert them into a one so let's go
ahead and use the invert operator or the
not operator and right here on this 3 in
order to do that you're just going to
want to type out a little squiggle and
in order to do that you're just going on
a hold shift and go above your tab key
and click the key right there there
should be a little squiggle on it hit
that and as you can see we now have a
squiggle and like I said before this
will invert this 3 and since this is a 3
in binary
we'll just invert it and we'll get two
zeros and a bunch of ones so in order to
view binary as a string in c-sharp we're
going to have to use the convert dot to
string method and then we're just going
on first put the value that we want to
convert into a binary string we want to
convert our short or our inverted 3 into
a string and we have to put comma right
here and a second parameter that we're
going to pass through we're just going
to put a 2 right here so it tells it
that we want it to be enough and binary
so it should be only one zeros so now
we're just going to display this value
in a message box so you can see what it
did or what it converted it into so
right here we just read as long using
the invert operation on this 3 so we
should get a 14-1 right here and two
zeros and the message box yep 14 ones
and twos
I'm not going to count the ones and you
can do this with any number for example
if you want to do so five but five there
let's see what five is in binary let's
go to binary now we get one zero one so
what it will do is it will convert these
thirteen zeros in front of this one zero
one right here all into ones go convert
this one into a zero is zero into a 1
and this 1 into 0 so now in a message
box
we should get 13 zeros or 13 ones a 0 a
1 and a 0 yep so that's pretty much it
for this tutorial
in the next tutorial we're going to get
into a little bit more bitwise operators
the only ones that one in this tutorial
so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
