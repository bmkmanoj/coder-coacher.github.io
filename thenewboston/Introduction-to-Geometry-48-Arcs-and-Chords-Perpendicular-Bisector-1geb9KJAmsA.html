chords and their relationship to one
another so two chords are congruent if
they intercept congruent arcs so on this
circle Z the arc see y is equal to 180
degrees and arc w X is equal to 108
degrees so that means ey is congruent to
arc WX so that means that chord zy has
to be congruent to coord w X so if z y
equals 10 that means WX also has to
equal 10 okay two arcs of a circle are
congruent if their cords are congruent
so this is like the other one it's just
the contrapositive of it so these two
chords so s T equals 10 and vu equals 10
so that means st chord st is congruent
to chord vu so that means that cord or
sorry arc vu is congruent to ark st so
if arc vu equals in 93 then st also has
to equal 93
so now that we know that we're going to
take it one step further so the
perpendicular bisector of a cord of a
circle so we're talking about this cord
of this circle so the perpendicular
bisector which is this line right here
because it intercepts this cord to form
a right angle will four right angles
these are all right angles and it has to
contain the center of the cord and it
bisects the arc of the chords so that
means that QR this cord right here is
congruent to RP q n this cord right here
is congruent to PN
to PN and since it's a bisector it means
it bisects this chord QR into two equal
parts so that means that Q we're going
to call this point right here are so
that Q R is congruent to our P which
makes sense because if these two chords
are congruent then these two segments
must be congruent so now we're going to
do an example so we have this circle
where K is the center of the circle m I
we're going to try and tell what kind of
relationship mi has to Jael well since
there's a right angle right here that
must mean that mi is perpendicular to LJ
this line right here because when they
intersect it forms a right angle so KH
right here is equal to six and LJ is
entire thing is equal to 16 so first we
want to know that what LH is congruent
to so LH is this piece right here it's
congruent to JH right here because when
mi intersects jl it not only forms the
right angle it cuts jl into two equal
pieces
so arc glm which is this arc right here
is congruent to this arc right here JM
because these if you look at mi it's
also the diameter of this circle so this
arc is the corresponding part of this is
corresponding to this arc so I am by six
first we're going to give it the line
that up it bisects which is Jael it also
by sex this whole entire circle so that
it by six i J m and m li because it
divides this entire circle up in two
congruent pieces so the midpoint of LJ
which is this line right here is what if
you remember the midpoint of a line is
the point that divides that segment into
two equal parts well right here I have
two equal parts so that means mean that
H is the midpoint of segment LJ so LH
right here equals what well since we
know that LJ is 16 and that H is the
midpoint of LJ we can just divide 16
divided by 2 and you'll get eight if you
do that so that each one of these pieces
has to be aight i think it's centimeters
eight centimeters so la
is eight centimeters and JH is also
eight centimeters now they want to know
the length of L K this segment right
here well if you think about it KL has
to be congruent to j/k because if we
were to do the Pythagorean theorem we
would have an A which is eight abbi
which is six and the see right here for
this triangle and we'd have an a of
eight abbi of six and the see right here
of this triangle so in order to find out
what L K and J k equal we're going to
use our Pythagorean theorem so we're
because these are right triangles so
we're going to take eight squared plus 6
squared and set it equal to C squared we
hit 64 plus 36 equals C squared C
squared equals 100 and if you remember
the square square root of 100 is 10 so C
equals plus or minus 10 now let's talk
about that answer for a second since
these are distances see cannot be
negative so C asked to equal 10 so both
lk and j k equal 10 well that's all we
have for today be sure to watch the next
