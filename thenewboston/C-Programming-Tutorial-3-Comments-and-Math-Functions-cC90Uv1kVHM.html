to your third seed tutorial in this
story I'm going to be talking to you
guys about arithmetic operators and also
order a precedence or order of
operations now in the last tutorial I
show you guys how to add two numbers
like num1 plus num2 and set it equal to
variable but there are other things you
can do besides addition and these
include of course subtraction using the
basic minus sign any times you want
anytime you want to multiply you use a
little asterisk that's above the eight
on your keyboard or it's also above the
nine the nine on your number pad anytime
you want to divide an integer you use
the forward slash but the thing is since
we're using integers and only whole
numbers this is going to give you the
whole number value in no decimal point
anytime you want the remainder which is
pretty much the same as a decimal point
you have to use that little percent sign
right there
so anytime you want to use Arm actually
I'm going to be showing you guys an
easier way to do that later but for now
don't worry about it all you need is
multiply add basic divide and subtract
so let's go ahead and let me show you
guys something now that I told you guys
how to do basic calculations I want to
show you guys something called the order
of operations so the first thing we need
is a variable so let's put int let's
make it value so we're going to have a
value and integer value and while I'm
doing this I might as well talk to you
guys about something called comments a
comment is something you put in your
line of code to help the user or the
people reading it such as yourself
understand what's going on in the code
to the computer hold on I got whooping
cough to the computer it doesn't mean
anything at all and to do this use a
forward slash and asterisk and then type
this is
in and type of extracts and I know I
spelled that around in a four slash and
as you can see in my compiler it's blue
and this means two computer all right
once I read this I'm not going to pay
attention to any of this this is just so
people can understand what's going on
better so a comment so let's say I make
a comment right here I'll put calculate
the value and again this is going to
have nothing to do with our compiler or
program or anything like that just when
you're reading and writing code it's
useful to add comments sometimes so next
I want to talk to you guys about the
order of precedence and let's go ahead
and write the DEP whatever the variable
use value is equal to let's f6 plus 4
times 10 now let's go ahead and print
that value printf and just type it I'll
type in then tell you guys what it means
it's kind of hard to type and talk at
the same time all right let's go ahead
and run this program right now as you
can see if we ran it right now what it
would do is calculate this right here
store it in value and print it to the
screen so let's go ahead and figure all
right value 6 plus 4 is 10 times 10 is
100
right execute compile and run looking
for 100 looking for 100 which you have
wait for it there you go
46 what the heck what's that all right
it gets 46 because of this something
called the order of operations it says
that you have to do all this in a
specific order and the order is this the
very first thing it does is if you have
anything in parentheses like this right
here it would do the parentheses first
and then after that it does
multiplication in the vision and then it
does addition and subtraction so since
it does multiplication before addition
what your computer knows
is our right 4 times 10 is 40 plus 6 is
46 so take all of this and add that and
again if you want 6 plus 4 you need to
add the parentheses first and now once
we execute compile and run as you can
see it should print out 100 if I didn't
mess up right there 100 so again armed
the order of operations is simply
parentheses first and after you're done
doing what's in your parentheses do your
multiplication and division then once
after you're done do multiplication and
division then you do your distant
addition and subtraction so um that is
why if you have a long calculation it's
always useful to do parentheses just
cause you can't mess up when using
parentheses and we're going to be
working with this a lot later when we're
building applications so I figured I'd
have to teach you guys at some time so
might as well now so now that you
learned how to comment your code and
also the order of operations
um make sure to study this learn this
tutorial and in the next tutorial we're
going to be building a small application
to compare two numbers and also make a
smaller decision to output on the screen
while you compare sounds complicated but
I promise it's easy so again if you want
all the source code I'm going to copy it
right now and put it on my website the
new Boston comm so make sure to
subscribe to my channel make sure to
check out the next tutorial thank you
guys for watching and I'll see you next
