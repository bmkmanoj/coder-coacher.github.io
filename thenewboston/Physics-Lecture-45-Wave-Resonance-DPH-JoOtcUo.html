lesson and in this lesson I want to talk
to you guys about resonance not the
Renaissance which was something that had
been a long time ago not residents or
especially residents evil because I
don't even think that exists they should
make a game called a resonance evil
based on physics by anyways I'm getting
off topic here in order to understand
resonance we first need to understand
something called natural frequency now
natural frequency is the tendency of
objects any object to vibrate at a
certain natural frequency so go ahead
and do this go ahead to your china
cabinet hopefully it's your parents and
grab one of your dad's and nice wine
glasses why because I hate your dad as
you already know now go ahead and tap
this wine glass and when you do the
first thing you're going to notice is
you're going to hear a sound coming from
it now the sound is caused by vibrations
that were caused whenever you tap that
wineglass and whenever this wine glass
vibrates back and forth at a certain
frequency
it's going to cause a certain sound to
come from it now that's going to be the
natural frequency of the wineglass and
it's going to be the same every time you
tap that wineglass that's why when you
tap it one time it's like E and you tap
it another time it's not like brah
Berndt brah you know whenever you tap a
wineglass the frequency is going to be
the same or the sound coming from it is
going to be the same every time now
we'll go ahead and make up a frequency
and we'll say that this has like 40
cycles per second which is way off by
the way but you know just to demonstrate
this example it'll be fine
so this wine glass is vibrating at 40
vibrations per second so why did I say
that well I needed to show you guys what
natural frequency is in order to
describe residence
now what resonance is is when you have
two objects and when one object
vibrating will say one glass a causes
another object to vibrate it its natural
frequency okay so does that mean that if
I had two identical wine glasses a and B
they
what I could do is I could tap a because
it's vibrate and that would cause
wineglass B to vibrate what the heck is
going on well actually that is exactly
what I mean and that's what resonance is
again one last time when one object
vibrating in this case wineglass a
causes another object to vibrate in this
case wineglass B at its natural
frequency now a cool experiment was done
by Mythbusters on unoffending you guys
watched Mythbusters but um well without
going too in-depth about Mythbusters
they took this wineglass and they wanted
to see if you could break it by just you
ever see the commercials where opera
singers like go in like they break
someone's glasses or the wineglass well
they want to test this basically so they
took a wineglass right like this looked
very similar to that let me draw a
little bit better well that's a little
bit worse and good enough so they took a
wineglass and they tapped it and they
heard the sound coming from it and they
found out that this was basically its
natural frequency so we'll say that 40
cycles per second close enough so what
they did then is they got another sound
source such as a speaker let's see how
good I can draw a speaker not that bad
and they played a sound coming from the
speaker at the exact frequency that this
wineglasses natural frequency occurred
so when this sound from the speaker was
intense enough what it did is it caused
the wineglass to vibrate so intensely
until it finally shattered thus proving
that resonance
excuse me I keep saying a resident's
resonance can cause a wineglass to break
that was basically the myth now a couple
things that people may get confused
about is this first of all notice that
every sound for example if you played
your favorite band Counting Crows Red
Hot Chili Peppers every sound coming
from the speaker right here is going to
cause the glass to vibrate a little bit
why is that that's just because there
are particles in the air
and whenever you cause a sound it pushes
against those particles and it will
cause the wineglass to vibrate however
that doesn't mean that resonance is
happening resonance is only when you
have a sound with a certain frequency
like um we'll just give it a variable I
don't know we'll give the frequency a
variable Y and it causes the wineglass
to vibrate at that certain frequency Y
so only when you have the source
vibrating at a certain frequency and it
causes an other object to vibrate at the
same frequency
aka its natural frequency does resonance
occur not just whenever you have a sound
and it's making something else move like
yelling into your computer desk or
something like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
