Python tutorial and in this tutorial I'm
gonna be teaching you guys about methods
how exciting so a method is pretty much
something you do to an object in
computer language so it's pretty much an
action that you do to like a specific
object and say you want to punch someone
in the face and this is just best
example I got you'd put what you wanted
to do it to so the first thing you have
to write when dealing with objects and
method is what you want to do the action
to so I want to do to your face and then
you write a period and then or write
what do you want to do I want to punch
it and then of course you have your
arguments so those are your basics for
your methods again this first one is
called the object what you want to do
will object you want to perform an
action on and the action is called a
method what you want to do to it so
let's go ahead and get rid of this
because I don't really want to punch
your face and let's go ahead and make a
simple list so I can show you guys how
to use methods might as well name it
face appropriately and let's go ahead
and set it to any numbers you want I'll
put 21 of 1830 it can be the ages of
someone maybe make sure that's a common
not period then go ahead and create it
make sure we have a great next let me
show you guys how to use methods now a
method is pretty much a built-in
function so you got to know what each
one of them do just by the name of them
the first one I'm going to talk to you
guys about is something called append
and what Upen means is add on to the end
of so say we want to add an element onto
the end of face again first you type the
object which is face because face is a
list and now see it already knows face
dot append and what this means is all
right what do we want to do to face we
want to append and
men on it and this means add an element
on to the end of it and then the argue
argument for this one is all right what
elements you want to add on 45 so go
ahead and press ENTER and bam as you can
see our now our list of three elements
now change the four because we pendant
an element on to it and again that's
pretty much just the basics of objects
and methods again you have a method
which is action and all you got to do is
say what object you want to apply to
sounds a little too easy so let's go
ahead and make a new list I'm going to
name this apples because I feel like
talking about apples right now and let's
uh have something like I bear with me
here it's going to take a little bit of
time I love apples apples now something
like that and make sure these are like
this right here and this is just for an
example I'm about to show you guys and
BAM create it roasted toasted let's make
sure we got it now this next thing I
want to show you guys is the count
method and what the count method does is
it takes an object and counts how many
times your argument is in that object so
again get your object and mines a list
called apples press count and remember
counts bill and function now what do we
want to count we can count any of these
things how many times I love apples
occurs so let's count how many times the
word Apple or actually apples occurs
apples press ENTER two and I'll show you
why because it took the list apples I
probably only use the same word and list
but bear with me here
it took this list and it set all right
I'm going to search for the word apples
nope nope one two nope so you have two
occurrences of the word apples let me
show you guys what happens if you have
no results so say you
I love apples apples now there is no
word um bow in there where do I come up
with the stuff so press ENTER and it's
going to search all this and if it can't
find a result it's going to return zero
so that's how you use the count function
and the last function I want to talk to
you guys is something called extend now
extend is a lot like a pend but you
can't use a pen with multiple values you
have to use extend when you have
multiple values so let's go ahead and
make two little lists one two three
pretty creative
and for our second list let's have any
one I'm going to guess it four five six
that's what I'm talking about and that
don't mind this I just hit the keyboard
and say we wanted to extend or pretty
much add the two lists together the
first thing we need to do was what
object we're working with we're working
with one and what do we want to do we
want to extend onto the end of it and
remember extends built-in function or
method and what do we want to extend on
the end of it too so let's go ahead and
press ENTER and now once we look at one
we now have a new new-and-improved
sequence so that is how you use it
extend pretty much how this works
you have your main lists right here and
you have the listing one add on to it
right there and again object method
argument so that is how you use basic
methods in just a recap one more time
you have an object name what you want to
do the method two then you have the name
of the method and then you have any
arguments so that is your a basic method
