put the chain on your go-kart but before
I actually zoom in and show you guys
where it goes I want to tell you guys
this whenever you have a chain from your
go-kart and again if you guys don't
remember where this goes you know that
gear on the engine that spins whenever
your engine is running and there's also
a gear on your rear axle to spin the
wheels this is the chain that connects
those two gears so therefore whenever
your engines working then your tires are
spinning the views just don't connect
like a clock gear on here so now before
I talk to you guys about this chain I
want to point out this you remember when
you're a little kid in riding your
bicycle around town and sometimes you
know you hit a jump in your chain came
off well then what you do is you just
grab your chain put it back on your
gears on your bicycle ride it and it
would pop right back on the gears for
automotive chains are I mean excuse me
the chains for like cars or go-karts or
motorcycles are really different they
don't have pretty much any play in them
at all they're tight and designed
specifically to fit perfectly on your
gears so when this thing pops off or if
you need to replace it you can't just
you know put it back on by hand what you
need to do is you actually need to
unlink it so how do you unlink this
chain well the first thing you need to
do is take a close look at the chain at
all the separate links now if you do
you're going to notice that one link is
quite a bit different than the others
can you guys see it's this one right
here so the reason this link looks
different is because this is the one
link in this chain that is post to
unlink so at first what you have to do
is you have to remove this top clip now
on one side of the clips I don't know if
you guys can see it but there's an
opening so wherever that opening is it
kind of looks like a mouth push it away
from the opening so it's going to own it
now this is always kind of a pain to do
so let me see if I can get it alright
there we go alright so now the clip is
removed from the links now all you have
to do is slide it in and pops right off
if you guys can see there's the clip now
aside from
click there's also one more bracket
holding the chains together and this is
just for strength because you guys
probably can't tell but this little clip
isn't very strong so once you have those
two pieces on done your chains going to
be able to unlink and be removed so now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to go
ahead and put this around the gears put
it back together and just remember in
this order the big bracket for strength
and then your Clips going to go on like
this and then it's going to push into
place and I probably can't push it with
my thumb come on baby
right like that so let's go ahead and
get to it so now go ahead and locate
your two gears this one right here is
for the rear axle let me go ahead and
spin my tires so you can see see that a
little gear with all the teeth spinning
that's the gear that makes the wheel
spin and this one right here is for the
engine whenever this engine fires up
this thing is going to start spinning so
obviously as you can tell if we just
started it right now the engine gear
would start spinning but nothing would
happen with the tires so in order to fix
that go ahead and grab your chain and go
ahead and put it on the rear axle first
spin it make sure it's on all the teeth
alright guys so sorry you didn't see
that but uh my hands were in the way I
could hardly see so there's no way I was
going to get a good camera angle but now
as you can see let me go ahead and spin
the rear axle whenever we do that the
engine and the tires or where the tires
are going to be whenever we install our
now link so then if we went ahead and
fired up this engine our wheels would
now spin and by the way if you're having
trouble getting your chain on because
it's just too tight what you can do is
actually unbolt the engine
lift a little bit and it may give you a
little bit of slack as you can see right
there maybe a little bit easier to do
your chain on families now that your
chain is on congratulations you're now
ready to start installing the shifter
