toriel that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to use each tree view
control so argument for this tutorial is
a button and a tree view so just go over
your toolbox and drag a tree view over
to your forum I'm gonna make it really
big here you'll see why alright so this
is a tree view like as you can see it is
like an item and then this item has sub
items and that divides into sub item I'm
sure you've seen these before I just
wanted to make sure that you know what
it is before we get into it so the first
thing that we're going to look into is
adding notes that's what they're
actually called these little those
things aren't there that the node so in
order to add one of those we're first
going to double click on button one so
we're going to type the name of our tree
view I call - tree V one that's just the
default name for it dot and then you
want to do dot nodes the nodes property
and they're gonna want to use the add
method to add a node and this will just
add it into the root of the tree node so
or the tree view so it would be like at
the top right here there would be no
like sub items for it so we're going to
give a name to it I'm just going to call
it person or people actually people so
now let me be bugged here click pot in 1
we should see that a node will appear at
the top yep and currently there are no
sub items for this node there's only
this this node right here so if we
wanted to add more than one node in the
root of our tree view you just copy this
code again and just name it something
different I'm going to call it and month
ago
so now many debug here and click this
button you should now have two tree
nodes there two nodes in the root of our
tree view yep now people and animals now
I'm going to show you how to add like
sub items for this so under people we
want to have people's names like Adam
Bob and go do that so we're going to put
three v1 again nodes use the notes
property only this time we're going to
treat it like an array and this array
will basically be the two nodes who you
have so currently we'll have people and
animals and we're going to try and
access the people one so we're going to
put zero right here since the first node
is zero the second to the one and so on
just looking all right so put zero in
here and then this is just like another
node so we can do dot nodes dot add and
then we can just add another node inside
of this people node right here so I'll
just add Adam so now let me get bug
right here and click this button you
should have people and animals and
underneath people we should have a node
called Adam yep and if you wanted to add
more you just repeat the same process
almost copy this code right here now we
can change the text to this so it's
going to have Bob and Joe so now
underneath people will have Adam Bob and
Joe and again this zero right here this
represents the node that you're adding
them to so we want to add it to people
so it's zero since at the top now if you
wanted to add on notes to Adam you put a
one inside of here so add another one we
will add a one because it's going to be
animals you got nodes the add message to
add another one and we'll just add just
a dog we'll add another one
so now under animals we have dog and cat
and under people we have atom Bob and
Joe this is basically just an endless
cycle so if we wanted to add on let's
say another note inside of cat or dog
like say we wanted to have list names
inside of this dog mode right here you
could do that so we would do 3 u 1 dot
nodes men sensor accessing the node
under animals 1 here then you do nodes
again and then we want to access dog
so put a 0 right here since dog is the
first one under animals I'm going to do
about nodes add and then just add a dog
name under their spot so now I'm going
to bug add them all under animals we
should have dog and cat and their dog
you should have spot yep so that's
pretty much it for this tutorial on
adding nodes to its review so see you
