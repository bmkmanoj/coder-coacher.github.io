going to come right out and say it I
need your guy's help I have a computer
problem that I cannot figure out worth
my life I tried googling it for like
three days not literally but I try to
figure this out I cannot figure this out
so i asked you guys for help i mean i
hope you guys enough i made like over
400 like 450 free tutorials for you guys
and all i asked for you is to answer
this one question and i'll show you what
my problem is usually I whenever I'm
editing a video I put it in the after
effects so I can stretch it to a 16 by 9
ratio because if you put your videos at
a 16 by 9 ratio then they fit in
YouTube's widescreen player right here
as you can see right here so what I do
is I stretch it to 640 pixels by 360 and
then I go ahead and I usually output it
to AVI and I can press it with divx now
this is all fine and good and for a
little bit my videos were coming out
perfect they were compressed good and
640 x 360 so whenever I did that with
the AVI file and that's the windows I
got this right here as you can see so
this is a movie or avi file that's 640 x
360 and when I uploaded it to YouTube it
just is you thought it was going to do
so if you're saying all right what's the
problem now well when I try to do that
exact same thing but instead of video
for windows like avi I go to when I go
to a QuickTime movie it's the same size
and then I go to format options and I
choose mpeg-4 video which is just the
compression actually this compressor
doesn't even matter no matter how i can
press this quicktime movie forgot forget
I even said that about the compressor
because it doesn't matter i already
tested it anytime i export a quicktime
movie and press ok
i render it it comes out fine 640 x 360
cervix and all right so it's fine right
here the size is the same but look what
happens when i upload it to youtube
right here when i upload it to youtube I
get these black bars to the top in the
bottom of it so here is my problem every
time i render a movie using after
effects all my avi movie and my
quicktime movie is the same or so i
think but whenever I try to upload with
the YouTube my avi fits into widescreen
perfectly my QuickTime movie has little
black bars at the top so that's why I'm
asking you guys I cannot for the life of
me figure out why has these black bars
on the top and bottom of this and if
we're saying all right why don't you
just export the avi just keep using that
well I need the compressor that goes
with quicktime so that's why i need to
figure out this problem so if anyone at
all knows why when i upload a 640 x 360
movie to youtube it has black lines on
the top and bottom and remember the same
size movie it doesn't do with avi it
only does it with quicktime movie files
so if anyone can answer my question i
will i don't i like pay 20 bucks or
something so if you have any reason why
these black bars are the top or bottom
and how i can get rid of them i'll send
you like 20 bucks on paypal and if you
don't have paypal i'll give you a all
write you a check or something but
please answer this question for me and
you will be my hero for life so thank
you guys this is the one thing I've ever
asked you so thank you and hopefully
hear from you soon leave me a comment
with your answer please thanks see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
