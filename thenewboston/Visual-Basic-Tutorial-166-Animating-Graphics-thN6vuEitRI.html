slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're gonna be
animating some graphics so we'll come
back into our form one designer and
let's just go ahead and change some
properties of this button so we'll set
the text to animate rectangle okay so
now let's go ahead and come back into
our code and we're going to create two
variables so or two variables private
exposition as integer then private Y
position as integer okay so whenever
they click on form one is going to
create a new rectangle so what we want
to do is set X position equal to e dot X
and they'll set Y position equal to e
dot Y so now I have our x position and
our Y position so go ahead and minimize
that so now I need to do is we need to
come into our form one designer again
we'll come over here through our toolbox
and we'll create a new timer so we'll
just call it timer animate and we'll set
the interval to let's say 100
milliseconds is good so we'll come back
into form one DB or
first we need to double click on timer
animate so we can access the tick of it
so you can see that when they click on
form one it's going to refresh it let's
just go ahead and take me dot refresh
and put it inside draw a new rectangle
so it'll refresh and then draw the new
rectangle so whenever the timer ticks
what we want to do is we'll set X
position - equals or let's go ahead and
add + equals let's do three and then
we'll just draw new rectangle and for
the new rectangle we're going to use X
position and Y position
and you can see I spelled some of this
stuff wrong so we'll come up here it
will fix that
okay so whenever it ticks it's going to
add three three more three to the
integer exposition it's going to draw a
new rectangle with x position and the Y
position so whatever they click button
draw what we want to do is start the
timer so timer animate dot start so it's
going to start the timer and we'll go
ahead and run this so we can just go
ahead and click somewhere on the screen
so you can see that we got our square
and when we click animate rectangle you
can see the bit the rectangle starts
sliding across the screen but once it
gets to the edge of the screen it goes
away and it never comes back so what we
can do to fix this is we'll type if
exposition is greater than me dot size
so we're accessing the size property and
size contains what's called width it's
the horizontal length of the form so if
it's greater than the width of the form
what do we want to do we want to set x
position equal to zero so it will send
it back to the beginning of the form and
now I need to do an else if so else if x
position is less than zero then what do
we want to do we want to set x position
equal to me dot size dot width now we're
not going to be using this el-sayf right
here it's not going to be used anywhere
in here but we may use it later on so if
the square goes too far to the right
it's going to set it back to the front
and then if the square goes too far to
the left it's going to set it back to
the right so depending on which way
we're going it'll still work and let's
go ahead and we'll make the animation a
little bit faster so for timer animate
we'll come over here into form one we
will select the interval and we'll set
it to let's say 20 milliseconds so let's
go ahead and run this
and we will draw a square then we can
click animate rectangle and you can see
that the rectangle will go all the way
and then once it passes the edge of the
screen it pops back up at the beginning
of the form and you can see that we can
keep putting the rectangle in different
places on our form and it's going to
continue to animate any time we do it
creates a new rectangle because it
refreshes the screen and takes away any
previous rectangles so what we can also
do is we can make this animation go
backwards and that's what we can use
this elsif right here for it so at the
position is less than zero this is going
to send it back to the right so we'll go
ahead and click that and create a
rectangle and we can click animate and
you can see that it'll go backwards and
once it hits right here it's going to
send it back to the edge the other edge
of the form and when every time we click
it creates a new rectangle and starts
animating it from that position
so go ahead put this code in if you have
it you can change it around if you want
make it animate in different ways and
then once you've done that go ahead and
move on to the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
