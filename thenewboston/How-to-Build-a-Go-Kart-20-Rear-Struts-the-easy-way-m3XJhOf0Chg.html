rear struts or shock absorbers now the
first glance you may be like ok this is
going to be easy I already installed the
ones on the front so the back ones will
be a piece of cake but actually the back
ones are quite a bit different
thankfully I'm going to show you guys a
really easy kind of a cheating way to
make this process a whole lot easier so
go ahead and start sewing this exactly
as you think you would go ahead and
start with the bottom take your nut and
bolt feed it through the bottom half of
this that's nice let's see if we can get
it there we go now of course can tighten
this describe your tumour inches and
it's pretty obvious what to do from here
now that your strut is securely bolted
to the bracket on the frame all we have
to do now is go ahead and bolt in the
top part and we'll be good to go alright
now as you can see the bottom of the
strut went on perfectly is looking good
now let's go ahead and take care of the
top in okay it looks like we have a
little situation here the top of the
strut is way off position to fit in the
bracket now whenever this happens we
have a couple options what we can do is
first we can get a strut compressor tool
which is basically a tool that
compresses this and then we can push
this piston down and it makes your strut
smaller then hopefully we get it small
enough where it could fit inside this
bracket these two holes can connect but
I have a little bit better idea
thankfully this go-kart frame was built
where the roll bar and one hinge is
supporting the back connected to the
front now obviously as you can see this
go-kart does not have a roll bar on it
which means that the only thing
connecting the back to the front is this
hinge right here if you can see over
here and on that side too there is a
hinge system
so therefore I believe that if we jack
up right here then what it's going to do
is it's going to allow this back-end to
pivot and drop down therefore making
sure that the strut lines up perfectly
with a bracket so again the mechanics
can keep their fancy tools but what I'm
going to do is just jack up the middle
until the top of the strut fits in the
bracket and if you guys don't know what
I'm talking about then I'm about to show
you so once again as you can see there's
no possible way that this strut is going
to fit into this bracket even if you
were the strongest person alive so what
I did is I position the jack right in
the middle of the go-kart where pivots
and we're going to start jacking up now
go ahead and pay attention to the strut
and bracket placement as I begin to Jack
it up as you can see it's closer and
closer and closer now what you want to
do is you actually want to keep an eye
on this because you don't want to go too
far and the reason for that is if you go
too far then not only is it too far
above but this entire back end is going
to be too far down you're going to have
to pull it back up so go ahead and go
slowly once you get to this point if you
just go ahead and look I know you guys
don't got a good angle on the video but
if you go ahead and move that position
right there it looks pretty darn good so
now what you need to do is go ahead take
your bolt put it through oh yeah look at
that you didn't even need a freaking
hammer
way to go Bucky way to use your head now
bolt this on tighten it up and you'll be
good to go
alright guys look at that isn't that
beautiful the rear strut is on perfectly
and we never even had to touch a strut
coil tool just a little bit of creative
thinking thinking outside the box and
we're good to go so now what you need to
do is go ahead and do the exact same
thing to the opposite side and then
you're going to want to lower your jack
and once you lower your jack
your back end is now supported by the
struts so how awesome is that pretty
freakin sweet so in the next lesson I
can't remember what we have to do but we
have to hook up the fuel system soon
enough so I'm just going to admire this
for a few more seconds and while I do so
and say thank you guys for watching I'm
gonna get subscribed and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
