slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to
taking another look at enumerations now
sorry I've been jumping around a bit in
these last couple tutorials but I'm just
trying to hit the most important points
and sometimes I feel you need to learn
maybe something about enumerations after
you learn about properties and when we
make those demo applications so I'm all
out of side what we're going to do is
we're going to be passing an enumeration
to a sub or a function so let's go ahead
and create a new project we will select
a windows forms application and we will
call it passing in nums
okay so we'll wait for that to load and
we will go ahead and shrink this down a
bit and we will select the toolbox we
will add a combo box right here on let's
see right there and we will add a button
so here's our combo box and we'll add a
button okay so now I'll shrink this down
some close out of the toolbox and we
will make the button a little bit bigger
so we will set the name of combo box one
to combo Sports and we'll go ahead and
set the button name to button analyze
and we'll set the text to analyse sport
so in our combo box we're going to go
ahead and come over here to the
collections property
so here's items and we need our we need
to add sets in the collection so we'll
just add baseball basketball and
football and we'll go ahead and click OK
so now we will go ahead and create an
event handler for analyze sport and
we'll just let that sit there for now
and let's go ahead and zoom in and
create an enumeration so
private enum sports and now all we're
gonna do is set the data type for that
so privately num sports as let's just do
integer okay so now what we're going to
do is we're going to set baseball equals
one basketball equals two and football
equals three so now we're just going to
create an object to this enumeration now
object probably isn't the best word for
that let's create a variable a datatype
of this enumeration so we'll just type
private my sport as sports and now what
we're going to do is we're going to come
over here and create a vid so you can
see that the default event handler is
the selected index change and now you
can come over here to the lightning bolt
and change it and you can select which
one you want but we're just going to use
selected index change so now what we're
going to do is we're going to type my
sport equals combo sports dot and now
let's go back here and we can look at
our collection for combo sports we've
got baseball basketball and football so
let's go ahead and click cancel there
and you can see that we have the same
value set in here now let's start from
counting from zero because it's always
good count from zero in programs because
that's how computers work they start
counting from zero so my sport equals
combo sports dot selected index now the
selected index for combo sport starts at
zero which is going to be baseball the
then the next one up would be one and
the next one after that would be two now
if no no item in the combo box is
selected it's going to be equal to
negative one so what we can do to handle
any errors that might happen we'll just
type if combo sports dot selected index
does not equal negative one then go
ahead and do this so just cut that out
right there and paste it in okay so now
that we've got which sport they
collected what we want to do is we want
to analyze the sport when they click
analyze the sport so we'll just create a
sub that will do that for us so we'll go
ahead and come down here below combo
sports and we will type private sub
analyze sport and we will just go ahead
and by Val sports list as sports
so basically we're passing a an object
of the sports data type which is an
enumeration so now we're just going to
use a select case statement so select
case and we're just going to go through
sport sports list so we will type case
so case is and now what we can do is we
can check to see if it's any one of the
values in our sports enumeration so the
way we would do this is sports dot
baseball let's try this again sport dot
baseball and we need to add N equals
right here that's what I was missing
okay so case is sport equals sports dot
baseball so if the sports list that they
pass to it is equal to baseball then
we'll go ahead and type message box dots
show your sport is baseball and now I'll
do case is equal to sports dot put ball
we don't want sports list we want sports
so if it's equal to sports star football
we will just type message box dot show
your sport is football and we'll do that
one more time so case is equal to sports
Sports dot basketball and now we'll just
use the shorthand for message box so
I'll just type message box your sport is
basketball and then we will do a case
else so then we'll just type message box
you don't have a sport okay so now if we
go ahead and run this we've got our
combo box right here nothing is selected
so if we click analyze support analyse
sport nothing's going to happen because
we forgot something really important
when they click a button analyze we're
going to call analyze sport and then my
sport okay so now let's go and run this
and you can see if there's nothing
selected it'll say looks like we got a
problem there alright let's go ahead and
select baseball so say your sport is
baseball just like basketball your sport
is basketball football your sport is
football
so you can go ahead and try passing
enumerations to subs and functions if
you want and you can even I'll scroll up
here so you can pause and look at this
code if you miss some of it put that in
change some of the code do whatever you
want and then move on to the next
tutorial and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
