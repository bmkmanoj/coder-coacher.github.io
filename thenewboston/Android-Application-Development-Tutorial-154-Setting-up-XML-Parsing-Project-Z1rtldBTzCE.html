Android tutorial for the new boss in and
I just again wanted to apologize for you
know being so boring and just being like
the jsonparser you do this and that it
feels like you know my great-great-great
great-grandfather rose from the dead who
happened to be a geologist and he's
trying to talk to me about rocks or
something so I can feel you guys his
pain so just for you you know I had a
few drinks and now we're going to get
into some XML parsing I also built the
application that we're going to develop
so you can see it beforehand as well as
kind of go a little bit slower so you
guys have a better knowledge of what
we're actually doing hopefully I don't
know if you know I have been going too
fast or not we're explaining enough so
I'm gonna try and explain this
thoroughly so you guys completely
understand so as you can see your
application has a city and state you can
also just put the city and hit enter and
it says in Lincoln Nebraska the current
temperature in Fahrenheit is 77 you can
also you know just say whoa whoa like
Texas let's go just Texas the state of
Texas is 86 degrees more specifically
Houston is 82 degrees and well what this
application is actually doing is we're
using XML parsing from the Google
weather API so it's kind of like JSON
but it's XML parsing it's a little bit
different but hopefully you guys will
understand this a little bit more
thoroughly as well so that's what our
application looks like and just get
started
you guys probably guess you need to
build your layout so I just have a text
view an edit text and you know a state
and other text views which says state
and edit text a button and then just
another text view that has a reference
attached to it these two don't have the
reference we're going to change them or
anything we don't need a reference form
so just get that set up and then we're
going to go over here
into our class which we call whether XML
parsing extends activity and implements
onclicklistener
again we have a string reference well
we'll get to that a second I'll actually
delete that we have a text view which is
going to change for weather and all that
stuff and we have a to edit text for the
city and the state edit text
have those all set up and set our
content view to the weather XML as well
as set a button to an onclicklistener
which we implement for the class and
here's our onclicklistener nothing too
new hopefully you guys can set that up
but I know you guys probably need some
time so just go ahead and do that right
meow doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
well welcome back as hopefully you miss
me as much as I miss you and we're going
to jump right into it we also need to
create two other classes called handling
XML stuff and XML data collected so go
ahead and set those classes up as well
right now they aren't really you know
doing anything so yeah just get those
set up and and we're going to get
started those are all the classes we're
going to need you guys probably just
want to keep those tabs out open you can
close your you know your XM XML layout
tab after you're done developing that
but keep those open for the next few
tutorials as we work through and how
this application is going to retrieve
its data is from the google weather API
and here's the website for the XML file
that we're pulling our data from as you
can see there's a lot more information
besides just the city and the ferret the
temperature in Fahrenheit but I thought
I'd cover enough of you know the
information that you guys would need to
understand the concepts this is
basically what I'm pulling is the city
which says Lincoln Nebraska and the
condition of Fahrenheit which is right
here 77 degrees as of right now could
also
pull the condition say yeah it's clear
outside there's a humidity of 90 percent
which is just crazy and you know there's
all this other stuff we can pull as well
like the projections for Tuesday
Wednesday Thursday Friday if we chose
but you know for our purposes we aren't
going to really refer care about those
you guys can add to your application for
homework but again the most important
thing is our URL which is wwq --gel comm
port /ig /a p i question mark whether
equals and then the city comma state so
that's a basic introduction to what
we're going to be doing and just kind of
seeing everything before we actually
develop because I think that might be a
little bit more beneficial for you guys
and again we're just going to work with
a string bridge in the next tutorial
even though we've used it before I
haven't really made it toriel on it so
we might as well do that since we're
breaking everything down and in
everything so I'll see you guys in that
tutorial have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
