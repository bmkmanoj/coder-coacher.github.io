Android tutorial for the new boss in and
again what we're gonna do is get our
actual key for a map instead of the
debug key and since we exported our
project and signed it now we can get our
actual key so what I want you guys to do
again and go to this website
code.google.com forward slash android 4
- add - ons forward slash Google
- API is for slash map key HTML and
that's gonna bring us to this site again
we're just gonna scroll down to
basically this line of code that we're
gonna follow again you guys want to open
up your command prompt and/or you do
that by going to start on Windows and
then CMD or on Mac applications
utilities and then terminal and this is
where we're gonna get our again our
fingerprint for the most part so let's
go back into our finder or you know
whatever let me pull this over can you
go into finder documents Android apps
and then what we're gonna do is right
click on our maps key store and go to
like get information I forgot what it's
called them windows I mean just had Mac
for like a month and I pretty much
forgot windows entirely but there we go
basically you're gonna get the location
we're gonna copy this this path and
refer to it in our terminal or in our
command prompt so let's get started
all we have to do is type key store or
key tool I'm sorry - list space - alias
and again our alias was named map alias
so this is where it's a little bit
different than last time because again
we have to refer to the name of the
alias that we saved within our key store
and then we're gonna say space - key
store
and in space and in our path so I'm
gonna hit ctrl v /e our key store name
which we called Maps key store so Maps
key store and then we have to hit space
- store pass and our password was Travis
or whatever year guys's password was and
then our key pass was also Travis then
when we hit enter we should get our
fingerprint here which again is pretty
much the same as last time we just copy
that and we're gonna go down to register
a certificate fingerprint and we're
gonna hit I've read and control paste
and then all we do is hit generate API
key
I probably I'm gonna blur out all this
stuff because I'm not for sure if I'm
supposed to show you guys but hopefully
you get the gist and then here is our
new key that we are gonna copy and paste
into our project so we're just going to
copy this and then I'm gonna pretend
like I paste it where you know our debug
key is but actually I'm going to paste
it and then run our application and make
sure it still works
all right so basically paste that ran
our application and hopefully it still
is gonna load our map if it doesn't you
guys need to probably you know redo the
terminal or the command prompt and make
sure that's right so hopefully it works
and yeah for the most part it's it's
good for some reason it's I think it
should be good I don't know it's loading
like that I think if I run on my phone
it will actually work but as long as you
get some sort of map it should work and
then we can sign this to the marketplace
and it will work so I will catch you
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
