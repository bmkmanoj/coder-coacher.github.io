to the tutorials that you have all been
requesting and I'm sure you guys have
all been waiting for we are finally
going to begin game development and we
are going to be programming our game in
Python so that's why I've been teaching
at WX Python and played on core
programming language before but we need
to learn one more thing in order to
build games and that's why I'm going to
be teaching it in this tutorial so go
ahead into your internet and go to
google and go ahead and type in P Y G
this is the Python module that lets you
develop games so go ahead and press
enter and click on this first link it's
called PI game org and again arm this is
what's going to allow us to develop
games and that's what we're teaching you
how to do in this series of tutorials
develop awesome games first in 2d but
eventually in 3d so anyways go to
downloads right here and once you click
this you're going to see a bunch of
downloads probably under windows unless
you're using something else you probably
want to download this latest one right
here it's called PI 2.6 so go ahead and
click that and it's going to give you a
MSI and this is pretty much like
executable just once you have this
downloaded um just click that MSI and
it's going to run like a wizard and it's
going to say next next next and then
it's going to say finish and you're good
to go
so if you ever installed anything before
then that's going to be a piece of cake
you it's not complicated at all so once
you have that downloaded go ahead and
open up your Idol right here and let's
see when mine opens go ahead and this is
just a test to see if you download it or
right go to import PI game and then go
ahead and press enter and what this is
going to do is import PI game for you
but that's going to be blank no matter
what unless you get an error so here's
what you need to do to see if it works
go ahead and print spell it right print
PI game
dot V ER and go ahead and press ENTER
and if you get installed right then it
downloads that version of Pi game that
you just downloaded if nothing pops up
or you get an error that means you
didn't download it right but if you get
anything at all like 1.81 release then
you are good to go for your next
tutorials where we will be developing a
simple probably not a game but the
basics to a game so again one last time
go to your internet Google PI game on
the first link click download and go
ahead and click this PI game 1.81
for Windows 2.6 MSI and once you
download that you are good to go so
thank you guys for watching this
tutorial hopefully you installed Pi game
correctly if you did you're ready to
move on to the next tutorial if not just
send me a message and I'll help you out
so again thank you guys for watching
can't wait to start developing these
games so don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
