welcome to your 31st Python tutorial and
in the last order I showed you guys how
to create a tuple or dictionary using
parameters but you can also do something
else that's kind of neat and you can
gather information from tuples and
dictionaries and use that information as
your parameters so instead of creating
tuples and dictionaries you can use
preexisted excuse me you can use
pre-existing ones as your parameters as
well so let's go ahead and let me just
show you guys what this means because uh
it's the easiest way just go ahead and
create an example so to find them the
example function that's going to take
three parameters a B and C and we want
this let's just have return a plus B
times C or something like that
no not a c c a plus b times c good
enough all right now once that's created
what do we want to do so that takes
three parameters and returns some math
function doesn't really matter what the
math functions then say instead of
creating a couple you already have a
tuple named tuna and let's throw some
numbers in there five seven and three
and go ahead and press ENTER to create
that now what you can do is you can
throw this tuple inside this as the
parameters so let's go ahead and write
example and you just don't write tuna
here any time you use a tuple you have
to write that a little star before
and remember star means you're working
with the tupple two stars means you're
working the dictionary since this is a
tuple this will do just fine
so go ahead and press ENTER and it takes
the numbers from tuna 5 plus 7 times 3
and that equals 26 so that is how you
can use a tuple and throw in your
parameters for a function so next I'm
going to show you guys how to do this
with a dictionary and this is a little
different but it's kind of the same so
pay attention first we want to define
something we can use with the dictionary
and it's not going to be a math function
so let's go ahead and name this example
2/2 so we don't get anyone refused and
let's go ahead and have it take one
parameter called this and I forgot a
semicolon so let's go ahead and define
example two and let's not forget our
semicolon next time this and excuse me :
and let's go ahead and just print it out
so print this so once we have that
function created example two we need a
dictionary because that's what I'm going
to teach you guys so let's go ahead and
make a dictionary called bacon you can
name yours or whatever you want and let
me populate this mom 32 and dad of 54
let's go and now we have a function that
takes one parameter a dictionary
parameter and we also have a dictionary
right here so if you're going to guess
what I'm going to do next then well just
pay attention anyways so we have example
two what takes one dictionary parameter
we also have a dictionary called bacon
and remember when you're using a
dictionary use two asterisks so let's go
ahead and throw bacon this dictionary
into this function example and see what
happens
it runs through the function which is
print this and prints the dictionary
which is bacon so um this is kind of a
simple example but I just wanted to show
you guys that you can actually use
tuples and dictionaries not only when
you create a function but you can also
use them as the parameters inside a
function and that's useful when you're
gathering data from an outside source
and you want to do something to it like
a alter in a certain way and also print
it out to your users so that is how you
do that gather information from tuples
and dictionaries so I hope you guys
learning how to do that so thank you
guys for watching this tutorial I hope
you enjoyed it I don't forget to
subscribe to my channel and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
