slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're gonna be
talking about the finally statement now
what the finally statement does is this
place inside of a try block and it's run
no matter what so let's say we have this
try right here and we go through this
for loop and just gonna add each one of
those items to our ArrayList and then
it's gonna try to access an index that's
out of range so what we're gonna do when
that happens its type message box not
show don't access memory that isn't
there and then we can add a finally now
if you read the description it says
introduces a statement block to be run
before exiting a try structure so this
is run before the try is ended and it's
run no matter what so it was type
message box show I am the finally and
then we'll go ahead and just beep now
this is the sound that is played when an
error occurs and this is just to show
you how what you can do in the finally
with the finally keyword so let's go
ahead and run this you can see if we
click add all we get don't access memory
that isn't there and then if we click OK
just listen and you'll hear the beep so
it says I am the finally and there's our
beep right there now we can also use
finally with multiple catch statements
so let's go ahead and catch e X as no
reference exception and then we'll just
message box that show that is no
so we'll go ahead and create one of
those exceptions here so we'll just
throw a new null reference exception so
let's go ahead and run this you can see
that if we click at all it's gonna throw
that throw this first even though these
catch statements are in different order
they do not go by order so since the
null reference exception is the first
one that is thrown it's gonna go
straight to this and do whatever is
inside here and then after that comes
our out of range exception it's gonna
catch that in this so let's switch back
to the program it says that as Noah will
click OK and it says I am the finally
and then if you listen closely
there's the beep that we added so go
ahead and practice with the finally
practice a lot with try-catch statements
because you're gonna be using using them
a lot inside of your programs they're
very helpful and I highly suggest you
look through a whole buck a whole bunch
of the different types of exceptions
that are built into Visual Basic and
read the description so you can know
when to use them and what exceptions to
use so you're not just using a default
exception each time now what you can do
is use catch and then catch an exception
and when it shows the method the message
it's gonna tell you what type of
exception that is so then you can go
back into your code and add a specific
type of exception instead of just a
default one so like I've said before go
ahead and practice this and then once
you have once you understand try catch
statements and finally go ahead and move
on to the next tutorial well we're where
we will be learning about the win
keyword so thanks for watching and stay
tuned for the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
