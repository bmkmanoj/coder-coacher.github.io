for hours and same math floor seconds /
and for hours it's just 60 times 60
because we don't need to go ahead and
use this 24 for every day if we now go
ahead and alert out hours you'll notice
that we've got 44 hours now obviously we
want to keep this it within the 24 hours
because if we were to say we've got
let's say it's just to let out days as
well if we were to say that up until the
10th of August 2011 we've got one day
and 44 hours it doesn't make sense
because you know there's more hours in a
day there's not there's not 44 hours in
a day or any more than this we need a
maximum of 24 hours in a day so what we
need to do is make a calculation under
days that will correct the amount of
seconds in order to display the hours
properly and for this we do seconds -
equals which is the same as seconds
equals seconds - so we can do that as
well but this is just shorter a notation
and then we want to say days times 60
times 60 times 24 so now what will
happen is the set this this value here
are calling two days will be subtracted
off of the seconds and then when we go
ahead and calculate the hours it will
stick within the well display the
correct value so we've got 1 hours and
20 so now that we've got 1 hours and 20
from the 10th of August at 12:00 let's
go ahead and change this to 13 and
refresh and you can see it's changed to
21 so we now know that this works
because we're echoing out or alerting
out the days and the hours so will not
allow out anything else we'll just go
ahead and correct each one so now we
need to do seconds - equals and then we
need to do the same but for hours so we
say hours times 60 times 6
and then we need to work out the sorry
not the seconds we've already have that
the minutes and the minutes is equal to
mass dot floor and seconds divided by 60
because we're just doing divided by 60
for the minutes and again we're using
seconds which has been updated here
after our hours as being calculated and
we need to go ahead and do this again so
let's go ahead and say seconds - equals
minutes times 60 so now what we've done
is we've retrieved the last value of
seconds which we can use let's go ahead
and just alert all these out again I did
say we weren't going to but let's say
days and the space and we'll say hours
and a space and then we'll say minutes
and the space and then we'll say seconds
so let's go ahead and refresh you can
see that we've got one day 21 hours 11
minutes and 15 seconds until this date
let's refresh you can see this has
changed - well the one hour the one day
the 21 hours 11 minutes to change but
this is now 7 seconds and you can see
that that's just gone to 10 minutes and
now 59 seconds so we know that the
values are working so we can go ahead
and actually do something with these ie
place them into the span that we created
earlier for each corresponding day hours
minutes and seconds so because we've
used the selector here countdown inside
of our plugin we can use this dot
something we've already got this
selection up here so we want to just say
this underscore cell and we want to say
dot find the first thing we're finding
is the days class or any element with
the class days and we want to place the
text in there days so now what's
happened is it's placed one in there
because we have one day until this
particular time we've already echoed
them out so we we know what they look
like so what we do is we repeat this
process for each one so we want to go
ahead and find ours and we want
texts sorry not in their text hours
again this selection dot find dot
minutes or mins as we called it text
minutes and then this selection dot find
and we want to go ahead and find seconds
and change the text to seconds so now
when we refresh the values that we were
echoing out earlier have just been
placed into you know the place on our
page using find we found this day's
element hours minutes and seconds
element within this countdown div that
we supplied here so pretty
straightforward in terms of just sort of
traversing through elements on a page
however the only problem now is I have
to keep refreshing in order to keep this
value changing so we want to go ahead
and apply at an interval so just
underneath here I'm going to say
interval equals set interval interval
and in here I'm going to give the name
of the function which is count execute
and I'm not going to put the brackets
because that won't work and we want to
execute this every 1000 milliseconds so
now on the page this function here which
returns all of this data will be
executed every second and when we
refresh the page you can now see that
the time decreases and we've got this
just updating itself on the page so
quite simple however we've obviously got
a few things we need to take in take
into account I want to display leading
zeros before this and this here if we've
only got one particular character I
wanted to show like it would on you know
say like a digital clock or something
like that
so just up here we want to go ahead and
change this around and then we'll start
to create our callback function</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
