tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm gonna be
showing you how to you the internal
access modifier so when we first started
learning about access modifiers I told
you that there were a few that we
weren't going to be able to learn that
and the internal access modifier the
last access modifier that we have to
learn so the internal access modifier
basically makes it so that we can only
access something in the same project
that we created it in so if I were to
make a class right here in terminal and
I would only be able to access this
class inside of this my tol project so
if I were to create a new class even the
different name space I would still be
able to access this as a project so it's
a class I let's call it my class all
right now before we can access the class
we're going to tell the c-sharp compiler
that in the clients name space because
it's not in the same namespace as this
class right here so there's no say
client dot and then yep client shows
right up Oh see so as you can see we can
access this client class because it's in
the same project even though it's in a
different namespace alright but we won't
be able to access it inside of this
client project up here so when you just
save it in debug to save the changes
that we've made then go back to our form
right here and we won't be able to
access the client class I can't do
client yeah they won't let us
you can also apply the internal access
modifier to members and fields 12 and a
member is basically a property event an
indexer or a method so we could make
this property right here internal so
we'd say intern
strong name and now this name property
using terminal and let me just make this
class public all right so now we can
access this name property inside of this
method right here because it's in the
same project as this property so we can
do C dot name and yep we can access it
but we won't be able to access it inside
of our client project so let me just
save the debug here mmm
alright go back to our form we can now
access our client class because I made a
public again but we won't be able to
access that name property nope we came
instantly and you can also apply this to
field as well so if we wanted to make
like a variable internally could so
wanting like an internal integer alright
then we wouldn't be able to access it
outside this project so 5 so now since
this is in the same project as this
field right here we'll be able to access
it so I'm going to send out height yeah
that's fine but we won't be able to do
see that height in different project so
let me just save in debug alright go
back to our forms we can't do see that
height it doesn't show up alright and a
way to tell if something is internal is
in intellisense right there there should
be like a little envelope icon on the
far left side next to me in it and I'm a
property it shows up towards the right
but on I guess this field are here shows
up on the left so that's pretty much it
for this tutorial on the internal access
modifier so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
