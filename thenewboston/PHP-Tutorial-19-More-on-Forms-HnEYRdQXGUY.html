last tutorial this is your 19th tutorial
and in this tutorial we're going to be
finishing what we started the first time
and finishing our form so as you can see
less tutorial we made this basic form
and we told it RA once we give you the
information and submit it go to tester
page and perform our task but as you see
tester page is blank now and it has no
task so let's make something in tester
page right now let's just copy this and
paste it in tester page just because I
want that this is pretty much all I want
now just too lazy to type it all so now
and tester page we're going to want to
start making a script so let's start by
typing our PHP syntax in and remember
whenever we submit this it's going to
run this script on tester page why
because we told it in our action that's
where we wanted to run it so in our PHP
script let's just make a real simple
output our name we're going to want to
echo which means output on-screen the
variable name but to do this click pay
close attention cut it because it's a
lot different than the way we've done
before since we told
the form to use the method post we're
going to want to tell our script that
we're getting the information from our
form so here's how we do that
put your dollar sign and underscore and
type in the word post this tells PHP
that you're getting the information from
a form and not a normal variable if you
didn't do this then it's going to look
for the variable on this same page and
by making post it's going to look for
the variable on another page now it's
going to say all right we have post but
what exactly what a variable do you want
to get and we're going to say all right
we want to get the name variable so now
make your square brackets and in your
parentheses type in the word name and
end it with square brackets this says
all right PHP we want to echo something
from form and we want to echo whatever
they input it for name and of course
like any other and it with your
semicolon and save it
now as you can see go to your welcome
PHP page refresh
oh I'm a tester page that's why so let's
go to welcome
and as you can see we have a basic form
with a simple submit button now let's
type in a word for name let's type in
Danny now what this is going to do is
going to fill in the word Danny for your
input and variable name now whenever we
will submit it it's going to output the
word Danny why is that because you said
go to tester page and echo the variable
that you just go in for name and that's
how you use a basic post function when
doing forms and now our freshest in the
next tutorial and it'll be a lot clearer
but this is a simple way where you can
get a bunch of information from a
website and you can use it to either
output their name or write it to a
database all you have to remember the
basic thing under your action that's
where the scripts going to be we're
learning post for now and whatever you
name your input for example mine was
name that is what your variable is going
to be called so study this I hope you
enjoyed and watch my next tutorial and
now clear things up hopefully thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
