Android tutorial and what we're going to
do in this tutorial is again some boring
stuff like installing software the
software we're gonna install is a clip
so going to Google type in Eclipse or
download eclipse I'm gonna say eclipse
download and it should be the first link
from eclipse org /downloads we're going
to click on that and basically what
eclipse is is an IDE which will make
developing a lot easier for us it's
going to give us some error checking
some shortcuts just basically some
references so we won't have to remember
exactly every line of code that we're
going to use for the most part by memory
it's going to be a lot simpler for the
most part and that's how we're going to
integrate the SDK as well so here we go
there's a lot of choices for eclipse
that we can download what we want is the
Eclipse IDE for Java developers and over
here is your platform should choose it
automatically for you but just in case
you can click Windows or Mac OS we're
going to download the 32-bit even if you
have a 64-bit we're just going to work
with 32-bit for now so it doesn't you
know whatever so click that and here's
your download links down here you can
choose some other links that you may
want to download from that might go a
little bit quicker or you can just
select this this one that they're
featuring for the most part so just
click that and it's a standard download
as you can see right here I already have
it downloaded because it's almost 100
megabytes I'm actually going to install
it for you guys because this computer
doesn't have it set up for the most part
so there we go
we installed it I'm going to try and
find it make sure I install it in the
right place yeah under my downloads
right here what I'm going to do is now
move this whole folder into my hard
drive or for you windows users your main
hard drive which is like at your C Drive
so just move it into that folder and
then we're going to open it up by
opening the Eclipse folder and clicking
this icon which basically looks like a
croquet ball or
like I don't know a third graders
painting or something so open that up
and that's gonna start our Eclipse yeah
we know it's from the Internet we're
going to show it anyways or open it
anyways because uh you know we're
trusting like that and it's going to
start up Eclipse and here's the
workspace that we're going to create now
basically I'm using my buddy's computer
which is Jake but basically we're going
to set up a new workspace and we're also
gonna we're going to do this within our
documents for the most part what we're
going to call this workspace or we're
going to create it by right-clicking or
clicking this new folder here and saying
the new Boston now this is where we're
going to again create a workspace and
what a workspace is is the way to
organize all of our Java classes all our
resources that we want to use and all
that good stuff so we're going to call
that the new Boston hit open and now
that's where our our documents are now
we're just going to click OK and also
for you guys wondering the java jdk that
we installed last time most likely
eclipse will still work even if you guys
don't download that because it's going
to have some sort of java on your
computer but you guys want to get the
most recent ones so we could use it for
like Google Maps and signing our project
and getting it on to the marketplace
which we'll get into later but now we
have a clip set up we exited out of
sorry I kind of skipped over that but
there's a welcome screen as boring ugly
and from the 1980s or something so we
exited out of that welcome screen the X
was up here somewhere so just click that
and then you'll get this which is
basically the layout of Eclipse and what
we're going to do is set up the ADT
reference so what I want you guys to go
to or where I want you guys to go now is
in Google type in Android ADT hit enter
it'll be this first link from the
developer android.com
SDK Ford / Eclipse ADT click that and
here's the developer page
it should be on this page if not but you
guys are on the developer page you guys
can click right here where it says ADT
plugin for Eclipse and scroll down to
the point where it says installing the
ADT plug-in and downloading the 8080 T
plug-in so it gives us a link what we're
going to do is copy this link by ctrl C
or you know command C whatever you guys
are on Windows or Mac and then we're
going to copy that link and what we're
going to do now is open go back into
eclipse
and under this windows tab for for if if
you guys are on Windows it should be
under the windows tab and right down
here out there'll be a website no no no
I'm sorry I'm on both Windows and Mac
it's under the help tab and it says
Institute's install new software so
we're going to click that and we're
going to now paste that link right here
and hit add now we can add a name to
this so we're going to just add a name
so Android ADT and again you guys can
paste the link right here that's the
location link and hit OK and it's
basically going to get the developer
tools for us that we're going to need
for Android programming so that might
take a little bit we're just going to
click this hit next and our computer
will freeze and probably a crash no I'm
just kidding so there you go now we just
hit next again you guys should have four
things within there as well and we have
to accept this license agreement for all
these as well so just do that and read
through those again because it's super
entertaining great stuff within these
agreements just hilarious the comedy in
there it's man such a great read so if
you guys want to read that otherwise
just hit accept and finish and it's
going to install the software for us and
then I'll catch up with you guys in the
next tutorial where we'll you know do do
some more fun installing software so but
soon enough we'll get into the
programming and
actual great stuff that we want to do
but basically that's it for this
tutorial I'll see you guys later peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
