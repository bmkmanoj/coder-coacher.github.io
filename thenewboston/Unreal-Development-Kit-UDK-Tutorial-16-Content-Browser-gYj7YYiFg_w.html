16th you decayed soil and in this story
I'm gonna be going over something called
the content browser so what we need to
do next with our level is we need to add
some materials to this house because
unless you're a huge fan of chess or
checkers you probably don't want these
purple and gray boxes covering your
house you probably want to apply it with
some nice looking pretty material spice
things up a bit make it a little more
interesting looking so in order to do
that we need to apply materials to this
house and in order to access our library
of materials we need to go up here and
open something called the content
browser so go ahead and hit this low
black button and now your content
browser is gonna pop up now I'm gonna
take the rest of this tutorial just to
go over the basics of this content
browser I'm not going to be going over
every little radio button in checkbox in
all these different packages but what
I'm gonna be doing is I'm gonna be
giving you the $2 tour of the content
browser so basically what the content
browser is is it's basically a big
search engine for example whenever we
start making advanced games we're gonna
have a bunch of different textures and a
bunch of different models for example
we're gonna have models of trees and
guns and cars and we're gonna have a
bunch of sound effects like gunshots and
you know car engines and people
screaming and this is where everything
gets organized any asset that we make in
an external program such as like
Photoshop and 3d max or maybe some sound
program we can search for that in this
right here so basically let's start with
the left hand side on the left hand side
is where we can basically tell our
content browser where to look for the
stuff we're looking for for example
everything in the UDK gets stored in
packages so we can either look for those
specific packages right here or and by
the way a package is just like a folder
basically so as you expand these you can
see that everything is just stored in
folders and subfolders and yada yada
yada so basically if we want to look in
a specific package or folder we can
expand it
or what we can do is this is what we're
gonna be doing generally just go ahead
and hit all assets and that's gonna
allow us to look through all of the
folders or packages now these different
collections is your shared collections
is pretty much if you're working on a
project as a team you can share your
favorite collections pretty much this is
pretty much my favorites so this is your
shared favorites and if you want to have
your personal favorites you can make
your very own collection right here I'm
not going to be going over that because
we got other more important stuff to
cover so in order to minimize this if
you don't want look at that anymore you
can also hit this arrow and that'll hide
it from the view but for now I'll just
keep it open for you know the tutorials
sake now let's hop over to the
right-hand side and this is your tags
section now you can create new tags and
straw tags but basically a tag is just a
keyword so if you want to apply tags to
some of these materials like you want to
apply the building tag to any materials
that you can use on a building that's
what you would do so again just like
this packages section you can minimize
this if you don't want it or maximize it
now the top here actually I'll get to
the top later because that's the part we
use most often but the bottom here is if
I just go ahead and minimize this this
is how you can set up your content
browser in different views by default
it's in the thumbnail thumbnail view
excuse me but you can also switch it to
list view and to split views horizontal
or vertical
I like the thumbnail view the most
that's what I recommend using now right
here is your zoom if you want to zoom in
for example if you really want to scroll
when you're looking at textures or
something here's how you can do that but
by default again I like to reset that
leave it at a hundred percent now right
here is your default thumbnail size so
say you're saying alright my thumbnails
are way too big when they're 128 so I'm
gonna go ahead and change it down to 64
it may make searching for your
thumbnails a little bit easier but by
the way I basically like to leave
everything in default because they set
it up default is a reason they thought
it was the easiest and I think it's the
easiest - so that's basically the basics
of how you can set up your view if
you really don't like anything how they
have a setup by default so now let's go
ahead and hop to this top section this
top section is pretty much your browser
or search engine it allows you to search
for any materials any textures model
sounds it basically is a really advanced
search engine and it's awesome so what
we could do is search for you know
specific things like door and then
whenever we do that we got all the door
aspects look how many there are pretty
cool huh
all the different doors door sounds door
static meshes so that's how we can
search for specific assets we can also
not search that and hop over to here and
this allows us to search for specific
types of asset searches what we're gonna
be doing is we're gonna be searching for
material so later on in the next
tutorial I'm gonna go ahead and click
materials and then I'm gonna be
scrolling through here and we're gonna
be finding the material that we want to
apply to our house but it's basically an
advanced search engine and you have a
bunch of different options here and
whenever we need to I'm gonna be going
over these but for now I don't want to
throw everything at you once don't want
to overwhelm you guys so I'm just gonna
leave you at that for now basically just
remember this your content browser is
where you go is basically a search
engine for all your content that you can
add into your level such as sounds in 3d
models like cars and guns and also
textures and materials like cloth and
maybe wood or something like that but in
the next tutorial I'm actually going to
be putting this to use so you might get
a better understanding of how this works
a little bit better so for now that's
all you guys get so thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
