with a video tutorial for the new bustin
in this example application we're going
to take a look at updating database
table values with jQuery and we're going
to be using the same methods that we've
used with Ajax but in this application
we're gonna make it a little easier for
you to update multiple fields at one
time and I'm going to show you and take
you through how you would do this now
the one thing I have not done in this
tutorial is created some kind of PHP
code that will actually retrieve the
initial values from our database now
let's take a look first of all at the
table that we're going to be using I've
created a database called jQuery and I
have a table called users just in here
and we have first of all a user ID which
is extremely important because if you
are updating users values they will
always have a unique ID and this is
where you will use or your where clause
in your MySQL query in order to update
it so for example at the name at the
moment the name here is Alex just go
ahead and browse and refresh that so we
can see so that's Alex this form here
and I've given it a just a simple header
to make it look a bit more user friendly
it's called name now assuming you've
created a some code that will actually
take the value from here based on the
user ID it will input the field data
here so Alex would be written in here so
that's the first thing that you would
have to go ahead and do yourself you'd
probably have some kind of system in
place if you are updating values to
actually retrieve the initial value
first however if I were to go ahead and
modify this for example add a surname
and then click Save you can see that
we've now got this your settings have
been updated now just before that there
was a tiny flicker of a loading message
that came up so if you were to say
update you know if the user was updating
a long
a string of data raw or several fields
at a time with lots of data in you would
have a loading sign come up beforehand
and I'll demonstrate this a bit later
when we actually create this by using
the sleep function in PHP to actually
pause the script however we have this
confirmation message your settings have
been updated let's go back to our table
and click browse and you can see that
where my name was originally Alex we now
have a surname added in as well
so this form here has actually updated
this value here and that's based on a
user ID that I've sort of forced to be
set so you'll see you'll see that a bit
later on anyway okay so essentially what
this is doing is actually just updating
the database table value based on the
fields that we're going to be adding in
here we're just going to be using the
name field in this tutorial however
obviously once you've completed the
tutorial and you're comfortable with it
you can go ahead and update multiple
fields at a time okay so to begin let's
first of all take a look at the files
that we're going to be using in this
tutorial now the first file is Ajax
jeaious if you've looked at my other
example applications in this series
you'll note that we include this in the
page as well as jQuery so we have use of
this javascript file all this javascript
file is going to do is it's going to
take the fields that we've created all
the button that we've created and it's
actually going to handle this event and
you know perform the ajax or the post
HTTP request in jQuery settings is the
file that we're calling from Ajax in
order to actually go ahead and update
these values here this value here and
init dot PHP is going to start our
sessions in PHP so we're going to start
the ability to use sessions we're going
to set a current session to one the
value one remember that corresponds to
this here so essentially what we're
doing is we're forcing a session to
equal one and this is just for the
purposes of the tutorial however you'll
probably
have some kind of registration and login
system in place if you don't you can
follow along by forcing this value
otherwise you can use the session data
that you've already already have in
place on your website the third thing
that this is is going to do is connect
our data connect to a MySQL sit there
server and then select the jQuery
database so the first thing we want to
do is go ahead and build the front end
of this and this is the page where we
have the form field and the button to
update so I'm first of all going to
create a h3 tag and I'm just gonna give
this a name of settings or title of
settings I'm then gonna go ahead and
create the name label and as well as
that the input field as well let's just
around these in paragraph tags the idea
of this is going to just be name and we
also need a button a bit further down so
the type is button the value is going to
be save and the ID is going to be save
underscore button now we also need a
span as well which is going to handle
the information that's fed back so we
need a span element and the idea of this
is going to be save underscore status so
this will either show the loading text
which we're going to talk about a bit
later it's either going to show
successfully updated or could not update
your settings for example if the query
fails for any reason</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
