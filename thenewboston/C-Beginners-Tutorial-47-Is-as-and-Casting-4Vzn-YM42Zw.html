c-sharp tutorial that I'm making for
them in passing this tutorial I'll be
showing you how to use the is keyword
and the cast operator because they work
together so all you're going to need for
this tutorial is a bottle and once you
have that onion formed just double click
on it so to start off here we're gonna
create an object and create an object
and we're going to set equal to a string
object so you go to and that's string
will just say Adam alright and and now
we're going to create an if statement to
see what type of object this is since
the object can be set equal to anything
like a sub category of object to be like
a string right here so we can check to
see if this is a string and in order to
do that it can type if and then object
or whatever you cause your object it is
and then a string and this will return
true only if our object is equal to a
string and since our object is equal to
a string then you can do something with
that and let's just make sure that this
works so we'll have a message box show
saying test I guess and you should get a
message box here we click on the body
because our object is indeed string
yep it is a strength so now we could
show this object in the message box by
doing the objects name which is my
object an adoptee string but there's
another way it's called a cast operator
and what you're going to want to do is
just put two parentheses before the name
of your object and then inside of these
parentheses you're going to want to type
the name of the variable that you want
to convert it into we want to convert it
into a string and the only way that
you'll be allowed to do this or use this
task operator is if this returns true if
you have an is statement or an if
statement using the is operator to check
if your variable is another type of
variable so like if we tried to like
cactus is an
here it wouldn't work because this is a
string and it's not an integer so now
when you blog here in button one we
should get a message box you're saying
Adam yep because basically it converted
this object into a string because we
told it to be a string but if we type
like int in here we will get an error it
says cannot convert from from entity
string so yeah we just can't cast it and
you can also do this with other types of
variables mantras like object to like a
string or something you could like do a
control so like if we had controls they
control all my control and such equal to
the button on our form
well button one is a control but more
specifically it's a button so we can
check to see if our control is a button
and if it is a button then what we're
going to do right here is we're going to
craft it into a button we're going to
create a new client pipeline and we'll
study equal to casting our my control
variable right up here at into a bun so
just lose my controller here and now
since my control is actually a button
you will create a new button variable
casting my control as a button so it
will basically convert this into a
button and then now we can do something
with this fun so I'm just going to have
the buttons text be displayed in a
message box so I'm just going to number
and display my button my button cut so
now when you bug and click button one we
should get one one that's the text of
the spot yep
now there's something else you can do
you can also use the as keyword so and
that's just an alternative to the cast
so we can do my control has a button and
that just does the exact same thing and
it will convert this control into a
button because it's like casting my
control as a button and they'll do the
exact same thing as before it's just an
alternative to the Past yep and that
will look at our objects too so if we
created our object over here then we
could create a new string equals our
object as a string so we'll just convert
it into a string check to see up here
straight back and then we can just show
that string and message box so now let
me give love we should just get hello be
open and having an if statement to check
if it is a variable you don't need to
have that there but it's usually good
just to make sure that this cast is
possible otherwise you'll get an error
you don't want areas so that's pretty
much it for this tutorial on is keyword
Diaz keyword and the cast operator so
see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
