welcome to your last tutorial in working
with files the last thing I want to talk
to you guys is how to read and write
actual files so the first thing that I
want to do is well let's do this before
I even begin go ahead and make a new
file and again it's just going to be a
empty text file next name it test error
file here so you guys can see a tester
file and choose and put it in build
debug right there where programs running
and go ahead and finish so now we have a
blank tester file but this is a tester
file and I like bacon hamp just fill
anything with it and go ahead and save
it so now we have a file test for file
in our same directory that were working
with so now we can actually get to the
tutorial you may have already had one if
you do then we can just use that one by
anyways the class that we want to use is
called NS file handle and this class the
objects we create from an organ allow
you to do things like open files create
output write things in the file delete
things from the file so we're gonna be
making two objects thin and fowl
one of those is gonna be for reading
files input and one of them is going to
be for outputting and creating new files
so aside from that NS data we're gonna
be working with this NS data class and
go ahead and make a buffer now what a
buffer is is this a place to temporarily
hold data so we're we're gonna be using
this is we're gonna be reading data from
the file we just created storing it in a
buffer and then when we're ready to
write that data out just saying alright
just write this buffer so we don't have
to type all that text it's going to be a
lot easier so the first thing that we
want to do is open tester file for
reading
and in order to do this go ahead and get
your NS file handle Finn means file in I
mean it doesn't need to be named Finn
that's just what I decided to name it
because then you know I like short
variables so I don't miss type anything
and here's what you do NS file handle in
this class there's a method called file
handle for reading at path and let's go
ahead and as your string this is the
path that tester file and make sure you
spell that right tester file so now what
we did is we've pretty much opened this
tester file and we're able to read the
data from it using the Finn object so
after that you know I'm not going to
create any more comments I'm just going
to talk you through so after that what
we need to do is create a brand new file
so this file doesn't exist yet because
we only have one file in it we want to
create a new file right here and copy
the data over so first thing let's
create that new file and in order to do
this we actually need a one those file
managers NS file manager default manager
and what we want this to do is create
file at path and the path is going to be
just your file name of course we learned
this before
just name it new file and the contents
just set this equal to nil we don't want
anything in there yet and attributes
just set this equal to note too so
you're pretty much creating just a blank
file I mean that's it with nothing in it
so after you created your blank file I
mean what we want to do next is open
that file so we're able to write stuff
in so in your f o UT your other file
handler what you want to do is set this
one equal to NS file
handle four and I don't know why this
isn't popping up oh I know and this file
handle there we go
I got kind of ahead of myself right
there so what we want to do is in this
class there's an object or excuse me
there's a method called file handle for
reading a path but we actually want to
change this reading to writing at path
so check this out
let me fill in the path and then I'll
explain what I just did yeah new file
whenever you create file handle objects
F N and F out you say what you want the
file handle object to do we said this
one is for reading so this file is able
to read files this object is able to
read files this one is for writing so
whenever we use F out we're able to
write stuff in our file and that just
means like write text in our file so
after that what we need to do is
something called truncate the file and
what truncate means is pretty much get
rid of anything that may be in the file
so let me add a little comment the trunk
a file so in order to do this we need to
F out because we need to get rid of
anything that's in the file that we're
going to be writing to F out truncate
file at offset looks good and start at
zero that means start at the beginning
and delete everything in the file so now
what we did pretty much so far is all
right we open the tester file to read
stuff from it and then we created a new
file and then we said all right we're
gonna write stuff to the file but first
we want to delete everything and now
when you actually want to start writing
what do we want to do we want to copy
everything from this file the tests our
file and well let's go ahead and do that
first so go ahead and take that buffer
which is pretty much temporarily it's
pretty much memory and FN
read data to end a file just like that
and that's all you need to put so what
this is going to do is it's going to
open that fin object which is test or
file and read all of the data from it
and it's going to store all of that data
in the variable called buffer so now
what we want to do is take that buffer
which is pretty much all the text in the
file and we want to write it to the F
out file and this is incredibly simple f
out there's just a built-in method
called write data and we want to write
buffer pretty easy huh so now what we
did basically is deleted everything in
the output file which is the new file
and then we read all of the data from
the old file and copied it into the new
file pretty cool huh
so now after we're done with this just
but fin close file and remember always
to close your files when you're done
working with it and check this out see
right now all we have is the tester file
and if I double click that you can see
this is the tester file and I like bacon
and ham yeah it doesn't really matter
what's in it so let's go ahead and build
and run this and see what we get a new
file pops up right here and when we
double click on it it says this is test
fry like bacon ham so what it did is it
caught is it pretty much created a new
file and then it copied all the stuff
from inside tests or file and wrote it
to new file so what did it do well let
me show you what it did in our console
now it opened that tests our file right
here using fin object and then it
created a new file with an NS file
manager which we learn how to do in the
last tutorials and then it opened out it
opened the new file so we were able to
write stuff in it but first before it
did we want to make sure that everything
was deleted you usually want to do this
when you're writing a file from
bare-bones and then what it did after
everything was deleted in the new file
stored all the data in the old file in a
very
called buffer it took that data and
wrote it in the new file f ow and then
it closed both the files because you
know good housekeeping practice closed
files when you're done with it and bam
that's what we did so again that's the
last tutorial that I'm gonna be teaching
you concerning files there's a lot more
stuff to go over but it's pretty much
the same concepts we learned just a
bunch of built-in methods for you know
paths directories files everything else
from now on should be self-explanatory
ready move on to the next topic so thank
you guys for watching don't forget
subscribe source code below and I'll see
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
