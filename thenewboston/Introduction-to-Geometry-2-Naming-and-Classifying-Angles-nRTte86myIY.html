naming angles and it probably seems
really simple but there is an actual way
you must name your angles so there are
three ways you can name your angle you
can start with point a and go
counterclockwise to point C and to
indicate it's an angle we do a little
angle symbol out front and we say angle
a B C we can go the other way and say
it's angles C B a or we could just name
it
angle B now this this point right here
is the vertex of your angle and the
vertex is how we really define which
angle that's why it has to be in the
middle or if you just name it
angle B you can you just have that
vertex angle because that make sure that
it's this angle that you're talking
about okay now that we know how to name
angles we're going to talk about the
types of angles you can have so an angle
whose measure is greater than 1 greater
than 0 degrees but less than 90 degrees
is an acute angle and you can remember
it because it's a cute little angle
because it's you know it's small okay an
angle whose measurement is equal to 90
degrees is called a right angle and it's
right angles that make up squares and
rectangles that's why when we measure it
we do this little
square right here to indicate that it's
a right angle so an angle whose greater
than 90 90 degrees but less than 180
degrees is called an obtuse angle and an
angle whose measure is equal to 100
degrees is called a straight angle or as
you can see it's also called a line
because a line measure is equal to 180
degrees and we more commonly refer to it
as a line than an angle so let's do some
examples with classifying angles so this
first angle we have right here is
measure is 73 degrees and since 73 is
less than 90 degrees but greater since
73 degrees is less than 90 degrees but
greater than 100 degrees this is an
acute angle this one right here is 120
degrees which is less than 180 degrees
but greater than 90 degrees so this is
an obtuse angle and like the first one
this is greater than zero degrees but
less than 90 degrees so this is also an
acute angle okay so now that we know how
to classify and named angles be sure to
come back and watch the next video where
we're going to talk about the congruence
and addition properties of angles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
