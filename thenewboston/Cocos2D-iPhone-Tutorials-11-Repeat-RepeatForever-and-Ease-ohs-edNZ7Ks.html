11th cocos2d tutorial I cannot believe
you guys are still watching this series
Wow it has been amazing but if you are
we are making some real progress and in
this disorder we're going to be going
over repeating and easing to things that
you probably don't know what they are
yet but by the end of this story your
life is a game developer on the iphone
is going to be a whole lot easier
because these are some things that you
know you can do it one way and it will
make it really confusing or you can use
these simple methods i'm about to teach
and it'll make everything a lot easier
so you know that's my introduction let's
get to the coding so let's go ahead and
make action um I'm just going to name on
a one and make any action you want i'm
going to use CC rotate by and actually
don't use any to action make sure it's a
by because it'll it'll make the examples
a lot easier to see so let's go ahead
and use action duration with angle so
it's going to be a second long and it's
going to be 360 just like that so now
what I want to do is make another action
and name this creepy accents what we
want to do is take this action a1 and
repeat it a bunch of times now what we
could do is just write the action into a
sequence and then you know yadda yadda
you know no no no there's a lot easier
way to make an action repeat a given
number of times and that is yes CC
repeat how easy is that and for the
parameters all your right is this action
with action and for this parameter you
write what action you want to repeat I
don't know that why they named it action
with action they could just add action
may best parameter of something else I
don't know and how many times you want
to repeat in this case three times so
after this what we need to do is go
ahead and write the sprites name chick
and run action and the action we want to
do is repped action so what this is
going to do is take this action repeat
it three times and then just run it
so let's go ahead and build around this
and now that my iphone stimulator is
running and now when I press the button
check this out one rotation two
rotations and three rotations stop so
that looks pretty cool but I know some
of you guys are saying already Bucky
that is a cool repeating action but i'm
too lazy to write this code a bunch of
times well i really want is this code to
repeat forever i want to write one mine
and i don't want to have to ever worry
about again I want that chick the spin
forever and ever and ever well my friend
have I got a treat for you what I'm
going to do here is change this to
repeat forever did you guess that here's
a little quiz for you maybe i'll right
i'll give you guys the answer then this
story and what movie did the guy say
forever okay the answer saying luck
because you know i'm definitely going to
forget at into torial to give it any sir
but anyways with that being said maybe
this will make some sense to you go
ahead and press escape and look at all
the parameters we can use now unlike the
last one where time x was a parameter
only action with the action is a
parameter in this one and you're saying
all right why is that the case that's
the case because when it repeats forever
you don't have to give it a certain
number of times or repeat it already
knows repeat forever continuous so let's
go ahead and save this and check this
out when i press the button one two
three four and this is going to keep
going on forever and ever and ever
non-stop until we know close out a
stimulator so that's the difference
between a repeat where you can give a
certain number of times in repeat
forever where of course does it forever
so that definitely save you some trouble
when you try to repeat actions in your
games so quit the iphone stimulator and
now what we want to do is this actually
let's go ahead and get rid of this whole
line and the next thing i want to teach
you about is e so
Sheila's it would probably be better if
we extend this animation by a second so
keep your rotation animation and yeah
get rid of that to pretty much start
blink if you need to so anyways the next
thing I want to talk to you guys about
is e so go ahead and make action name
anything you want and go ahead and put
CC ease and if you press escape you can
see all these different ease you know
bouncing bounce out the one you're
probably going to be using the most is
ease in out now what these actions are
they're pretty much a more natural way
for your animations to look on the
screen let me give you guys a quick
example whenever you're driving a car
and you know how you begin you
accelerate by you know starting out slow
5 miles an hour then work your way up to
10 and then you know go to 6585 and then
you slow down gradually you don't you
know always sudden you start your car
and you're going 65 miles an hour that
would be very unnatural looking and
definitely be very unsafe so what EES
action zoo is they give you a natural
way that things move around on the
screen and if you ever worked with like
a flash or any programs like that um
pretty much everything put computer
program has this with animation um after
effects has it with ease ease so anyways
people use this a lot whenever they do
just about any animation give it a more
natural look so enough with me rambling
what these actions are pretty much to
use acceleration and deceleration
built-in so what we need to do for this
is I'll see right here action with
action and rate the action with action
is what action you want to ease in and
the rate is it would be for this for
example if this was a car action driving
from zero to sixty five and back down to
zero if you put a rate of two maybe
actually let's go ahead and put a rate
of
of three well forget everything I said
in the last twenty second check this out
if you gave it a rate of one it would
this is really hard to explain without a
graph but the higher the rate the more
powerful acceleration and deceleration
this is really hard to explain with how
to graph it's really easy to see what
out without a graph so here's what I'm
going to do I'm just going to do this
all right let's start out with a rate of
one and go ahead and build this and
let's see oh yeah run action ease this
will be the way to teach you guys
visually i forgot i'm doing in tutorial
where you guys can just watch what's
going on so remember this has a rate of
one and check this out she starts out I
don't even know if that did it right
there let's go ahead with a rate of two
you can hardly even see alright so
what's going to happen is if we just run
the rotate action normally she rotates
it all the same speed but this time she
starts out going slow then speeds up and
slows back down at the end kind of a
more natural rotation and now that's
with a rate of two think of this as case
instead of right I think of it as power
because if we did a rate by seven this
will be very clear this was a kind of
rambling try to explain but if we did
array of seven she starts out even
slower than speeds up faster in the
middle then goes even slower at the end
so you know like I said just substitute
the word rate for power and it'll make a
whole lot sense i think that they
probably use the word rate whenever they
make in this method because um whenever
it whatever formula they use to make
methods it probably had rate in it
somewhere but you know doesn't really
make sense when you're using it in a
method by anyways rate is pretty much
the power um I don't know you know just
play around with enough of me talking
but the important thing I want to talk
about is a you know what eases more
natural ways
to use actions so you know three looks
pretty good instead of spending all at
the same speed if we set it to a rate of
three it starts out slow increases speed
and then decelerates at the end so you
know it took me like 20 minutes just
explain one line of code but you know
what at least is this tutorial is done
now so thank you guys for watching we
are finally done with the repeats and
eases I'm sorry I had to make you guys
struggle through my terrible explanation
of that but you know what at least I
tried that's all I could say so thank
you guys for watching don't forget
subscribe if you have any questions ask
me on the forum so yeah that's all I got
to say I now see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
