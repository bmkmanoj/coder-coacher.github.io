me I have been out of the YouTube action
for about two weeks now but now I'm back
making tutorials and I have actually
been using my time to create apps
instead of tutorials and in fact I got
an appt accepted by the App Store so
maybe I'll leave a link below you should
definitely check it out it's my first
app ever made I'm gonna put some update
center right now it's like a quiz game
it's pretty cool only got 100 questions
right now but you know I'm going to
update it add some more features but you
know if you want to see uh what a nap is
in uh you know if you don't know by now
then you're probably screwed but anyways
go by my app that's what I'm saying I
mean I gave you like 800 free tutorials
it's at least you could do and if you
want to rate it five I'm not going to
hate you alright so tonight I have two
more apps waiting to be approved I
didn't run really um start making
anymore so right now I just decided to
get drunk and make some tutorials so I
got the first part taken care of take
care of the second part now and drunk
stories are much like regular stories
except if i get an error or I mess up
anything now then I'm just going to
start breaking stuff so you know a
little bit different but overall the
same so I already made um a project I
guess you could say or started in the
app and I just made it almost view based
so we only have one view controller so
that's what I did so far you didn't miss
out on anything too much trust me save
you the hassle so what we're going to be
doing in this tutorial is I'm going to
teach you how to save and load data
because you know the apps we made so far
they're kind of just you know you can't
really save any data I didn't teach any
of that so pretty much every time you
open your app it's pretty much the same
as you looked at your app for the first
time you download it so if you want to
have any highscores or if you want to
have any um you know just settings that
you want to
save it would be impossible until now
don't don't do so let's go ahead and
learn how to do that what we're going to
be creating is just a really simple text
field on the screen and you're going to
type something into it and then when you
close your app it's going to save it and
then you know you can go go to the
Internet go check your mail and then
when you come back it's going to be
right there waiting for you BAM save and
data awesome so what we need on screen
is a UI text field and try to put the
text view in there I sonya and we'll go
ahead and name it filled one because you
know we have to name a number of course
because it's our only field alright so
this is going to represent a text field
on the screen that's all we're going to
have it's going to be really
dumb-looking so NS string Wow mess that
up already some phone getting mad or any
ns really NS string this might take a
while come stay with me all right and go
ahead and name this path of file and
what this method is going to do is this
going to return to you the path or in
other words the file that we want to
save two and you'll understand later but
anyways now that we have the file we
want to save to what we want to do is
make the method to save it and we want
to save I mean you can put a button to
when you click it you save but we want
to use the application will terminate
and this is a built-in method that gets
called automatically when the
application will close and so whenever
they close or quit the application we
want to save the data automatically so
it takes voice plant perimeter um
actually I just have it copied right
over here and every st. Bucky you can't
do that it's cheating well actually it's
a if you go hold and control MC cook
click ctrl or option is and click or it
you know just do this it's easier right
click it and press fine text and
documentation here's my rule any text
that I can find in the dock
mutation I can go ahead and copy from
some routes so yeah it's not cheating so
leave me alone trolls alright so now
let's go ahead and build this you need
to overview one last time all right i'll
give it to you this is going to be a
text field on the screen this is going
to be a method to retrieve the path of
the file that we're going to save two
and this is the method that's actually
going to do the saving whenever our
program is about to shut down we want to
save all the data and I you know that's
all we want to do actually so now that
we have this built we can go ahead and
in our nib and by the way check this out
I downloaded the new iphone sdk for or
whatever in this library i don't like it
i like the other style view this one is
like one big scroll bar I like it with
all the icons so if anyone knows how to
get the icons back i no take me five
seconds to the lookup up i'm too lazy if
anyone knows how to get those icons back
you know let me know alright so here's
what we've got so far a view on the
screen looks pretty cool what we want to
add to it is if i can find it with this
dumb view let me scroll down scroll down
a text field BAM got you so just go
ahead and add the text field right there
and then go ahead and your files owner
ctrl and drag and i must not have saved
this oh-ho I know what I did well this
is a quite embarrassing
synthesized oh wait a minute getting
ahead of myself at property non-atomic
may be sure to hit that last beer retain
and I be outlet and then just go ahead
and copy this and now what that does is
create an outlet for you on the screen
so now we can go ahead and build this
lamp it right here build it save it
shave it I'm skin there is no saying
that goes like that it also don't you
know don't try so now if you go ahead
and control drag go ahead and select
field one and now this text field
represents field one in our code so file
save interface quit interface while we
were speeding through this so now we can
go ahead and let me do this before I
forget copy that all right under
implementation go ahead and synthesized
field one and now go ahead and copy
these methods and we can go ahead and
implement them copy paste that shiz
right there and go ahead and pat the
file add body that and I actually add
all my body's first let the bodies hit
the flow all right path a file and you
know what you know what I decided just
now one at the moment um I'm actually
going to do all this and next story and
it might even run another run over to a
third tutorial I don't know but I'm
probably going to go funnel some beers
and yeah you study try to understand
what went on so far and yeah I'll see
you next time oh I know you can do check
out my app plug plug alright thanks for
watching and I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
