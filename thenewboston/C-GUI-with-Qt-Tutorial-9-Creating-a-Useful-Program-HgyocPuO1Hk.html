tutorial and now that we understand how
to set up a very basic cue program and
we kind of know about all the basic
widgets and signals and slots I think
it's time to kind of step away from the
basic examples and learn how to create a
useful GUI application using cue so what
I'm going to be doing in these next
couple tutorials is probably going to be
like five tutorials is I'm going to set
up a full program something that you
might actually use which is a text it's
basically going to be like you're going
to be able to insert a couple paragraphs
of text and you're going to be able to
find like a certain word so if there is
a biography of myself in the New Boston
you might type in find Bucky and it's
going to find all the word Bucky in
there again it's not an application that
you're going to you know have fun for
with days and days of fun but you know
it helps us demonstrate the basic ideas
of how to set up a full useful GUI
application so pretty cool let's go
ahead I'll shut up now I'll get started
so we'll create a new project and we'll
create a widget project just like before
cute GUI application nothing in here
let's new choose this and I'm just going
to name it find crap because that's
basically what the application is we're
going to type in a word aka crap and
it's going to find it in the bigger body
of text so hit next what target just the
desktop will be fine for this
demonstration next now the first thing I
want to do is change the base class from
main window to cue widget and also the
class name to find crap so if you notice
whenever you type the class name your
header file source file in your form
file which is basically your interface
file they all change automatically so
just keep the defaults they're set up
perfectly already as long as you change
the class name so now go ahead and hit
next and looks pretty good finish our a
so we now have our project set up find
crap looking pretty good and a lot of
stuff is already built in here into the
header file the source files and also
the interface file so before we go ahead
and hop into the coding let's go ahead
and set up the
interface the thing that the user is
going to see now the reason that I don't
want to do this through code is because
what I like to do is actually set it up
through here and I'm going to tell you
guys about a couple shortcuts that are
going to save you guys a lot of time
actually so the first thing that we need
to do is we'll add a label so go ahead
and grab label and drag it right here
and well I'll add everything before I
change any text but now what we need to
do is we need to add a line edit now if
you want to it might be a little easier
just go up at the top and start writing
a line edit so it pops up automatically
or if you want to search through all the
widgets that's fine too so go ahead and
this is where we're going to be typing
the word and whenever the user is ready
to submit their entry they type through
the word and they're ready to you know
pretty much hit go they need a button so
if we clear this out let me see if I can
find it
we're right here a push button go ahead
and drag that so basically um we might
as well change this text right now so
the labels text will be searched for
something like this said they know that
you know this is what the program does
search for text let me line this up a
little bit better search for okay now
for the push button go ahead and double
click this and hit go so basically the
easier is going to search for a certain
word like tuna and whenever they hit go
it's going to search through the text
right here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
