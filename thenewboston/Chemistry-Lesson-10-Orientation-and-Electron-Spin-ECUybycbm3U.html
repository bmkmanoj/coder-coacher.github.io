first two variables in the quantum
mechanical model we can go ahead and
talk about the other two orientation and
spin so let's go ahead and start with
orientation which is technically called
magnetic quantum number but who wants to
say that it's basically orientation in
other words how is this orbit tilted in
3d space is it doesn't follow along the
XYZ axis you can tilt these things any
which way and this number represents
which way it tilts so the possible
values are this is dependent on L
remember the L value which was the shape
that number depends what the orientation
value could be and it could be anything
from negative L to positive L so for
example if L equalled 1
you could have orientation equal
negative 1 0 or 1 that means you have
three different ways which are why am I
getting that little weird circle thing
you can have three different ways that
your path can be oriented or tilted in
by path I mean subshells and if you
still don't understand what I mean check
this out so in this case where L equals
one we have three different tilts so if
we went ahead and looked at the chart
the shape when l equals one is this is
it looks like two balloons kind of
pressed together so you could either
tote it on the x-axis left and right the
y-axis up and down or the z-axis
front-to-back
so whenever I say tilt that's what I
mean you can tilt it or orient it in
different directions so now that we
understand orientation or hopefully you
do orientation means till that's all you
need to know let's go ahead and talk
about spin this is the easy one now the
spin which is technically called the
spin quantum number basically means
whenever you have an electron you have
to figure out which direction it's
spinning basically clockwise or
counterclockwise now you can only have
two values of course for this plus 1/2
or negative 1/2
this means clockwise or counterclockwise
now each subshell or each path I guess I
can say can only hold two electrons one
of them can spin clockwise and the other
one can spin counterclockwise so if we
go ahead and we look at this chart look
we'll just take a real easy one s s is
the shape remember this path or this sub
show can have two electrons one spinning
this way and one spinning this way
whenever you get to these other ones the
P shape in this sub shell one electron
can be spinning like this in one
electron can be spending like this in
this one one electron can you spin like
this and another can be spinning like
this so each of these balloons basically
can hold two electrons one can spin
clockwise and one can spin
counterclockwise so basically with all
those variables we can use something in
putting together inside the quantum
mechanical model to predict which path
an electron is likely to take so
remember to recap one last time n is the
size of it for example you could have
one s and it might be this size if you
had two s it would be a lot bigger it
would be like this size so basically n
equals the size of it L equals the shape
and remember s P and D we just took the
numbers 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 and change them into
letters so we could write it better but
s equals 0 P equals 1 in D equals 2 so
the shape for L is a sphere the shape
for P looks like two balloons pressed
together the shape for D looks like four
balloons and sometimes you get this
little doughnut thing it actually gets
really weird if you keep going on but
we'll just work with three different
shapes for now this is complicated
enough so n equal size L equal shapes
and the higher it gets the more complex
they get the M L or the orientation
equals the tilt can it be tilted along
the x axis the y axis the z axis or if
you get even deeper you got you can like
pretty much tow to any direction you
want and M s or in other words
the spin quantum number just means in
these little balloons in these little
areas is the electron spinning clockwise
or counterclockwise and with all that
information that's all you need to know
pretty much that's all you need to know
for now so even with this quantum
mechanical model in all these numbers we
still can't predict a hundred percent
the path of an electron
these areas these balloons as I'm
calling them are just areas where the
electrons are likely to be but it's not
100% guaranteed that the electrons are
going to be here but for now this is all
our chemist Scott so it's pretty dang
accurate to be honest it's just not 100%
so just remember that so after all that
you're like man that isn't even
guaranteed but whenever you study a
lecture on some weird factors take place
and we'll talk about those later on so
now that you hopefully understand what
the different variables are now that we
have broken this puzzler part I'm going
to show you guys a really cool and
really simple way where we can take all
these pieces and put them together and
finally everything whenever it's tied
together you're going to see how much
sense it makes and when in fact you
would ever need this quantum mechanical
model so I know things may have gotten a
little fuzzy but promise I'm going to
take all the pieces put it back together
in your brain so thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you guys in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
