what we did up to this point is we
created our main data storage and we've
passed it to our application so now we
can really use it in any component that
we want now I really don't want to use
it in our main layout because again this
isn't really supposed to be smart it's
just supposed to be kind of a way to lay
out all your other child components so
what I'm going to do now is I'm going to
actually create a component that can
accept that main store that main
application data so this is the thing we
know that our data is up here our
storage and we know that we can create
components to use them but they have to
go through this thing called a container
so that looks like a pain-in-the-butt
right believe it or not
containers are incredibly easy all they
are is about two functions to say okay
this is your data that's the component
and this is how they're connected super
easy but there's actually a lot of
debate on how these should be kind of
properly set up whenever you work with a
react and redux now what some people
like to do is they like to make a
directory called components and have all
of their kind of presentational
components in here not a lot of brains
so then what they do is they make
another directory fault for containers
and remember containers are really just
the glue to bind your store and your
components together so they make another
directory for those however what other
people do and this is kind of the other
half of a fence is they combine these
components in containers into one file
so they're kind of the same thing so
even though I may not agree with this
for teaching it I think it's really easy
if they're just both in one file because
then you can see everything that's going
on at once so that's what I'm going to
do so for right now think of it like
this whenever I say component I just
mean basically a dump component a part
of your website that doesn't have any
brains whatsoever whenever I say
container
I mean basically a component
it that's hooked up to your data storage
that's it so let me go ahead and make a
new directory called containers and
again containers are going to look like
99% like components but yeah there you
go
so for this one I'm just going to name
it I don't know user list so make a new
list j/s and see what I can steal so
what I need I need a react component
all right so of course we need to react
and I also need component because I'm
going to be treating this class is a
component now a couple other things I
need in order to make a container is
first of all something called bind
action traders and I'm going to be
explaining all of this in just a second
but again bind action creators and this
is coming from redux
and one other thing is connect and I'm
sure you can probably guess what this is
already so connect from react redux
there we go
all right so now you pretty much just
set this up like a plain old generic
component so class we'll say user list
and in order to make a component
whenever you use a modules or this kind
of build environment is you just extends
component now inside here just like any
component all it is is pretty much a way
that we can return some HTML so we just
want to render out in a return any HTML
that we want now eventually what this is
going to be is it's actually going to
get a list of users but for right now
what am I going to do all right just do
this keep things real easy just put like
one
two and three now once this is hooked up
I'll change this but for right now I
just want to show you guys that this is
indeed working correctly all right
so whenever you make a component you
need to render or display some HTML and
you can have an image in here a heading
whatever but for right now this looks
pretty good so now what I need to do is
just export this so I'm just going to
write export default user list and there
you go so over in my app in order to
actually import this I'll just say
import user list from containers user
list right there
and now anytime I want to use this just
refer to the class name and pretty much
like making your own custom tags and I
just need a self Pleasant tag so boom
there you go now if this thing builds
again all right so there we go
so basically we didn't even do anything
container related yet this is just a
normal react component all we did is we
made a class extense component so it
actually is a component and then we
returned some basic HTML
all right so nothing that we haven't
learned in the beginner react tutorials
so now what we need to do is we need to
figure out how to take this component
and hook it up to our data store right
here so how do we do that
well we need to convert it to a
container so our rights how the heck do
we do that well I'm guessing that we use
some of the stuff that we imported right
here
so under your class right here go ahead
and add a room for one more function and
that's this I guess going to write the
word first the function is called map
States to props now this is a function
that confuses so many people and it's
not your fault it's because
every single resource online every
single bit of documentation it's like
they're trying to make this is hard to
understand as humanly possible but this
is actually one of the easiest functions
in the world all of this does is it
takes a piece of your application store
your application state the main data and
it passes it into your component I can't
say component today it passes it in to
your component how does it pass it in
there as a property that's all it does
and they can pass whatever pieces of the
store in that it wants do so we're just
going to go ahead and return and again
we want to take the users that we made
earlier and we want to pass it in there
so what do we do well we're going to
make a property called users and it's
going to be equal to the state users
that's it that's all we do so again all
Maps state to props does is it takes a
piece of state which is just part of
your store and it sends it into your
component as props that's it so does
that mean that in our component what we
can do is we can just say this stop
props dot users and it's equal to the
users for our entire application yes
that's exactly what it means how awesome
is that now there is one other thing
that we need to do and that's this and
this is actually really easy let me just
cut this in order to actually use or
call this function we just need to call
connect so Connect takes map state props
what we just made and then after we need
to say users list so again whenever you
just say users lists right here
we're just exporting the default dumb
component the component that doesn't
know anything about the main application
data whenever we export the user list
but we connect it to map state the props
now what we're doing is we're taking
that component we're making it aware of
your applications store or you
your data and then that's what we are
exporting so now this is pretty much a
smart component or a container so again
you know what I was saying earlier that
some people like to make this all in one
file like I just did in other people's
or other people like to kind of take
this part which is your container glue
of it and break it up separate from this
it really doesn't matter it's up to you
but yeah there you go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
