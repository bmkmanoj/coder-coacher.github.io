welcome to your next tutorial in
electronics and robotics and as promised
in this tutorial I'm gonna be teaching
guys how to find the value of a resistor
now in case you guys forgot from the
last tutorials each of the resistors I
showed you had four bands on it bands of
colors and this is because instead of
having a challenge of printing really
small numbers on a really small
component the manufacturers found it was
easier just to print bands in each of
these bands resemble of value in a
certain way now the there are usually
four bands and this resistor is flipped
around so this is actually the fourth
band but how it usually goes is the
first three bands show how many ohms
that there is this area is capable of
resisting and the last band shows the
tolerance so the first band on this one
is brown the second one is black the
third one is orange and the fourth band
is gold and let me show you guys what
that means right now and how to look at
this resistor and see exactly how many
ohms it resists
so remember Brown black orange gold in
that order what you do is when you look
at a resistor you have to find the first
band and that's your first digit and how
many ohms that resist and remember the
first one in this case was Brown so if
we look at our chart it says Brown
equals one so let's go ahead and write a
1 next our next band was black C Brown
black so if you look up here black
equals zero so let's go ahead and write
a zero and those are your two digits you
just write them down playing like that
now the third band is called the
multiplier band and this is what value
you have to multiply that number by so
since it this one is orange let's go
ahead and see what we have to multiply
but so anytime we have an orange we have
to multiply the number we found by a
thousand so ten times a thousand is ten
thousand so that is how many owns that
this resistor resists right here ten
thousand ohms now you're saying all
right I figured out what the first three
mean how to figure out the resistance
what about that fourth one right there
the fourth band is always the tolerance
now in case you guys forgot from less
story tolerance is pretty much margin of
error and since this was a gold band
right there gold let's go and find what
tolerance means so tolerance if we look
at gold right here it means five percent
right there so we have one thousand our
excuse me a ten thousand ohm resistor
that has a five percent tolerance and
that's how you can determine tolerance
value of resistors just by looking at
them and again they did this by making
bands instead of printing really small
numbers because small numbers are hard
to see and bands are a little easier so
let's move on one more resistor and make
sure you guys got this down pat we have
another resistor here that has orange
let me get a pointer orange orange brown
and gold now we already know that this
gold one at the end means five percent
tolerance so we're just concentrating on
what value of ohms this resistor resists
so orange orange and brown don't forget
it we're going to need to remember that
so let me see if I can get rid of this
there we go
all gone so actually now I forgot it
orange orange Brown all right so let's
get our trusty painter out where are you
there we go so the first one band is
orange so we know that Orange equals
three right here three our second band
was also orange as you can see orange
orange so that means right a three again
three next we got to figure out what to
multiply
33 bye so we look at our third band
which is brown and if we look on our
chart brown it says multiply this by 10
so 33 times 10 is 330 so that's how many
ohms your resistor resist so this is a
330 ohm resistor with 5% tolerance so
that is pretty much how you use the
band's to find the ohms or resistance of
your what's called a resistor and again
the first two numbers use this the third
band or excuse me of the first two bands
write the numbers down here the third
band multiplied by that number here in
the fourth band is the tolerance here so
1 2 3 4 and that is your quick tutorial
on how to use the bands of colors to
find how many ohms your resistor resists
so thank you guys for watching if you
have any questions there's a there's all
these graphs on the internet just Google
in like resistor graphs or resistor
charts and this will pop up so again
thank you guys for watching make sure to
subscribe make sure to check out my next
tutorial and again thank you and I will
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
