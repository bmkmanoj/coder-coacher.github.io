video as promised I'm going to be
talking to you guys about the order of
operations in parentheses and how to use
it
whenever you're working with C
programming so let's go ahead and might
as well get our hands dirty and I'll
show you guys exactly what I'm talking
about in the problems that you might run
into so let's just go ahead and make it
integer called a and we'll set this
equal to a real simple equation 4 plus 2
times 6 and then we'll just go ahead and
print it out on-screen printf and of
course just go ahead and print D and
pump that to a new line actually let me
go ahead and put this result that new
line and of course print out a now I
actually want to copy this and do I want
to do it now yeah ok I'll go ahead and
run it now so this equation right here
you might be thinking this ok 4 plus 2
that 6 times it by 6 36 piece of cake
run this and 16 okay so I'm an idiot
what did we do wrong hello I don't know
if you got I'm sure you do it learn
about the order of operations already I
don't know how old you guys are watching
this tutorial but basically the order of
operations in real life is the same as
they are in C programming so I learn
like PEMDAS I think which is parentheses
exponents for now just remember that
multiple ate multiplication and division
come first and then addition and
subtraction meaning that whenever you
have an equation that has both
multiplication and addition what it's
going to do is it's going to do your
multiplication first that's kind of a
tongue twister so it's going to times 6
times 2 which is 12 and then add 4
however what if we actually wanted to
add 2 to 4 which is 6 and then multiply
it by 6 well whenever we want to do that
we actually need to do I want to make a
new variable
I'll just stick with this a so whenever
we wanted to do that actually just copy
this then here's what we do just like in
real life again surround the thing you
want to do first with parentheses so you
can use parentheses basically to
overrule the rules of math so right now
we're saying always do the things in
parentheses first so now what we're
going to do is um you do this equation
first which is 6 and then times the
result by 6 and hopefully if my computer
is not broken it would print out 36 so
again the first one is just the default
way of I don't know just like how math
works and the second one we over wrote
it and use parentheses to make our own
armed equation I guess you could say now
another thing that I want to teach you
guys since this is kind of a short story
do I want to teach you guys this now
actually I got a vent a little bit and I
want to save this for next tutorial so
that's all I have for you guys um you
guys can check out the next video but if
you guys want to stick around listen to
this story so last night um a couple
people came over and we were just
hanging out out front because I don't
know that's what we do for fun and this
stupid cat walked right up to me because
my neighbor she left and she was like a
cat lady and she left all our cats here
so now they walk around my house so this
cat walked up to me and I'm allergic to
cats I'm like get the heck away cat and
this girl named Emma who was uh with me
she's like hey don't beat me into the
cat I'm like whatever
and she wanted me to feed the cat and
I'm like no way I'm f---ing this cat so
she went in my house and she was going
to get some food for the cat so she
could feed it
I guess she felt bad for it or something
and you know what she walks out with a
bagel a freaking a friend a freaking
bagel I'm like Emma what are you doing
what the heck and I try to like explain
to her that cats don't eat bagels and
she's like I'll be fine my dog eats
bagels I saw like wow really
so eventually I just let her do her
thing so she actually sets the bagel
down and I'll scratch my head because in
my house I actually had a couple cans of
tuna fish
she coulda got but she sets the bagel
down and like this cat is the gal I
gonna it's like flippy of the finger and
the cat actually starts eating the
freaking bagel I'm like what the heck
and now I look like a idiot because this
stupid cat is he in this stupid bagel
and I so so that's basically the story
of midnight and now the cat always comes
around and meows whenever I'm making
sorrow because I don't know I guess you
just wants more freaking bagels so if
you hear meowing in the background it's
that stupid cat blame Emma
anyways I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
