slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and this tutorial we're going to be
taking a look at the do until loop so
now basically what the do until loop is
is it's similar to the for loop and that
it will do a certain block of code over
and over again until a certain value is
reached but the difference is is that
when you use a for loop the developer
knows exactly how many times that for
loop is going to run so let's say we did
for num1 equals 1 to 20 we know that
that's going to go 20 times because we
specified that it needs to go that many
times now what the do until loop it will
run until a certain value is reached and
now sometimes this will run I don't know
let's say for example we make a do until
loop do until num1 equals 10 this could
run ten times or it could run a thousand
times if num1 is equal to let's say
negative 990 that will run a thousand
times now let's go ahead and make a do
one two loop example so we'll go ahead
and select a new project will do a
console application and we'll type do
until loop
now let's zoom in here okay now let's go
ahead and add console dot readline so I
won't forget that at the end and now
let's come up here and we'll declare a
variable so we'll do dim num1 as integer
and we'll set it equal to negative well
let's just set it equal to zero to start
with okay so now what we're going to do
is we are going to create our do until
loop so type do until num1 is equal to
let's do 10 and you can see here that it
created this loop word for us so
basically what this means is it's
similar to the next in the for loop once
it hits this statement right here it's
going to come back around to the top of
the do until loop and if num1 is not
equal to 10 then it's going to go ahead
and keep looping until num1 is equal to
10 and then just going to go down to the
line after the loop statement okay so
what we want to do until num1 is equal
to 10 so we'll just write console dot
write line num1 now if we run this then
we it will print out 0 over and over and
over again because we haven't
incremented num1 it's always going to be
equal to 0 so let's just do after
console dot write line num1 will just
type num1 plus equals 1 so basically
what this is going to do is it's going
to print out num1 and then it's going to
add 1 to it it's go up it's going to
loop until num 1 is equal to 10 and it's
going to do console dot read line so you
can see if we run this it goes 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 now you can see that it stops at
9 now the reason it does this is because
it does it until num1 equals 10 so if
num1 is equal to 10 then it's not going
to do it now if we set that equal to 11
then it would print out all the way up
to 10 now we can also increment num1 in
different values
so we can do num1 plus equals 2 and you
can see if we run this we get 0 2 4 6 8
now we can also set num1 to a different
value other than 0 at the beginning so
if we set it equal to negative 20 then
if we go ahead and do until num1 equals
10 it's going to do it a different
amount of times so it's going to start
at negative 20 negative 18 it's going to
increment it by 2 all the way until it
gets to 8 so go ahead and practice and
make a couple do onto loops once you got
those down and you know you're not going
to forget them go ahead and move on to
the next tutorial and thanks for
watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
