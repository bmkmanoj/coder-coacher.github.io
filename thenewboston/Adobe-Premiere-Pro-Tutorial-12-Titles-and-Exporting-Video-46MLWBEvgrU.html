editing a podcast video and this is
Torah I'm going to show you how I add
the titles and how I make the final
product that looks awesome for YouTube
now it's going to be different your
settings depending on whether you want
to put it on a DVD or YouTube but since
I love youtube I might as well show you
guys how to do that so the very first
thing I'd like to do is this let me go
ahead and zoom into the beginning and
start playing okay that video looks
pretty cool but at the beginning I mean
it's kind of bland I just don't want
people to start playing my youtube
videos without you know getting some
logo promotion out there so I'm going to
go ahead and take this clip right here
which is pretty much an image and use
that is my introduction so go ahead and
drag that on video three because you
know we really don't want to mess with
video two right now and now let's go
ahead and play this so by default
pictures play for five seconds and then
they stop okay
so let's go ahead and check that out in
the program monitor again it just plays
and then it cuts to the video not that
interesting so what I want to do is I
actually want this to fade in and fade
out so go ahead and the effect controls
we're going to mess with the opacity of
this title so go ahead and expand
opacity and again make sure you have
your title selected if you have
something else selected it's going to
change the opacity of that so you
definitely don't want to do that so I'll
do the fade in for about a second and a
half so about a second and a half in I'm
going to change it to a hundred percent
then at zero zero zero I'm going to
change it to zero so between zero and a
second and a half is going to go it's
going to fade in just like that and now
for the last second I'm going to go
ahead and change this to a hundred
percent and have it fade out to zero so
now whenever I play it the title fades
in stays at 100 and then it fades out to
zero so now that I'm looking at it I
kind of like how it fades into the video
just like that but whenever the title is
fading in
it's kind of weird seeing that
background video for kind of you know a
second and a half I wish that it kind of
faded in from black so we have a couple
options of doing that again what I'm
trying to say is I really don't like how
it fades in and you see us in the
background but I do like when the title
fades out that it goes into the video so
we need to change this beginning section
right here where you can see the title
and us so again like I said we have a
couple options what we can do first is
we can go to this video and for the
opacity we can change this to 100 and
right before we can change it to zero so
if we go ahead and we hide this title
what happens is the video is black and
then it suddenly pops up to 100 or there
is a better method we can go ahead and
let me go ahead and delete these
keyframes so our video is normal there
aren't any keyframes on this what we can
do is add something called a black video
and a black video is exactly that it's a
video of no sound just plain black
screen so in order to get one of those
you can either create a black picture
like in Photoshop or something and
import it or hit new item black video
and it's going to say pretty much do you
want a black video and we're going to
say yeah of course we want a black video
that's what we just told you so go ahead
and drag this out on the second one on
the second track right there and now
check it out whenever we fade in it now
fades in from black instead of having us
in the background we now fade in from
black give us us a much more
professional look however I said I only
want to fade in that way I don't want to
fade out that way whenever I fade out I
do want to fade into us talking so what
I can do is just go ahead and take that
black video and move it so it stops
halfway through so now when we're fading
in we have the flat excuse me we have
the black video behind it so check it
out in my program as we're fading in we
fade in from black
and then when it's at 100 it fades back
in to the video so that's how I do my
podcast if you were wondering about that
little trick on any of my recent
podcasts you can check out and yes that
is how I do my awesome introductions and
now to end my podcast here's what I do
it's a lot more simple I just go ahead
and drag that title out there and now
let me go ahead and zoom in to the end
again you want to make sure that it
snaps to the ending point so your video
in your title is synced up with the end
now again all I need to do is since we
don't need a black background for this
I'm going to go ahead and select my
title and for the opacity of this about
I don't know I want to say a second in
or so hit 100 and then make it fade in
from zero so it goes from zero to 100
just like that and now let me go ahead
and play like the last ten seconds see
that and now you don't need a black
background behind that because this is
totally opaque so that is why sometimes
whenever you have a buffer in between
like a video you want to add that black
video and sometimes you don't so that's
how I fade in and fade out my
introductions on the podcast so if you
want to use that technique can if you
have an alternative technique feel free
to use that too so you're saying all
right I watch this video over and over
again probably the best video ever
recorded and ever made on YouTube so now
how do I get the finished product if I
go ahead and hit file and save that's
just going to go ahead and save this
entire project I want a final video well
here's what you need to do go ahead and
hit file export media and this is pretty
much saying all right how do you want to
save your video do you want to say that
this flash file is a move avi
the best format for YouTube is this f4v
and it's this 1280 by 720 in it your
highest
settings you can so it's going to be
1280 by 720 any video that you have that
sixteen by nine is going to fit
awesomely and YouTube player and of
course the bitrate is pretty much how
much quality is it on your video so you
want that as high as possible anyways
there's a preset on f4 v that's 1280 by
720 with a 4500 bitrate and that's going
to give you awesome quality so now you
just go ahead and hit export and that's
going to go ahead and take this final
video and turn it into a video that you
can low to YouTube because right now you
can't just go ahead and load this
project on the YouTube because this is
an Adobe project it's not like a final
video so that's why you need to export
it into a final video so again there's a
lot of weird settings in this export
that we can go over but for the purposes
of this tutorial I just want to give you
guys a real quick and dirty way to do
things so that's what you choose and
again if you want to name it something
different go ahead and output name you
can name it whatever you want here so
that is how you're going to do that I'm
not going to go ahead and export it
because it takes like two minutes to
process and I really don't have time to
sit here and talk about nothing for two
minutes so for now thank you guys for
watching it and don't forget subscribe
and I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
