ninth of JavaScript tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm going to be talking to you
guys about something called the return
statement so sometimes like before we
made a function and it just did
something it either printed text out on
the screen or it made a pop-up appear or
you know it just did something but
sometimes you want the function to
return a value to you so this is
especially useful whenever you're making
a calculation and you pass in two
numbers as a parameter for example arm
20 and 10 and you say multiply these
together and it multiplies them and it
returns the value to you or in other
word it performs the calculation and it
returns the answer to you so sometimes
you can see you just need functions do
something like print out something on
the screen or pop up a text box and
sometimes you need to perform a
calculation and give you back the value
and whenever you need the value in
return we need to use something called
the return statement so let's go ahead
and make the most basic function we can
with the most basic return function so
let's go ahead and name function and
let's go ahead and name this to Easi
because this is going to be extremely
easy not even going to take any
parameters and let's go ahead and just
return any value let's return on just
some text game time so now whenever we
call this function to easy and try to
run it nothing happens because by
default as you can see we didn't tell it
to do anything we didn't tell it to
print it out on screen we didn't tell it
to you know use it in an alert box we
just said give us this value back and
with that value we didn't even do
anything with it so in order to use that
return value you actually have to use it
somehow so for example if you're right
document dot right and then inside here
you call your function to easy what's
going to do is it's going to take this
function right here and it's going to
say all right for this function you want
me to return the text game time so
whenever you gave me the function I'm
substitute the return value which is
game time so then I'm going to print out
aka document.write game time so it's
basically saying r-right this function
is basically equal to the return value
so when I say document right too easy
it's going to calculate this and figure
that the answer is game time now this
might be a little difficult to
understand so what I decided to do is
make a function teaching you guys how to
add two numbers add one number and
another number and give you you know
basic addition and I know that I didn't
talk to you guys about any of the math
operators or how you can use algebra
with you know JavaScript but it's going
to be really simple to understand a lot
more simple than that example so let's
go ahead and make another function and
just call it add numbers and it's going
to take two parameters it's going to
take a and B and inside here let's go
ahead and make another variable called C
and this will just be the sum of a plus
B so now if you pass it like number
three and for C would it be equal to
seven because it's going to add a and B
and store it in the variable C so now
what we want to do is we want to return
C so now later on when we're programming
and we go ahead and write add numbers
let's go ahead and pass it like three
and six whenever we call this nothing is
going to happen because this is just the
value of nine we didn't tell it to print
out nine on the screen we didn't tell it
to print out nine in an alert box it
just is the value of nine and just
sitting there in our program pretty much
like a waste of space so let's go ahead
save this and see what happens
nothing so let's go ahead and actually
take this and cut it and now let's go
ahead and write document dot right and
inside that paste let me get rid of that
semicolon put at the end paste that
function add numbers and now it says all
right the function add numbers three and
six is basically equal to the value of
nine so what do you want me to do with
that nine oh you want me to write it out
on the screen now I see so we go ahead
and save
this in refresh that is why we get the
value of nine on the screen so again a
return value isn't really useful unless
you do something with it and as you can
see clearly in this example we called
the value three as a and B is six and it
said 3 plus 6 is 9 so that's why I'm
going to return nine to you so anyways
the expression at number is three and
six it basically looks at this and says
nine so that's why it wrote nine out on
the screen so basically whenever you
call a function it's basically looking
at it and trying to figure out what's
the return value and then takes that
return value and does whatever you want
to it so that is the basics of a return
value again I know I didn't even teach
you guys that you can add variables but
hey you can whenever there number it
adds them together so that's a little
glimpse into the future but for now
that's all I want to cover so thank you
guys for watching this tutorial
in the next tutorial probably going to
be talking more about functions but for
now thank you for watching don't forget
to subscribe and I'll see you next
