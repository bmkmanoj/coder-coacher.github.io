farm and I asked him about sex he sort
of smiled and said maybe instead of
telling you what sex is why don't we go
out to the horse pasture and I'll show
you so we did and there on the ground
were my parents having sex Jack Handey
deep thoughts you son will be every time
so anyways I know what you guys are
thinking Bucky that's great and all but
shouldn't you be teaching us about like
else/if or something well yes and no you
see now on with the tutorial in the last
tutorial I taught you guys about
else--if and it's a really neat syntax
very very handy so handy in fact and so
commonly used they even though it's
incredibly simple objective-c made an
even simpler way to test multiple values
and conditions and stuff like that so
quite often you have a variable and you
want to test what it's equal to so for
example you have H you want to test if
it's equal one two three four five six
seven eight nine ten so on and so on
well you want to do something different
for each age that it's equal to so you
can do if else if else if else if else
or you can do something called a switch
now what a switch does is it doesn't
whip you like you know some people think
or it doesn't turn on the lights on
enough no not that kind of switch either
what it does is it takes a variable
which is also called like a condition I
think or an expression sorry it's a
variable and it tests against several
different values and depending on the
value it has a certain statement XQ so
you know enough of me talking you know
let's just go ahead and get building
this program is just talking about so
put it age equals like three or
something
actually that's but two I like to a lot
better in three so we can if we want to
test what H is equal to even though we
already know what is equal to
say we didn't know what it is equal to
we want to make a program to do
something different for the numbers like
one to four and then if it's not either
of those do something else so let's go
ahead and in order to test one variable
what we do is do this we would put
switch and now you can see the outline
for right now now for expression you
write what variable do you want to test
in the different cases are the different
things it can be equal to the constant
would be the thing that didn't change
like 1 2 3 or 4 and the default would be
the thing that if you enter like 99 if
all your cases didn't get mesh then what
do you want your programming do by
default so if it like test 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 in
your N or 99 spike what's after I do now
you got to give us something to do and
break what do these breaks mean well
after you test it and it comes across a
positive result that actually matches
you don't want it to keep testing all
the other results because you already
found your answer so that's where break
comes in what break means is our a I'm
gonna break out this program I already
found my answer if you didn't and say
you enter to age for one you don't need
to test three four or five if you didn't
have that break it would test three four
or five six seven eight nine ten so why
do you put a break in I mean what's the
harm
well it takes a lot of your memory in
more time to execute if if you just find
your answer and exit the switch it saves
a lot of time in memory that's all I'm
gonna say so let's go ahead and get
building this program now that I gave
you guys a background you can actually
see a program in use so switch let's go
ahead and test age now let's go ahead
and your brackets because we're gonna be
executing more than one code let's see
in case age is equal to one and go ahead
and put semicolon and again one is your
constant what do you wanted to do NS log
um let's go ahead and put something
stupid one
what if H is equal to one day our cute
this is like a baby test or something
one hmm it's pretty cute and now we want
to break if
we came across one in age was equal one
no need to test two three four and five
and six we already find our answer let's
break out of the switch so it would
execute their queue and break so let's
go ahead and do this a couple times
let's see copy two three four
that would good so let's go ahead and
test if H is equal to 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 so in
the case of 2 if H is equal to 2 right
they are two really terrible twos in the
case of 3 right they are thirsty or
something 33 I don't know what to call
them and therefore I don't know just
right therefore you get nothing
especially for 4 kid so now what this
program is going to do is we already
gave it a condition to test it tests age
and by that we mean switch age and
what's which means is all right can give
you a block of code in a bunch of cases
whatever age is equal to do that bed of
code sir if it's equal to 1 do this bit
of code if it's equal to 3 do this bit
of code if it's equal to 4 do this bit
of code but now your computer programs
like alright I'm going to test this but
if it's not equal to 1 2 3 or 4 you got
to give me something to do well that's
what we're gonna do right now whenever
it tests all of its cases and it still
hasn't found his answer we need to give
it a default program to run right there
and in order to do that just go ahead
and write default and let's give it
something to run default and a slog but
like that isn't a kid it's a FN teenager
you know I gotta make it kind of
dramatic and then break out of that so
let's go ahead and run this and maybe
you'll see what's going on so build and
run save all and the age of two they are
terrible like that now let's go ahead
and change it so what happened well let
me change just one more time change this
to three build and run save now H is
equal to three and it says they are
thirsty and I forgot to T so what
happens is you have a variable named age
in it's equal three switch age means
test the H variable so it test it and it
says in the case of one if ages one do
this well it wasn't it said they are
thirsty not they are cute in the case of
to do this
was it to know in the case of three do
this they are thirsty so that's why your
program executed the code they are
thirsty because it tested this tested
this and tested this and it says all
right it is actually three so that's why
I'm going to execute this bit of code
and then once I'm done I'm gonna break
out of it no need to even test this or
this I already found my answer it's time
to take a break run on to my next bit of
computer program ago and again let me
just show you guys if it's not one two
three four put like ninety nine it's
gonna run the default and it's gonna say
that isn't kid it's F and teenager ah so
you know that's what the default is for
if all your key cases are wrong it has
to run something by default so that's
the basics of a switch in what it does
and again the else if is useful when
you're testing like a condition less
than greater than and a switch is really
useful when you're testing if a variable
is exactly equal to like one exactly
equal to three
not like between the range of three and
eight so that's your basis of switch
like I said I hope enjoying my program
don't forget to subscribe and don't
forget to check my blog and that's it
enough of me talking I'll see you next
