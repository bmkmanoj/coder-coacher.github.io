very first tutorial in advanced game
development using the UDK now a lot of
you guys already watched my beginner
series in the UDK and for those of you
who have not I strongly recommend you go
check out that series it gives you
basically an introduction to the core
concepts behind UDK and this year's
right here is gonna be for the more
advanced stuff so I didn't want to put
it all in one series so that's why I
decided to split it up but for those of
you who have completed my series welcome
back for those of you who just you know
our heart hunted and you guys decided
that you are not gonna watch my beginner
series then let me introduce myself my
name is Bucky Roberts and yeah that's my
introduction there you go that's all you
get so anyways like I said this tutorial
series is for more the advanced concepts
concerning the UDK so we're gonna be
starting in this story which is working
with physics objects so in this tutorial
what I'm gonna be doing is well in the
last story what we did is we basically
learned how to add things like static
meshes which are basically just you know
plain old walls or things that don't
move now in order to make something move
we learned about something called
matinee and you know this was if you
have a door that you bump into you can
open it or if you want to play a simple
animation you can do that but it really
didn't provide an incredibly interactive
gaming environment so that's what I'm
going to be teaching I said doing this
story through the use of physics objects
now let me display what a physics object
is real quick or let me talk you guys
through if you have like a box or you
know say a tank or a piece of wood in
your game you can go ahead and shoot it
but if it was a static mesh it would
just stay there wouldn't move but in
real life if you shot at you do you know
and move around bounce around that's
what we're gonna be doing in this story
all right here so with all my talking
let me go ahead and shut up and finally
show you guys how to do this so go ahead
and open the content browser and clear
everything out by hitting all assets X
and clear and you're gonna want to go
ahead and search for static meshes now
I'm just gonna go ahead and narrow it
down by dqo right there
and let me go ahead and find a good one
that we can use something not too big
because we're gonna be shooting it
myself statue that was pretty cool but
we already use it this one looks pretty
neat see how excited I got there I think
I got a little overexcited when I saw
that statue but okay so here is how you
turn a static mesh into a physics object
the very first thing you need to do is
double-click it and then its properties
are gonna pop up and let me just go
ahead and shrink this a little bit there
we go so the very first thing we need to
do is we need to add a collision in mesh
I guess you could call guess you could
call I guess you could call it so if we
go ahead and click this button it shows
the collision and that's a nice
collision mesh but we want something
even more simple because the more simple
your collision mesh is the faster its
gonna load during game time so this is
actually a pretty good one right here
but if you go ahead and up the collision
you change it to six dlp simplified
collision and go ahead and replace it
it's gonna give you the most basic
collision and for this tutorial since
I'm just demonstrating you know we're
not really making a real advanced game
I'm just demonstrating what collision is
this works a little bit better than that
more advanced collision so if you have a
mesh that doesn't even have collision
that's how you would add it just going
up to this collision drop box down here
and choosing a collision in hitting yes
now that's all you really need to do but
another thing we might want to do is
change the mass scale now if you hover
over it says it basically is the amount
of mass in it so by default it's 1 but
if we go ahead and change that like to
0.25 then this object becomes less
massive so why would we want to change a
mass for example whenever we shoot it in
the mass is 1 it's gonna move around a
little bit but if it's less massive
whenever we shoot it it's really gonna
move around since you know it's a lot
easier to move when an object is a less
massive so though we're those are the
two properties that we really need to be
concentrating on so once we got that
taken care of just go ahead and hit X
and we are good to go
however we probably want to make sure
that we saved this so if we go ahead and
right-click
fine package we can just go ahead and
find this package and save it and we
should be good to go oh it's gonna take
a long time to save Aria let me see if I
have a story to tell you guys nope I
don't so now that this object is saved
we can finally add it to our screen so
go ahead and make sure you have this
object selected and we can actually just
go ahead and X out of this content
browser and since we have that object
selected all we need to do is
right-click anywhere on a screen and hit
add rigid body and it's going to add our
rigid body right there so now we got our
new and improved static mesh with all
our physics properties added to our
gaming environment however it's not
complete yet what we need to do is with
it selected go ahead and hit f4 on your
keyboard and what this does is it brings
up the properties for this KA actor and
by the way I probably didn't mention
this but the KA actor is different than
a regular static mesh because a KA actor
is basically in objects that has physics
properties applied to it so static mesh
like this wall over here we can shoot it
but it's not going to move or anything
since you know it's just a static meshes
its purpose is to stay there and not
move our vis ka actor whenever we shoot
it's gonna move bounce around do a bunch
of cool stuff so what we need to do is
we need to make sure we have selected
wake on level start this basically means
as soon as our level starts then it's
going to start acting like a physics
object so of course that's what we want
they should probably have this selected
by default so you know if anyone's
watching out there from you know the
Unreal company you know you might want
to look into that so anyways just go
ahead and hit X and now this is good go
this is going to be active as soon as
the level starts however for the
purposes of this tutorial what I'm gonna
be doing is I'm just gonna be
right-clicking and hitting add static
mesh so now we have something to compare
it to a physics statue and a regular
static mesh that you so let me go ahead
and rebuild everything just because I
haven't built everything in a while so
want to make sure everything's up to
date and then once it's built I'll give
you guys a demonstration of just it's
not bad not bad so close and hit play
from here now check it out whenever I
shoot this one
that's my static mesh it isn't movement
but whenever I shoot this one oh look at
him go flying
oh and he's yep you fell off the edge
there but that's basically a difference
between adding a static mesh and the KA
actor which basically is well a static
mesh that you can shoot and move around
definitely a lot cooler so there you go
there you guys have a physics object
introduction so if you didn't quite
understand what you know something about
this Oreo trust me just watch the
upcoming tours and I'm gonna be covering
everything I covered in more detail and
definitely give you guys a better
understanding of physics objects so we
definitely have a lot of work to go
concerning physics and also advanced
game development and I'm looking forward
to it so thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
you guys in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
