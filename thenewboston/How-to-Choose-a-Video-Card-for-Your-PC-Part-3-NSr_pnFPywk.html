across is something called the GPU now
this isn't the CPU a GPU stands for
graphical processing unit and it's the
processor in your video card now there
are two different main types of makers
of GPUs just like AMD and Intel make
CPUs the two major types that are
fighting in everett now are called a TI
and end video it says envy I dia I say
nvidia I don't know how you really say
that's how I said and just like um AMD
and Intel different people think oh one
is better than the other i recommend
nvidia just cuz i do i like them better
but they're pretty much the same thing
and they offer awesome products no
matter who you choose so i just keep an
eye out for that another thing now that
we're talking about the GPU manufacturer
is the GPU speed and of course just like
a regular processor or CPU a GPU the
faster the speed is going to offer a
faster processor and therefore a faster
performance of your video card so again
you want to choose pci express 2.0 m16
ati or nvidia it doesn't really matter
and you want to go for the highest GPU
speed that you can afford and lastly the
one other major thing you want to look
for when buying a video card is the
memory now all video cards come with
built-in memory and what the memory does
is is holds the data for the GPU so
whenever the processor wants access it
it's right there it's right there quick
and fast so again more memory you have
built into your video card the faster
and better performance that your video
card is going to be so a really um a
decent video card has about five twelve
and a really good video card has about a
gig and anything bigger than that is
just incredible so um again just the
overview recap one
last time you don't want to really get
an AGP you don't really want to get a
PCI Express you want to look for a pci
express 2.0 x 16 you want um a GPU ati
or nvidia you're going to have two
choices just pick one whatever you think
is better the GPU speed is one thing you
want to look for the higher the speed
the better performance and the memory
that comes built in with your video card
so those are some things that you want
to look for when buying the video card
if you follow this tutorial instructions
you should be all set buying a sweet
video card that's compatible with your
motherboard so thank you for watching
keep sending me those questions make
sure you go to my site the New Boston
calm if you have any questions I'll
ansel them our I will answer them for
you there excuse me so again thank you
for watching and I will see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
