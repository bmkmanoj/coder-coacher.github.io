tutorial that I'm making for them in
Boston and in this tutorial I'm maybe
showing you on how to use ternary
operator so all you're going to need for
this tutorial is a button and a checkbox
alright and under the button one click
here you're four lines of code the first
line of code this creates a new string
the second line in the if statement
checking to see whether or not checkbox
one is checked and if it is checked then
my string would be equal to its check
otherwise else my string will be equal
to it's not checked and then it just
displayed that string in a message box
so if we debug here since this is not
checked we should get a message box
saying it's not checked
yep but if it is checked you should get
a message box saying it is here it's
checked yeah so instead of having these
three lines of Erb these three lines of
code right here we could use ternary
operator and I'm just going to go ahead
and comment this out and in order to do
that you're just going to go for this
little tool bar up here and click these
I guess this lines right here and just
says comment out the selected lines and
that was make it so that the compiler
just skips right over you vonda throat
so we could type literally anything
anything you wanted and it won't give us
an area alright so now we're going to
use ternary operators so first we're
just going on create string my string
and we're going to set that equal to
first we're just going to put two
parentheses and inside of this
parenthesis we're going to want to put
what we want to be evaluated we're going
to evaluate if checkbox one is detractor
and then following that we're in a lot
put a question mark now after the
question mark we're going to want to
type out what we want it to do if this
is true so we're going to have my string
be equal to its check
and they're going to want to put a colon
and after that you're going to want to
type what you want my string to be equal
to if whatever evaluated in here is
false so in other words that would be
our else so we're just gonna type out
it's not checked so once again my string
would be equal to either this or this
depending on what this is so if this is
true inside of here then it will be true
and then it will do this code if this is
false inside of here then it will do
this code and you don't have to just use
rules like you could say like if I don't
know button 1 dot txt equals something
it doesn't have to just be a pool
all right so now this should do the
exact same thing as what this did before
so now when you bug we should get um
it's not checked yep and when we check
it we show you the message box saying it
is checked yeah you can also use this
you could just pass this through as a
parameter in here you wouldn't even need
this my string we could just take this
code right here copy it and paste it
right in there and not even use this
string the only downside to this is it
makes it a little bit harder to read but
if you get used to this enough it's not
really that big of an issue so now we
only have one line of code which makes
it even cleaner yet it's not checked we
check it it's checked so that's pretty
quick but that's all it really is the
ternary operator like I said before
though this law will cut down on the
readability if you're not used to
ternary operator then you can just use
the if statement however this will make
your code less lines which is always
what you're aiming towards as a
programmer so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
