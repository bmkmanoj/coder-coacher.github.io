of your polymorphism tutorial and in
this tutorial we're going to be going
over a building well you know what who
cares what we're going to be going over
you guys just want to get into it so
let's go ahead and hopefully watch the
last story because if you didn't you're
going to have no idea what's going on so
let's go ahead and import our two
classes numsa header and you also want
to go ahead and import the other class
of course I mean why wouldn't you and
that is chars header and now we can
since we import them we can go ahead and
create objects from this class so nums
let's just go ahead and make an object
called n or you can name it gary you
know whatever you want it's up to you
and go ahead and put noms Alec in it
save me some space for this and now
let's go ahead and just copy that whole
thing and paste right like that so this
is chars and we'll name this object C
and there should be a hotkey for that
too so I don't have to type that out
every time because you know that's
pretty common thing so you know who's
ever right in Xcode just take that note
so now since we have objects we can go
ahead and add the method so the first
thing we need to do is um call N and
remember we have set numbers in we have
two parameters we have to pass it 8 now
10 you can put any numbers you want so
now that we have those two variables we
can go ahead and add those together so n
add and it's going to add 8 and 10
together and now we can go ahead and
print it out so n print pretty cool so
this is going good so far so now let's
go ahead and use some methods from that
charge class go go ahead and put C set
char's I think that was how you spell it
and remember this set char one to be in
character to W so now let's just go
ahead and add those together and now
let's just go ahead and print those
babies out see print so now we're done
with everything let's just go ahead and
release our memory because we don't need
it anymore and let's just go ahead and
run save everything and we'll see we got
it'll didn't look like we get any errors
and the first thing it says I am from
the numbers class biatch and we put 18
that's the result of adding two numbers
and this is a result of adding two
characters and this is the print so what
is kind of the point of this tutorial
now that I just typed a bunch of stuff
well the beauty of polymorphism is this
you see that we have two separate
objects which are of course from two
separate classes yet however they're
from different classes they have the
same method names ADD and current yet
whenever we try to use add in print it
doesn't get confused that our am I
supposed to be adding from the
characters class or numbers class on the
print class or the character class
numbers class what am I supposed to be
doing I only have one method name but
yeah I know which one to use
so polymorphism is this plain and simple
trust me it's a lot easier than you
thought objects from different classes
and and see in this case or numbers and
characters class can have methods that
share the same name but do different
things so for example add an add share
the same name but they can do different
things in print and print share the same
name but they can do different things so
both classes contained add and print
methods same exact names but they did
different things and why is this
possible
well polymorphism because first of all
and
second because whenever you use a see
object it knew that it was from the
characters class thinks to this and
whenever you use an end object a knew
that it was from the numbers class
thanks to this little declaration right
here so whenever you called a method on
n it automatically looked in the numbers
class to find that method and if the
method wasn't there then it would get an
error so by the declaration that's how
it knows what methods to use you were
saying that's all polymorphism is yes
that's all polymorphism is it's really
simple I mean there are a couple other
tweaks and couple other things you need
to know about it but like the core of
polymorphism that's all it is the fact
that you can have different classes with
the same method name in each class so
that's that for this tutorial I'm sorry
it wasn't more confusing than that but I
mean you know if you want something
confusing then you know just go figure
out Rubik's Cube or something so thank
you guys for watching if you want all
