illustrator cs6 tutorial my name is
buddy Blackford today we're gonna start
using the character panel here to adjust
some of the type it that we have going
on so for this video I'm just going to
go ahead and use an area type tool and I
just made it within this star and we'll
just use that for now and if you want to
follow along and make it you can do an
area type tool one or you can just do
any you can just do a plain old type
tool if you want to so want to make a
little interesting but anyway let's go
ahead and get started now you're going
to want to use your selection tool and
you're going to want to have your your
type object selected and you're going to
want to go to window and then go to type
and go to character once you click on it
it brings up this panel now we've got
the way to change our text so we could
change the text to something different
if we wanted to I want to keep it what
it was I think and and then we've got
our style to here and here we have the
leading and I wanted to talk about
leading a little bit because I'm not
everybody knows what it is so leading is
the distance from the UM the baseline of
one line to the baseline of the next
line and its measured in points as you
can see points there and pretty much if
you see these blue lines here now those
are going to be the baselines and much
when I start moving the leading up what
happens and you can see they're going up
and down and if I go the other way now
I'm getting into the other side you can
see now how different is and they were
coming together or texas coming together
closer the other way was going farther
apart so i'm going to set it back to
like 80 because i think that's what
around what it was at and that's a
pretty self explanatory now it's just
you've seen what it does it just
pretty much brings the baselines
together or pulls them apart now let's
go on to the next thing I wanted to
mention that leading is only apply to
horizontal type so if you want to change
the vertical spacing in your type you're
going to have to adjust the tracking so
next thing I want to talk about is
turning now kerning is the amount of
space between each individual character
they type so sometimes the space between
two characters is larger than others and
it makes the word look uneven if you're
really messing with your type and want
to make it look really nice you know you
can go in and use the character panel to
change the kerning settings to either
space them out farther or put them
closer together and i'll show you that
now so the kerning is right here where
has the v /a and right now it's at auto
if i wanted to select the entire object
with the selection tool i can know auto
or zero you can put it on there we go
and now it has been changed so i can put
it on auto or zero and if i click on
auto here or zero down here instead of
having to type it in you can see the
difference now if you want to start
spacing out the individual letters go
ahead and go to your type tool and put
it in between two letters and you can
start spacing out some of the letters
and you can see that they're all spacing
out at the same time on this line and if
I select them you can see that it
doesn't expand just between two of them
it's going to expand the whole entire
line so if i bring this kerning and it's
going to start bringing everything
closer together all right could you just
use my presets
that's a hundred and then this is a
negative hundred in now you can see the
difference okay OTO so if you want to
bring two characters closer together or
further away then that's how you go
about that and the last thing that I
want to go over is tracking and tracking
is down here where has the VA and a at
the box and what tracking is is it's the
adjustment of space between three or
more characters so pretty much you
usually like track a line of type or a
few words and it depends on what like
how your design is going and everything
like that so if I wanted to go ahead and
select all this here and adjust the
tracking I can bring start bringing the
whole thing closer so that it now ends
up on one line or I could adjust the
tracking to go up higher space it out so
that I have it going over multiple lines
let's see i don't know if i can get it
to go three lines no I can't well unless
I start going crazy with it well kind of
almost got it but if I were to measure
that I could get this onto three lines
but you can see the the letters are a
lot spaced out so maybe you would want
to go in and set your kerning and that
would bring the letters back in together
just uh something you can mess with and
how you can use these together and then
M if you didn't notice this is the last
part right here that's the font size and
I'm sure everybody really knows what the
pretty much knows what the font size is
already because I've gone over multiple
times and you use it and all kind of
things but it just makes it your text
bigger and smaller so that's it for this
tutorial then in the next section woke
over some more of the advanced options
if you click on this section here and
you go to show options there's more
things that we can do and we'll go over
those in the next tutorial so stay tuned
everybody have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
