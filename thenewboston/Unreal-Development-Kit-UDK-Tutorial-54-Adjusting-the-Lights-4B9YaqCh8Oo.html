udk tutorial in this tutorial what I'm
going to be doing is I'm basically going
to be adjusting a lot of the lights and
getting them ready for us to program in
kismet so by default check this out we
have to enter pack ters and basically
this is the one we're going to see first
before we blow it out this is you know
just enter back there with some emissive
properties some light is pulsating right
from there but if we go ahead and we
switch to lip view there isn't really
any actual light coming from this is
just you know a material basically that
glows so we want to give the appearance
that some light is popping out here kind
of like a flashlight so then they look a
lot cooler whenever we blow it up so in
order to do that I'm just going to go
ahead and add a spotlight right in front
of it so let me go ahead and remember in
order to do this go up to view browser
windows actor classes and now under
lights go ahead and look for spotlight
and spotlight toggle make sure it says
toggle because then we can turn on and
off it's going to be on by default and
then whenever we shoot it with our gun
it's going to turn off give it the
appearance that we're blowing it out so
now let's go ahead and X out here and
now that you have it selected go ahead
and right-click in your perspective view
and you should be able to select add
spotlight toggle here now by default
it's facing towards the ground so if you
go ahead and your front view we can go
ahead and rotate that so it's pointing
outwards and we also want to adjust that
using our move tool make sure you have
your light selected and move it right
and front right about there and also
this is actually positioned pretty good
in my side view so now there is light
coming from this inter factor however
it's kind of hard to see right now and
you may be wondering know why the reason
for that is not because we added it
wrong or anything like that it's because
we already have a point light right here
you can see that in my top view and it's
really powerful so the first thing I
want to do is hit f4 and change the
radius of this so
if i go to light mass or excuse me point
light component I can bring down the
radius a tidbit I want to bring them
down to like 750 somewhere around there
and okay let me zoom out a little bit so
okay I don't really like that let me
bring up the radius just a tidbit to
like close to a thousand and I'm also
going to be moving it over here alright
so that looks pretty good so now I got
my point light kind of out of the way so
now you can see that that spotlight is
indeed illuminating the area in front of
it but however I do want to boost the
brightness just a little bit in my
spotlight so if I go ahead and select
that spotlight and go ahead and hit f4
and now the brightness of the spotlight
I can go ahead and pump up and if you've
looked in my perspective view you can
saw that that spotlight did indeed get a
little bit brighter so now let me go
ahead and the very first thing I want to
do before I forget just go ahead and
build my lights might as well just go
ahead and build everything and I don't
have any many stories to tell you guys
this time I'm sorry so we're just going
to have to wait in silence so let me go
ahead and close and hit play from here
and now you can see with that point
light radius taken down a bit and moved
out of the way and the brightness of the
spotlight pumped up it now looks like a
nice spot light is coming from this
static mesh or interp actor right there
so that's the effect we're going for so
then it's going to look really cool
whenever we shoot it and blow it out so
however before we just go ahead and jump
into that first of all I want to hop
over to unlit mode because we already
know that our light set up properly so
we can go ahead and hop over to on limo
just to see everything a little bit
easier what I want to do is in case you
guys frack free out or in case I didn't
even tell you guys I'm going to start
the level with this light showing and
then I'm going to blow it out and then I
want to have this slowly up here because
remember this light has the emissive
light properties on it in this light is
pretty much our dull blowing out
so by default I want to start the level
with this light hidden so go ahead and
double-click it and under display you're
going to have this hidden checkbox now
you're going to want to go ahead and
select this and whenever you do whenever
you play your level this light is going
to be hidden now I know it doesn't hide
it whenever you're designing it but
trust me whenever you play your level
it's going to be hidden now the next
thing I want to do is this let me go
ahead and try to explain it let me go
ahead and hit play from here and if you
look that static mesh is indeed hidden I
know it's a little bit dark to see but
trust me it's hidden another thing I
want to point out is whenever we shoot
this I know it's kind of hard to see but
my bullets are going right through that
static mesh and it doesn't look
realistic it's just kind of going right
through that static mesh and we actually
need the bullets to collide with that
static mesh or else it'll never take
damage so let me go ahead and actually
this is kind of bothering me that it's
not lit up exactly how you want it to
there we go check it out now we can see
both lights oh yeah that's nice right
there so anyways what I'm going to be
doing is I'm going to be changing the
collision properties of that light
that's lit up as soon as this dumb thing
ends so in order to do that go ahead and
select your static mesh or excuse me
enter back to right there and hit f4 and
under collision right now you can see
that the collision type is no collision
what this means is that if you bump into
it with your player it's going to be
able to run right through if you shoot
it with a gun the bullets are going to
go right through it so how can this take
damage and how can we blow it up our
bullets are going just right through it
well it can so we need to change that
from no collision to block all what this
means is that anything is able to hit it
your player your bullets a sword your
fist a foot a tuna fish sandwich
anything so now let me just go ahead and
hit play from here one last
time and check it out now whenever we
shoot it our bullets are indeed bouncing
off it and turning that light black and
another thing if we noticed there is no
light right here it is indeed hidden so
what we're going to be doing in the next
tutorial is shooting this light blowing
out the game light and the properties
and switching this light with this light
right here and we're going to be doing
all in kids Matt I got whooping cough
going to be doing all in kismet it's
going to be awesome amazing absolutely
fantastic so I will see you guys in next
tutorial where we will be finishing up
