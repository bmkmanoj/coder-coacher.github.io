set it means that we have passed a
variable to this page called username
inside of the post variable set so we
can now redefine the username variable
dollar underscore post username now it's
important to note that because we're
querying a database and we're going to
be inserting this value into the query
we need to apply the relevant security
so we're going to apply MySQL real
escape string to this just to help
prevent SQL injection okay so now what
we want to do is we first of all want to
check if the username is not empty so we
use if not empty username then we want
to go ahead and do something so we want
to create a query that's going to return
a count of the amount of user names
where they match so we create a query
called username query and this is equal
to a MySQL query now the query is as
follows we want to select count and we
want to count a field from out our table
so I'm going to be counting user ID it
doesn't matter which field that you pick
it will just literally return a count so
I'm going to count select count user ID
from users remember our table is called
users and that's where user name so the
user name field just here is equal to
and then in single quotation marks
username so we're taking this value here
and passing it to this query here and
we're now going to check what the result
of this query is so this will return a
number now if the number is equal to 1
that means that the username exists in
the database assuming that we are
inserting unique records into the
database I generated some code that puts
760 thousand 768 unique records into
this table so what we don't have the
same username twice so as long as your
registration script or however you're
registering a user actually checks
beforehand that the username is unique
we'll only ever return a 0 or a 1 from
this query so we need to check first of
all if the query returns a 0 or 1 and we
need to grab a result for that so I'm
gonna say use name result that's equal
to MySQL result we need to supply two
parameters here the original query and
the rhone the row count so or the row
that we're referencing which is 0
because it will return one row which is
row 0 with the count we now need to
create a simple if statement in fact
what we'll do is we'll go ahead and just
echo this user name result out now let's
go ahead over to our main page and I'm
going to go ahead and type Alex
now that's return a 0 automatically so
this is echoing out this here which is
equal to a 0 let's go over to our
database table and find a value here
we've got Alex 840 so what happens if I
type Alex 8 4 0 we then return a 1 and
that means that this username is taken
inside of here we've got Alex 840 just
here we can try this with all of the
other records as well it doesn't matter
in Laura's return a 1 so we can go ahead
for example and say Dayo 1 4 8 1 and we
could type in AO 8 I forgot the number a
1 8 1 4 8 1 so 1 4 8 1 and that will
return a 1 as well because that's taken
so now what we can do is we can create
an if statement just to check this
number and then we can return the
appropriate textual representation of
what we are I've just discussed the
overall concept so if username result is
equal to 0 which means that the username
isn't taken we can echo
that will just say use the name
available else and we want to create
another condition if username result
equals one or is equal to one we want to
echo sorry that user name is taken okay
so now instead of a one of our or a zero
we've returned the appropriate textual
representation of the content we spoke
about so now what we can do is we can go
ahead and start to type I LP a LAX
I it's not returning anything let's just
check why that might be
oh sorry else if username result is
equal to 1 and again okay so now it says
use name available then I type Alex
let's go ahead and pick another one so
let's go for the shortest one I can
remember there's quite quite long ones
let's just go ahead and copy and paste
this one into here when we paste it in
sorry that username is taken so we have
successfully created a back-end piece of
code in username check PHP which checks
and returns these values jQuery handles
the event itself
it handles taking the value from this
and passing it to our username check
file and then it returns it into the
appropriate div or element on our page
which happens to be this span just next
to here so by implementing this into a
registration script is an easy way for
to allow the user to instantly see if a
particular username is available</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
