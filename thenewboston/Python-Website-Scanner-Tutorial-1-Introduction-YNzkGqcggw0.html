Roberts and in this video series I'm
going to be showing you guys how to
build a Python reconnaissance scanner so
essentially what this is is let's say
that you want to gather information
about a website for I don't know some
kind of security analyst shop well what
you can do is you can go in the terminal
and you can start gathering all this
stuff and it's going to take a long time
you know finding the IP address of the
website getting nmap scan the Whois the
robots.txt and this is what I actually
was doing up until a little bit ago and
I was like you know what every single
website that I scan that I want to get
info for I'm doing the same thing over
and over again so I might as well just
build a tool and Python that allows me
to do it all in one click so again what
this tool is going to do is allow you to
pretty much just type in the URL like
the New Boston com hit go and it grabs
all of the information for you so pretty
cool and again what we're going to be
doing is we're going to be scanning it
and all of the results actually was
thinking about how to store them do I
want to put them in the database and
then I was like and people probably
don't have like MySQL installed and
don't want to use Jason but then we got
to use that so I'm actually just going
to take all the results and just save
them to a text file but you guys can do
whatever you want and in order to do
that I'm actually going to make a new
Python file right now I don't just name
it
general Pi so inside here what I'm going
to do is I'm just going to make two
really simple functions make sure my
terminal is out of the way all right so
I'm just going to make two functions
real quick to first create a directory
and another one just to write a file so
then whenever we start building all of
our little tools then we can save the
results easily so I'm going to import OS
and by the way in order to follow this
tutorial you guys should be familiar
with Linux and also Python I think
that's pretty self-explanatory but I
want to get that out of the way so uh
yeah there you go there's my little
intro so the first one I'm just going to
write great derp so
so basically I want to make a function
to create directory because let's say
that we have a bunch of targets or
scanning a bunch of websites I want to
store all of the results in their own
directory so I'll have a directory for
the new boss then I'll have another
directory for eBay
I'll have another directory for YouTube
and that way we can organize all of our
targets or websites whatever you want to
call them so I'll just pass in the
directories name and now we have to
check if the directory already exists so
let's say we are scanning a list of 100
websites well maybe something happened
to our scanner halfway through and we
don't want to have to scan all those and
create them again so we're just going to
check if not OS dots path dot exists
right there and I'll just write
directory so we're basically going to
only create this folder if it's not
created yet simple enough so OS make
ders and directory so let's say we pass
in the new Boston it's going to say ok
did we create this folder yet no then
I'm going to create it if it's already
created then you don't have to do
anything that was the easiest function
in the world so this next one is just to
write the simple file so I'm just going
to call it write file and where do you
want to write it and what um you know
txt or whatever do you want in the file
so the first thing I'm going to do is
I'm just going to say open path in w-4
right and then we just write the data so
write data and close it boom roasted
there you go
so all this does is we're gonna pass in
the path essentially where we want to
write it what folder what location and
also what do you want in the file so you
know these are going to be either the
results of a scan and that's all we need
to do for
this general dot py file and now in the
next tutorial we're actually going to be
getting into the fun stuff and making
the actual tools</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
