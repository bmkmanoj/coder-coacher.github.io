tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial we're going
to begin our second project and now that
we know how to paint and draw you can
see sharp we're basically going to be
creating our own paint application
similar to Microsoft Paint so for this
tutorial you need to have a panel tool
strip with a label and a text box on it
and this is basically just so that the
user would be able to choose how thick
their pen is so if they want to make it
one then it'll just do one pixel thick
and basically by the end of this
tutorial we're going to have an
application that will allow us to click
and hold them hold down and move our
mouse it'll draw a line now there are a
couple different ways you can do this in
this tutorial I'm going to be showing
you the first way which isn't as good as
the second way but it's still not too
bad so first thing that you're going to
want to do is select your panel go over
to the events and go down to Mouse down
and what Mouse down is is basically
whenever the user holds their mouse down
or just puts it down so what we're going
to be doing is creating a pool and
setting that rule equal to true and the
user has their Mouse down but then when
the user releases their mouse it's going
to be set equal to false and then when
user moves their mouths we're going to
check to see if that pool is true and it
will be only true if the user has their
mouse down and then I fuse our heads our
mouse down according to that rule with
unreal paint so we're going to go up
here and create a new rule I'll call it
can paint and we'll set it equal to
false and then when user holds your
mouse down when you set that pool we put
the true so just a campaign equals true
and now we're going to want to study
equal to false when user picks their
mouse up so it's going to stay in Mouse
up now because they can paint equals
false alright so now that we have that
all set now we're going to check to see
when user needs their mouse so with our
panel selected again just go over to the
events and double click on mouse move
all right so now or we even start
painting we're going to check to see if
the user has their mouse down
if can paint then we will actually do
paint it now poor can paint you create
graphics to paint on we're actually
going to be creating these graphics up
here so that we can use them in other
methods now in this tutorial we're only
going to be using our graphics in this
method or a year but in following
tutorials we're going to use graphics in
multiple methods so instead of creating
graphics of the same graphics over and
over again we're just going to use the
same one we're going to go up here and
take graphics I'll say call it G and you
can't set equal to panel 1 up here so
we're going to set it equal to panel 1
inside of the constructor of our class
right here so it's going to say B equals
panel 1 dot create graphics
alright so now graphics is equal to or G
is equal to panel 1 dot create graphics
because it will do this as soon as the
form is created alright so first thing
that we're going to want to do is create
a brush to paint with so we're still a
solid brush s equals a new solid brush
and I'm just going to have the color be
black for right now but it really
doesn't matter you can set a equal to
anything and huge toriel's from now
we're going to be selecting or choosing
different colors or a lot of you to do
that
so right now to set equal to something
now we're actually going to be drawing
so we're going to draw a circle every
time that the user moves their mouse so
just a little circle so that when you
can use the mouse a lot it'll look like
a line so we're just going to say g dot
fill ellipse and then we're just going
to want to pass our brush through here
which is X and now every other time in
the drawing tutorials when we were like
drawing circles or something
we would always choose a location well
what we're going to be doing in this
tutorial is have the circle up here at
the user's cursor so in order to get the
position of the users purser we're going
to be using this mount Mouse event arcs
class so since it's called e you can
just do e dot do e dot X and this will
get the x coordinate of the mouse
so then what it's going to do eat out
why for this as well so now with these
two combined it basically is just the
coordinates of the cursor so now it will
create a small circle at the coordinates
of the cursor and for the width we're
going to have it be whatever pen side
user selects so it's a first dot two and
32 tool strip Xbox one text and we're
going to do the same thing for the
height so it'll be circle all right so
now that's all that we need for this
tutorial so let's debug and check to see
if this works so before it can even
begin painting we're going to the pen
size I was opposed to right now so now
when we click and hold down our mouse it
should begin drawing it will set the
bool can paint equal to true and then it
will check to see if it can paint and
since it can I'll create a little circle
each time you move your mouse so click
and hold and draw and as you can see it
makes a line but this line is very
broken up and if you move your mouse too
quickly it doesn't like to look at the
line in there so in the next tutorial
I'm going to show you a much better way
of drawing lines so that's pretty much
it for this tutorial so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
