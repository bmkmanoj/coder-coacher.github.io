physics lecture and in this lecture I'm
going to be clearing things up because
I'm going to discuss the units of force
now the rules for units of force is this
whenever you're trying to figure out the
force of something and you have your
mass that's measured in kilograms not
grams not anything else but kilograms
and your acceleration is going to be
measured in meters per second squared
then the end result or the force you
come up with is going to be something
called Newton's which is symbolized with
the N in physics now if you guys are
saying okay this is kind of hard for me
to picture how much force is exactly one
Newton is it a car hitting me is it the
force that you know maybe you're
throwing a baseball is that one Newton
well I know a Newton just picturing okay
kilograms meters per second it's kind of
hard to picture
so imagine it like this on earth
whenever you are holding a pound of
something in your hand
that's equal to four Newtons
so for Newton's equals one pound so what
exactly does this mean say you are
holding a one pound bottle of water
because wow that definitely does not
does not look like a bottle of water h2o
but say that you are holding a one pound
bottle of water 16 ounces this is
supposed to be your hand right here well
if this bottle of water was 16 ounces or
one pound then due to gravity the bottle
of water would be pushing down on your
hand with a force of four Newtons right
like that so basically on earth one
pound equals about four Newtons
so let's go ahead and you know enough
with my awesome drawing let's go ahead
and take a look at a word drum so just
remember this force which is measured in
Newtons is equal to mass times
acceleration so I have this big old
potato behind my house and this potato
weighs or has mass
should I say of six kilograms now me and
my friends thought it would be an
awesome idea to fling this potato
through the air with a potato gun that
we built
now this potato gun that we built it
kind of looks like this and it can exert
a force of 36 Newtons it's a pretty
powerful potato gun so what we wanted to
figure out is okay how fast can we get
this six kilogram potato to go with this
potato gun that that can exert a force
of thirty six new ends well we know we
had this formula force equals mass times
acceleration and we had the force which
was this right here and we had the mass
of the object or a potato which was six
kilograms so 36 Newtons
which would be the force equals the mass
which would be six kilograms times
acceleration and that's what we were
trying to figure out so in order to get
a alone or acceleration you divide both
sides by six by six and you come up with
the answer of six meters per second
squared so guys just remember this if
you have a potato that has a mass of six
kilograms and you built a potato gun
that is capable of flinging a potato 36
Newtons then you can get that sucker up
to a speed of six or velocity of six
meters per second so there you go
there's some potato gun building advice
and hopefully you guys understand the
units of force which is Newtons so
remember one more time whenever your
mass is measured in kilograms and your
acceleration is measured in meters per
second squared then your force is always
going to be equal to Newtons</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
