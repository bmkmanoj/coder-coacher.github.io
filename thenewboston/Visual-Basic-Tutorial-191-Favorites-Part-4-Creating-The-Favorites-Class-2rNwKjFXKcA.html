youtube.com slash on live gamer for the
new Boston and in this tutorial we're
going to continue working on our
favorites viewer application now before
we get started I just want to get folk
full credit to the authors of beginning
Microsoft Visual Basic 2008 I'm the
authors are Theron Willis and Brian
Newsome they created this great program
and I'm teaching you guys how it works
and how you can make it yourself so in
the last tutorial we created art web
favorites collection so we need to come
over here to my project or not my
project favorites viewer YouTube and
let's add a class so we'll set the class
name to favorites so what this class is
gonna do is it's gonna go through our
favorites folder and it's gonna find all
of the favorites and it's going to give
us back a collection of a web favorite
collection and it's gonna hold each one
of our favorites and those are going to
be of object type web web favorite so
what we need to do is let's implement I
disposable so that we can dispose of our
objects when we're done so let's go
ahead and minimize out of this region
right here and we'll start adding our
code so we need to create a an object of
our web favorite collection so we'll
type public favorites collection as web
favorite collection so you can see that
we didn't use the new keywords because
we don't want to create a new instance
of web favorite collection we're going
to be assigning this right here to other
web favorite collections later on okay
so now we need to do is we need to add a
property that will get our favorites
folder it'll find it based on what
machine we're on so we'll make it read
only because we don't need to right I
might change the favorites folder so
public read-only property
favorites folder as a string so when I
press ENTER it's going to add argot for
us now what we want to do is we want to
give back the path of the favorites
folder so what we're gonna do is type
environment dot get to folder path so
we're gonna beginning the folder path of
our favorites now how are we gonna find
favorites well what we can do is type
environment the special folder dot
favorites so I can continue to Mouse
down here and you can see that here is
favorites right down here so I can just
press tab and that'll fill that in for
us so it's going to get the folder path
of the favorites so now that we're done
with this property right here let's come
down below it and we need to create a
method so we'll call it public sub scan
favorites now this is not going to take
any arguments because we don't need
anything to do this so whenever we scan
the favorites what we want to do is call
scan favorites and we'll use favorites
folder now this is going to return an
error right now because scan favorites
has not been created yet or let's see
well it has been created right here but
we're giving me we're gonna make another
version of it that's gonna overload it
and let's see here too many arguments to
public sub scam favorites
now the reason we're getting in this
area because there's no arguments right
here
so we what we need to do is type public
sub scan favorites and for this we're
going to need an argument of folder
named as string so whenever we create
duplicate methods what its gonna do is
it's gonna allow the developer or user
to call either one of those so if they
call just scan favorites and with no
arguments all its gonna do is it's gonna
scan the favorites folder but they can
also call scan favorites and then add
their own arguments in there defined and
they specify the favorites folder so
either one of these will work and we can
make as many duplicates as we want with
different arguments in them so if our
favorites collection variable hasn't
been in it initialized yet then we need
to go ahead and create it so here's
favorites collection right here so we'll
use an if statement so if favorites
collection is nothing then what do we
want to do so we're saying if favorites
collection is equal to null for all of
you developers who've used another
language so if it's nothing and there's
nothing in it and it's not equal to
anything then we need to set it equal to
something so favorites collection is
going to be equal to a new web favorite
collection and that is the reason we
didn't create a new instance of this up
here is because whenever they scan
favorites it's gonna change that and set
it equal to a new web favorite
collection now what favorite collection
is just the list that's going to hold
all of our favorites so let's go ahead
and come down below this end if and now
all we need to do is we need to go
through each file in the
there and find our favorites so we'll
use a for each loop and we're just gonna
call string file as string in my dot
computer dot file system dot git files
and then folder name so this is gonna do
is gonna get each file in this folder
named directory right here which is
what's passed to this method so for each
of the files inside of this directory
that has been passed we want to go ahead
and try to find the favorites file in
there now the favorites file and with
dot URL so we can just use an if
statement to see if the file ends with
dot URL so we can just use if string
file that ends with and ends with is
part of string so we can check to see if
it ends with something so if it ends
with dot URL in comparison type so if
that's true and the culture is nothing
and it says it determines whether the
end of the string instance matches the
specified string when compared using the
specified culture so culture could be
the language of the program you don't
really have to know what that is right
now because you're probably going to be
working with English so it's not that
big of a deal unless you plan on
releasing your program to other
countries so thanks for watching this
tutorial
put it in this code if you haven't
already I mean if you have any questions
leave them in the comments and then in
the next tutorial we're gonna be filling
in this if statement right here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
