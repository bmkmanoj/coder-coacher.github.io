Illustrator cs6 tutorial my name is
buddy Blackford today we're going to be
going over the tools panel and I'm going
to go over a little bit about the
different tools that we've got here and
it's good to know the different variety
of tools that you have available to you
so pretty much there's an abundance of
tools that give anybody using
illustrator a huge amount of control
over any design problems that make them
up so you've got a ton of different
things a variety here for example you've
got selection tools you've got painting
tools shape tools type tools and a whole
bunch more including slicing sampling
and viewing tools so you have all the
tools that you need to do the job that
you need to do now when like I said
before when you're working on a document
it's important to know what you have
available to you so I'm just going to go
over these a little bit and I'm not
going to tell you what every single tool
does but I'm going to show you where
they are and and tell you what's in
there basically so the first one we've
got here and if you have the default if
you hile if you stay highlighted over a
hovered over a tool it's going to pop up
with the name of the tool and then it's
hotkey now a hotkey is when you press a
button on the keyboard it will
automatically switch that tool so the
hotkey for selection tool is V the
hotkey for direct selection tool is a
now if you watch my cursor here if I
press a right now it's going to switch
back and forth oh I was hitting that by
accident so here's a and here's V a V
and you can see that it's changing
between the selection tool and the
direct selection tool now under the
direct selection tool you can see on the
bottom right that there's this little
white arrow in the corner that means
that you can click and hold and then
there's going to be other tools involved
so we've got
direct selection tool and group
selection tool now here we've got the
magic wand tool and then we've got here
the lasso tool now these are tools that
you'll use often most likely and most
artists illustrators use these often now
Oh below here we've got our pen tool and
then other tools here that are related
to the pen tool we're below we've got
our type tools and the different types
of type tools in there here we've got
our different line tools and there's our
can spirals right below that we've got
our different shape tools we can make
different tools are different shapes
that we need to brush here this is the
paintbrush we've got a pencil and then
we've got our blob brush and in time
I'll be going over how to use most of
these tools we've got our scissors tool
and then we've got our rotate and
reflect here below this we we have our
scaling scale shear reshape we got width
warp twirl and a bunch of different
tools here for fixing shapes are making
shapes different free transform and you
can see there's no arrow and the free
transform tool so if I click and hold
nothing's going to show up nothing else
is going to show up so that's how you
know that there's nothing no other
things there below the free transform
tool we have the shape builder
perspective grid and then in these are
other tools that are related live paint
and then as you can see we got some
perspective there when I clicked on it
we've got our perspective selection tool
here's our mesh it's kind of like
warping around stuff we've got a
gradient
eyedropper and then we've got a measure
tool here to help measure things out
obviously blending and then we got a
simple sprayer tool which is kind of
neat and then we got a whole bunch of
different symbol tools there's some
graphing tools pie graph is why we make
our different graphs quickly artboard
tool we've got a slice tool it's going
to cut some things up hand tool and use
that to move the canvas around and we've
got our zoom tool here now it's good to
know the hotkeys for the zoom tool which
is Z and the hand tool which is H in
case you need to move things around and
then we've got a couple panels down here
that we'll go over later on but here's
how we change our fill if we switch
those we're swapping the fill and the
stroke so at the bottom is stroke at the
top is fill and then we've got some
colors down here and then we've got a
our different screen modes down here
that we can change up now when you're
working on projects or when you first
start actually when you're first
starting out in Illustrator you're going
to want to pretty much use these two
panels by clicking on them that we get
an idea where everything is and you have
an idea of where all the tools are now
when you're getting paid and starting to
get paid by clients and stuff they're
going to want you to be working fast and
you can't work fast as you can't work as
fast as you normally can if you are
clicking on these going over here and
then clicking back again and stuff like
that so you're going to want to learn
your hotkeys now a good way to learn
hotkeys for program is to find a
wallpaper that has the hotkeys listed
for you so they're always in your face
or print up the hotkeys
and put a thumbtack into it and put it
on your wall or somewhere where you can
see them so that the hotkeys are always
there for you and then you've got quick
reference you want to get used to
getting these hotkeys done because
that's how you become a better artist a
lot of clients they like things done
fast and to get things done really fast
hotkeys are the quickest way another way
to get things done fast obviously is
knowing your way around the program and
knowing how to solve different problems
and that's one of the main things we'll
be going over in my tutorial series is
ways giving you enough information that
you can solve these problems or solve
any problem that you come across so this
is a wallpaper you just save it to your
desktop and hopefully it like pops up on
there if you guys know how to save
things to desktops but whatever that's a
tutorial for someone else to teach you
so that's all I'm going to go over here
that was all the tools and if you need
to watch it again to remember where
other tools are go ahead and just get
yourself familiarize with the tools
panel so thanks a lot for watching this
tutorial and be sure to stay tuned for
another series of tutorials coming up
see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
