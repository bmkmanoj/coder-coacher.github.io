28th chemistry tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm gonna be talking more about
covalent bonds because I know you guys
just can't get enough of covalent bonds
so let's go ahead and learn some more
about them so I might have said this in
less soil but a covalent bond is
basically a type of chemical bond where
one or more electron pairs is shared
between elements so we went ahead and we
already looked at hydrogen and it bonded
with another hydrogen and one pair of
electrons was shared so you're saying
okay I understand how it can share one
pair just like that but how can it share
more than one pair that doesn't really
make sense well let's go ahead and take
a look at something like nitrogen now
nitrogen has five valence electrons so
we usually draw it like this 1 2 3 4 5
now a lot of the time in nature nitrogen
is bonded with another nitrogen and
that's kind of weird because like we can
understand with hydrogen
it could easily bond with another
hydrogen but how the heck can this thing
right here bond with another nitrogen it
just doesn't look like it would fit
nicely together well in order to do this
first of all if we look at the nitrogen
we can see that it does have five
valence electrons so in order to fill up
it needs eight so eight minus five it
needs three more electrons so if it
bonds with another nitrogen that means
that it will need to share three
electron pairs or six electrons
altogether and this would make something
called a triple covalent bond so let me
go ahead and draw this model for you you
have one nitrogen and it's going to bond
with another nitrogen over here now in
between you have 1 2 3 4 5 6
now this nitrogen is gonna go ahead and
keep two of its own and this nitrogen is
gonna go ahead and keep two of its own
so let me go ahead and demonstrate by if
I change my opacity you can see that in
this nitrogen right here it gets its a
from right there
and this nitrogen over here it kids it's
a from I'm see what color over here so
now if you take a look this nitrogen
right here has eight it shares six or
three pairs and has two of its own and
this nitrogen over here also has two of
its own and it's sharing these six
electrons and remember whenever you have
a pair of electrons that's shared it's
called a covalent bond so since you have
three pairs two four six this is called
a triple covalent bond now if we want to
write this more formally in the electron
dot format we can go ahead and write it
like this you have two nitrogens
I might as well make those a little bit
better I forgot you have two nitrogens
and each of them is going to have its
own two electrons now instead of drawing
all these dots right here what you do is
remember for each electron pair you just
draw a dash so it would look something
like this so that is how you would write
it more formally again this is called a
triple covalent bond or a triple bond is
some people like to call it so that is
the difference between a regular single
covalent bonds such as in the case of
hydrogen and a triple bond such as in
the case of nitrogen so hopefully you
guys understand now between the two and
also you can have double bonds and I'm
going to be talking about those later
and I just want to point out this I'm
not gonna be talking I'm not gonna be
explaining whenever I make a double bond
between something in the upcoming
tutorials what that double bond means
because I explained in this story so if
you're lost come back and watch this
tutorial but anyways thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
