who wants to set up a less to work with
a JetBrains IDE now I'm using IntelliJ
but it doesn't matter what Geoffrey's
IDE you're using they're all the same so
what you need to do is you need to go to
file and settings and first under
languages and frameworks scroll down
until you see no js' in NPM now as you
can see I already have the package
installed but you guys aren't going to
have this what you want to do is you
want to click this little green plus
button and make this so you guys can see
and search for the package les le SS now
before you hit install package head over
to options and check this because we
want to add the option of minus G this
is going to install the les package
globally in other words so you can use
it on your entire computer and not just
specific to this project it's a lot
easier that way so once you have that
setup hit install again I already have
it installed so that so I'm not clicking
any of this and once it does you guys
should see this les package 2 right here
so hit apply and ok if you want but
essentially you now have less package
setup that you can use now here's the
thing whenever we use less what we're
going to be doing is we're going to be
typing les syntax and converting it to
CSS now it's going to be a pain in the
butt if every little thing we type we're
going to need to hit a button that says
like translate or convert to CSS so I'm
going to show you guys another cool
thing that you can do and that is
install a file watcher now well a file
watcher is going to do is it's a plug-in
that automatically converts your less
code to the proper CSS anytime you make
any changes so all happens automatically
quickly behind the scenes it's all taken
care of for you so if you go to file
settings in from here go to plugins then
what you can do is you can look for a
plug-in called file Watchers this one
right here now again I already have it
installed so that's why it says
uninstall for me but it's going to say
install for you
so click that and once you have it
installed then hit apply in at this
point I think that Jeff rains asks you
to restart your IDE so just hit restart
and then it's going to pop you up and
you're essentially just going to have
the plug-in ready to go so you have the
file watcher plug-in but what you need
to tell it now is hey start watching my
less files so in order to do this in
actually to get that plug-in up and
running go to file settings tools and if
you expand this you're going to see that
you now have the file watcher tool and
as you can see it's now watching my less
files because I already set this up but
if you go to this plus button right here
and select less you're pretty much
telling it hey watch any less files I
have and automatically compile them or
translate them into CSS so select this
and also if you guys decided effort to
use sass or SC SS then this is how you
do it the same and some other cool
things on compressors if you guys know
what those are basically - like a weight
to minify code anyways I'm getting kind
of out track here I get a little bit too
excited about writing CSS code I guess
but anyways that's how you do it hit
apply ok and boom you're good go so now
you don't ever have to worry about like
translating it manually or you know
taking it and converting it to CSS
jetbrains takes care of all of it for
you pretty stinkin awesome so yeah there
you go in the next video we're going to
get started learning how to use less</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
