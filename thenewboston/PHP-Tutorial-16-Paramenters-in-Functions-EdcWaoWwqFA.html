tutorial and in the last tutorial I told
you how to write a basic function and
this time we're going to be adding one
parameter to our function and I'll show
you what that means let's just type in a
function and this tells PHP that we're
going to be working with a function and
we'll give it a name we'll call it some
fun for some function and last time we
had these empty parameters right here
and we left them empty but this time we
are going to want to be adding something
to it and in functions you add one
variable to it we'll be adding one
variable and I'll call my variable sub
because this variable is going to be
substituted for whatever I tell it to
substitute so on the next line of course
we want to tell PHP exactly what we want
our function to do
so this function is going to echo the
variable sub which it's not good we're
going to tell it what the variable is
later and then after that it's going to
type the word Hoss on the screen and
then we're going to add a line break so
here's what this is first for some PHP
we're working with a function we're
going to be calling this function some
fun the variable and the parameter is
sub for substitute and whenever we tell
you to spit out whatever we want the
substitute to be then the word Hoff's
then go on to the next line so let's put
this to work first thing you have to do
of course is call your function and mine
is called some fun and then after that
you add your parameters now instead of
just leaving them empty you write
whatever you want to substitute for this
in here so I'm going to say take it easy
so now if I outputted this on the screen
it's going to say take it easy
pause and it's going to move on to the
next line
so just to show you that I'm going to
write some fun add my parameters and I'm
going to write I said take it easy and
now if we go ahead and save this and
took a look at it
you can see take it easy Hoss for right
here and then move on to the next line
and on the next line it said I said take
it easy Hoss so as you can see when you
add one parameter to your function
whatever you type in that parameter down
here gets substituted as long as you
include it in your function so that's
how you can change your parameter of a
function with using basic one parameter
and sticking it in your parenthesis so
study this this is just a very basic
technique and learn this in the next
tutorial not sure what we're going to do
but probably be adding more parameters
