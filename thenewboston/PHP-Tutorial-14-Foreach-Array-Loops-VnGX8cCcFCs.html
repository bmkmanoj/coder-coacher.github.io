PHP tutorial and today I'm going to be
talking about a special kind of loop and
NRA called the for each loop now if you
learn the last array then you're going
to thank me so much after you learn this
one because it's a hundred times easier
the reason we would use the last one
when we had an array is when we wouldn't
exactly want to list every single
element and we wanted to increment them
by two or we wouldn't want to start with
the first one or anything like that but
each time you just want a plain ol just
spit out elements of array one after
another there's a ten times easier way
to do this so first of all let me just
create a basic array and you can do this
either two ways I'm going to use the
first one you learn about so I'm going
to just say one
two and three
and now we have three elements in our
arrays and I'm using string of text but
you can use number if you want and the
last time we used just a basic for loop
but this time we're going to use a
special thing called for each and what
this does is it allows us to go through
the loop and it's going to do it
automatically without us even telling
the parameters or anything because it
knows when we type for each set it
doesn't need parameters the only thing
that we need type is test as in most
people just use the variable X this
first one has to be whatever array
you're wanting to loop through and this
variable X we're going to talk about
right now we're going to say echo and
then this is where we type variable X so
this is what this means
we have an array called test right here
just a basic array and that says for
each element of X which you're going to
assign right here echo it out on a
screen so every test element in the
array echo on the screen and of course
just end the semicolon right there to
let them know it's ending line save it
as you can see it echoed it right on the
screen 1 2 3 so as you can see it's the
last time where you had to type a bunch
of parameters like X is equal to 0
define it then less than or equal to if
you just want to go through a basic
array and spit out all the elements you
have in your array this does it
automatically and you can use the same
one if you add an element to the array
later on and you want to spit it out
later just use the exact same syntax and
will automatically update for you so as
you can see this is about a hundred
times easier than what we learned before
I just wanted to get you guys learning
the hard stuff so once you understand
that this all should be a piece of cake
so watch my tutorial next I don't know
what we're going to learn but it's
probably going to be useful too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
