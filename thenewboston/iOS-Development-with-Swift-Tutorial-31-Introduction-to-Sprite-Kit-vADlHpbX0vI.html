video is actually the very first
tutorial in a little mini series that
I'm going to be making because for the
next five or ten tutorials I'm going to
be showing you guys how to create a
really simple 2-d game using sprite kit
now what is sprite kit sprite kit is a
game technology that's built into iOS
and it makes it really easy to make 2d
games and inside it it takes care of all
the hard stuff like collision detection
and physics and it pretty much gives you
all these tools so you can just
concentrate on what you want your game
to be and pretty much the fun part of it
so it's easier just to show you guys to
be honest instead of just you know
giving you guys the definition of what
it is so let's go ahead and get started
I created a brand new Xcode project and
make sure you select I oh s application
now before whenever we were just
learning how to make apps we're just
choosing a single view application most
of the time apps with one screen but now
we want to choose is game now whenever
we choose this it's going to give us a
really simple um like basic game
template and I'll show you guys what it
is in a second but select game hit next
and the product name I'll just name it
like a Bucky Blaster nimma game anything
you want are a swift game technology
sprite kit devices Universal this game
is going to be able to run on everything
so Universal is fine and hit next and
crates right there it looks good so now
let me go ahead and make sure that this
looks good for my screen recorder and
just that alright so hopefully somewhere
around there is good now believe it or
not if you just run this right here let
me change it to like iPhone 5 you can
run this right here and when my
simulator pops up you see that at the by
default pretty much the very first thing
gives you is this really simple game
that says hello world
and if you tap or click on it it puts
these little spaceships up and then they
can spin so it's not even a game it's
just a little stupid demo but that's
what it gives you by default whenever
you start out so I'm going to quit that
simulator and get rid of this and the
very first thing I want to do is
actually just pretty much strip out all
of that default stuff because we want to
start making our own game so again I'm
going to hop over to this view right
here and if you go to game scene swift
then let's clean it up and strip
everything out so first delete this
comment at the top and actually what I
like to do is you see how it gives you
these three methods by default didn't
move to view touches began in update
well it's stuck a comment inside each
one but I really like to stick those
above all right now once I'm done of
that what I'm going to do is I'm going
to delete all of the code inside all of
these methods so real quick before I
delete it we can kind of see what this
does this alright so this was obviously
the label that prints that text on the
screen that default hello world text
alright that's probably what that did
delete that don't need any of that
alright what's this does this has
something it look like wherever you tap
to pop that spaceship up and we can
delete that because we are creating our
own custom game so now if you run this
check it out where yes simulator alright
so it gives you a blank brand new game
that's a better starting point for
learning now another thing I probably
should mention is this for the game I'm
going to be showing you guys it's going
to be a really simple game and it's
definitely not one that you would want
to put on the App Store but just for
teaching you guys the basics
I'll show you guys we'll do this let me
put this simulator again oMG quit
popping up Xcode alright so here's what
I did I went and I found this dude on
and if you go online and you type in
game sprite or game sprite sheet it's
going to give you a bunch of free ones
or if you want some really good ones I
got this from Cote Canyon comm but you
can actually just use a plain image it
doesn't need to be like a bunch of
different frames but I'm going to be
showing you guys how to create a
character and you see how this is
actually in animation with six different
frames so here's a guy he's just firing
the bullets coming out and then his gun
it looks like it like blasts like a
backfiring effect so go find any sprite
online to clean that up and this is his
bullet and what he's going to be doing
is he's going to be shooting these balls
as they fall down from the sky so again
pretty simple game just a dude shooting
balls as they fall down but it's going
to teach you guys like I said the basics
of physics and collision detection and
get you familiar with sprite kit and
then once you learn all the pieces
you're going to be able to pretty much
put them together and create any game
that you want so that's what you have to
look forward to and well that's probably
good for this tutorial I'll see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
