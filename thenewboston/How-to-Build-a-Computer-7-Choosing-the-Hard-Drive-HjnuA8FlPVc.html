your harddrive tutorial and how to build
a computer now in the less tutorials we
learned that your RAM was kind of like
your temporary member and computer well
your harddrive is your permanent memory
on your computer so whenever you turn
off your computer anything in your RAM
kind of just disappears but your stuff
in your hard drive right here that's the
stuff that sticks with your computer in
its permanent
now your hard drive is your main in your
biggest storage system from your
computer it's where your entire
operating system is stored and also all
your Program Files and everything like
that now before you go picking out a
hard drive you gotta learn a couple
things first a the most important thing
there are two major types of hard drives
you got your pata in your Santa pata
stands for parallel ata and this is kind
of the ole the older hard drives and it
plugs in something that looks like this
a big old I don't know it looks like a
big ol thing with gold pins sticking out
in you don't want to ever buy a hard
drive like this though they're older
they're not using personal computers
really what you want to get is a SATA
hard drive s88
it stands for serial ata these hard
drives are faster newer and they're just
a whole lot better so make sure again
the SATA in when you buy an SATA hard
drive you're going to come across two
interfaces one is the 1.5 gigabyte and
one's the 3.0 gigabyte so the 3.0
gigabyte is probably going to be more
expensive but trust me it's a whole lot
faster so you can pick whatever guy's
one you want I'm not going to
many don't with the 3.0 just a little
bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
