tutorial and now that we are ensured
that all of our stuff has tables we can
go ahead and take that information and
throw it into a table so let me just go
ahead and make another string SQL see if
it can happen again man I'm frickin
getting ticked off by the drop kick my
dumb computer SQL three and we'll set
this equal to who don't want that now in
order to insert information in mysql you
use the keyword insert into and then you
go ahead and write the name of the table
that you want to insert information into
that's the cool thing about mysql it's
very like a layman's term so now since
this table has a whole bunch of columns
in it you need to write the columns that
you want to insert and you need to write
these in the exact order they are going
to be inserting the data so date open
high low close volume amounts change and
there's a freakin fly flying on my
freaking head amount underscore change
and also what's it % I keep thinking
percentage for some reason percent
change so actually let me go ahead and
make sure I have this right real quick
one two three four five six seven and
eight and hopefully I have eight up here
one two three four five six seven eight
ra so we're good so far so now we say
okay insert into table name and these
are the columns that we want to insert
information to however now we got to
write what values we want to insert into
them so values and now right after
values it's like the same thing but you
write the names of the values so this is
going to take a while okay one two three
four five six seven eight okay now that
I got that out of the way all we need to
do is basically grab these variables and
throw them
to these this might take a little bit
what am I going to talk to you guys
about while I'm doing this nothing
because I need to concentrate quit
trying to distract me all right so date
open and I got to remember a mulligan
high low close I low close now this is
usually when I tell you guys a funny
story or something while you guys are
just way in but in this case I actually
need to make sure I don't miss any of
this up so volume and it was the other
ones amount change amount change and
percent change not percentage Bucky get
that out of your head and I'm also
forgetting to delete my one extra
comment at the end so now this looks
pretty good and let me just make sure
okay everything looks pretty dang good
so now what we can do is remember for
the last time this isn't a queer yet
we're not running any max ql all we're
doing is we created a string why did we
do that because in this line we can go
ahead and run our query and it doesn't
look you know like a crazy super long
function so now what we did is basically
created a table and inserted the data
all this data into the table the
appropriately named table so now after
this checked out you see all of this
happens whenever it's looping through a
file whenever you're done looping
through a file you need to close that
file so the file the name of that file
we sort an object called file so after
the loop is done just go ahead and have
F closed and as a parameter it takes
that file just like that and that is
just because you don't want your file
open or else it's going to take
resources and not only in PHP but any
computer program even if they say then
it's not necessary to close your files
close them anyways okay it's just good
practice so guys I got good news this
function is completely done
that is how you take a text file like
this and you insert it into a database
table however this entire what's called
file is not done that's kind of
confusing because this is a file and I'm
saying this this entire script is not
done yet because what we need to do is
we need to create one more main function
that calls create URL then get CSV file
then file to database and that's where
we're going to be doing in the next
tutorial I think there's only one
tutorial or maybe two left to go for
this file but anyways enough of me
talking just go ahead and you know jump
to the next tutorial now thank eyes for
watching oh and don't forget to add me
on Google+ I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
