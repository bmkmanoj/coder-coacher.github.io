going to show you how to set up
Metasploit able now remember this is the
testing environment that we can use if
we don't have access to a server or if
we're just testing a new tool and we
want to play around with it and we don't
actually want to mess something up that
we own so go to this website right here
or if you just type Metasploit able to
in a google it's going to be the first
thing that pops up and you're going to
want to download the latest version so
click this right here and it's going to
download and I already have it
downloaded so right there I didn't want
to have you guys wait during the video
so here it is for me and it's going to
come in the zip file so if you
right-click you can hit extract all and
we'll just extract it right here looking
good doc detected on uh now from here
all you have to do is hit open a virtual
machine and remember mine is on my
desktop
my display table - boom roasted open and
there you go
so that's going to be compatible with
vmware now now all we have to do is play
it and I copied it so again what this is
doing is it's pretty much the equivalent
of starting or making a new computer so
what we're going to do is we're going to
host the server on the own my personal
computer that I'm sitting at right now
and I'll show you guys how to log into
it and get the IP address as soon as
this is done loading and just a word of
warning you always want to run this on
your own computer never run this on a
live system and also if you guys have
this on your laptop or a computer that
you take to school or work don't run it
on that computer because again this is
incredibly vulnerable that's the point
of it it has a bunch of bugs that we can
test so you don't want to bring it in
into a network that anyone can access so
just like any computer we need to log in
and the login name and the password is
actually the same that's msf admin now
I'm going to type the password again and
you guys aren't going to be able to see
the password but it's MSF admin so there
you go we are now
I'm running this virtual machine but the
thing is we need the IP address of this
virtual machine why do we need that
well then whenever we go back in see if
I can pop it open so then whenever we go
back in Cali oops that was Maya all
right so then whenever we go back in
Cali we can access it so in order to get
the IP address of it if you type
ifconfig then it's going to pop it up
right here so this is 192.168.1 52.1 - 9
now just to show you guys something cool
I'm probably going to forget that if you
go nmap - f was a 1 to 9 - don't want to
say that one five two one two nine one
five two one two nine I'm going to run a
port scan of that virtual machine and
hit enter let it do its thing and look
at this so on Metasploit able to look at
all the stuff that is open all of these
ports right here and these are different
points of attack for us so in the
upcoming tutorials and by the way
whenever you're in your virtual machine
arm your mouse is going to be owned by
this virtual machine and if you ever
want to get back to your host system
which is your main operating system you
can hold down ctrl alt and then it'll
move your mouse out so if you guys you
know are like re how do I get back to my
normal computer that's how you do it
ctrl a and you also just want to leave
this running in the background so once
it's up and running just minimize it and
we're going to have a server running
beautiful so now we can go back and Cali
and in the upcoming tutorials I'm going
to be showing you guys a bunch of
different cool exploits and things that
you can do and it's going to be pretty
sweet so I will see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
