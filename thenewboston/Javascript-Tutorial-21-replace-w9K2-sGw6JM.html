JavaScript and I promise this is my last
tutorial and how to style strings and
this is probably one of the most useful
tools that I'm going to teach you and
that's the replace tool now as you can
see last time we learned about mash that
just you typed in whatever you wanted to
match in empty parameters you know
either give you the output of that same
thing or it'll say no and this time what
we're gonna learn to do is replace one
of these words with another word so for
instance well let me just show you guys
how to do this I set the word match
let's type replace and pay attention my
syntax because what you put in your
parameter is a lot different than what
you've put before and your empty
parameter you first type a slash and
type in whatever the word is that you
want to replace and let's replace the
word Bob then once those are surrounded
and slashes use a comma and then you
type in whatever you want to replace it
with and if it's a string make sure you
type it in parentheses so I'm gonna say
let's type in Robert so here's what
we're gonna tell JavaScript to do find
all the occurrences of the word Bob as
you can see it says hello Bob and
replace it with the name Robert
so again the syntax for this is replace
slash whatever word you want to replace
slash and close this in slashes , don't
forget that and put your in quotations
whatever the new word you want so let's
save this refresh it and as you can see
it now changed our string hello Bob my
name is Susie into hello robert
my name is Susie and that is one very
useful way you can style strings using
the replace feature in JavaScript and
I'll promise that next tutorial we'll be
getting into something a little more
interesting no more styling JavaScript
or anything like that we learned enough
about that and again there are a lot
more of these built-in features in
JavaScript just look them up on the
internet somewhere and uh thank you guys
for watching put out start working on my
next tutorial and in the meantime you
