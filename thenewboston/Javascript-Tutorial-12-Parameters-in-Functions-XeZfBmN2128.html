JavaScript tutorial and in this story
I'm going to be teaching you how to add
those parameters to your function so the
first thing we need to do this is of
course a function song again type in the
name function I'm gonna call this
function add now unlike before when we
just had empty parameters you put two or
you can put just one variable inside the
parameters so I'm just gonna type in two
variables I'm gonna type in a and B and
where you use these variables is in your
functions statement so type your curly
braces and inside you tell the function
how you want to use those variables so
I'm gonna make another variable called X
and I'm gonna say the variable X is
equal to the product of a plus B or the
sum of a plus B I mean now on the next
line I'm going to tell it to return the
value for x
now here is what we're doing right now
we have a function call it add a and B
and this function adds the numbers a and
B and it returns the value of it as you
can see right here but now you're
thinking all right so what exactly are
the numbers a and B well to do that we
have to type it in in our variables
later on so I'm just gonna make a simple
alert box but don't pay much attention
to this pay more attention what I'm what
I'm typing inside it in the alert box we
want just to spit out the function so
just type the functions name add and
inside look at these red print these red
parentheses right here because those
symbolize these right here a and B but
up stat instead of adding a and B we're
gonna want to give it two actual numbers
so let's give it 32 and 56 so right here
inside ear alert box you're gonna
substitute make your substitutes for
whatever this is so if it's a and B give
a number to fill in a which will fill it
in right here and B which were filled in
right here so now javaScript is going to
take the sum of these two numbers right
here and it's going to return in and
spit it out and it's going to alert it
out to us so let's save it and take a
look at what it looks like as you can
see the sum of this function was 88 and
just like before you can use this
function as many different times as you
want without having to type this whole
bunch of code and any time that you want
to just change your numbers or something
say you wanted 35 and 76 anytime you
want to change the parameters it's that
simple you can use this multiple times
I'll copy it and paste it and say you
had 43 and that whatever that is you can
use this function as many times as you
want and all you have to do is change
the values in these parameters and java
script will automatically substitute
these and run it through your function
for you so let's save this and take a
look at this one more time as you see we
got 111 for our first answer and 5689
for our second one
so that's how you use the parameters and
a function and if you practice with a
digit with this just a little bit you'll
get the hang of it very easy and then
we'll save you a bunch of time so thank
you for watching and please write this
