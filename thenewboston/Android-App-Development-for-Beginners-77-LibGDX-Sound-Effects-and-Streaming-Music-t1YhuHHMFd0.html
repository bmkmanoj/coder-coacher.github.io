video and in this tutorial what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna show you guys how
to work with sound and libgdx
now what I already did is in my assets
folder I added a new directory called
sounds and all of these are just sound
effects that I bought the internet
because I didn't want to get sued so I
actually had to buy them but if you guys
know of any way that you can get sound
files for free on the internet I don't
know if there's a way to do that or not
but if there is then feel free to grab
any one off the internet but essentially
these are just little sound effects like
three seconds or a bloop ding Lou you
know like stupid sound effects like that
in this clam jam this is actually a song
so it's like three or four minutes long
and the reason that I wanted different
links is because the way that you handle
simple sound effects in the way that you
handle music is a little bit different
not only in your code but logistically
if you just think about it
whenever you play a sound effect like if
you collect a coin and a game you're
just going to play it's going to be done
you're going to hear it simple as that
but with music and a song you want the
user to pretty much have more control
over it you can allow them to pause it
stop it
start over and of course you don't want
that control with just a simple sound
effect so again that's why I'm going to
show you guys two different techniques
and it's going to make sense in just a
second so another thing I should
probably point out is this
I already implemented an input processor
and all the methods just to you know I
didn't want this tutorial to last
forever so go ahead and do that and also
don't forget to register your input
processor as this class so right now if
I ran this program it would just look
like a white screen so that's our
starting point and by the way one other
thing I am adding all of the source code
from this tutorial and all of my other
tutorials on github right now so if you
want this source code and I don't know
maybe you just want to watch the video
like all right this is cool and then
I'll copy the source code later go ahead
link below you can get it there for free
also not only just for the tutorials but
if you're ever making an app and you're
like alright you know what I can use
sound effects in here you can just go
back there and it's pretty much like a
library for a bunch of different cool
codes that you can add your program so
I'm going to shut up now because I
didn't even teach you guys anything yet
so let's go ahead and get started so the
first thing we're going to do is declare
two objects the first one is sound and
game over sound let me highlight that so
whenever you're using just a really
simple quick sound effect you can use a
sound object so that's what this is for
anything longer than like 10 seconds you
probably want to use this one right here
music now again this is for longer
pretty much songs in music that let's
say you're making a music player or
something you would want to use music
instead why well as you're going to see
in a second with music you can actually
pause them stop them a bunch of good
stuff so again sound for short music for
long songs like a music player so once
that is taken care of what I need to do
is just initialize them so game or over
sound and this is pretty much just
saying where is the sound file so audio
new sound and mine is at BIOS at
internal and I put mine in a directory
remember cult sounds and this was
actually death to I did not make that
name up next he named it death too and
it does kind of sound like um I don't
know like the user's diner their games
over so there you go now for the clam
jam which is my song I'm going to go
ahead and set this equal to G DX dot
audio now remember whenever you actually
have a music object you need to call new
music so if I just copy that you guys
probably want to notice but new sound in
new music are two different methods to
initialize your sound files different
so GD x-files dot and this is all the
same internal and my file was ok that it
sounds what was the name of that I
believe us clam jam doctor wave
hopefully if not we'll find out pretty
soon a-all right now another thing I
want to point out is these sound files
both of them are disposable so make sure
that you dispose of these especially
your else they're going to eat up all of
your memories so game over sound
disposed and clam jam disposed look at
that filled it in for me now what I'm
going to do in this program is I'm just
going to say whenever I tap down on the
screen I want this sound effect to start
playing so of course you would want to
play this whenever they either like um
their character like hit a block or
collected a coin or for a music player
you would want some buttons on here but
for now since you just have a white
screen I can just put my finger on it
and I'll start playing so that is of
course touch down whenever I touch down
on the screen and let's do the simple
game over so this game over sound effect
is that really quick one and at first
I'll just show you guys this to play it
as normal now I'm not going to record my
screen because a I'm lazy and B if I
showed you guys a demo it's just going
to be a white screen you guys can't see
by finger on the screen recorder so let
me just run this and a hold on to my
chords all tangled up and I'll show you
guys what does alright guys so I had a
typo actually put sound instead of
sounds so my program crashed but it is
running now now let me go ahead and tap
my screen and listen so that's you can
see actually right here whenever I'm
tapping in my little lock at and now let
me tap it real quick
so first of all that's the most annoying
sound ever but that is my game sound
file and let me set my phone down here
so another thing I want to show you guys
is this see whenever we just played the
sound we just call it a method called
play it ran play the sound fine but what
this method actually does is in addition
just playing the sound it also returns
an ID number and we can store this value
and we'll just sort in a long variable
called like sound ID now why would we
ever want an ID number essentially to
reference this sound well with this ID
number what we can do is add some cool
sound effects and say that you're making
this game and you had a bunch of
different sound effects for your game
maybe you had a sound where they
collected coins maybe he had one where
they busted a block and you had this one
that played whenever it was the game
over but you noticed that this sound was
kind of loud so what you wanted to do is
go in here and somehow you got to figure
out how to edit a sound file and turn
down the volume or with a sound ID you
can actually do this all through Android
so if you reference game over sound and
cause something like set as you can see
there's a bunch of different stuff that
you can do so we'll just say set volume
for now and then you throw in your ID
right there the volume is actually a
value 0 to 1 so if you want to set it
like 90% just put 0.9 F and let me show
you guys one other thing and just so you
know being able to differentiate between
90 and 100% it's probably a little bit
difficult so I'll show you guys one that
will be easy to hear set pitch and this
this is actually a value 0 to 2 1 is the
default pitch that you heard um you know
just like a minute ago so I'm just going
to go ahead and slow this down to like
50% so if my pitch was a 50% talking I
would talk like this so that's what
pitch is pretty much a speed and well
the pitch of it so that's it now let me
go ahead and play this little demo all
right so I got my phone so you guys
probably can't hear the volume being at
90% but you can definitely hear the
pitch all right beautiful a sounding
sound effect so now what I want to show
you guys had to do is work actually let
me just go ahead and take all these out
and again I'm going to include these
whenever I post the source code on
github so yeah alright so another thing
I want to do is show you guys how to use
that streaming music now of course just
to play it it's pretty simple you call
the music file and remember this is my
long music file it's like four minutes
long now of course I don't want to touch
down it plays for four minutes and I
have zero way of stopping it so just for
this example I'm going to say whenever
my finger is down on the screen it's
going to play however whenever I lift it
up then I'm going to pause it so I'm
going to call clam jam which is the song
pause now of course you would never add
the functionality to actual music player
you know you don't want their finger to
constantly be on the screen um to play
the song but let me go ahead and show
you guys and by the way before well I'll
tell you guys in a sec alright so I'm
about to tap my finger on the screen
and now lifting it off alright so as you
can see whenever I lift it off then it
pretty much stops it or pauses it right
there we're going to press my finger
down again lift it off and that's
another thing see this right here is the
pause method and what this does is
wherever you paused it at whenever I
lifted up my finger it pretty much keeps
the indicator of where it's at now I can
also call stop and what this does is it
actually stops it and if I put my finger
down again it would start right at the
beginning so that's the difference from
pause it keeps your place stop would
start right at the beginning and I kind
of like the song I got it off a well I
don't know even though with the websites
called but check it out alright so there
you go
and alright have to like adjust
everything since I'm like grabbing my
phone and then like trying to teach this
and keep my screen recorder it's a mess
so I'm gonna go ahead and probably go to
McDonald's they got them chicken selects
now shout out to my selects alright so
uh yeah there you go again all this code
is going to be on github so thank you
guys for watching don't forget subscribe
and well see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
