Photoshop cs6 tutorial my name is buddy
Blackford and today we're going to O
computers going crazy we're going to be
pretty much taking a multi-layered
document and creating a background layer
out of it otherwise known as flattening
images so what it does is it takes
whatever you have visible in your layers
panel and converts that into a
background layer with no transparency in
it so what we're going to do is just
that we're going to have what we want to
be converted into the background layer
let me cancel out of that crap and put
it in and we're going to flatten it and
put it into the background layer I think
I just said that twice but now you
really really get the hand so let's uh
just right-click in our layers panel and
we're going to come down here to flatten
image and what it's going to ask you is
discard hidden layers if you don't want
to you hit cancel and then nothing
happens but if you hit OK
everything that you don't have visible
is going to go away and everything is
just going to get changed into a
background layer so I'm going to hit OK
and now as you can see everything is
into a background layer I can't open
this layer up or anything like that it's
just one background right now and I have
no control over this the only thing I
think I can do is erase well it's
erasing everything into red for some
reason who knows why now let me hit
control Z to go back a few times ok here
we go and what I wanted to show you was
just another way how to do this so if we
come up into our layers panel and go to
our panel options we can also flen image
from there hit OK and now we've got that
off land now as if I add in some of
these pictures here and then go to
flatten
those pictures are going to also be in
into my background here they're also
going to going to be what's there so I'm
going to go back another time and hide
these pictures and if you notice the
last time when I deleted out the
background layer and flattened my image
remember that there is no transparency
so it adds a white background for me and
that's what the Photoshop defaults to so
that's another quick and easy tutorial I
thought it was going to take a little
bit longer to teach that but I don't
know why I was thinking that because
it's so easy so thanks for watching this
tutorial and subscribe for more
tutorials I promise that they're a
little bit longer than this one thanks
for watching and everybody and have a
good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
