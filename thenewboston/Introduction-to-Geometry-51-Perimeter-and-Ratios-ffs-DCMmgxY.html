perimeter and ratios and we kind of
already did this when we did similar
triangles but this time we're just going
to talk about similar figures in general
so in similar figures the ratio of the
perimeters is equal to the ratio of any
pair of sides so just like a triangle
we're going to pair corresponding sides
to find the ratio so we're going to take
one the little side of this square or
one side of this little square and to
one side of this bigger square and
that's our ratio so that means the
perimeter is also going to have a
one-half ratio so we're going to do two
things we're going to find the perimeter
of this which is one plus one plus one
plus one so the perimeter of the little
triangle is four and then we're going to
put an X on here to find out what the
perimeter of the big square is going to
be so if we cross multiply we get 8 is
equal to X so the perimeter of this
bigger square has to be eight so we're
going to check that by actually finding
the perimeter so two plus two is four
plus two is six plus two is eight so yes
this is right and we could have done it
the other way and found the perimeter of
the big square first and then solve for
the little square so now we're going to
do some examples okay find the missing
perimeter so they tell us that the ratio
of the sides is 324 so we're going to do
two different things and you can solve
it either way
so if they have a three to four ratio
and this side is three and this is the
smaller triangle or sorry square that
means this side which corresponds to
this side on this triangle or sorry
square has to be four so knowing that I
can find the perimeter of this one by
finding the perimeter of this one so
we're going to take three fourths which
is the ratio of their sides and their
perimeters and we're going to set it
equal to the perimeter of this one over
the unknown perimeter of this square so
first we have to find the perimeter of
this square so 3 plus 3 is 6 plus 3 is 9
plus 3 is 12 so 12 so then we're going
to cross multiply get 48 X so then you
get x is equal to 16 so the perimeter of
this big one is 16 now find the
perimeter knowing that they have a two
to one ratio so the first number is this
big triangle because this is this
triangle is has a two to one ratio to
this one meaning this is two times as
big 21 which is this triangle now you
might say that looks funny because this
is a four and this is a two and not a 2
2 a 1 but if you put the big triangle
over the little triangle and you
simplified by dividing by 2 you get to
21 so we want to find the perimeter of
this little triangle
so we're going to find the perimeter of
this big triangle first and these are
all similar figures so that means that
they're all they've they fit all the
requirements so we can do this kind of
problem so we're going to set 2 over 1
is equal to 4 plus 4 which is 8 plus 4
which is 1212 over X if we cross
multiply we get 2x is equal to 12 / to
you get x is equal to 6 well that's all
we're going to do for today but make
sure you come back because in the next
unit we're gonna start talking about
parts of the square and that's going to
help us so we can do area of shapes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
