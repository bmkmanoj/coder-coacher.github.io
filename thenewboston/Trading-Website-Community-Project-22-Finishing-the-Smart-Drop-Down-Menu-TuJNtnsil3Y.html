we need to create that default very
first option so if you notice in our
HTML code we already created the frame
for our drop-down list now whenever you
create a drop-down list you pretty much
have to select tags and you have all of
your categories in between option tags
so since the first option we want to
display is all categories that's where
what we're gonna create by default so
let's go ahead and do that right now if
I could find my function it's active to
go oh here it is
so echo and we can just go ahead and put
this in double quotes because we're not
passing in any variables option all
categories so basically all categories
is the default option that's selected
whenever you're looking at that a
drop-down menu now what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna go ahead and make a while loop
now what this while loop is going to do
is it's gonna start at 0 and it's gonna
loop all the way down until it breaks
now why do I do that well the reason is
because I don't want to make a for loop
because if I made a for loop I'd have to
give it distinct values a range of
values now I want to make a while loop
because these are all the categories we
have 0 to how far do we go 0 to 24 we
have 24 categories but obviously this is
one of the things on our website that's
likely to change
we either probably whenever we're
working on our website we're gonna
decide to remove some categories or add
some as they become more popular so
instead of just making a simple loop
with a starting and ending point I want
to make this loop where it's easily you
just add a category right here and you
don't have to worry about any other code
it's gonna still work fine so in order
to do this I'm gonna show you guys with
the two first make a count in the
variable name I and we start at 0 y 0
because 0 is the first category name
and now in order to make a loop that
never ends just go ahead and put while
one now this loop is gonna keep going
and going and going forever until it
breaks now we want to break this loop
when it gets to the end of this category
in other words whenever this function
returns category does not exist and
that's when our loop knows to break if
we didn't make our loop break and then
this would just go on and on forever and
it would cause an error in PHP so now
basically this is going to start a zero
and it's going to go all the weights 24
and then it's going to return category
does not exist whenever it's done
looping through two categories pretty
sweet huh so now all we need to do is go
ahead and do a little housekeeping shiz
so of course this was named number two
category so let's go ahead and copy that
so let's go ahead and say if number two
category and instead of n we actually
want to pass in I is equal equal to and
now we need to go ahead and copy
category does not exist
so basically we're saying okay once we
are done looping pretty much at the end
of the loop what do we want to do all we
want to do is break so basically when we
get to the end of all of these
categories and you're done doing your
thing then just go ahead and break out
of the loop and that is the code that's
going to make this never-ending loop and
if we didn't have this line right here
then we're gonna get a error so
basically when you get to the end break
else why you are working this is the
code that's going to happen whenever
you're passing in those values 0 1 2 3 4
5 all the way to 24 so else if we gave
you a good value then what do you want
you to do well basically what we want to
do is we want to take each one of these
and we want to turn them into one of
these an option simple enough right
well not exactly we need to do a little
bit of housekeeping first so the first
thing we need to do is go ahead and echo
that first option so let's go ahead and
okay I got lost here for a second
option value equals I now hopefully you
guys know a little bit about uh passing
form values and getting the values from
them but basically each option needs of
value and this is for whenever we handle
the forum in PHP then it's going to look
for that but basically the first thing
we want to do is make our opening tag
which we just did right there and we
actually don't make the entire opening
tag because before we close it off here
let me show you guys that right here
might be a little bit easier to explain
now aside from just making a bunch of
options you also have the option
probably shouldn't use the word option
there but you also have the option of
typing in the word selected now whenever
you type in the word selected that's the
option that is the default option for
the form so in this case electronics
whenever research that you see how
electronics is the option that we see
the user sees whenever they first view
the form that is because if we took a
look at the source code the word
selected would be right next to this
word electronics so what we want to do
is a neat little trick we want to go
ahead and make a simple if statement and
we want to test if that variable that
we're currently on is equal to the
variable that we grabbed from the URL if
it is indeed exactly equal to the value
that we grabbed from the URL then what
we want to do is we just want to echo
out a simple selected keyword just like
that now what's that what that's going
to do is before we finish off closing
our opening options tag is that is going
to add the word selected before it and
then we can go ahead and close off our
ending option so basically this entire
option thing is equal to this thing
right here except it's a little bit
smarter what its gonna do is it's gonna
grab the value from the URA URL and it's
going to see okay which one of these is
the category they're searching for if
it's the category that they're searching
for then go ahead and add that selected
keyword and what this is going to do is
it's basically gonna test and see which
one of these values is the default value
which one of these do I want the user to
see now all we go ahead and do is go
ahead and echo number two category I now
what this is going to do is it's going
to take whatever value I is and it's
gonna pass in this number it's a
category function which is basically
going to return a string
therefore naming our option and the last
thing we want to do is just go ahead and
echo out this ending option you don't
need to do anything to that one thank
God so there you go finally the last
little thing we need to do before I
forget actually might as well finish
this baby off is I plus plus so one last
time if you have no idea what's going on
listen just one last time then I'll let
you go
we basically grabbed a value from the
uoy URL just to see if the user was
searching for a specific category if
they were then whenever we create this
form through PHP we want to make that
category such as home-and-garden
the default category that the user sees
and we did that by adding an optional
selected keyword now after that we just
went ahead and we converted whatever
number we were on to a category which
basically turned a number into a string
because it'd be a little a little
confusing if these are all numbers right
here and we obviously ended our proper
option tag and incremented I one more
time now again like I said what this is
going to do is it's going to loop
through all your options or all your
categories starting at zero going all
the way to 24 and once it gets to 25
it's going to return category does not
exist and once it returns category does
not exist it's going to go ahead and
break out of our loop and we can go
ahead and go on about our
so I know this is confusing but this is
going to be incredibly easy to maintain
and the cool thing is we're actually
gonna be using this function again in
probably another 20 tutorials or so and
we don't have to do anything special to
it it's gonna be all ready to go so
anyways that's all I have for this
tutorial I know this is a little bit
confusing but I just go ahead and look
at it and think about it for a second
it's gonna make sense so anyways thank
you guys for watching and again all of
this source code is available for
download right now on my forum link
below so last time thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
