Android tutorial for the new Boston
again with me Travis and we're going to
do this tutorials I'm gonna introduce
you guys to how to create a method
within Java because we're going to want
to create some methods down the road but
we're in this uh basically this method
that we're going to set up is just going
to initialize all of our reference
points from Java to the XML that we have
set up here so it's not really going to
do anything new for our activity but I
just want to show you guys how we can
set that up the first thing that we're
going to do is define just our variable
above our on create method because this
new method that we're going to use we
want these uh we want to use these
variables in both methods and make sure
it's the same so again we're just going
to go above the on create method and
just set up our variables such as button
make sure it's the exact same as you
guys have it spelled in here within our
own crea themá-- create method and
we're just going to set them up so we're
going to say button and we're going to
create a a button check man toggle
button was a pass
what was it passed hog and then edit
text was input and textview
what's called display
now we're just going to delete basically
the pre-identify or the modern modifier
and also the type because we defined it
up here so basically the final is saying
that is going to be final within this
method since it's only used for one
method oncreate method we we want
basically we want both methods to have
access to this variable so we don't need
to set it as final no law anymore so
we're just going to delete the modifier
final again and the type for each of
these variables and it's pretty much
going to do the same thing but now what
we want to do is create a method that's
basically getting a hold these four
commands within there so we're going to
call this method whatever you guys want
let's say like bacon and eggs I don't
know just because I'm really hungry
right now and again method we'll use
kind of parentheses afterwards so that's
how we're going to set up our method
called bacon and eggs you know it's kind
of a terrible descript description of
what the method is going to do because
it's basically just going to do these
four things but you know it's good way
to kind of clean up your code within the
oncreate method and yeah basically we're
using this method called bacon and eggs
but we haven't set it up yet so easy way
to create a method would just be to
hover over it and eclipse and it says
create the method bacon and eggs so
we're going to click that and as as you
guys notice down at the very bottom
after our oncreate method closes there's
this new method called bacon and eggs
and it's private void again void
basically means it's just the method and
it's going to return
well it's but just think of it as just
being a method for the most part and
private is going to say you know it's
accessible to this class for the most
part so again instead of public we could
have there as well so what we're going
to do now is just copy or cut and paste
this code right here where we set up
those reference points to our XML and we
can just place it within this method
that we just created called
bacon and eggs now it's going to
register all of those all those
basically bridges over to the XML and so
again when our program starts it's going
to call this on create method and it's
going to set the content view and then
it's going to be like Oh bacon and eggs
it's not going to do anything below this
bacon and eggs method until it calls the
bacon and eggs method it's going to go
shoot down here and be like oh what am I
supposed to do so I go okay I'll do this
real quick and then it's going to shoot
back up to this line of code and just
continue onward so I mean it's not
obviously this didn't really change
anything with our application but I just
want to show you guys again kind of
emphasize the point that the final will
have to be removed when we define it
above our method oncreate so it can be
used within multiple methods and as well
as how to set up your own personalized
method in the next tutorial we're going
to get into another thing that we can do
with java is called implementing we can
implement a class and I'll show you what
that does so again thanks for watching
guys and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
