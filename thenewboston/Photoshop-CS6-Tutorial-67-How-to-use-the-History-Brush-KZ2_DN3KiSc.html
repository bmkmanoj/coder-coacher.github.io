Blackford here with another Photoshop
cs6 tutorial and in this tutorial we're
going to be learning about the history
brush and you need to combine the
history brush with the history panel to
bring back elements from original or
previous history States and a history
state is any one of these sections in
the history panel so pretty much what
the history brush does is brings back or
you select you select a history state
and then paint over the original or the
state that you have now and it will
bring back stuff from the from the first
image that you selected so I'll just
have to do it to explain it a little
more so I'm gonna delete this history
brush right here and what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna start out on this snap on
this right here which is basically
nothing I'm gonna take this patch tool
and I'm gonna grab this like wood stack
back here again I'm just gonna move down
here to just replace the wood stack so
now we've got that mess right there
now if we remember I'll just take a
snapshot real quick and snapshot one is
this one so if I click on it's gonna be
that if I go to the original nothing was
there so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
click on this check box area over here
on the original and it's going to show
the history brush now I'm on snapshot
one as my selected history state our
selected snapshot so I'm gonna click on
the art history brush right here if you
click and hold the are the history brush
tool not the art history brush the
history brush tool is what we want I
click on that then come over here and
start painting its gonna paint back the
original
it's actually painting back the layers
of the one that I have selected so it's
painting that back so now if I have this
this one selected right here that I want
to have my art brush or my history brush
work on so I had that selected now if I
go to paint around the edges here I may
make this a bigger brush it's bringing
back this stuff from that state so
that's the history brush for you now
something else I wanted to show you was
bringing the states bringing the what's
it called bringing the history state
into another document and that's really
easy and pretty much it just creates a
new document for you with the history
state that you have selected so let me
go to something like this snapshot one
right here where we did the where we did
the patch right there and I'm gonna
click on this button here with the
document with the plus sign and I click
on it and it's gonna create a new
current document and now it it brings it
doesn't carry over the other history but
now I have this document to work on on
my own or on its own and this actually
helps save RAM so that's very useful
that way you can work on a section
without having to work on it and like a
huge project so if you got a project
that has a bunch of different layers and
elements and it's going really slow for
you just create a new document using the
history panel and you won't have to work
as slowly and everything I wanted to end
up showing you something cool that you
could do with the snapshots and our
history brush together and let's do that
so I'm going to not save that document
that I created and what I'm gonna do is
I'm going to delete on some of these
snapshots
so we don't have to worry about them and
I've got my original one here and what I
want to do is put a filter on it let's
go to let me just figure out a filter I
didn't think of this ahead of time
I'll just throw on like a blur I guess
so let's run this blur and we'll blur to
a decent amount so it's pretty much
blurred there and I take another
snapshot oh I clicked on the wrong
button
and I clicked on the myth to a new layer
I was like what did I just do take
another snapshot by clicking on this so
we got a snapshot one here which is the
blurred and then we have our original
here so let's put our art history brush
on our blurred now I want pretty much
just me to stand up this picture is of
me eating a piece of corn cob with a hot
dog bun on it just goofing around okay
let's let's start this so we need to
rasterize the layer first and then I can
use this brush here to start painting in
use our history brush to paint in and
remove basically the effect that I had
going on so there we go so now the main
focus is now like everything is blurred
out in the background and you could have
used done it a little better by being
more intricate using a smaller brush and
everything like that but you can see how
you can mix like filters and the history
brush and snapshots and everything like
that to create cool effects so that's
all I wanted to show you guys here and I
thought it was pretty cool so if you
guys liked the video make sure you
thumbs it up if you hated it of course
give it a thumbs down and all the
feedback helps so be sure to check out
some more photoshop videos on Bucky's
room
make sure you want to check that out so
I have a good one everybody see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
