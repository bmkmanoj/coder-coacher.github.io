Android tutorial for the new Boston
we're going to do real quickly is set up
a couple boolean values called can W and
can R can read and write so we're gonna
set these boolean values to be is just
you know this should be can W equals can
or can read can write equals true within
you know our state where we can read and
write and can W equals false here but
can r equals true and lastly can W
equals can r equals false and we're
going to do in this tutorial we aren't
actually going to work with the data yet
we're going to do something called a
spinner within XML so go over to your
external data and look for something
called a spinner I'm just going to drag
and drop it within our class here now
let's just check of references make sure
everything's the same I'm just going to
keep the default for the most part
because probably only time we're going
to use spinner so let's just give me
spinner 1 and let's set that up within
our external data class so now let's set
up some stuff within our class here
we're gonna set up a spinner and we're
going to call it just spinner awesome
like that pretty clever huh yeah thought
of that name for that variable for quite
some time and what we're also going to
do is create a string array we're going
to call this path something like that
I'm going to set this equal to open
bracket quotations I'm going to say like
music because basically we're creating
path is that we can save something too
for this activity so we're going to say
path or music pictures and just download
something like that
so just a quite a pretty small string
array there and just has three things
again position zero one two and two and
now what we're going to do is we're
going to set up our spinner within our
on create methods so just go within the
brackets of our oncreate and we're just
going to say spinner equals again
spinner and find view by ID RG dot
spinner one now we're going to add to
the spinners we're going to say spinner
dot set step onclicklistener we're going
to say set adapter and we're going to
just leave it as adapter here but we
don't have a adapter yet so we're going
to create adapter called adapter just so
it will match this right here above
where we actually access the adapter so
what we're going to do is how we're
going to set up our array adapter is
just typing a ray adapter Russia should
say how we're going to set our adapter
for here we're going to make it be a ray
adapter and you just say adapter and
this should be kind of familiar with you
know where you guys probably got super
confused at the beginning of the series
we worked with our ray adapters but now
all we're going to do is we're going to
set this array type array adapter type
to be string because we're working with
this array paths up here the string
array up here so it's the right adapter
type string called adapter so it matches
right here now what we're going to say
is a new adapter new array adapter
and again type string and within its
then its parameters we're going to say
this for the context of our class or
even just you can also say external data
which is our class name dot this comma
and then we can refer to the ant that
basically what comes with SDK for a
simple spinner item so we're just going
to say Android dot r dot layout dot
simple spinner item hit that the last
thing we need to set up so there's three
things within the parameters the context
kind of this type of spinner layout for
the most part which we're just going to
use the default for the most part and
then we also need to setup our string
array so we're string array was called
paths so that's kind of difficult to see
but yeah just make sure you know the
context this right adapt or the type is
just from the Android SDK called spinner
a simple spinner item and the third one
is our string array called paths right
here so that's pretty much it for this
tutorial in the next tutorial I'll show
you guys how to access which spinner
item has been been touched and I'll
catch you guys then have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
