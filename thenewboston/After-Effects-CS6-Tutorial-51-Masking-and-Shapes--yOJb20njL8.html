Effects cs6 tutorial my name is buddy
Blackford and today we're going to be
going over masking and I'm gonna show
you how to mask today with the shape
tool and then in a later tutorial I'll
show you how to mask with the pen tool
so the masking tools if you follow my
cursor are over here with the starting
with the pen tool and then over here it
says rectangle tool but if you click and
hold you can see that there are other
types of masks here you can also create
shapes from these tools also so enable
in order to mask something you're gonna
have to click on the layer down here in
the layers panel and now make sure you
have your shape here selected and you
can click and drag out and that enables
you to create a mask revealing your
image here if you hold shift it's gonna
constrain your proportions here for a
square it'll keep it or for the
rectangle tool it'll keep it into a
square so all the sides are gonna be the
same you let go of it then it's going to
just freeform so let's try a different
mask with some of these masks there's
different tricks that you can do that
aren't really apparent unless you unless
someone tells you so the next one is
called the rounded rectangle tool and
you can cycle through these by pressing
Q that's the hotkey and as you can see
if you look up here you can see that is
changing so we'll go on the rounded
rectangle tool for now if you click and
drag obviously you can make a rounded
rectangle and if you hold shift it's
going to keep it into a square and one
thing that's cool about the rounded
rectangle tool is that if you push the
up and down or left and right keys
on your keyboard it's going to affect
the roundness or the shape of the
rounded rectangle tool so first I'll
hold up and you can see what it does you
can look at the corners here and you can
see it's getting more round it's pretty
slow but you can see that it's getting
even even more round and if you hold
down which I'm going to do right now
it'll get less round now if I press left
it goes into a square without any
roundness
if I press right it'll go into a pill
shape and then you can adjust these pill
shape in the square shape here you can
adjust the roundness again by holding up
and it'll turn back into a rounded
rectangle as you can see so that's a
neat trick with that tool press ctrl-z
and head on to the next one which is
ellipse tool the ellipse tool draws from
the side out instead of the center if
you hold shift you'll get a circle and
that's pretty much it for the ellipse
tool here there's a not any anything
special with that so I'll hit control Z
head off to the polygon tool click and
drag and starts me off with a triangle
let me drag in the middle here so you
can see it drags from this point here on
the corner instead of in the middle so
if you press left and right it makes
your image either fatter or skinnier if
you go too far you can see overlaps and
that's not usually good but maybe
sometimes you might
that so look if we we can get almost a
circle with that
now I'm gonna control Z and then redo it
now if I press up it's gonna add more
spikes as I guess or add more points as
a as you can see it's - there's a
four-sided polygon here's the five six
and so on you can keep on adding points
so that's how you use the polygon tool
get out of that now if we go to start
tool here I'll click and drag now we
have a start here the up and down if you
if you're holding the mouse button and
you press up and down before you release
it you're going to be able to add more
points as you can see there if you press
left and right on your on your keyboard
it's gonna do the roundness of the outer
so there's a flower shape go back it
back where it was that looks good
and then this one has another one
wherever you use the page up and page
down key it'll do the inner roundness
this is page down you can see what's
going on here so you're gonna be a
little bit careful with this one
here's page up if I'm hope I'm holding
it down
so those are some neat tricks with that
tool there's also a trick that I that I
learned if you go to something like the
ellipse tool this is my favorite part
and double click on it it's going to
create a mask that is the size of the
the size of your of your image or your
solid or whatever is on there so you can
see that my image is the size of this
blueish colored box that's how big the
image is it's bigger than the comp so if
I go back and I hide this I'm gonna
create a new layer new solid yellow is
fine now if I double click this way now
you can see it created the size of the
solid an ellipse I want to show you that
down here there are mask properties then
we can get into those in the next
tutorial but keep be aware of that so
that's a quick intro to masking with
shapes
we'll continue this in a later tutorial
and I hope to see you guys there have a
good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
