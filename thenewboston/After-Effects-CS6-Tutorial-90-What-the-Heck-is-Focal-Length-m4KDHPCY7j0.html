the heck is going on in the words of
Bucky so this is Buddy Blackford here
with an After Effects tutorial about
focal length with your 3d cameras and
you need to know how to use focal
lengths so you can pick the right camera
for your project because they do it does
different things when you have a
different focal length no I wanted to
tell you guys a quick story before I
went on to this because focal length is
going to be mostly me talking about it
and it's not a whole lot of different
things to show so let's go on with a
story I it was a nice day out the other
day like 80 degrees so I decided to go
to the local market the meat market and
I picked up a couple of ribeye steaks
and there were like $15 each and I
bought some for me and Bucky and Joby if
you guys don't remember who Joby is
check out some of the V logs and he's
the big guy that just makes funny
sarcastic jokes all the time so I was
cooking those up and we cooked them like
perfectly pretty much and put them on a
plate and we're eating them and all of a
sudden Bucky just starts like taking
parts of it with a fork and just like
whipping it into the into the grass in
his yard and me and Joey are like well
with what the hell are you doing and he
cuts out all the fatty parts of the of
the steak and just like throws him away
now where we come from people don't
usually do that you pretty much eat all
the steak unless it's like a tough as
tendon or something like that is from
like Walmart or something like that and
you can throw off parts because who
cares but so we were like kind of like
dumbfounded so you're kind of like what
the hell so now when he trims up his
steak
because it was like a $15.00 steak when
he trims up the steaks now we just give
him to Joby so I mean this is Joby and
he definitely likes the the fat part on
his steak and he always says he does and
I mean this is him he caught caught a
fish that day and since he's got a
picture of him with the fish I got to
show the picture of the bigger fish that
I caught yeah even though I'm making a
dumb face but who cares now let's get on
to focal lengths let's uh come come to
our 50 millimeter camera here and let's
make sure that we're on it by clicking
on this button here and coming down to
the 50 millimeter camera and I'll
explain what focal length is and when
you have your presets here the focal
lengths are these presets these are
based on the focal length of the camera
so if I change this to like a 15 the
focal length down here will change now
well focal length is is it's the
distance between the camcorders lens and
the focused image and a lot of people
don't really know about it because you
don't really need it to operate your
camera but if you want to be good at
what you do you need to understand
everything and understanding focal
length is key so something with a short
focal length is going to offer you a
wide angle so if I come to the 20
millimeter note here and look and look
through it looks like I adjusted the
camera at one point come on
we're going to have a wide angle now let
me check in our top view to see where
the camera is located so it's located
back here and that's the 50 millimeter
let's check out the 20 the 20 millimeter
is up here now it's going to have you're
not gonna be able to see as far but
you're going to be able to see wider
kind of like when you zoom out so the
200 millimeter if I click on that look
how different it is the 200 millimeter
camera is way back here and it has a
really narrow field of view you can see
narrower but from farther away and
that's called telephoto the default
setting would be the 50 millimeter which
is the one right here in the middle so
this is 50 this is 20 and this way back
here is the 200 now there are different
angles so that we can are there a
different amounts of space away from the
middle here because that's how we're
going to be able to see them if I drag
this 200 millimeter camera up in
position I'm gonna have to hold shift
because it's so far away now if I keep
on dragging this up to where the 50
millimeter camera has then we look
through it this is what we're gonna see
way zoomed in and everything it's not
what we want so so the 200 millimeter
camera is good for scenes that have a
lot of 3d space in them that's far away
so you'll be able to zoom in with your
camera from far away let me put the
camera back where it was
I'm gonna press ctrl-z see if that's
where it was I have to look at the top
yeah that's probably where it was
we do now if I go into my active camera
view and come to my 20 millimeter into
my 20 millimeter camera view and I want
to show you what happens when you track
on the z axis which means going forward
now this is the 20 and I'm zooming in
just holding my left mouse button down
and zooming in and you can see how
fairly fast this goes when i zoom in now
let's go to the 20 millimeter camera and
I'm gonna try to zoom in and this is me
just holding the zoom in button and I
got to click and drag to like a whole
bunch of times to get anywhere now these
pink boxes here are my other cameras now
if I hold shift and zoom in I can zoom
in a lot faster so that's a tip with
your big or longer focal length cameras
so hopefully that explains focal length
to you so in short use the shorter focal
lengths for a wider angle shots that
don't have a lot of length in the 3d and
use the longer focal lengths for
telephoto shots where there's a lot of
3d space and that's it that's it thanks
for watching this tutorial in focal
length and check out some more tutorials
on cameras in the next few tutorials
that I'm gonna make see you later
