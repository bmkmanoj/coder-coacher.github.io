just go ahead and get started because
I'm going to be teaching you guys well a
couple different things the first thing
is a quick and easy way to assign a
value to multiple variables at once
doesn't sound that exciting but is going
to save you a whole bunch of time in
programming so let's go ahead and make
couple stupid variables an A and B and C
and of course whenever we want to assign
a single value to all of these variables
I don't know maybe we're making a game
in every player so it starts out with
the same amount of points or these are
be like a bunch of monsters with the
same amount of health or something what
we can do is of course do it the
old-fashioned way
a equals 100 B equals 1 oh my god it's
taking too long so we know that we can
do it that way but the way that I wanted
to show you is this what you can do is
I'll just type it out and then you're
probably going to understand just by
looking at it so what this is going to
do is it's pretty much just going to
read it from right to left so what your
computer sees is this take the value of
100 and assign it to C so now C equals
100 so whenever you do this take the
value of C which is 100 and assign it to
B B equals 100 take the value of B which
is 100 and assign it to a so now all of
your variables a B and C equal 100 don't
believe me you shouldn't because I lie a
lot but anyways I'll prove this one to
you so let's just go ahead and put I'll
just print out the won't do anything
fancy here
% D and a B C good to go so let me print
this out and check it out 100 100 100 so
again I know that this it isn't really
like handy right now but later on you're
going to see when we have a ton of
variables that we need to create for
programs we can do all in one line of
code
instead of like 50 lines so let me go
ahead and delete this stuff right now
and let's actually put this to use and
let me I don't know I'll make like a
quick program that can calculate the
average ages or something so say that we
had like three people and we wanted to
calculate their average age so we can
put flow h1 h2 h3 compact that now we
also need a float for average and might
as well stick that up there too so all
of our variables are fine on one line
now of course let's go ahead and just go
ahead how can we do this okay so the
first person the second person will say
have the same age so h1 and h2 will set
them both equal to four four years old
so maybe this is like my kindergarten
class so boy a and girl B are before
years old and then let's go ahead and
get the age of the user make this thing
interactive a little bit and we'll just
say enter your age bus that on a new
line and of course we need to give them
a way to actually enter their age if
we're asking them for it so again what
they're going to enter is store it in a
flow it's actually going to be stored in
this age three so percent F and remember
also that whenever you use a variable
that's not an array then you need to use
that little ampere sign and we're going
to store whatever value they entered in
age three so now we have all the data
that we need we only need to make one
other calculation and that's average and
of course we know how to figure out
averages h1 plus h2 plus h3 and take
that entire equation and throw it over
three and that's going to give you the
average age and now we just got to print
out the result on the screen
so we'll say and we actually probably
want to put this on a new line as well
that average age of the group is % F and
of course percent of is average so let's
go ahead and run this bad boy and check
it out
nothing is happening because my computer
is freaking slow but eventually it says
enter your age
so how old was I in kindergarten I think
I was a 42 and hit enter and it says the
average age of the group is sixteen
point six six six
okay I'm old I freaking get it well
basically you know my age guys that's
not even important don't worry about it
what I want to teach you is how we can
pretty much compact our code make it a
lot neater and save ourselves a whole
lot of typing so that's how you do it
cool little program to figure out your
average age and well then guys for
watching I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
