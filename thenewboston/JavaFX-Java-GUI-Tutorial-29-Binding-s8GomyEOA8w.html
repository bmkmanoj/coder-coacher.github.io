we understand the basics of properties
what I want to do is show you guys
something really awesome that you can do
them and that is how to take two
properties and bind them together so
what we're going to be doing in this
example is we're going to create an
integer property called X and another
one called Y and we're going to bind
them together now whenever we do this
both of those properties are pretty much
tied together or connected so whenever
we change the value of x the value of Y
gets changed automatically sounds kind
of weird but it's actually pretty easy
once you see everything so just like
before whenever we had a string property
we can also have an integer property of
course instead of storing a string it
stores an integer and I'm going to name
this X so set it equal to new simple
integer property and in here you give it
an initial value so right now I have an
object X and it has initial value of 3
so let me go ahead and make one more
call to Y and I'm not going to have any
initial value for this so as of now X is
equal to 3 and why does it equal
anything has a null value so what I'm
actually going to do with Y is I'm going
to bind it to the value of x and let me
just say I'm like multiply by 10 so the
value of Y is bound to the value of X
multiplied by 10 so they're tied
together connected in other words
whenever we update the value of x for
example 2 7 the value of y gets
automatically updated to 70 so pretty
cool we don't have to type any extra
code and that's one of the awesome
reasons that people like to learn about
property so system.out.print line
let me just print out a little demo so
you guys can see so I'll print out the
value of x and y each time and you guys
can clearly see what's going on so X get
value
and do the same thing for y so why get
value and then let me just add a new
line so it looks a little bit cleaner
all right so that's what we're going to
do at first and also if I copy this I'll
show you guys kind of the point of all
this so what we're going to do after we
print out that initial binding data is
we're going to take X and we'll say set
the value equal to something like a nine
and then print it out again so let me
run this and I'll show you guys what's
going on and by the way this has like
nothing to do with JavaFX or the windows
but I'm going to show you guys how you
can use this for Java FX in just a
second so what you can see is of course
X initial value of three nothing new
there and since Y is bound to the value
of x times ten that's why Y equals 30
now later on a few lines later what we
did is we took X and we set the value
equal to nine all right
now notice in code we never changed
value of Y all right so between here and
here we're not changing the value of Y
but since Y is always bound to X
multiply it by ten since X changed why
change with it pretty awesome so again
like I said this doesn't have anything
you know to do with like GUI development
but the reason that people like doing
this in Java FX is because let's say
that you want to like add something to
the middle of your window actually let
me run this so let's say that you have
this button and you want to always have
it in the middle of the window whenever
you expand kind of like it is right now
well what you can do is you can actually
bind this to the center of the width and
the center of the height so it doesn't
really matter what size this is it
always just looks for the center so
whether it's you know 640 by 640 or 900
by 900 they're always bound together
correctly and there's also like a
million
they're cool things that you can do with
it but that's one little quick example
but for right now
hopefully you guys understand the
concept of binding arm yeah any
questions ask me on the forum and I'll
see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
