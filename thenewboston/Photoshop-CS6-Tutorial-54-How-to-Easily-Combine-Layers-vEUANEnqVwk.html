Photoshop cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and today
we're going to be learning about how to
combine different layers and the actual
technical term in Photoshop is called
merging layers and there are a different
different kinds of ways to merge layers
such as merging down and merging all the
visible layers and things like that and
we'll go over everything in this
tutorial so merging layers lets you take
the characteristics of both layers and
combine them together so if you combine
a layer to the background layer then
it's going to add to the background
layer if you combine a layer that uses a
blending mode to another layer that
doesn't then both layers are going to
now have that new blending mode so
that's what merging does it also puts
like if you have two pictures and
they're both on separate layers you can
merge them together and just have them
on one layer see then you can transform
them together as a pair alright let's
get started so some of our merge options
are going to be in the layers options
panel so if we come to the layers panel
here and then come to the very top right
of it and click on our layers option
panel we now have some of our objects
here we've got I mean some of our
options here we've got merge down and
we've got merge visible here in the
options menu so all merge down means is
that it's going to merge from the layer
that you have selected and it's going to
merge into the next layer down so right
now I have this picture of Bucky here
where I'm flashing it right now and then
the layer below is the bass holding the
bass there so I'm just going to merge
down
oops and we noticed that we're not able
to merge down right now and it's grayed
out and we can't do anything so the
reason why that is is because this layer
here needs to be rasterized a layer
that's below so if we right-click on it
and go to rasterize layer that makes it
so it's now pixels F now if we go back
up to our layer that we want the merge
down with and then come to our options
we can now do it and now these two are
merged into one if I take my move tool
and move them around they move around as
one so I'm going to hit ctrl I'm going
to step back so that way they're not
merged anymore and I wanted to let you
know that there's a hotkey to quickly
merge down and that is ctrl e so if I
hold ctrl and i press E it's going to
merge down and you can see that they're
moved down and our merge together again
so that's a basically the merge down and
then the next thing I want to show you
is the merge visible option so merge
visible just takes everything that you
have that's visible which is these icons
here if they're off then they're not
visible if they're on then they are
visible so I'm just going to take some
of these and then turn them off so we've
got these two here that there are
visible and the background let me turn
the background off I don't want to have
that on I'll just put this up there or
something so now we have just these that
are visible let's go to the layer
options and then go to merge visible got
a rasterize there we go
merge visible and now all three of these
should be merged together now I'll put
these back on and let's move these yep
and all these are merged together which
is sweet so that's what merge visible
does and there's also another powerful
tool just called merge layers and
merging layers you can select whatever
layers you want they don't have to be as
visible they can be invisible whatever
you want so let me hide this one here
and then we'll try to merge that with
one that is visible so if I right click
we can find merge layers here and I can
merge them together and what happens is
that since the layer was invisible the
head Bucky on it it actually got clipped
out and now it is gone so that is like a
side effect of merging layers that
aren't visible so let's turn it back on
and now let's merge them merge layers
and now now that one's not invisible we
can they're now merged together and
actually have this together and actually
are together so that's a little bit
about marching layers there so it's kind
of the way to find these is kind of
goofy but if you right-click you can
find your merge down and merge visible
if you have a two of them selected and
then you right click the merge oops
me right-click the merge down becomes
merge layers as you can see there and
then you still have your merge visible
same thing with the options layer
options there you cannot do it that way
and as you can see that March visible
has shift ctrl + E as the hotkey so
that's all about merging layers use them
when you need to combine layers together
to
basically have them into one layer it
helps clean up things and it helps
pretty much add properties that other
layers have to another layer and combine
them together so thanks for watching
this video and I look forward to seeing
you guys in the next videos have a good
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
