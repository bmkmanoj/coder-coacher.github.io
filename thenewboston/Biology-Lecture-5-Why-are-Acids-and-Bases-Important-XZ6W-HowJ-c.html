your fifth biology tutorial and in this
tutorial I want to answer the question
that I asked you guys at the end of the
last video and that is why are we
learning about acids and bases it seems
like it's kind of like chemistry term
and we're talking about biology so what
the heck well remember a couple of
tutorials ago I said that every living
thing is made up of these smaller living
things called cells now a cell is
essentially just a bundle of chemicals
it's just organized in a very specific
and organized kind of way now in the
last video I said that an acid is a
molecule that splits apart in water
and whenever it does it releases a
hydrogen ion H+ now a base is
essentially the same thing except when
the base splits part and water it
releases hydroxide which is o h- the
important thing to remember is that
these are charged particles and a cell
remember is basically just a bunch of
chemicals organized in a very specific
careful kind of way now if you're
familiar with chemistry and chemical
reactions you know that anytime you want
to mess up a chemical you need to throw
some charged particles into the mix and
that's what happens whenever you have
charged particles from acids and bases
in your body so whenever you drink a
bunch of battery acid or eat a bunch of
baking soda this is what happens the
molecules are going to split apart and
cause these charged ions and they're
going to react with the chemicals inside
the cells and they're either going to
break apart the chemical bonds or mess
them up in some kind of way and that is
why it's usually not a good idea to
drink battery acid so just remember that
because of acids and bases causing
charged particles they interfere with
the chemical bonds in living organisms
and mess them up or sometimes they don't
kill the cells completely but they can
cause diseases in the organisms and I'm
going to be talking about those specific
diseases later on but for right now this
is all you have to remember now on the
topic of you know acids bases in charged
particles I want to show you guys
something really cool that's going to
help you remember these charged
particles
and that is well just think about this
well what does happen whenever you do
have an acid or base in your body your
body needs to kind of correct that
problem or get rid of it somehow so say
that you had an acid like H+ which is a
hydrogen ion in your body
how would your body get rid of it well
what your body does it actually combines
it with the product from a base which is
remember o H negative in other words a
hydroxide so whenever you combine this
and this check out what happens we end
up with can you guys guess h2o freakin
water how amazing is that and I show
this to people all the time and they're
kind of well kind of amazed in a way
because it's kind of weird that
obviously your body needs water you
should drink a lot of water all the time
and it's very beneficial to your body
however whenever you have the product
from an acid or base such as a hydrogen
ion or a hydroxide that it's so harmful
to your body however when these two
combine they form something that's very
beneficial to your body so you know you
really don't need to remember this but
it's kind of cool understanding the two
harmful things from acids and bases can
form something so beneficial to your
body and you know just cool little you
know thing that you can remember many
ways in the next tutorial what I want to
do is I want to cover something called
the pH scale it's going to be awesome so
I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
