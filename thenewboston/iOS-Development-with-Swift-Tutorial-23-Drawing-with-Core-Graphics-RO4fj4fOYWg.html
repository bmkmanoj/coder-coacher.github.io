video in this tutorial actually in the
next couple tutorials I'm going to talk
to you guys about drawing graphics on
the screen and probably like the next
two or three videos or just going to be
drunk simple shapes lines I'm going to
show you guys like in this video how to
draw a green line and if you guys are
like alright that sounds pretty boring
so I'm going to skip these videos I
can't picture in my app when I'm going
to need a stinking green line in that
well not so fast because the concepts
I'm going to be teaching you guys in the
next couple of videos they seem really
simple and you may think that you're
never going to use them but later on
when we learn how to make things like
computer games or well games were like
the iPad or iPhone whatever all of these
concepts that I'm going to be showing
you guys they come into play and you
need them to understand the bigger
picture so again even though these next
couple examples are going to be like
okay a red circle nothing cool about
that later on when we're making games
trust me you will thank me so what I did
already is I've made a brand new project
I just named it draw examples and just a
single view application I set the
devices to universal nothing new and the
first thing I actually want to do is
this I'm going to make an entirely new
file specifically for drung so we're
really not going to be using this view
controller too much so if you right
click draw examples or whatever you
named your project you can hit new file
and what we want to do I guess you can't
move that down all right so an iOS
source choose cocoa touch class and
click Next now what am I going to name
that just uh I know I do
draw examples keep things really simple
alright so another thing I want to point
out make sure that you inherit from UI
view I think this is something it might
be UI view controller by default UI view
is the class that we want to inherit
from so we're going to be a subclass of
that and of course we're working with
Swift next and the default location
is good great and boom so it should
appear right here again if you click
this folder then it'll um put it in the
right place if you didn't then go back
and do it again but here we go
as you can see well I'll explain this
later but for now what we need to do is
we need to hook up our screen to this so
if you hop over to your storyboard then
we can actually keep this by default
because we'll just run our simulator to
show whatever we want but what we want
to do is with your storyboard selected
go to the identity inspector and make
sure that you have your view selected so
click somewhere in this white area and
change the class to draw examples or
whatever you named that class so all
right we created a class we now hooked
up this view to it and we should be good
so if you go back to draw examples Swift
then check this out
first of all I'm going to play all these
top comments because they are annoying
me and for here it says ok only override
draw rect
if you perform custom drawing well
that's what we want to do so let's go
ahead and delete these right now so I'm
going to delete this first comment right
there
and it gave me like kind of a comment
within a comment so we can actually just
delete all the comments there we go and
if you accidentally deleted that then
you can just type it out but it gives
you this one method by default this one
function in here so what the heck is it
draw rect all right so all I can do in
here is draw a bunch of rectangles
that's kind of dumb well believe it or
not draw rect it isn't for sure on
rectangles it's for any drawing or any
graphics that you want to add you can
write a method I'm going to show you
guys in just a second inside this
function so we can of course we can draw
a rectangle if we want to in here but we
also draw circles and lines and we can
draw um what else like we can actually
put images in here like I can put an
image of my face and draw it on the
screen um cool things for games so they
can interact with each other everything
is going to go inside this draw rect
method so how do we draw crap on the
screen well it's kind of um I don't want
to say like a three-step process but the
first thing we always need to do is get
a context now I'll just write this the
context is the object used for drawing
what do I mean by that well we need to
draw something on the screen and it's
like okay I you have to give me like
some information of what you want to
draw do you want to draw something blue
do you want it to be a line ask where
your context is where you set all of
that so in this example I'm going to get
the context and we'll just give us some
basic settings like set the width of it
to I don't know like three points and
set the stroke to like green or blue
whatever but it's kind of like a really
fancy paintbrush that you can draw
kokrak crap with but it's I say really
fancy because you can use it to draw
like pictures and stuff too so if you
just make a variable called context what
you do is you set this equal to uij
graphics get current context right there
so this is not as well what this does is
it just gives you um a customizable
object or that really fancy paintbrush
and it is now stored in context so once
you have that right now it's just blank
it doesn't have any settings whatsoever
so let's go ahead and apply a couple
settings to it so it knows how to draw
so the first one is CG context I hate
there there's so many methods of context
set
line width so of course this is going to
say okay first of all what are you
trying to set it on the context and what
is the width of it and we'll just say
3.0 um don't go like above 7 or else
it's going to be really thick 3.0 is
pretty good should show up good on the
tutorials so now we can draw lines with
three-point thickness so let's go ahead
and give a color right now so CG and
this is set stroke color with color
right there so what this does is it
gives a color to our context which is
our drawing object and the color this is
actually kind of weird it's UI color dot
and what color do I want let's go
I don't know purple color why the heck
not there's like purple color green
color red color blue color pretty much
all the ones you want to think of and
later on if you guys are like well I
kind of have a weird color to like match
your background on my website then I'm
trying to draw I'll show you guys how to
set RGB values if you need to be more
specific but for right now you can just
like choose red purple whatever and the
last thing is we need to make sure that
this is a cg color property right like
that so now we have our paintbrush
taking care of that context that's three
thickness three points and it's purple
so now what it will whatever we draw
it's going to be that setting so the
first thing we have to do to draw this
is we need to give it a path so this is
going to sound weird but what we're
going to do is we're going to make an
invisible path first and then the next
step we have to say okay fill this in so
it's not like in real life where you do
it all at the same time you're pretty
much making a blueprint of where you
want to draw and then you say okay now
fill it in so I'll just write create a
path right there and
it's CG context move to point so right
now we're just giving it a starting
point and it's really simple so what are
you trying to move that context and
where are you trying to move it well I'm
just go ahead and put it at fifty sixty
now here's a good time to explain the
coordinate system so it's I know like
what annoys me is that every single like
um software or programming language I
teach whenever I'm drunk stuff on the
screen the coordinate system is always
different but this coordinate system it
starts in the top left so 50 50 just
imagine that this is our screen right
here so 0 0 would be right here
50 points over and 60 points down that's
our starting point so again it starts in
the top left and it goes right and then
down so if we just said zero zero right
here which might as well just do that
for right here it's going to start right
here so now let me um give it an ending
point in that cg context add a line to
point so this does is it makes a
straight line from wherever it currently
is to a new point on the screen so from
zero zero to will say like um we'll go
250 across and 320 down so now we have
kind of a diagonal line that looks like
this kind of a 45 degree angle but not
quite so now that we have that invisible
path we can do the one last line of code
actually draw the path and that is CG
Wow I cannot freakin type context okay
you know what I'm going to dropkick my
computer in like two seconds
context stroke path and now saying okay
what this method does is it just
actually draws the line what line are
you trying to draw well that context one
and the reason that we need to add this
parameter is because if we I don't know
made another line or something it
wouldn't be able to differentiate
between them so now I'm just going to
tighten this bad boy up switch to iPhone
5 and drop and hopefully it works all
right so check this out we give it a
purple color
we started at zero zero which was the
top left and it went over to 50 down 320
and once it had that path this last line
I filled it in so just so this is a
little bit easier to see let me start it
like actually let me start it like 30 30
30 30 and I'll go to like 150 320 all
right so 30 over 30 down that's our
starting point 150 over 320 down that's
our ending point so I know that all this
is a little overwhelming the first is
like context and then everything goes in
a draw rect for some reason even though
we aren't even drawing rectangles but I
promise um we're going to be focusing on
this topic a lot so if you feel
overwhelmed and now it actually gets a
lot easier that was probably the hardest
tutorial with this a little mini series
so for now thank eyes for watching don't
forget subscribe and I will see y'all in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
