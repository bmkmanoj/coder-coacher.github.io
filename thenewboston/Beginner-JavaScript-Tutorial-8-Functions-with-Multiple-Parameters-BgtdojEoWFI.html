think it's your eighth the least
who's countin welcome to your eighth
JavaScript tutorial and in this tutorial
I'm adjusting right now probably should
have done that before I started then
again I probably should have found out
what story oh I'm doing too but anyways
welcome to your eighth tutorial in
JavaScript and in this tutorial I'm
going to be talking about how to use
multiple parameters with your function
so let's go ahead and make function
right now and I'm going to name mine
apples because I'm kind of in the mood
for some applesauce right now and let's
go ahead and give it two parameters in
order to give it two parameters inside
your parentheses instead of just writing
the name of one variable you write the
name of however many variables you need
separated with the comma so if you have
two variables you separate them with one
comma so I have a variable I have a
variable called one and I have a
variable called two now inside the body
of my function let's go ahead and use
both of those variables on document
right we'll just go ahead and write
something like one is better than and
actually need some spaces is better than
add two so now you can see that this is
where I taught you guys how to add
strings to variables this is one
instance where it would come in handy
and another cool thing that I didn't
teach you guys yet but any time you add
a string of a HTML tag or XHTML tag it
actually will treat that not as text but
actually treat that is the tag itself so
whenever it comes across this right here
it's actually going to break aka movie
to the next line so that's a neat little
trick that you guys might want to
remember so anyways we have a function
called apples so now let's go ahead and
actually call or use this function in
order to call a function you just go
ahead and type the function name
anywhere in your program and then you
write what other information that it
needs so this function we already know
it needs two pieces of information so
let's give it two pieces of information
I'm going to give it my name is a
variable and is the other variable it
needs I'm going to give it the name of
my cousin Hobart so let's go ahead and
save this and refresh and see what we
get Bucky is better than Hobart so what
it did is it said all right we have this
function that takes two pieces of
information so whenever we're running
our program and we said that we want to
use this information it's going to say
all right
what variable are you going to use as
number one okay
Bucky got it now what variable are you
going to use is the variable to Hobart
got it check so Bucky is better than
Hobart makes sense you gave us both the
pieces of information we need we're good
to go
so we can also call this function
multiple times and it you know runs the
same exact way so let me think of
Saban's
counting crows is better than I don't
know Bieber and let's go ahead and write
like a strawberry is better than coconut
by the way guys nice little piece of
information I absolutely hate coconuts I
can't stand the smell of it I can't
stand the sight of it I can't even wash
my hair with coconut shampoo it makes me
gag so if I ever see you you know
walking down the street and you have
coconuts then ah you know don't be
discouraged that I don't talk to you
it's not you it's the coconuts so let's
go ahead and save this refresh it and
see what we get Bucky's better than
Hobart Counting Crows is better than
beaver should be are better strawberry
is better than coconut which is true all
of these things are true same ways back
to our program what it did is it
substitute the first one for one
and the second one for two and then
inside our function it just substituted
those variables forever we had out here
and again these are called the
parameters and whenever we're giving
this information or substituting it it's
called passing information into your
parameters so again if you're watching
these tutorials because you were taking
the JavaScript class at school and you
couldn't understand your teacher that's
the questions that they're going to ask
on the test and that's the information
that you need to know parameters passing
it in so there you go but if you're just
watching this then I don't even worry
about it as long as your program works
you're good to go
so thank you guys for watching don't
forget subscribe don't forget to check
out my website my other videos and don't
forget to check me out if you see my on
the street so yeah i guess i'll see you
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
