so here is it how it goes in the
timeline pci then AGP came out then the
PCI Express came out and those are get
faster and faster as we go on so now
talking about the pci express these are
the cards i would recommend getting but
again just because they want to make
things real confusing for you they give
you a bunch of PCI Express options the
first is the regular pci express or pci
express times one you might see it as
when you're buying car this is the old
um pci and although it's a it's about
two two and a half times faster than an
AGP I would not recommend giving a PCI
Express regular because there are better
options out there now another thing I
want to take note before I finish going
over the rest of your PCI expresses your
motherboard is going to support a GP or
PCI Express it's not going to support
both of them so when you choose a
motherboard make sure you get one that
says pci express with an interface you
want now again i told you i want to
recommend getting peace and express
because there are better options out
there those better options are pci
express x 16 which is even faster than
pci express and the top of the line
right now is called pci express 2.0 x 16
i know it's real confused in between pci
express I'm 16 and pci express 2.0 x 16
but pci express 2.0 x 16 delivers even
more power than anything else so that's
what you want to stick to one buying a
video card and it's not that expensive
compared to the other ones and you're
going to be it's going to be compatible
for a long time it's a newest video card
out there so again you want pci express
2.0 x 16 this is the fastest video card
it's not that expensive out there right
now so get it now
once you get that make sure that your
motherboard supports pci express 2.0 x
16 make sure it has those slots in it
and then you're going to be able to put
your video garden now that we got your
video card and make sure it's compatible
with your motherboard it's going to work
no matter what but you just don't want
to go out buying any pci express to 10 x
16 motherboard here are a couple things
or it's our video card here a couple
things you want to look for when buying
a video card</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
