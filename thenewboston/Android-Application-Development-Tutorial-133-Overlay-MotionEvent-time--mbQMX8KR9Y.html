tutorial for the new Boston well we're
just gonna work with this touch event
that we're getting from our overlay
class and some of the question or one of
the questions that you guys might be
asking is hey can I just do something
like map dot set onclicklistener
and then create a click method or set a
touch method the problem is again like I
told you guys in last tutorial is the
map is already handling so much stuff
that when we try to add like a click
listener it's not going to properly work
so that's again why we want to use the
overlay class to handle some of those
events and I just pulled up briefly kind
of the overlay Javadoc that kind of
tells you the methods that we can use
and there's a draw method that we might
get into on a key down on key up on tap
and on touch event which is what we're
going to be working with we're still
gonna kind of reference the keydown and
keyup but in a different way through the
event motion event so that's kind of
what's uh what methods overlay class has
for now there's a few different types of
overlays which we'll get into but again
we have this on touch method or on touch
event method and what we're gonna do is
we're gonna set up some variables and
they're both gonna be long so we're
gonna say a long starting point or just
start and we're gonna set this actually
let's set this up at the top yeah it
looks like I already did
so just create two new variables start
and stop and what that's gonna do is
when we press down on our map which is
actually our overlay that we're pressing
down it's gonna create a start starting
point we're going to get kind of the
time when we hit the down button and
when we release and we're that's gonna
be our stop and then we're gonna - those
I'll just get into I don't wanna you
know sometimes that gets confusing my
trying to explain things before we
actually do them so let's just get into
it so again what we want in this touch
what this touch event method is going to
give us is the
motion event in the map view so let's
reference the motion event when we say
the motion is pressed down so we're just
gonna say if and then our event we
called e get action is equal to the
motion event dot action down again this
will be when we're pressing down on our
overlay what we're gonna do is we're
gonna get the starting point or the time
for the most part when that event
happens so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna set our start equal to e dot get
event time which is a new method that we
haven't used yet that's probably the
sole you know he key point of this
tutorial is just getting the event time
when an event happens so that's pretty
you know it's pretty good method even
for like games and stuff like that if
you want to judge the philosophy
velocity of you know how fast someone
moves from one point to the next you can
do it this way but again we're gonna set
up another if statement when they
release so we're gonna say e dot get fit
get fit get action equals motion event
dot action action up alright right there
so now when we release we're gonna set
up our ending points so we're just gonna
say stop is equal to again our event
when this event happens action up
happens dot get event time and lastly
all we're gonna do is subtract this time
from this time and if it's greater than
you know like a second and a half then
we're gonna we're gonna do some sort of
a method which we're gonna create allert
dialogue which we kind of talked about
but we're gonna go into a little bit
more depth in the next tutorial but so
what we're gonna say a stop - start as
long as that's greater than one and a
half seconds again it's in milliseconds
here so this is one and a half
seconds we're going to perform an action
well I'm not even leave a comment cuz
it's getting late and I don't really it
doesn't really matter but here's again
this is all we're doing for this
tutorial is we have our event which is
an overlay type because we extend
overlay and we get the motion event and
we're going to get when they press down
and when they press up and if that total
time is greater than one and a half
seconds we're going to do something here
otherwise it's going to return false
that this this hasn't been handled for
the most part but that's pretty much it
for this tutorial again guys I'll
kitchen the next one we're going to get
into alert alert dialogue a little bit
more in depth than we have it because
the last time I used it I thought I
explained it earlier but I don't think I
did so I'll catch you guys in that
tutorial and have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
