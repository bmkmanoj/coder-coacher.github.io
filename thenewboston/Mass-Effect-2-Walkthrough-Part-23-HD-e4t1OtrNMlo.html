an honor to have you on board yes very
exciting cerberus working with aliens
unexpected elusive man branching out
baby not so human centric the collectors
have been abducting colonists from the
fringes of the terminus systems no
distress signals are sent out no signs
of attack there's virtually no evidence
that anything unusual happened at all
except that every man woman and child is
gone gasps maybe no sweats too slow
airborne virus no you don't have to sit
there and guess we've collected samples
from one of the colonies I'd like you to
analyze them and figure out how the
collectors did this yes of course
analyzed the samples are going to need a
lab there's a fully equipped lab on the
combat death professor solace if you
find anything laughing please place a
requisition order who's that pilot no
synthesized boys simulated emotional
inflections could it be no make me have
to ask is that an AI this ship is
equipped with an artificial intelligence
at AI on board non-human crew members
Cerberus more desperate than I thought
the collectors have taken tens of
thousands of colonists will do whatever
we have to do to find and stop them yes
of course can't risk being captured like
colonists need to identify neutralized
technology need samples which way to the
lab follow me professor
Shepherd how can I help any ideas on
other ways to prepare for the collectors
ideas yes expensive but possibly
valuable can show you
let me know if upgrades seem feasible
can install them whenever you like I'll
let you work will be here if you need me
