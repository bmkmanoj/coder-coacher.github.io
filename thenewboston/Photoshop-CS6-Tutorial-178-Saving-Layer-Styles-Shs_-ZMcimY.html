Photoshop cs6 tutorial my name is buddy
Blackford today we're going to learn how
to create a customized layer style and
then save it for future use and then
we're going to be able to apply it to
some text again if we need to so the
first thing you need to have open is you
want to have your Styles tab open so go
to a window and then go to styles and
make sure it's checked and it'll pop
open somewhere around here so right now
I've got this text here and it's got
these different styles so I got bevel
inner shadow setting gradient and drop
shadow on it
and what I want to do is save this for
future use because I'm gonna be using a
lot of text like this in my next project
so I'm gonna hit new style and I'm just
gonna name this glass I'm gonna hit OK
oh I'm gonna hit OK over here and then I
can exit out of this and now you can see
that the glass style has appeared right
here and yet even shows up with its name
on the pop-up so if I wanted to create
some new text inside this one
so I've got new text right there and I'm
gonna apply the style to it and you can
see that it changes it to the text that
I have it even added it even made sure
that the fill was at zero and the
opacity was at a hundred percent because
before that the fill was at a hundred
percent so it even saved that kind of
stuff so that's really useful when
you're doing that kind of things or
those kind of things like if you have a
stroke and you wanted to be the same
exact size for everything go ahead and
save that in your styles and it'll be
quick and easy to use so that was really
easy you just save your style in your
effects panel under new style and then
you just drag from your Styles panel on
to your layer so that's awesome and it's
really quick and easy and it's makes
your life a lot easier when you're
working with a lot of different things
that use the same styles so that's it
that's all I wanted to show you on how
to create your customized layer styles
and how to apply them to the lair so
thanks a lot for watching the tutorial
and I'll see you in the next one have a
good one everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
