slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're gonna be
working more on the card program now if
you don't know what this is and this
code isn't familiar to you you might
want to move back to the beginning of
the program so let's go ahead and get
started let's come down here
and we'll go ahead and minimize our
sports car class so we'll just call it
it sports car and then we'll come on
class ok so now let's make a truck class
so we're gonna go ahead and define our
class so I'll just call it truck and
we'll add car to simplify it so we know
that it inherits from the car class so
to make it inherit all this stuff that
the car class has we just want to type
inherits car so now everything car has
we can use now let's add some stuff in
here to that's specific to a truck so
let's go ahead and create an enumeration
so private in them and then we'll just
do bed length for the length of the
truck bed as let's do integer so we need
to fill this with some values so we'll
set short equal to 0 so if they have a
short bed it's going to be equal to 0
and we need to do short bed Mika's short
is a keyword in Visual Basic and it
doesn't like it when we use that so
we'll do medium bed equals 1 and long
bed equals 2 so now that we have our bed
link a new bed length enumeration let's
go ahead and make a cab size enumeration
so what's go ahead and comment this
so we got short medium and long and
they'll do cab lling enumeration okay so
we'll start off by declaring this
private so private enum it'll do cab
length as and we'll do it of type
integer again and we will set single
equal to zero and it looks like we are
getting an error again because single is
a keyword - we'll do an extended cab and
let's just do one more so let's do
something like what a Tundra would have
a crew max so we've got C okay single
cab extend cab and crew max so now what
we need to do is create a variable or
two variables that will store values
from these enumerations so we'll just
type private truck bed length and then
we'll do it of type bed length so as
bendling and then we'll go ahead and do
the cab length so private truck cab
length as cab length okay so now we've
got two data types of our enumerations
they're going to store some information
about our truck so what we need to do is
create some properties that will allow
that will allow us to get these and set
these so we'll just type public
property and they will do let's go ahead
and call it the bed length so and then
we want it to be of type bed length
okay so now we need to do is we need to
add some parentheses right here we'll
type get and it'll fill in the rest of
it for us so what do we want to get we
need to go ahead and return truck bed
length so whenever they access this
property is going to give them back the
bed link so what are we going to set it
we're going to type if value is greater
than or equal to zero and value is less
than or equal to two then go ahead and
set the bed length to that
so we'll type truck bed length equals
value okay so if you remember before I
pause this right here we were getting an
error right here under bed length now
this was causing some problems with
being able to access that enumeration
because of the inheritance and some
other stuff that I'm not going to go
into right now but what we need to do to
fix this is we'll just go ahead and take
our enumerations
and we're just going to take them out of
our truck class and we will put them in
the namespace itself so now it's in the
namespace we're getting another error so
what we need to do to just get rid of
that error is take out the private key
word because this is an inside of any
class so we have our new enumeration cab
length in our enumeration bed length so
now this will work as we intended it to
so low side gets and sets the bed length
so now we're going to need to do this
again for the cab link so gets and sets
truck cab lengths so we'll type public
property the cab length and what we're
gonna need to do is set it of type cab
length so the reason we made these
enumerations is to keep out certain
values and make it easier to use our
code so what type in get here it's gonna
fill in the rest for us so to get it all
we have to do is return truck cab length
and to set it once again we're going to
use an if statement to see if it is a
valid number so what was type if value
is greater than or equal to zero and
value is less than or equal to two then
go ahead and set the the cab length so
truck cab length is going to be equal to
value</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
