welcome to another sweet tutorial and in
this one I'm actually going to be
teaching you guys how to make a physics
puzzle game using construct two now if
you're unfamiliar with a genre it's
basically a game just like Angry Birds
we're going to have a cannon and we're
going to be flinging meatballs out of it
and we're also going to build a tower
like a wooden block tower and try to
knock it down and reach a target so I
actually uploaded all of the files and
put them on my forums so if you're
watching this on youtube click right
under the video there's a link right now
that says um I don't know like download
images here or whatever I decide to call
it and if you click it it's going to
take you to this just right click all of
these hit save image as again you got
this one right here let me just my seat
so you got this one right here which is
basically the land we're going to be
building everything we're going to be
building the cannon on the left hand
side flinging the meatballs over and
knocking the tower down on the right so
these are the blocks that were going to
be building this is the target I just
have my face because you know what thing
better to shoot than my face
this hand blaster I called it must be a
you know an awesome cannon that's where
we're going to be flinging the meatballs
out of of course we need a meatball in
this blue square and I'll tell you guys
why we need that later
so again if you're watching this on my
website then head over to the forum and
they're in the game design forum and if
you're watching on youtube click down
right click save all these so now at the
end you should have a folder that looks
like this with all of your crap in it
except this one so now let's go ahead
and rip open construct two and also I
want to mention this if this is your
very first time using construct 2 then
please check out my other videos first
because this one's going to be a little
more advanced I'm going to assume you
guys already know how to do basic things
like import sprites and work with the
event sheet so I really want to just
cover the logic of physics and how to
make a physics puzzle game not really
the basics of construct 2 so make sure
your again if you're just a beginner
then check
Foreman or check out my other videos so
now that we open this just go ahead and
click new project new empty project and
the first thing that I want to do is
actually change that layout size because
right now 3 scroll out we can see that
it's kind of like the same shape is a
piece of paper but this game right here
is going to be longer like shorter or
not as tall and a lot wider so the size
of this background image is actually a
little bit bigger then we're going to
have the layout many ways we'll control
a 0 get back to normal in your layout so
again to change the size of the layout
just go ahead and click anywhere on the
white which is your layout and I'm going
to change my size to 1500 by 480 pixels
now you can see it gives you a nice long
layout the exact size that we need for
this game and now once we have our
layout change we can go ahead and import
that background image so double click
this and I'm just going to go ahead and
select tiled background I don't know if
you guys are using them a tiled
background or you know if you're making
your own game or you're going to use my
images but it'll work for either one so
double click this and just click
anywhere on your screen for now hit this
folder icon and navigate to this
background hit open and close in this
little warning is just saying whenever
you're making a tiled background it's
good to use it in multiples of 32 like
32 64 or anything doubled because it's
just a construct 2 is able to work with
those easier but this is going to be
fine since we're just using one big
image and now once this is selected the
first thing I want to do is change the
position property to 0 0 hit enter and
all that does is it but sit up in the
top left corner nice and snug and I also
want to change the size of this to 1500
by 480 the same size is the layout and
hit enter and also there's a little bit
of this image that gets cropped down
here but it's just some more of the
around it's not important and I actually
like it that way because that way you
know I don't want like half the screen
taken up to be taken up with ground so
this is pretty sweet right here and
actually to tell you the truth the
background image is now completely done
so just to make sure that we don't
accidentally edit it or anything like
that I think it would be a good idea to
lock it right now so in your layers
panel right here right next to projects
go ahead and rename layer 0 to
background now once that's done you can
lock that now as you can see just like
before you can't select it or anything
perfect so now let's go ahead and add a
new layer name this bad boy game and of
course make sure that this layer is
selected from now on this is where we're
going to be building all our stuffs our
cannon are the meatballs are going to be
flinging out all of the cool stuff is
going to happen on this game layer so
again make sure you have this one
selected and once you do let's head over
to the layer properties and I want to
show you guys one thing what's going to
happen is we want to change this
parallax property to 160 by 160 and hit
enter now just to give you guys a real
quick description of what the parallax
property is it's basically the camera
speed for the layer so the faster your
camera is the faster it is allowed to
move around your layer so by default it
was a little slow um if you have it like
a 0/0 didn't you camera doesn't move at
all so that's why it's really good for
like heads-up displays and um like
health bars and stuff like that but
since we're going to be following the
meatball flinging through the air with
the camera that's why I wanted to speed
it up a little bit to make sure that um
it has enough speed and also if you add
too much speed then it just like it
looks like you just sped like your
camera's like speed a grand screen so
you don't want that so now that we got
the parallax properties done we can go
ahead and start importing all that crap
we need so double-click anywhere on your
layout and choose sprite insert and
we'll just insert these one at a time
and hopefully you guys know how to do
this just load an image and do the block
looks good and actually the shortcut the
easier way to do this so we'll call me
my just hearing things
alright basic same buckyball cannon what
else we got the meatball and the square
close out of those so again let's go
ahead and rename these one by one this
one is called the block is basically the
pieces we're going to be making the
tower out of this one buckyball I'll
actually name this target ball since
that's a target that we're aiming for
that's the thing that we hope to blow up
now this its name cannon which that's
works right now this one is named
meatball so that's we're going to be
shooting out of the cannon and this one
is called square pretty sweet and I
think we're good to go
so actually the one other thing that I
want to make sure that we do in this
tutorial is actually if we double click
anywhere on the layout and we scroll
down to Mouse right here and hit insert
what we now just did is basically added
um mouse input to the game so now we can
use Mouse events click around the screen
and construct 2 is going to be able to
recognize that so we pretty much have
our layout in our game the very basic
setup our project is setup so in the
next tutorial what I want to do is I
want to begin working on the logic
specifically um showing you guys how to
add that mouse input and how to move the
cannon around with your mouse so you can
pretty much aim it where you want
but for now thank you guys for watching
and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
