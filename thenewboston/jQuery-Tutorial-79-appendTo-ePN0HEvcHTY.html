and this is a video tutorial for the new
Boston now in the last video we take
took a look at the manipulation
functionality of jQuery and we looked at
app end and we looked at how to append a
particular value from a textbox onto a
the end of a sentence inside a paragraph
tag so if you haven't already looked to
that go ahead and take a look at that
now we're going to take a look at append
to now let's just say we have a
paragraph just up here and I'm going to
give this an ID ID of Perak graph 1 I'm
gonna go ahead and I'm gonna copy and
paste that here and I'm just gonna call
this paragraph 2 I'm gonna put some
contents inside paragraph 1 so this is a
paragraph what I'm going to do is I'm
going to allow a button to then take
this and append it to the end of here so
Oh in actual fact we'll do this example
I'll put my name here and my name is on
a space here so eventually what I want
to do is click a button and I want this
paragraph here to be appended to the end
of this paragraph here so instead of
going through the process of taking the
elements contents what I actually want
to do is reference this paragraph 1 and
append it to the end of paragraph 2 so
let's go ahead and up here just create a
paragraph and inside of this create an
input field or a button sorry
I'm going to give this a value of a pens
too and the idea of this
I'll call append okay so inside a pen
CAS which we have included on our page
we can go ahead and create an event
handler for this button and then go
ahead and use the append to function to
append this paragraph here to this
paragraph here let's go ahead and create
our event handler first so we've called
the button append so when the button is
clicked we want to carry out a
particular function and inside this
function block let's just bring it down
a moment we want to append this first
paragraph to the second paragraph so we
reference the first paragraph which is
para graph 1 and then we use dot append
to instead of just append on its own and
then we can simply choose another
element on the page so this is obviously
paragraph 2 so now when we click the
button paragraph 1 will be appended to
the end of paragraph 2 let's just open
up our browser and take a look at this
okay so we've got Alex just here when we
click append to this Alex here it should
be referenced and appended to the end of
here let's go ahead and click it okay so
you can see that we have a slight
problem and that is the fact that I have
Alex inside of a paragraph let's just go
back and change this and I'm going to
change this here to a span because then
we'll have the contents all on one line
let's just change this here to span and
this just a paragraph and we'll go ahead
and change these names accordingly
okay so that was my mistake the example
looked a bit odd okay so now when we
click append - you can see it now says
my name is Alex now you'll also notice
that the first this span has actually
been moved rather than just cloned and
appended to the end of here
so what we're actually doing is we're
taking one element and we're appending
the whole of the element onto the end of
another so you can under you can sort
start to see how useful this would be in
a more practical application if you were
actually taking values and you wanted to
place them for example if you had a user
that was for example constructing
something constructing a sentence or you
know something along them nines or maybe
you had something like a menu builder
that built menus up you might want to
append the different menu items the
subcategories onto the main menu
there's the uses for append to are
really unlimited obviously against your
imagination so what we've taken is we've
taken this span here and we've appended
it essentially removed it and placed it
here and that's what you see on the page
so let's just take a look at the page
source you can see that we've got the
spot now it's it won't show because
we've obviously using jQuery and that's
not going to show up in the source but
essentially this is what would have
happened this is the cut the result of
when we used the append - by appending
this span onto that paragraph</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
