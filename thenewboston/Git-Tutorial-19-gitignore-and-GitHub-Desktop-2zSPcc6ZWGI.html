know it's been like two years since I
made the last get tutorial but I am
actually going to in a few weeks take my
entire website and put it on github make
it open source something like it might
as well continue those --get Orioles
that I was working on like two years ago
so here I am and another thing I want to
mention is that I don't have the repo
that I made in the last video because
like I said it was like two years ago I
got a new computer so I made this one
real quick so I just went create new new
repository and I just named it dogs so
that's my starting point for this video
and before we get started the one other
thing I'm going to mention is I'm
actually going to use desktop github if
you go to this website right here you
can download a free kind of gooey github
program and the reason I'm doing this
for the rest of the get up tutorials is
because instead of having to learn the
command line and then also learn about
github itself I think that's going to be
a lot of information if I just throw to
you guys all at once so instead we're
just going to keep it simple and I just
want to focus on github itself and you
know navigating around and what all of
these things do so I think it'll be
easiest if we just use the GUI version
so go ahead and download this and again
I'm not going to show you guys how to
install it because it is incredibly easy
just double click in hit next next
whatever and you're going to get I'll
show you the icon that pops up you're
going to get this icon on your desktop
so once you double click that this is
what's going to pop up all right so we
have the desktop GUI beautiful-looking
version of github desktop so the first
thing you need to do is you need to
login of course and that just links this
desktop program to your github account
so I already logged in now once you do
that what we want to do is is we
essentially just want to take this repo
that we made and we just made it
completely on github and we actually
want to download it so we can work on
add files you know just pretty much just
work on the website work on a project so
how do we do that
well what we do is we click this little
plus button on the top left and you
probably are only going to have this one
account right here I have an
organization out I'll talk to you guys
about organizations later on but
basically click your username and then
click clone and as long as you have a
repository on your github account then
you can go ahead and select that and
then click clone so again what this is
going to do is it's going to download it
to your own computer and now it's saying
ok so you have some files or a
repository on github I'm downloading
onto your local computer where do you
want me to stick it well we are just
going to stick this on where am I going
to stick it might as well just put it on
my desktop so just select desktop right
here or wherever you want to put it and
click OK
so that's pretty much just going to
download it and boom look at this so it
downloaded this and even though it's
empty right now we can see that it is
indeed a git repository it's already
initialized looking sweet so let's go
ahead and add some files to here so we
have something to actually look at so
open up whatever text editor you want to
use and I'm just going to make one
homepage for now so I'm just going to
right click in hit new HTML file
index.html and I already copied some
sample source code and there you go so
nothing too special right here so once
you have anything in there you can even
put sample text file it really doesn't
matter just go ahead and save it now
whenever you open up github for Windows
you're going to see this file right here
index.html now if you're just using
notepad or something like that then
that's the only file you're going to see
which is great but the thing is I have
all of these files idea idea all these
settings files now the reason I have
those and you probably don't is because
this IDE this program that I use to edit
code it's kind of a special and it has a
bunch of weird features but what it does
every time you open
up a project or open up any you know
website to edit it makes a bunch of
default settings files and this is
usually great because I love that IDE
but for this tutorial I'm like a man now
I have all that weird stuff in I really
don't want to add that to my github
repository so you have a couple options
right here you can just go ahead and
uncheck all of these every single time
you want to update github or what you
can do is this you can actually say hey
instead of having to uncheck all these
I'm just gonna have a setting that says
ignore anything in the idea directory
sounds pretty cool a lot easier that way
so how do we do that well I'm going to
go ahead and make a new file in my
repository and this is just going to be
a regular file but you have to name it
dot git ignore so just go ahead and hit
OK and here you go so now let me just
ignore that in art so this is a special
file where if you don't want to keep
track of any particular files such as
these settings files then this is where
you specify that so I'm just going to go
ahead and type dot idea and what this is
basically telling it is ignore all of
the files in this folder right here if I
just wanted to ignore one specific file
um I don't know like maybe my settings
file I'll say like admin slash settings
dot HTML so basically any files or
folders that you don't want to keep
track of then you can just stick in your
getting nor file now look what happens
whenever you we save this and pop back
into github for Windows if I can click
this again alright so now you see that
all of those files that was tracking it
now got rid of we only have two files
that are really important to us is
getting Noor which is your main uh
ignore file and of course the home page
which is the meat of this tutorial so
from here the process is essentially the
same as using the command line you
basically right
a little message of what changes you did
and I'll just write a created homepage
for the website looking good and now
what we want to do is we need to commit
it to master so go ahead and click that
and after this we want to go ahead and
click publish
so what publish means basically take the
changes that we made locally on our own
computer and publish them to github com
so I'm going to click this and it's
going to dump in a sinking sinking take
some time to connect the github and
check this out
so if i refresh this page look at that
so we now have all of the code for our
website and also our get ignore file
looking sweet now another thing I want
to point out real quick is if you ever
want to like share this repository with
one your friends or maybe your boss or
teacher or whatever and you don't
remember the entire URL it's actually a
pretty easy structure to remember it's
always github comm slash your github
username slash the name of the
repository so you don't have to like
copy this somewhere special
you have comm slash your username as
long as you remember the name of your
predatory you should be fine
so that ladies and gentlemen is a brief
introduction to github for Windows and
yeah I've still got a lot of stuff to
cover but that's it for now I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
