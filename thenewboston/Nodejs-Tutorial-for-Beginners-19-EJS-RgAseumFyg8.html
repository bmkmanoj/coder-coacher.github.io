video I want to talk to you about these
II J s files now as you can see as you
already talked about a little bit this
is pretty much the HTML in other words
the view for your web page now if you're
skinning this real quick and you're
saying all right I know HTML yada yada
headings paragraph wait a minute what
the heck is this crap right here that I
don't really recognize that um care to
explain Bucky well this is the EJ s by
the way EJ s stands for embedded
JavaScript so again these files are
pretty much HTML that you can stick
JavaScript into that's all they are
nothing really um you know too fancy
about it so as you guys can see the
syntax whenever you want to throw
JavaScript in here is this there's
actually two different variations of and
I'll explain the difference right now so
whenever you want to use a variable for
example this title as we can see this
title is equal to Express so that's why
whenever we display the title such as in
this heading and on the title actually
it says Express so um that's what that
does in anytime you want to use a
variable you use less than percent equal
sign right your variable name which is
title in this case percent greater than
now whenever you just want to use plain
old JavaScript and by that I mean
anything other than a variable such as
loops switches if statements basic
JavaScript you don't add that equal sign
so again the equal sign is for variables
no equal sign whenever you're just
writing plain JavaScript now the next
little confusing thing that probably
pops up is this alright so clearly we
have a variable called title and it's
equal to express explains why it's
displaying right there
but uh where is that happening because
shouldn't there be like JavaScript up
here with some like variable variables
being declared and set equal to some
values I don't see any JavaScript so
what's happening is this remember
whenever the user makes a request for
this home page what it does is it looks
at this file right here index J s so
what this file says is for this view
whenever the user tries to get the home
page what's happening is I want to use
index as my view and this
behind-the-scenes text on the ejs since
we already set up our project to use the
ejs views instead of JDA already knows
to add that file extension so you don't
need a type it manually so it says
whenever they request the home page use
index ejs and you can also pass
additional information in this case it
passed one additional variable in that
variable was equal to express so now
anytime we display title which is a
JavaScript variable it displayed Express
and just to show you guys one other
quick example um actually let me clear
out everything in this body right here
and let me clearing out this title all
right actually in the title I'll just
like the New Boston static text and say
that we want to pass in my name as Bucky
so now what we can do is in our ejs file
anytime we use the variable name it will
display Bucky and in the body I'll just
make like a real simple paragraph and
remember that's less than percent equals
since we're using a variable and the
variable is called
name so now I'm going on this again and
check it out Bucky and just to show you
guys a real quick example of the other
syntax you can use with just regular
JavaScript we space this up a little bit
prettier say that you're making
something like an unordered list now
inside here what you need is a for loop
or you don't need one but that's what
we're going to do in this example we're
going to make a for loop and print
something out
five times now of course that for loop
is not a variable it's just regular
JavaScript so you need to throw that in
between these two little weird-looking
symbols right there now what I'm going
to do is this I'm going to write four
and then for my conditions bar I equals
zero I'll just say uh what I say I is
less than five and I plus plus all right
so now I'm going to put my opening
bracket right here in my closing bracket
right there and any code in between here
is going to get looped out five times so
let me just put some list item and I'll
just write the word tuna whatever now
let me run that in check it out tuna
tuna tuna tuna tuna tuna tuna tuna tuna
tuna chameleon alright it's late it's
like 6 a.m. and I have to go to my mom's
because it's Easter tomorrow so I was
like maybe I'll try to sleep tonight but
then I'm like you know maybe I'll just
stay awake because if I go to sleep I'm
not gonna feel like waking up so anyways
that's how you do that again EJ s files
really simple there's just HTML that you
can throw JavaScript into whenever you
want to display variables use the equal
sign whenever you want to write plain
JavaScript don't use the equal sign
simple as that
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
