SQL tutorial and in this lesson I want
to talk to you guys about creating
custom columns now create them custom
columns wow that's kind of like a tongue
twister creating custom columns is
something that you can do and it's going
to come in handy a whole lot for example
say that you were working with your
customers table and your boss wanted to
send out a letter to all your customers
so of course in order to address a
letter at least in the United States you
write the name the address and under
that you write the city and state but in
order to write the city and state you
typically write it like this instead of
write them writing the city and state
like that you write the city with a
comma and then the state after however
if we go ahead and we look at our
customers table there's no way that we
can achieve this because the city and
stay are two different things and the
comma doesn't come after the city name
so your boss comes in and he's like
Bucky I need a column that has City
comma state and we're like okay well
these are the only columns we have to
work with what do you want us to do
lucky for you you have been watching my
tutorials and you know that there is a
way that you can temporarily make your
own custom columns so let me go ahead
and use a select statement but instead
of selecting city and state I'm going to
teach you guys about a simple function
now I'll go more I'll go on more about
functions later on but for now go ahead
and type CEO n CAT this is short for
concatenate and it's basically a job
that MySQL can do that it takes a list
of items and it combines those items now
the first item we want to combine is
city now of course whenever you're using
a list just separate it with commas now
the second item we want to combine is
just a string of text we want to include
a comma because remember and this isn't
MySQL this is just an example atoms
comma and why would be an example where
I live so in between the city and state
I want a comma and a space
so anytime you are just including raw
text go ahead and put it in between
single quotation marks so a comma and
space is the next thing I want and then
the last thing in my list of course I
need a common to separate my list is the
state
so again City comment space state now
those three things need to be separated
with a comma so now that I'm going to go
ahead and select that column and again
this is a column that I'm going to make
up from customers I can go ahead and run
this and check it out I now created a
new custom column that is made up of the
city name with a comma and a space after
it and then the state so Adams is a
steady instead I say steady with the XS
steady Adams comma space New York Gary
comma space Indiana I think that is
Phoenix comma space Arizona so that is
how you can use the concat to pretty
much like I said concat is short for
concatenate which means join things
together so it takes a bunch of items as
a list and it joins them together you
can either join together two columns
that already exist or whenever you want
to use text like maybe a comma or maybe
you want to use a hyphen or plus sign
you need to include that in between
single quotation marks now you're saying
okay well I know PHP or some other
program already or maybe Java and in
order to reference this column it needs
to have a name so what is the name of
this column is it city no is it state no
is it concat city comma state comma
whatever no in order to give this new
column a name because check it out
whenever you make a table every column
has a name in order to name your new
column you need to specify that whenever
you're writing your query so here's the
query ahead for select this column the
custom column we made up from customers
however it doesn't have a name yet so in
order to name it go ahead and say select
that
as and after the word as you give a name
such as new underscore address now
whenever you select this column is going
to have the name new address so select
my custom column as the name new address
now I just go ahead and I messed that up
so let me go ahead and run this and
check it out now we have our custom
column formatted exactly how we wanted
it to be formatted and it now has the
name new address so now whenever we are
working with the program like PHP that
needs to know the name of this it knows
whenever uses the name new address to
use this information it's pretty much
like a nickname that you can give your
column so whenever you're programming
you can refer to it now the last thing I
want to teach you guys about whenever
used in custom columns is how to use
mathematical operations so say for
example you were having I don't know
like say we had this website and this
was like eBay and you were having a sale
of all your items where you were selling
them for $1 off so instead of 204 this
would be 104 and instead of one 49.99
this would be 148 99 well in order to
you know if we don't want to ruin this
column already let's just go ahead and
make an additional custom column with
the new price so let's go ahead hop over
to where we can type in our queries and
let me show you it beforehand first
select the name and the cost from items
now what this does is it goes head and
gives us the name of the item and the
cost of the item so now let's go ahead
and add an additional custom column on
here in we will call it sale price or
something so we want to select the name
and cost just like before but now we
want to go ahead and select cost minus 1
now what this is going to do is it's
going to create a new column that
basically takes the price or the cost of
the item and subtracts 1 from it so our
first column is going to be 148 99 the
second one is going to be 104 the
third one's going to be $13.99 so on and
so forth however just like before this
third column is a custom column
therefore it doesn't have a name yet so
in order to name it we need to use AZ
and then we give a name like sale price
or something clever like that so now it
creates a third custom column whenever
you run this query and it treats it it
gives it the nickname sale price so
whenever we were to code this with our
you know whenever we were programming
our new and improved eBay we can use the
sale price column and we still retain
our important information now a couple
things you may want to take note of
computers have a weird way whenever they
perform math on well just whenever they
perform math because they don't perform
math like a human and they make these
little rounding errors and I'll talk
about more on that later on but we're
going to learn how to format this
properly for example drop all these
unneeded decimal points and I'll explain
to you guys why computers can't perform
math in the way that mean you can later
on but for now that isn't the you know
that's not I don't want to get into all
that right now I just want to go ahead
and talk about custom columns and how to
nickname your custom columns so the last
thing I want to talk about is you know
how I used - as a simple mathematical
operation you can also use plus and
whenever you want to multiply you use
the asterisks the symbol above the eight
and that means multiply it by one and
divide is the forward slash so again
plus - asterisks four multiply and
forward slash four divide so you know
don't look for like a division key on
your keyboard or something because it
doesn't exist but anyways I bet your
brains are jam-packed full of
information so please go take a break go
do something else go watch some TV or
something in when you're ready to
finally come back to these tutorials
because I know it's a lot then you're
welcome back so anyways thank you guys

don't forget to add me on Google+ and I
will see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
