tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you on how to draw the hang
post off your hangman so in the previous
tutorial we basically built a user
interface for our application so we
don't really have any code for our
application yet so in order to view that
code you're just going to want to
right-click on your app and click view
code and then we should see this code
right here and we're just going to
create a method to draw all the hang
posts so I say void draw hang close
alright so the first thing that we're
going to want to do is create graphics
to actually draw on the hang post with
so this will say graphics e equals angle
1.38 graphics and panel one is this
panel right here inside of our hangman
food box just in case you wanted to know
and the next thing that we're going to
want to do is create a pen to draw with
sensor only drawing lines going to say
10 e equals a new pen and you can make
the color and you can move on but since
it's a post I'm going to make it brown
so color dot around and the size of our
brush will be 10 pixels wide all right
now I basically already have the code
all written out or actually drawing the
lines because you're not going to want
to sit here and watch me figure out
exactly which points to draw to so I'm
just going to explain how I figured out
the points though all right so basically
the size of this panel is 149 by 218 so
that means that this point right here at
the bottom right is 149 218 and the
first line that I draw is from 132 18 to
135 so we start at 132 18 and 132 18 is
approximately right there because the
entire size of this is two weeks teen on
the Y and I made it start at 218 for
drawing the line because I wanted to
start right at the bottom of the panel
so there's no white space in between the
actual post and the bottom of our pan
right here and I didn't want it to start
right up against the side right here so
I made it start at 1:30 since the entire
sides of this on the X is 149 and then I
had to end at 135 and since the X's
remain the same and only the Y's change
that means that it will be a vertical
line straight up and down and it won't
be like sideways or anything like that
and as to edit ends at 5 on the y-axis
meaning that it will start or end right
before the top of the panel so there
will be a little bit of white space in
between on the top of the panel and the
line all right and then for the next
line which is the line coming across
right here it starts at 135 5 and you'd
think that you'd want to keep these X's
the same but if you do that then there
will be a little chunk missing out of
the line right there so just be white
there and one line will end here and
another line will end here so it won't
look right you're just going to want to
move that line over a little bit and
since only the X's change and the Y's
remain the same that means that is just
going to be a perfectly horizontal line
and then finally for drawing down it
starts at 60 zero so that means the end
of it is right up against the panel
right here and it's it's 60 on the X so
it's about in the middle of our panel
right here maybe off to the left of it
and then it ends at 60 50 so again since
only the Y's change it's going to be a
vertical line and it's 50 pixels down so
it's about from like right there down 50
pixels so I guess about that maybe more
I don't know all right so now when we
alright so now we're just going to call
this draw hang post method when our form
is shown so just select your form go
over to the events in the properties
panel and go down to shown this
basically occurs when the form is shown
and you can see it so now we're just
gonna want to call this draw hang post
method so just draw pipe draw hang post
and when we debug here you should see
our anko's and yep it's not I don't know
I guess that's not brown but
whatever so that's pretty much it for
this tutorial so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
