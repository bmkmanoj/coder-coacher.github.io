Photoshop cs6 tutorial my name is bunny
Blackford and today we're going to be
creating and modifying text on a path
now you can create a path using any ur
pen tools and then add some type on top
of it to be able to make a cool-looking
font or some cool-looking typography
that's going to look awesome in your in
your next document so let's go ahead and
get started with that it's going to look
something like what we're doing here now
so I'm going to delete some of the stuff
that I had R on here already I don't
need that and my paths are gone now too
so that's good so select your pen tool
and just create a path there we go and
then you can just end your path and make
sure you have a path in there now go
ahead and select your type tool and
click where you want to start typing now
if you want to start typing from the
left to the right it'd be a good idea to
have this set over here to left and
click there and where you click it
creates an insertion point you can tell
that you're on the path when you have
your actual cursor it changes into the
font cursor the type tool cursor with a
like a little squiggly line throw that
actually looks kind of like this alright
now we can start typing
and you can see we already have some
problems but we have a type on a path so
that's pretty cool and that's what we
got there so there's how you start
typing on a path now since we have a
path we're able to use our direct
selection tool to click on the path and
adjust it now I can like maybe spread
this out a little bit so that it's not
all really connected so it's not like
all together like this and I can go into
here and edit might go back to my text
and edit it a little bit maybe add some
space in between depending on how your
path is and you can like I was just
trying to show you that you can edit
your actual path and it'll change the
way that the actual text looks so that's
pretty cool
you can also create the insertion point
and move it around like I would just
look I just did right there so that's
really nice you can do that as you can
see when it comes to the it turns into
this like little line here and you can
click and direct our turns to uh the
cursor has like a little triangle on it
if you look at my cursor and you can
move that little X and it'll move the
path for you so that's pretty handy
anytime you go over like the text you
can see that line there and that's how
you change your insertion point so that
is fairly good to know so that's what
you get if you select a path selection
tool here you can also do that which is
pretty handy as you can see when I moved
it over that way it flipped if you move
it too far it flips over which is also
good to know so there's a couple little
things there as I showed you
how to type on a path and now you guys
should be able to mess around with it
and figure out where you figure out some
cool ways to make typing on a path look
really cool so that's all I wanted to
show you for that be sure to subscribe
for some more awesome YouTube videos on
photoshop cs6 and i look forward to
seeing you guys in the next tutorial
that I do everybody have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
