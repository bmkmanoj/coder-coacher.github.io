drunk
such as obstacle drives and also how
many 3.5 drives are drought and also how
many things like USB ports are in front
this doesn't really have much to do with
performance but as far as just ease of
use and plugging in your USB port you
may want some USB ports in print or
something like that you don't have to
really worry about that but another
thing you're gonna want to look for is
stability and I don't mean like stable
like computer's gonna crash by actual
physical stability once a your hard
drive starts spinning and your power
supply is gone your computer my Gretl
around a little bit make sure that when
you shake it a little bit it's not gonna
rattle if you're gonna put on something
hard and it's going to be making a lot
of noise this is especially important if
you're gonna work in an office and
you're working around a lot of people if
everyone else has a nice quiet case in
here just rattling around like a rat
snake or something like that then it's
gonna get annoying to them um another
thing is to make sure the things that
are included with your case some or a
lot of cases have fans and power
supplies included this case I bought
right here has a fan included with it so
I don't have to add any more fans to
cool my case now my power supply I
didn't want included because I wanted to
show you guys how to put in a power
supply but a lot of cases that you buy
half power supplies included right in
the back room so you don't have to buy
an extra power supply and put it in
separately but we're gonna be going over
that in the next couple of tutorials so
you don't have to really worry about
that right now but again if you want
things included then a lot of things
included with a case our fan and power
supply so look sure make sure those are
included and if they're not you have to
buy separately and the last thing brand
name this is a huge thing people look
for on mine the case the brand name is
very important to them to some good
brand names I don't really want to tell
you guys how
I really like you guys to judge for that
on your own but I will tell you that in
this coat I rent with a Roswell this is
the Roswell is the brand name micro-atx
which is what kind of motherboard you
can put in it this is a micro ATX
motherboard in this case supports member
ATX motherboard obviously since we want
to build computer that's going to fit
together
a mid tower which is the size which is
just a basic size and it also included
120 millimeter fan which is pretty much
means that I don't have to buy extra
fans cool my case so again in Roswell
micro ATX mid tower with a 120
millimeter fan so now that we picked out
our case we are good to go
for a build so I hope you picked out
your case and once you did once you
learn everything you need to know about
boone and pick them out of case you can
move on them in the next tutorial so I
hope you learned something
thank you for watching and I will see
you next order</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
