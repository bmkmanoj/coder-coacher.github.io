Photoshop tutorial last time we talked
about how to repair a basic image and
this time I'm going to be going over the
wand and quick selection tool now the
magic wand and quick selection tool are
located right here or you can click W as
a hockey and what the magic wand tool
does is wherever you click on your image
it samples that pixel color and selects
the range of colors similar to that
pixel so for instance say we clicked
right here on this white pedal what the
magic wand tool will do is select all
the colors similar to white now how you
define your range of colors is located
up here the tolerance the lower number
you have from 1 to 100 the less range it
selects for example if you had 10 and
you selected the flower as you can see I
only selected the whites that were very
closely related to that but if you had a
color such as 95 as you could see it
selects almost the entire flower
now you have a couple other options here
called the anti-alias and the contiguous
what the anti-alias does is soften the
edges when selecting your colors and
what the contiguous does is allow you to
either select the colors that are
directly touching that color or select
the colors that are somewhere off in
that image but still related to the
color now this is useful we have an even
more useful tool and this is called the
quick selection tool now this is a lot
similar to the magic wand tool right
here you have three options new
selection adds a selection or subtract
from selection when you start out you
always want to click a new selection and
as you can see like the magic wand tool
it allows you to click and go over and
sample any of the colors you can see we
can select piece-by-piece the white
flower
any pieces that we missed
now if you selected too much or too
little right around the edges there's
one thing you can do right up here is a
button that's called refine edges yeah
it gives you plenty of options to refine
as you can see you have many options
down here to view the background so you
can more clearly see your edges and all
these options let you define how much of
the edge you want to use the radius is
for softening the edges much like to
anti-alias tool the contrast removes
anything fuzzy any pixels that might be
around your image just like contrast
basic contrast the smoothness also
erases any jagged edges that might be
around your image and this is helpful
when you want to smooth it out as you
can see that's it of the image will
begin the feather in I'm slightly you
can triple when you have a ring of color
outside your image that you don't want
that's okay if you don't want quite as
much as your image selected or you want
a little more around it if anything you
didn't grab with a quick slide and once
you got those all set you can just press
okay but say you selected something that
you didn't quite want to select right
here you would use this tool called the
subtract from selection and say alright
I wanted this white flower but I didn't
want this seedlings in the middle or
whatever they are and as you can see so
we can get a better picture of the
background
I didn't select it all the way do the
time but as you can see we began to
remove that metal by using the delete
from selection tool and just a couple
hotkeys I want you to guys remember
remember they're very useful when
dealing with these tools anytime you
want to deselect an image you can hold
in ctrl D as you can see my entire image
was deselected now any time you
accidentally deselect an image and you
want to reflect it you hold down ctrl +
shift and press D as you can see what we
just deselected is now reflected this is
pretty helpful in case you make a
mistake and you want to reselect your
image and to select the entire inverse
or the opposite of what you already have
selected all you need to do is hold down
ctrl shift and press I as you can see we
now have a border of what they're called
marching ants around the entire image
and what this does is allow us to select
the inverse of the image now this is all
hell for helpful when you want to take
out part of an image very quickly and
say if you want to paste it on another
piece so now that we learned how to use
the magic wand and quick selection tool
to select an image quickly the next
section we're going to be covering is
masks
now this is a very important topic and
it's a lot better way of selecting your
image and of course if you miss anything
I talked about today you can go to my
website the new Boston comm and I'll
give you a step-by-step examples and
instructions about everything I talked
about thank you
