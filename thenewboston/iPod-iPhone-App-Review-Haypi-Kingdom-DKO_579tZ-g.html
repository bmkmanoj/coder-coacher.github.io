another awesome iphone app review and I
know I haven't done that iphone or app
review in a while but I just found this
awesome game it is one of my funnest
most greatest my favorite game
definitely I've ever found on the ipod
it is called haipai Kingdom I think
that's how I say it now when you first
started out you're going to need to
create an account and I already did my
name is white blue i'll post on my name
in the description box but make sure
when you create your name the put mirror
as your referral and then we can be in
the same alliance and we can send
messages to each other and stuff like
that so white blue don't forget add me
as a referral so go ahead and once you
create account you can go ahead and
start your game and you automatically
see this interface with tons of stuff
that you probably don't know what is
what well if ever you need help then go
ahead down this help section and I'll
give you a nice little tutorial on what
to do but i'm going to give you guys a
real quick tutorial the main things you
want to do is complete all your tasks
watch in other games they might be
called quest but in this game they're
called task then see i have three right
now i already completed one through 17
and i got some random ones like flitter
it kind of skipped around a little bit
but um so these are your task and
whenever you do a task you get rewards
now the main thing you get is these
resources right here and your resources
can be viewed in your top right there
now you're saying alright what our
resources why do you need them well
resources are essential for many
different reasons you see a lumber stone
iron these are mainly build new
buildings crops these feed your people
on money can be used to buy stuff and
coins you know just a random stuff but
it's too much to explain right now but
anyways say you want to do oh here is in
the cool thing you get more resources
each hour so for example i'm only
getting 90 crop each hour and it's kind
of low compared to each my other stuff
and so say I wanted more crops outputted
what you do is go to your cropland
right here and go ahead and output
upgrade and upgrade and now it says this
it's upgrading and now this crop field
is now going to produce more crops once
this time's up so the key thing is the
more people you have the more resources
that you need to keep up creating and
keep the building your city and make it
stronger now here is your city right
here you can see a whole bunch of
different buildings if you scroll around
you see the main building which is
pretty much the higher level of your
main building the more people that your
city will have the barracks are when you
want to train soldiers and the cool
thing you can take over other cities and
steal their resources and stuff the
marketplace you can buy resources um
Tech Center you can pretty much upgrade
anything you want um in the cool thing
about the marketplace it works just like
well pretty much like eBay it has a
sweet off oxygen system the best I've
ever found in pretty much any game you
can sell your goods I don't have any
options listed right now but and these
are real people you're bidding with this
is a multiplayer on my massive
multiplayer online game and that makes
it all the better you can play with your
friends um connect with each other and
you know um down here you can send
letters to your friends um you know get
different reports and stuff and here is
the map I was talking about right here
these are real people the other cities
once I get strong enough see this guy
yeah I'm probably going to take over his
city soon enough but you know I'll close
that out for now but uh again like I
said playing with your friends not only
does this have a sweet chat live chat
just like a IM check that out ha awesome
is that but it also has an alliance was
just pretty much a team and this team
can help you destroy other cities and
you know a fight with you in wars and um
aside from that you know you got letter
so awesome way to connect with your
friends and
your alliance and not only that you can
see your ranking among other people so
you know if you ever get bored and want
to see where your rank with your
prestige and you know trying to level up
you can do that but anyways this has so
much stuff to keep you busy I can't even
begin to explain it all in one video but
uh you know like I said it is by far one
of my favorite games of all time not one
vote it is the favorite game for my ipod
because i'm now addicted to it it keeps
me busy for so long and there are so
many things you can do this is this game
is leaps and bounds above any game I've
ever played on my ipod touch so that is
why I'm gonna recommend it of course in
aside from all that it's free one
hundred percent and not only that i'm
going to give it um let's go ahead and
give it a 10 out of 10 rating very rare
I don't have any complaints for this
game so far and I doubt I'm going to
have any in the future so again haipai
kingdom I would definitely recommend it
I wasn't planning on doing this
walkthrough but once i found this i'm
like wow this game is awesome you
definitely have to get it so you know
thank you guys for watching um don't
forget subscribe and check out my other
reviews and if you have any apps you
want on your view then i'll send it to
me and i'll try to do it for you so
again thank you for watching don't
forget to add me who's your refer refer
and uh well I guess I'll see you next
