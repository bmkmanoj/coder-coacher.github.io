show you how to sniff packets from the
command line so we can just sniff
package using wireshark
but another way and this is kind of the
preferred way in a lot of these methods
is to use a tool called arrow dump ng so
this lets you capture packets but for
this tutorial right now i'm not going to
be saving any of the results i just want
to run it real quick because i want to
show you guys a real basic overview of
all the different settings and just
explain a few things so if i just go to
arrow dump arrow dump jeez can't type I
have to type like the entire word or
outs I can type it so arrow dump - ng
then right after this you just type what
interface do you want to listen from so
W LAN 1 Mon that was our monitoring 1
and hit enter so since we didn't specify
any other settings it's just going to
look for any arm you know Wi-Fi access
point in my area and also whenever I
turn on my device you guys are going to
see that it pops up down below alright
so I I was just playing around my tablet
probably shouldn't mention that so
around my area I live in a pretty small
town if you guys can't tell we are
seeing one network it's called Bucky's
Wi-Fi so in these top sections right
here these are all of your networks all
the access points so this is my
neighbors that just popped up right here
this Belkin 5c and I believe this is one
of her devices down here so again
remember the top is for all the networks
and the bottom is all of the individual
devices the phones the tablets the
laptops whatever wireless devices there
are so now let me go ahead and talk to
guys about what all of these columns
mean because it's actually really
important so we'll talk about the
networks first so the bssid this is just
the MAC address for that networks access
point so this is the MAC address for my
wireless router and this is the MAC
address for my neighbors so on and so
forth now power
this means the Singh
strength from your computer which is in
my case my laptop to the access point
now the closer this gets to zero then
the stronger it is so anything above
negative 70 is good anything below it is
bad
so negative 60 this is RA I have a
decent connection if I try to connect
like to negative 92 if I just try to get
online and browse you know like
Instagram or whatever then I have a real
bad connection so remember usually you
want to be as close to zero as you can
and this is actually pretty important
because there's stronger signal we have
the better our attacks are in me
whenever we start trying to correct
passwords and perform like
man-in-the-middle attacks and all of
that fun stuff
so this beacons right here this column
is the messages that the access point is
sending out to other devices know that
it exists so all the time your router
your wireless router is like hey I'm on
a Wi-Fi router someone connected me hey
I'm a Wi-Fi router and it does it
several times per second so again these
are just the signals to letting other
devices know hey I'm access point you
can connect me this data right here this
is the number of packets sniffed so on
my network
I think Amazon is still sending me
packets even though I went to this I
like you know a minute ago so this is
the number of packets that we collected
from that network this number per second
is just the number of packets is sniffed
in the last 10 seconds and it's just for
a statistical analysis this channel
right here different access points can
broadcast on different channels and they
do this so they don't interfere with
each other so basically whenever they
broadcast on different channels me in my
neighbor and even you know if I had a
roommate was living in an apartment we
could all have our own access points and
they could broadcast without causing a
whole bunch of problems pretty sweet so
this MB right here this is just your
speed ENC this is just the encryption
type I'm sure you guys are familiar with
this so right now I'm using WPA
encryption so that's why everything
looks scrambled this network is actually
open so you never want to connect to an
open network it's incredibly insecure so
yeah so that's just the encryption type
we'll talk more about those later on
this cipher is the cipher used to
decrypt the packets and if you don't
know what that means we'll understand it
more whenever you learn about encryption
this is the type of authentication in
PSK means pre shared key so basically um
they're using Wi-Fi that you need a
password to get on so basically like
most all Wi-Fi is actually accept these
punks who are you know I guess they're
very trusting people my neighbor all
right now SSID this is just the user
friendly name of your Wi-Fi network so
mine is Bucky's Wi-Fi I actually changed
it before this tutorial but yeah there
you go and down here all of this is
pretty simple the MAC address of the
access point they're connected to the
MAC address of the device and some other
information that we can use but yeah
there you go um that's the basics of
again it's called airodump-ng and
usually this is actually capturing
packets right now however it's not
saving any of them so we can't do
anything useful with the data whenever
we stop it and if you ever want to stop
it hold down control C and it's just
going to stop capturing so later on
we're going to capture the data and
analyze it do some really awesome stuff
with it but for now that's all you guys
get so thank guys for watching and I
will smell you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
