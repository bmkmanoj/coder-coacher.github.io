notice now we need to style a header tag
which is going to go inside of here
obviously we don't just want this text
hanging around at the top of this div we
want a header to be in the middle of the
document so I'm going to go ahead and
style
slide notice a head of three so any head
of three tags that appear within the
slide notice div will take this style
and that is position relative padding
we're gonna set some naught pixels and
the margin we're gonna set to naught
pixels up as well that's important so we
don't get the padding that's default for
headers and then the top I'm gonna set
to 25% so this will align it in the
middle of this div okay so at the moment
we've just got some text inside here
let's go ahead and create some header
tags now eventually inside of here will
be the replaced text that we're going to
supply our notice function with when we
create it so for the moment you can just
see we've got the text here we've got
aligned in the center of this div and we
haven't got any padding around it it's
important to note that if we were to
take out this padding in this margin
option that we get some kind of padding
and we the alignments all wrong
so we want the padding and the margin to
zero pixels okay so now what we're going
to go ahead and do is actually create
our notice function so remember when we
click our button we do whatever we have
to do and then we call the slide notice
function and the slide notice function
is going to take a text parameter so
let's just go and call this although we
haven't defined it so I want to call a
slide notice and inside here I want to
supply it with some text so obviously
we've associated all actions inside of
this function with saving user details
and therefore we can go ahead and create
some text in here so your settings have
been saved now obviously if you are
updating user sessions you would ensure
that user settings have been
successfully updated before you call
this function so for example you could
go ahead and
maybe create some kind of if statement
which would check whether an HTTP
request had been successful and and you
could output an appropriate error
message so for example if the settings
hadn't been updated and that was in a
particular block you could adjust the
message accordingly and you could call
this more than once as well so you could
call it twice on a page but obviously
depending on the result of the settings
that are being saved it would be output
in a different way so now that we've
called the function doesn't actually
exist yet we want to define this inside
notice j/s so let's go ahead and define
the function again this is called slide
notice and we take some text in here
okay so this text here is going to be
taken into account inside of this block
and we are going to change the content
of this div and then slide it down and
then we're going to delay for a while
and slide it up so we've got the we need
to have the display on this set to none
so back to our style dot CSS file and
now you can see that nothing here when
we click Save nothing happens because we
haven't done anything inside our slide
notice function which is called when
this button is clicked so inside notice
jeaious we want to go ahead and actually
show this slider so we reference this as
slide and notice remember our div is
called slide notice so we want we're
using a selector to select this div now
we want to go ahead and do something
with it so we can just first of all say
show so this Hill this will when we
click this button obviously we're
calling this function when this function
is called we're going to show slide
notice so let's go ahead and test it out
click Save you can see that this div is
now shown so that's the first part of it
we've enabled the button to show this
particular div based on this function
but now we want to make it obviously
applicable to you know the tutorial the
what we're actually doing so what we
want to do is want to apply some HTML to
this div and the HTML is going to be
some header tag
so some head of three tags remember we
specifically styled head of three tags
to work within this and let's go ahead
and append just in the middle of these
pluses
so we're outputting a head of three tag
and then some content and then another
head of three tag and in this case it
will be text the text that we supplied
to the slide notice function here so now
that that's happened we can go ahead and
show that again so we are appending on
HTML and then we are binding show to
that so now what's going to happen is
when we click Save we have this message
appear your settings have been saved so
now what we want to do is actually
animate it so instead of show we're
going to use slide down and what this is
going to do it's just going to change
the animation there are various
properties you can define within here
but we're not going to be looking at
those in this tutorial so now when we
click Save you see that slid down quite
nicely the animation has taken place and
the slider is at its height it's just 50
pixels now what we want to do is slide
it back up again so if we were to use a
slide up this would actually slide the
div up into its into the top of the
document but it's the problem is is it
does it instantly so as soon as the
first animation has finished the second
animation kicks in and slides this back
up again so inside here we want to bind
on the delay property or the delay
function and we want to give this a
specific time and the time is in
milliseconds so I'm going to choose one
15 hundred milliseconds and what that
will do is it will slide it down and
then slide back up again so now that
we've done this we're essentially done
it was extremely easy to implement this
just by creating this function and
allowing this button to call this
function once it been clicked so what
happens if you want to go ahead and
create another button for example let's
go ahead and create another button next
to this Save button
and now I'm going to demonstrate how
easy this is to actually use with
multiple buttons so the type of this is
a button the value of this is let's just
say let's just go ahead and say delete
account for example I mean we're not
actually going to be creating this
functionality and we'll give this an ID
as well out of delete account so now
that we've done this we have this delete
account button which we can now apply
the same function to so inside buttons
j/s we want to go ahead and reference
delete account which is the button and
we append the same event handler to this
and inside here we create a function
pull these down just so we can read it a
bit better and we want to go ahead and
slide notice okay so now what we can
just do is say your account has been
deleted obviously you wouldn't delete
the account straight off but that's
nothing to do with the tutorial it's
just to demonstrate the slider we now
have this delete account button when I
click on it your cam has been deleted so
we just in like 10-15 seconds we've
implemented this delete account button
when we click the Save button we get a
different message coming up so overall
this the benefit of using this function
and allowing this text to be passed to
here will allow us to create this nice
animation here and putting these header
three tags just inside of this div
allows us to call it upon any button
click so we can just call this function
multiple times in our application
without having to replicate this code
which is essentially the point of a
function so you can see how easy it is
to implement this we've used quite a lot
of CSS but it's it's very basic CSS that
you know just allows us to create a div
at the very top of the page that's going
to overlap all the other content so you
could probably now go ahead and
implement this into your website
extremely easily</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
