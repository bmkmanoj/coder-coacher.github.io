going over a custom validation of a text
field so I guess the only time I guess
you're really going to use this is if
the types that were defined in the last
tutorial are not exactly what you need
and with the custom validation that you
can really create any pattern that you
want and it is just a few simple rules
that you have to follow better than that
it's pretty pretty easy pretty pretty
and it won't take you long to figure out
I don't think but here's how we do it we
go ahead and we click on custom inside
of our type and we go down here into
pattern and if you if you have some
paper around you might want to take
notes on on what I'm about to say
because there are a few different
characters that you put into the pattern
that will drastically change what can
and cannot be inserted into the text
field to sell so right now I'm just
going to go ahead and put some zeros in
and time I pattern here and these zeros
mean a whole number a number between 0
and nine if you want to make sure that
someone enters five digits then you type
five zeros in the pattern field and I
mean that's the same as a zip code so
you wouldn't really you wouldn't really
need to do that but if that's just
that's just an example so say that you
have a number or you have some kind of
ID number that looks like this and
they're all whole numbers so you have
five numbers and then high thin and then
two more numbers after that so you can
also can also say say you want like
a date and a time in the same text field
then you can enter something exactly
like that and you will be able to have
the user input the time with actually
that's more like a date I'm sorry date
and the time so that's how you do
numbers so if you want to do any number
between zero nine all you have to do is
zero and so to indicate a single
uppercase alphabetic character then you
will type in a capital A so for instance
you type in a capital A zero and a
capital A then that will allow the
person to put in any capital any capital
letter a number and then a capital
letter the capital a means that the
letter has to be capital though if you
want to do a lowercase letter then you
can say a 0 a and then that would be the
same as the last except the letters
would have to be lowercase the pattern
AAA would mean that you would have to
put in lowercase letters for all three
letters have to be lowercase so if it
was a a that would be acceptable but
this would not be acceptable to accept
either an uppercase or lowercase letter
then you will use a capital B so the
pattern BBB a capital B 3 times will
accept boast lowercase letters and also
uppercase letters to include numbers
along with uppercase letters then you
can use the X actually it is a a capital
X
the letter X messes both numbers and
lowercase alphabetical characters you
use capital y 4 case sensitive I mean
case insensitive match for numbers and
letters so so if you use X X X just like
that then that will match b2b and BBB
and also one two three but it will not
match b2b or BBB so basically just to
recap that to include numbers along with
uppercase letters use a capital X the
letter X matches both numbers and
lowercase alphabetical characters so
also if you need to use anything else
you can use a question mark as like a
wild card it stands for any character
whatsoever so you should use it when a
character other than a letter or number
like a period ! a doll or symbol is as
what you want so I think for that that
is about it oh one more thing of the
enforcing pattern down here you can make
sure incorrect characters aren't even
allowed into a form filled by turning it
on so like if you want to turn on the
horse pattern checkbox when this option
is selected the form field blocks the
input of invalid characters so it won't
even allow them like to be put in there
for example suppose you added a sprite
text field and then status validation
type 2 zip code using the u.s. zip file
format the box can accept only digits
and only five digits of that so if the
enforced pattern option were turned on
for this field then a visitor can only
type five numbers in the field and
that's all they could type is if a
visitor clicks into the field and types
letter a nothing happens because it only
accepts le accepts numbers so if you
want to enforce the pattern strictly and
not allow any characters whatsoever to
be allowed inside of the text box then
you will use the enforced pattern and
that is it for this tutorial i'm in the
next tutorial we are going to be going
over text area and we will see the text
area isn't as detailed as the text box I
order the text field validation was
where there are some cool things that
will be able to do with that so
hopefully you're looking forward to
moving on to the next tutorial and I
will see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
