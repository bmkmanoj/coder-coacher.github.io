to your very first YouTube programming
challenge now this is a challenge that I
challenge all of my students and
programmers all around the world to
solve what you have to do is build this
pattern in over this next video I'm
going to be showing you guys exactly
what I need to do to build this but the
only problem is I'm going to be missing
one line of code in the whole thing and
I challenge you to figure out using one
line of code how I can fix this so in
case you don't know as you can see this
is pretty much eight asterisks with
spaces in between in the second line is
a space and then the asterisks begin
again so it's eight in a row space eight
in a row and then the next line eight in
a row space eight in a row like that and
it goes on for eight rows so study this
pattern and that's our goal right here
so next I'm going to show you you guys
or actually let me get this right here
and I'm going to show you guys give you
guys a nice starting point so the first
thing we're going to need to do to build
this and follow along and type in
exactly as I do because this is what's
what's going to get you started in the
first thing we need is three variables
int 1 equals 0 and 2 equals 0 and int 3
equals 0 and these are going to be three
counting variables the next thing we're
going to do is build 3 while loops the
enter 1 while 1 is less than 8 what
we're going to do then is print F
and where we're going to print is pretty
much just oops already to the in Asterix
with a space and what this is going to
do is make a lineup stars so let me go
ahead and compile and run this and this
is going to give us our very first line
actually I did something wrong already
what we're going to need to do is
increment that by one so it actually
ends so let's go ahead and let me show
you guys what we built so far come on
come on no whammy no whammy so we got
our first line built successfully so now
that we have that loop we're going to
need to enclose this entire loop in the
loop of itself because we run or run
this entire loop two times so let's go
ahead and make another condition and
we'll write while this we're going to
want to run this entire line twice so
let's go ahead and write while two is
less than two we're going to want to run
this and at the end we're going to want
to let me do that just so we're going to
want to set one equal to zero because at
the end of this one's going to be equal
to eight and we don't want that and then
we're going to want to do print a new
line F because if we don't then it's
just going to be on the same line so
let's go ahead and print a new line and
after that we're going to want to print
space printf
print space just like that and the last
thing that we're going to need to do is
increment this counter so this one
doesn't keep going on forever so let me
show you guys what we've built so far
and when you're done looking at this
you're going to be amazed and think that
this is a little too easy the first loop
we built put these asterisks one two
three four five six seven eight that's
what this did right here it looped
through this print statement eight times
and printed eight asterisks or Astra C's
however you say it
the next line pretty much just move to
the next line put a space on it ended
the whole thing again so right now we
have this bill in this bill so now
you're thinking alright all you have to
do is repeat that program four times and
this will give you your checkerboard pan
what we were looking for it to begin all
right let's do that let's go while 3 is
less than 4 what we're going to want to
do is loop through this we move this up
so you guys can see there we go and we
also need to do a couple make up things
we also need to set two equal to zero
because at the end of this inner loop 2
is going to be equal to 2 because of the
increment and we don't want that we're
going to want to reset it and another
thing we're going to want to do is have
3 plus plus increment that so actually
runs through the loop and isn't a
never-ending loop so let me just clean
these loops up a little bit and now
since we loop this through this four
times we should get exactly what we
wanted so let me go ahead compile and
run this and you'll see what's going to
happen oh no dear heavens Betsy look at
this we have our first two loops working
perfectly
but then for some reason that you guys
are going to need to figure out this
checkerboard pattern doesn't reset and
it goes
one in and then they're all in from
there so this is my challenge to you
using one line of code somewhere in here
you have to figure out what line of code
it is and what to put so that our
checkerboard pattern is what it what I
showed you at the beginning and it's
nothing too tricky and that is my
challenge to you guys and I don't know
why you guys are going to win yet but
I'll definitely give you a shout-out I
definitely want to see who's been
following my tutorials who can actually
accomplish this goal and just a fun
little game uh one my professor
professors told me this and it took me
forever to figure out but I had an
awesome time trying so what I'm going to
do is copy all of this code in my
description box so you can just copy
this and use it to work with and once
you figure out the answer I want you to
message me what line of code it is and
where you put it or the new or the new
code in total and I want you to send it
to me and that person is the winner
of my first challenge so again this is
the problem you have in a the first
thing I showed you is the thing what you
wanted to get so whoever can fix this
for me is the winner and I will
congratulate you so one line of code
that's the challenge good luck everyone
and I look forward to hearing from you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
