Photoshop cs6 tutorial today we're going
to be learning about using layer masks
to generate some soft transparency now
what that means is that basically the
edges are going to be soft and not such
a hard edge and it's going to be
feathered or blurred so let's go ahead
and load up an image change the
background into a layer just by double
clicking on it and let's go ahead and
make the selection so make a selection
around the object that you want to
preserve so right now I'm going to make
it over top of these canoeing guys and
go ahead and click on the add layer mask
button and when you do that you can see
that the edges are nice and sharp and
crisp but maybe we don't want that maybe
we want it to be a little bit more
blurred so what we're going to do is
we're going to click on there's a couple
ways to do this actually but this is the
first i click on your mask here and just
go to the properties panel make sure it
has a layer mask selected here and you
can see your mask and all you need to do
here is feather and you can see now that
the edges of the mask are more feathered
out you can also go into the refine mask
here you can feather it out here as well
and you can see it gives it kind of a
little bit of a different kind of
feather going on so that's two ways you
can do it now for a third way and this
is the way that I like the most I think
and let's go to filter blur and we'll go
to you can pick almost any of these both
go to Gaussian blur and that's how I say
it is Gaussian some people say Gaussian
but I mean gosh and just is easier to
say for me and make sure you were on
your mask when you did it and apply the
filter and you can see that the mask
has blurred on its edges as well so if I
hit okay and then let me just add a
background layer for us to look at you
can see what you can see that there and
you can use this kind of effect to
create like a vignette effect or maybe
like a spot lighting effect or you can
think of a hundred different things that
you could use this for if you are
working on your project so that's how
you create a soft edge for a mask and
gradually blend it into your background
so that's a it for how to do that it's
really easy but it's actually really
useful and there's code you a couple
ways on how to do it you got your mass
properties you got your refine edge
which is also in the properties and then
you can apply a blur filter to the mask
itself so that's it thanks for watching
this one guys hopefully you guys learn
something new see you guys in the next
