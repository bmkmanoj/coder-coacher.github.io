tutorial but I'm making 420 Boston and
in this tutorial I'm going to be showing
you how to use the directory class a
little bit more so all you're in need
for this tutorial is a button once you
have that on your form just double click
on it so just like in the last tutorial
you're just going to need a folder
browser dialog and if statement checking
to see if the user actually selects a
directory and you need to be using
system dot IO so once you have all that
just type out a directory to access the
directory class and you're going to want
to use the dot operator to access all of
the methods inside of the director class
so the first one that I'm going to show
you is the get creation time method and
what this will do is it will just get
this over there it gets the creation
date and time of a directory so if you
wanted to know when a certain directory
was created you can use this method to
get that and it just says on the path to
directory so we need to pass in a
parameter for the path to the directory
that we want to get the creation time of
and we're going to have to be on the
folder browser dialog selected path or
whatever the user selects and the folder
rather than a lot and we're going to
want to splay this in a message box then
I saw show I will just show this in the
message box and right here it says it
returns a date/time variable and it's a
variable called day time and we haven't
really looked at that at all but we're
going to look at that in later tutorials
so for all you're going to really need
to know right now just use the dot two
string method to convert it into a
string so you can view the date time so
now when we click this button you get a
folder browser backlog yep I'm just
going to navigate to my test folder
right here click OK we should get a
message box on showing the date and time
that it was created yep and I created it
last night for one of the tutorials
all right and the next few I'm going to
show you are also time so we can just
replace the creation time of another one
that return to date time and we're just
going to do last access time and this
will just return the last time that
director is accessed that's older if
last time was access and the last thing
I'm going to show you is the last right
time and this will just get the last
time that the folder was written the
last time something inside of the folder
was changed so I'm just going to go add
in four hours to our test folder right
here yep and this will work for any of
the directories for example we could do
like my desktop or something and yeah
that was not too long ago all right so
the final thing I'm going to show you in
directory class is the gift parent um
method and what this will do is it just
says return the parent directory of a
specified path so basically what that
means is since that test folders on my
desktop
we should get up the path to my desktop
so we're just going to do the path the
folder that select path and again looks
play this on message box so we can
actually see what directory is catch you
got to string alright so since we're
going to select my test folder and it is
on my desktop as you can see right here
we should just get the path to my
desktop yep
and if we were to select something
inside of this test folder like this
directory
you should get a test folder yep
weirdest lag lot on my desktop yeah
since that the atom folder
so that's pretty much it for this
tutorial
so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
