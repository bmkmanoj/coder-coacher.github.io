Pro tutorial and in this tutorial I'm
going to be going over the timeline now
the timeline should be at the bottom of
your screen right here and it's probably
the most important part of your entire
project um what the timeline is if you
couldn't already figure it out what you
pretty much can just by looking at it it
pretty much is the way you arrange all
of your clips and audio files to a you
know arrange them you can change the
size of them you can cut them you can
shrink them you pretty much take care of
all of your files or video down here so
as you can see right here I have three
clips and you can go ahead and just
arrange them by holding them and
dragging them into place or if you want
to delete one just go ahead and click
one press the lead and then you can go
ahead and slide another one into place
and this is how you can use different
clips to edit together and make a movie
so first thing you probably notice is
all these widgets and gadgets and
toolbars and everything like that around
the timeline panel so let's go ahead and
figure out what all these do and I'm
sorry for the sounds of windy in here
but it's about 105 degrees in my room
because my air conditioner broke so up
and there's a cricket chirping outside
nested most beauteous sound and cricket
in the world but anyways back to the
timeline the first thing one probably
take note of is this thing right here
this is the time display and this is
where in your movie and I'm talking like
this whole entire thing is movie where
in your movie your current time
indicator is so for example if you want
30 edit like something in the 30 seconds
like add a title or something what you
need to do is drag this thing this blue
little triangle with the red a little
bar down this is called the current time
indicator and this is how you change
different points in time in the movie
and now as you slide this you can see
that your time is move
so let's go ahead and slide that 30
seconds I don't want to get exact
because and now so pretty much now we
know what two things are the time
display which shows what time in your
movie you are and the current time
indicator and this is how you change
through points in your movie now as you
can see these little things on these
little video layers you can see them
visually or if you press this little
error right here it changes the
appearance of it but there is also
another way to change the appearance of
it and that's this little button right
here and this is the display style so
what this is called right here is the
first frame and each clip is called the
head in the last frame is called the
tail so if you want to show head and
tail guess what one you choose show head
and tell if you want to show frames like
each arm frame threat thing then you
want to do show frames I like show head
only just because I only need a starting
point and if you saw anything else it
kind of gets all jumbled together if you
put show frames then when you're looking
at you don't really know what one where
one ends and where one begins just by
looking at so you probably want to do
show head only another thing that you
might find useful is when you're working
with different layers and overlap
lapping them and stuff like this you
probably want to be able to toggle one
of these off and on so as you can see
when you toggle this off or on by
cooking the eye it's still there but in
your preview you can't see it so what
the high does and this is called what is
that called um track output I think
let's hover over and see if we can find
an answer yep taco track output this
pretty much means the visibility and
even though it's still there if you have
like a bunch of layers and stuff and
things get too confusing you can just
click one of those and it pretty much
just like it says makes it visible or
invisible
but if you export it it's still going to
be there so now let's bring me that's
bring me what the heck does that mean
that brings me to our to last and most
confusing things this first little bar
right here which I didn't even it's
probably hard to see this is pretty much
not pretty much it's called the viewing
area bar this is pretty much to zoom
level and it just shows how much you
want to view so you can either slide it
or you can grab one of these corners in
you can either view more or less of your
project another thing what you probably
never want to touch is this thing right
here this is called the work area bar
and this is pretty much where are you
working and when we get in exporting and
previewing stuff like that um that's
when we'll do that but for now don't
ever touch this and you probably don't
ever want to touch this ever I've been
working with premiere pro for a long
time and I never touch this or this more
useful if you want to view more or less
of where you're working you probably
want to use this little thing down here
this is the zoom so see for example say
for example you want to edit this part
of your clip right here what you want to
usually do is move your current time
indicator that clip and just zoom it
right in there and then BAM you can edit
that right there so those are the basic
properties of the timeline panel and
once we started working with clips
you'll get more familiar with it but i
just want to show you what every little
teeny widget engadget was for now and in
the next tutorial we're going to be
going over the monitor monitor panels I
can't talk right today but uh for now
that's all you get so thank you guys for
watching it don't forget to subscribe to
my channel and I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
