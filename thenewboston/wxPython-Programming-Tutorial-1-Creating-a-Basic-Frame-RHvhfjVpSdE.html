first WX Python tutorial and if you're
wondering all right what happened the
rest of the Python tutorials well
actually that list was getting a little
too long so I decided to separate my WX
Python tutorials for my regular Python
tutorials so in this tutorial we're
going to be talking about coding WX
python and if you're watching this
disorder for the first time and you
don't even know what WX python is I will
put a link to the right-hand side in my
description box to show you guys how to
download and install WX Python so again
I'm sorry that this is first tutorial
and that is in the first story but hey
that's a life so just deal with it so if
you want to know how to download and
install WX Python then look in the
right-hand side and I will put a link
but for now I'm just going to show you
guys how to use it so for the rest of
you guys we already downloaded and
installed WX Python so we want to import
that into our program so just go ahead
and put in port WX and this allows us to
use WX Python the next thing we want to
do is build a class and I'm going to
name mine Bucky and it's going to take
the parameter of WX frame now frame is a
class in WX and it's going to be the
parameter in every application we build
for now pretty much so anytime you make
a class or at least this main class make
sure that it takes the argument of WX
frame and this is going to allow you to
use frames in WX next go ahead and put a
colon basic colon not a semi colon and
now we want to go ahead and build our
constructor function now we want to
build our constructor function or
initialize it or initializing function
because we want this to happen
automatically we don't want to happen we
don't want the user to run the
application and have them press a button
for it to run we just want to double
click on it and boom it starts up in the
runs
you see frames so let's go ahead and
name this give the name an underscore
underscore ini T underscore underscore
that's very important next in your
parameters put self
parent ID and now the first arm thing we
want to happen is this WX frame dot
underscore underscore ini t underscore
underscore now this also takes some
parameters self parent ID and now let's
get to the fun stuff the next parameter
it's going to take is the title of the
window so I'm going to name my fray aka
window so unless you guys hear me
talking about frames like I have been I
probably should told you this before any
time I use the word frame it's what the
Python people call a window why they
name it two totally different things I
don't know but frame and a window is the
exact same thing adjust it for your
computer nerd you probably call it frame
if you're a regular user you name it a
window so if I say frame one time in
window another time don't think I'm
talking about two different things
just know that I'm talking about the
same thing so this total right here is
what's going to show up right here again
mine says apples dot py that's what's
going to show them right here that's
where the title shows up of your window
or frame the next parameter it takes is
the size of the window or frame so go
ahead and put size equals and sorry if
I'm typing so I had to put a bunch of
stickers on my keyboard for After
Effects but that's totally something
different so size equals 300 wide by 200
tall and I think I have no I'm good so
now we have our constructor function
boat and this is pretty much our basic
frame that we have built so now we have
a frame now we got to go ahead and if we
run this program right now nothing would
show up because even though we built a
frame we didn't tell our program to go
ahead and show it yet so that's what I'm
going to do right now and to do this I'm
going to build a simple if statement now
what am i Beth type you don't really
need to know what it does but you need
to have it I'm going to be going over it
and the next couple of tutorials but for
now just type it
and maybe I'll give you guys a basic 1/2
of what's going on you first need to
build a application actually just do is
I just uh I can't really type and talk
at the same time so by simple app and
again this is what we're going to copy
from all the rest of the tutorials so
don't delete this thing frame equals
Bucky and or whatever you name your
class right there frame equals Bucky
it's going to take the parameters
apparent equals nine make sure that
nothing capitalized - I believe it
matters and ID equals negative one and
frame
oh let's see dot show and also app main
loop with right there so let's go ahead
and save this and before I keep talking
let's see if it runs or not go ahead and
press f5 to run it and let's go ahead
and we see our frame right here right
there so again you can see the size is
300 pixels wide by 200 pixels tall and
the title is right here frame aka window
now I showed you guys how to build it
now let me talk to you guys one more
time and show you what everything meant
we needed a class because everything
that we need to work within WX it needs
to be in the class that's just how it is
the next thing we did is build this
constructor method or constructor
function and what this happened is it
let this frame automatically pop up if
we didn't build it inside a constructor
function we would have to like press a
button or type something on our keyboard
for it for him to pop up since this is
our main application we wanted to pop up
as soon as they run the program so
that's why we needed to put it in this
weird thing called ini T it stands for
initial initialization and it meant this
is the first thing that happens again
you put your title right here in your
size right here and now to this
confusing thing I'm going to give you
guys the quick 1/2 of what this means
every WX Python app
needs two things an application object
and it's a called a frame object or
something like that the application
object pretty much runs your program and
the frame object displays your program
so this is like the blood of your
program this is like the face of your
program it's pretty much the inner
workings and what they see so now that
we got our application object and frame
object we could show the frame since
that's what they wanted and run the main
loop this is a pretty much running the
application but again all of this you
don't need to know for now but you do
need it in every application so copy
this ignore it for now this is more
advanced stuff well we're going to be
concentrating on in the next couple
tutorials is how to add buttons and
menus and other cool stuff other things
called widgets this so again this is
your tutorial for now um pretty much all
you need to learn is how to add a title
and how to resize your window and once
you've got that you're ready to move on
to next tutorial where I promise I'll be
clearing everything up for you so thank
you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed
your intro to WX and I will see you next
