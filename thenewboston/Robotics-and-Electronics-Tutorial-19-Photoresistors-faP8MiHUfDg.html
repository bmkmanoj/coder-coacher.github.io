your next tutorial and robotics in
electronics and in this tutorial I'm
going to be teaching you about one of my
favorite pieces of electronics and these
let me see if I can zoom in these little
things right there are called calcium
sulfide photo resistors those little
tiny things right there and you were
saying what the heck did they do well
I'm about to tell you in the last
tutorial I showed you how a
potentiometer could change its
resistance based on turning the dial
right there well what photo resistors do
these little things right here in just a
little tidbit of information they're
also called photo cells and photo
conductors they all mean the same thing
so what these photo cells do is they
change their amount of resistance based
on how much light it receives so the
easiest way to show you guys this is
just a hook it up to a multimeter and
show you guys so right now it's kind of
medium lightness in my room so this is
giving off about um 15 or let's say 13
thousand ohms but when I let's a darken
up a bit as you can see as I block some
of the light out it gives off more
resistance now it's given up twenty
seven thousand ohms
let me darken it some more now it's
giving off about fifty thousand ohms of
resistance and let me make it completely
dark put my finger over it it's now
giving off a hundred or let's say
between 90 and 100 ohms of resistance so
there the darker it gets the more it
resists and therefore the lighter it
gets the more electricity it allows the
pests through it and this is going to be
useful in a robot and they have these in
things like a night lights for kids and
they have them
armed streetlights and stuff we're stuff
that it automatically changes the amount
of electricity due to the amount of
light he receives so these things are
awesome one of my favorite pieces of
electronics that we'll be working with
and they're extremely cheap so again I
encourage you guys to go out and pick up
some photo cells or photo resistors this
is what they look like and don't forget
to subscribe and check out my next
tutorial so thank you guys for watching
and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
