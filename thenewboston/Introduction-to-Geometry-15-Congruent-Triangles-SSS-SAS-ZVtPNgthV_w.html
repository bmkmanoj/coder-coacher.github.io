are congruent today using two of the
five basic methods the first is side
side side and the second is side angle
side so the first one side side side is
when you have three sides of one
triangle congruent to three sides of
another triangle so here we know that
this side is congruent to this side
this sides congruent to this side this
sides congruent to this side therefore
we're going to call this triangle and
this triangle beem triangle a is
congruent to triangle B so then the next
one we're going to talk about is called
side angle side or for short s is to
sides and the included angle of one
triangle are congruent to two sides in
the included angle of another triangle
so this part right here the the included
angle is really important it has to be
the included angle so for these two
triangles I know that this side is equal
to this side this side is congruent to
this side and I know that this angle
which is between these two sides and
this angle between these two sides are
both right-angles they don't have to be
right angles like if you were trying to
prove other triangles were congruent and
you just knew that they were their
angles were equal that's all that
matters but you don't have to know the
right triangles or right angles but we
know that because right angles equal 90
degrees
they these two angles have to be
congruent because they both measure 90
degrees so knowing that these three
things two sides and the included angle
and I call this a and this B therefore
we can say that triangle a is congruent
to triangle B so let's do some examples
so we're gonna state whether these
triangles are congruent and if they are
congruent we're gonna say whether it is
by side side side or side angle side if
we find that these triangles aren't
congruent we're just going to put
neither so first we have these two
triangles and I have this side congruent
to this side this side congruent to this
side and these two sides congruent so
therefore their triangle one is
congruent to triangle two by side side
side I can now I'm going to look at this
one I know this side is congruent to
this side this side is congruent to this
side so so far we have two congruent
sides but if you look this angle is the
included angle of this of these two
sides but this angle over here is not
the included angle for us to prove that
these are congruent that we'd have to
know that this one is congruent to to
this one but since we don't know that we
have to say neither now this doesn't
mean the triangles aren't congruent this
just means that we can't prove that they
are so we went over the first two ways
to prove triangles are congruent so make
sure you come back and watch the next
video
and we're going to talk about two other
ways to prove triangles are congruent
called angle side angle and angle angle
