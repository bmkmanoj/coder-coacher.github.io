about master detail flow and what this
is it's pretty much a new kind of way to
structure the entire design of your app
because what it is is essentially a way
to add a real quick menu to your app in
the menu is actually displayed
differently on tablets than of this
phones because phones don't really have
that much area to use so in like two
seconds
I'll be showing you guys a quick example
but right now start a new project you
know just things like master flow um I
don't know what's good enough
so master flow whatever alright
API eight looking good next in right
here instead of just adding a blank
activity scroll down to master detail
flow and this is a better little
demonstration instead of me just trying
to explain it so this is what it would
look like on a tablet if you're holding
a sideways again a list of items would
always be showing on a menu on the left
hand side and whenever the user selected
one of those things then the content or
whatever they were trying to view it
would appear on the right hand side now
of course with the phone it's a little
bit different because if you always had
a menu sticking on the left hand side
then you really couldn't see anything
because there's not that much space so
on a phone what happens is you have a
menu that kind of looks like this with a
bunch of items and the user can click
one of those and whenever they do it
transitions into just showing all the
content on the full screen and of course
if they ever want to pull up the menu
again they can click back and go back to
the menu so again a tablet always shows
the menu on the left a phone you have to
keep switching back and forth to it
alright so now that you know the basics
of it again select master detail flow
and hit next well I got like a phlegm in
my throat actually I'm chugging orange
soda right now so uh yeah not bad not
bad
alright so the first thing we need to
tell it is this alright Bucky you're
gonna have a list of items that the user
can choose
from what items are these well for this
example what I'm gonna do is for the
content I'm just gonna be displaying web
pages because it's really easy to do and
I don't know I just think will be a good
demonstration so for the object kind
I'll just write something like web page
in for the plural
alright web pages in this again you can
name it any noun that you want this is
just for naming conventions it doesn't
you know affect your code at all if you
name it something weird so naming like
list items web pages again books if
you're displaying like different books
they can choose from whatever but
anyways I'm gonna have web pages and
click finish alright looking good so as
you can see what it did already is it
created a bunch of different files for
us not just one Java class and one XML
layout like before it actually created
for it looks like pretty sweet and my
default we have this one right here and
this web page detail fragment popped up
for us now another thing I want to
mention is you don't have to click this
I just want to explain something so this
two pane layout would be for something
like a tablet this just looks kind of
weird because I'm using a phone as my
example but this left section would of
course be the list in the right area
this is actually called the details pane
so if I just call it the main area or
elected details area it's all the same
thing so again the list in the details
pane so I just didn't want you guys to
get confused with my terminology so the
first thing I actually want you guys to
do before we start working on the layout
or anything is go in your app Java under
your package you're gonna find a
directory called dummy
now what this dummy is if you expand it
you're gonna see that there's one java
file in it so just go ahead and click
that and let me drag it to the left and
as you can see by the comments it says
this is just a helper class for pretty
much creating really quick
templates essentially what this is is
it's just an example class and it has
some sample menu items right now so the
list just says like item 1 item 2 item 3
and of course you would never want to
use this whenever you're making a real
app again it has like kind of bad naming
conventions and everything but just for
understanding the basics of a
master-detail flow it's really good for
modifying and demonstrating so open this
file dummy content dot Java and of
course if you scroll down you're gonna
see a class called dummy item right here
so essentially what we're gonna do is
we're gonna be making a list of items
now each of those items is going to be a
dummy item object so each list is an
object now also each item in the list is
going to have a couple properties with
it these are the default properties but
I'm gonna have our list have an ID a
name in the URL for the webpage so we
can keep ID since of course every one of
our list items of course gonna have an
ID and I also want public string I'll
just name this like item name and let me
just copy this and the last thing we
need is the URL because whenever we
click it it needs to know what URL to
display in the details pane that main
area so after we created all our
variables the next thing I want to do is
actually just change this little method
right here and what this is pretty much
going to do is well I probably don't
even need to explain it but it's gonna
take whatever values we pass in and set
it to the class variables so I don't
know that's just normal Java stuff so of
course the ID is good
this item name set equal to whatever
item name we pass in
and this URL we have to set it equal to
whatever URL we pass in and of course
actually need to pass them in
all right looking good all right so
again one last time this class is going
to be responsible for creating
individual items in our list so of
course these are the properties that
each item is gonna have and right here
or we're doing is a I don't know this
just assigning the values to the
variables normal stuff and this last
method right here string to string what
I actually want to do is our no return
item name instead of the default content
so that's all we have to do as far as
creating individual items so now if we
scroll back up we're gonna see that we
got some errors right here so again for
the example whenever it was creating
items it just used two pieces of
information an ID and something else I
don't remember remember what it was but
right now our list items are gonna have
three properties an ID a name in a URL
so of course if we go up here this add
item is essentially just a method that
creates a new dummy item object and we
already saw whenever we created a dummy
item object that was of course a list
item simple enough so of course it needs
three properties that we need to pass in
and let me pull up alright so this is
what I'm gonna do so the first one of
course is the ID we'll keep that one two
and three the second one was the name so
I'll just name this one like Bucky and
this can just be a URL to my profile I
can get my cursor in the right place all
right so the next one can be a Yi it
will display the forum and the last one
will display the videos page
all right so what is the URL to my forum
that yeah let's get the URL to the
videos page again use any three URLs you
want you don't have to use the same ones
as I am alright so again what this bit
of code does is it essentially creates
three sample list items and each list
item has an ID associated with it a name
in this name is just gonna be the name
that appears on the list because
displaying the URL look I don't know
kind of stupid and the URL of course is
so we can pass it in and it knows what
to display</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
