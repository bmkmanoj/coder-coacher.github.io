Android tutorial tutorial for the new
boss in and what we're gonna do in this
tutorial we're gonna kind of overview or
talk about what we've done so far and
also we're gonna set up switching the
map view to be either satellite or
street view which is gonna be pretty
quick and simple so what we need to do
or first let's just talk through what
we've done within our alert button
called get address when we hit the click
button of our get get address alert we
created geo coder again a geo coder is
just going to allow us to get some
information about a specific longitude
and latitude if there's data that's
relating to that current geopoint we
basically can reference that and for
example if it has the address
information it's going to return us the
address information we actually use the
geo coder but just to set it up we set a
new geo coder we related to the main
context or a main class which is our
base context then we created a new
little cow and just to get default every
time we click this button it's gonna you
know get the default locale that's just
gonna kind of process information that's
on the screen whether you're zoomed in
and kind of relate to the coordinates
based off the pixels and all that stuff
then what we're gonna do is we're gonna
try and set up a list item that looks
for addresses in our geo coder because
again our geo coder is gonna be able to
get some information like the dress and
and convert it so what we set this list
up to which we call address is our geo
coder and then we get some information
from the location of basically the our
geo point and again we just divide by
one e six because it's returning our
latitude and longitude and and the
version e six so we just divide that out
to get rid of it we just want one item
within our list and then as long as our
list has been filled with something if
it's not set to zero we're gonna set up
a string called display and create a
loop in this
is gonna loop through twice the first
time it's just gonna give us like you
know the specific address like 1 2 3
Sesame Street and then the second time
it loops sure it's gonna give us like
the city and the state or whatever so
that's what that's gonna do and then all
we do is we create a toast that's gonna
display our display or show our display
string and we're gonna set it to be long
again referring to the context of our
main class or base context and that's
all we did in the last tutorial even
though we kind of went through that
stuff quickly it's pretty simple I mean
it's kind of complicated like you're
going to be like how am I ever gonna
remember all these methods but the thing
is once you guys get into programming if
you're new anyways you're gonna realize
that you realize it's kind of like that
for every project you you work on most
of the time you're gonna realize every
single method every single code and you
just kind of refer back to the internet
or to a previous project that you work
on you'll be like oh that's how I did it
so once you guys just get familiar with
kind of using some methods you'll
realize how to do it and again all this
kit is returning is basically you know
the location and our list of position 0
because again we only have one thing
within a list so that's what that's
returning there so that's just a quick
overview of what we did in this tutorial
we're gonna set up our third button we
still haven't set up our first one but
we'll get to that we're gonna say toggle
view and what we're gonna do is we're
gonna say we're gonna toggle between the
satellite view and the street view so
all we're gonna do within this toggle
view is set up a quick if statement and
we're gonna refer back to our map view
which we called map we're gonna say is
satellite or is street view however you
guys wanted to do it so we're gonna say
if it's in satellite mode what we want
is our map dot set satellite to be false
and we also want you know map dot set
street view to be true and that's
basically saying if our map is in
satellite view we want to shut off our
satellite view and we want to pretty
much turn on our street view but let's
say it's if if it's in the street view
it's gonna go through this and then this
is gonna return false so what we want to
do is say else and then we're gonna say
because again if it hits this else
statement most likely it's going to be
in street view so we want to turn the
street view off so we're just say set
street view to be false and we set up
our met our satellite to be true so
that's pretty much it I mean it's a
pretty quick tutorial let's check it out
run it make sure that works again our or
this button get address won't work for
some reason but as of now it looks like
we're in satellite view let's zoom in a
little bit
so
so again we're in satellite view so now
if we just you know click and hold and
we hit toggle view it's gonna shut off
our satellite view it's going to turn on
a road view or a street view and it's
going to look like that again if we hold
down release toggle views again go back
into satellite and yeah it's pretty
sweet you know a lot of you guys have
priced in Google Maps before but still
pretty tight to see all the satellite
images and all that stuff so there you
go pretty quick tutorial guys but I hope
you enjoyed it and I'll catch you in the
next tutorial have a good one guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
