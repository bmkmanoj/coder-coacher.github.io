know basic housekeeping crap taken care
of let's go ahead and start building the
init method now this applet only has two
methods of course the first one is the
init and I you know I like putting a
comment above all my methods just
because whenever I build a huge program
these green things help you know when
I'm aware I'm scrolling through them
real quick I can see where the methods
start so public void in it and of course
the first thing we need to do is now
that we pretty much said ok Java we're
going to make a hash map and an
ArrayList we might as well in our init
method go ahead and make them since you
know we're always true to our promises
so this one was named a website info so
let me just go ahead and copy that crap
so web site info equals new hash map and
the title is a string in the URL which
we want to tell our browser to go to is
actually going to be a URL object and
after this just go ahead and put empty
parenthesis just like that now after
this do the same thing with titles which
is our ArrayList titles equals new
ArrayList and this takes the title which
is a string and empty parentheses after
that so now we created and I spelled a
right list with a lowercase L
embarrassing so now what we basically
did is we created blank a blank hashmap
and a blank ArrayList now eventually
where we're going to be doing is we're
going to be populating these with
information but for now we won't really
worry about them so remember that I told
you guys that we're going to have two
methods in this applet well of course
the first method is this init and a
second one is going to be a method
called grab HTML info now what this
method is going to do if you guys
couldn't guess it's basically going to
take all you know you remember in the
very first video or the 28th video
whenever we may
HTML document well what this method is
going to do is pretty much grab all the
necessary information out of those
parameters and stick them into a hash
map in an ArrayList because Java can't
work directly with an HTML document it
needs to convert them into something
that's a little bit easier to work with
so it's more familiar that with hash
maps and arrays and crap
then you know HTML documents so that's
what this method is going to do so after
this let me go ahead and I'm going to
code the rest of the init method and
then we'll jump into grab HTML info I
think that would be the easiest way to
understand so what I want to do now is
just add start building the GUI I'm
going to add this label right here that
says what website do you want to visit
and that's just you know nice to give
the user a nice little prompt in in
order to do that just go ahead and add
new jlabel
and is a parameter for jlabel takes a
string what website do you want want to
visit question mark and as the second
parameter what you need to do is you
need to write where do you want this
label and I'll just put it in boarder
layout north
and hopefully there we go I was saying
all right that doesn't frickin turn blue
then I messed something or mess
something up all right so after that
after we added our label to the GUI and
again this just adds the title at the
top of our applet what we want to do now
is we want to go ahead and basically
make the other part of the GUI which is
a list so our GUI is really simple all
it has is a label which is what website
do you want to visit in a list
underneath it in our list only has two
items in it the new Boston the org and
Bucky's Twitter so let's go ahead and
first of all make that list right now
now the list is going to be this J list
because of course since we have a jlabel
we'll add a J list and that makes up the
GUI so let's do that right now main list
equals new J list and for a J list the
first parameter it takes is and actually
the only parameter is basically an array
of items so what we want to do is take
our array list which is titles and to
convert it to an array use the method to
oh look at this it already knows what
we're doing it's like going to code the
rest of the project for me so I'm just
going to type in two letters and this is
just going to code the rest of the appli
for me many ways what we did now is
we're saying okay worried about this
later on but we want to add a pretty
much a title to the applet and also the
list which is going to consist of all
the titles and basically there are only
going to be two things in this list the
new Boston the org and Bucky's Twitter
so after this what we need to do is now
that we have the shell of our app what
made we can go ahead and start adding
some smarts or intelligence to our
applet now this is how our applet is
going to work there's going to be a
listener that sits on the applet and
waits for the user to make one of these
selections as soon as the user clicks
one of these things for example I'm
going to go ahead and click the new
Boston though org right now it's going
to say well
wait a minute they just freaking click
something that means that I have to run
some code to take them to the website so
anytime that you want to wait for the
user or visitor of your website or
applet to do something you need to add a
listener now the listener for this is
well it's called a list selection
listener but I think what I'm going to
do is wait for the next tutorial and
then I can code my whole entire listener
instead of breaking up between this
video and the next one so anyways in the
next video we're going to code the
listener now that you know what it does
so thank God for watching and we can
subscribe and I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
