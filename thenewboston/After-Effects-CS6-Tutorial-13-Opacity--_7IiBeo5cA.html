buddy Blackford for the new Boston Adobe
After Effects cs6 tutorials in this
tutorial we're going to be talking about
opacity and how to fade things out and
fade them in or turn them off or turn
them on so let's get right to it there
should be a pretty quick tutorial let's
start now
the quickest way right to get to opacity
is by clicking on a layer and pressing T
that brings up the opacity so you can go
to this one also another way is to twirl
down into your transforms and then
opacity is down there at the bottom so
let's uh I like to hit T because it
doesn't have all the other crap in the
way so if you have opacity at a hundred
percent it's going to show if you have
it at zero it's going to be gone turn it
on I have the two squishes here and then
we can you can animate opacity and
that's the way you can do crossfades
or you can animate opacity to be to be
100% and then 0% to just turn right off
real quick so I'll explain we'll start
at the beginning we'll set the opacity
to 100% by keyframing it clicking on the
stopwatch starts to keyframe and then
we'll go in like a second and go to zero
now if I do a ram preview you can see it
fades out
simple enough now you want something to
turn off really quick so you set your
keyframe at at a point hit the page down
button to go one frame use this all the
time type in zero percent and now you
can see it'll turn it will turn it off
yep that one turns right off without
fading that's easy and when you're doing
something like this and you turn it
you're going to turn this off for good
you can grab your layer here on the end
and pull it in close that way After
Effects doesn't try to render any layers
you have any frames on the layers and
it'll save you
processing time so then I would try to
take this all the way down here doesn't
have to be right on sometimes if you do
it right on you might mess up and have
it like cut off to earlier or something
like that you can also animate opacity
at the same time so let's delete these
keyframes I'm going to turn it off
I'm going to click on both of these by
holding ctrl or shift shift will select
a bunch in a row like here I'll click on
this and then I'll hold shift and click
on BG that's locked and it will select
all of them in between or I can click on
the layer and hit control and it all I
select kind of like when you're
selecting keyframes so let's looks like
the opacity is at zero turn that back on
100 real quick so you can see what's
going on all right
select both T and if you hit the
stopwatch for one it's going to make it
go for two if you have R for both of
them if you have both selected a little
bit now all you got to do is select type
into percentage for 1 and that will both
go to 50% move it back in here and then
put it back up and just doing one
doesn't have to be the top one I can do
it to the bottom one to see 95% oh one
one zillion 95 just 95 90 they're both
at 95 quick way to animate things at the
same time
another little tip for animating opacity
or any other value really click on your
keyframe here and your current time
indicator is not on that keyframe so you
don't know that what the value is of
this keyframe so you can right click it
50% right there
this one right click it you know that
one's at 100% so let's see if those were
actually at 100% 50 yeah that was at 100
and this one was at 50 it's a quick way
to figure out what your keyframes are so
that's a that's it for animating opacity
it's really simple opacity is used all
the time to turn layers off or to fade
out fading out happens all the time so I
hope you guys enjoyed the tutorial made
it quick for you and go go out and have
some fun see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
