fourth tutorial and Adobe Premiere Pro
and in this tutorial I'm going to be
going over one thing I forgot to go over
last time and I'm also going to be
teaching guys how to make transitions
between scenes in your movies so other
thing I forgot to go over last time is
how when you mess up your title on the
fading it in and fading it out how to
just get rid of it so here we have the
title right here and as you can see it
says Myrtle Beach and if you remember
from last video how we made it fade in
we went go to the beginning go to 0 then
go about a quarter it away go 100 go
about another way go 100 then go out the
end then go back to zero and what this
does is make our title fade in show up
and then fade out jelly but say you
accidentally made a key frame right here
and I try to move it or you just mess
all this up one thing you can do if you
want to completely start over is
right-click anywhere in here in pick
clear all keyframes that's what these
little squares are called keyframes so
if you clear all those as you see you
get a brand-new line again you can start
from brand new so that's how if you mess
up on your trend I mean a fading in
fading now then you can start over again
now the what I wanted to go over today
was how to add transitions to your video
now as you can see right now we have two
scenes right here and let me just play
it real quick so you can see what they
are right now let me just play this
there and as you can see as you can see
the two seen just kind of cut into each
other with no transition or anything
like that so what we want to do right
now is make a transition so let's go
ahead and let me show you how to do this
go to your timeline between the two
scenes as you can see this is seen one
this is seen to you want to first open
your effects panel and to do this go
down window effects and when you do that
if it's not already open this a little
effects panel will open up and you want
to go to video transitions click on the
climbing the triangle facing the right
you'll see a whole list of transitions
all of these honor to this are different
transitions that you can use now I'm not
going to go through them because there's
about 80 million but i'm just going to
show you guys one of the most basic ones
dissolve you probably will be using a
lot but for the purpose of this video
just so it's easy to see i'm going to go
to GPU transitions and i'm going to go
to card flip now the process is the same
with every transition so pay attention
once you find the transition you want
and these will be labeled with a purple
square next to them click and drag and
bring it over to the video and once you
put it between your two scenes you'll
see it highlighted the kind of then just
let go and if it says this just click ok
they just give you a little saying it
doesn't really mean anything and now you
can see a little purple box in between
your two scenes let me just zoom in
right here so you can see it a little
easier now you see a little purple box
and this marks the transition you can
also adjust the size just like you're
adjusting the size to make your
transition longer or shorter now if we
go in a play this
we can see that we have a nice little
transition and if you missed that let me
play it one more time and instead of
just cutting we this is a the way that
we transition from one scene to another
and of course if you want to get rid of
it just right click it and press clear
and if you want to add another one again
just click drag the transition and bring
it in between your scenes and you can
also adjust the size right here so that
is how you add transitions between two
scenes of a movie using Adobe Premiere
Pro so study that and make sure you know
how to do that and make sure from now on
you watch all my videos in high def I'll
have a link on the right hand side so
thank you for watching I hope you
learned something and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
