sheriff tutorial and I'm making fire in
Boston
in this tutorial I'm going to show you a
little bit more on inheritance and I'm
going to show you how to use our
interfaces so in the last tutorial I
forgot to tell you that you can only
inherit one base class so we couldn't
put like a comma here and inherit like
another class but we can inherit from
the same class multiple times so we
could create another class here called I
let's call it my third class and you can
inherit from Kappler and we could
inherit from my class as well so now
this would both of these classes are
inherited from my face class they're
both derived from the same class also we
could inherit from a class inheriting
for example my third class could inherit
from my second class so if we did that
then my third class would contain
everything from both this class and this
class so if we go out here we should see
that we have both air color and show
message because I'm hair color is in
this class but show message is
originally in this class so that's
pretty much it on our arrogance so the
next thing that we're going to be
looking at is interfaces and armed
decree in on your face you're first
going to type the keyword interface then
following that you're going to want to
name your interface usually interfaces
start with eyes so are capitalized so
you're going to want to start your
interface of the capital I as well and
that just means this it will allow
someone to differentiate between a class
and an interface so I'm gonna do
interface and then knowledge pop my
interface oops
all right and now inside of an interface
you can create names for methods
properties and also indexers and events
which we haven't learned yet and um so
you cannot create like a definition for
them so if we were going to create a
void we would just do like um void will
this have it I guess my void and then
whatever parameters you want to pass
through it we're just gonna fasten on
for the moment and then just put a
semicolon and that's it you cannot put
up curly braces and have it actually do
something that is for method for classes
so and all of the members inside of
interface are default leaf public and
you cannot put an access modifier on
this and make it like private or
something all of them will be public and
they will remain public so if we were to
you're probably wondering what
interfaces are used for if you can't
like even define what this does well
what you do is you inherit from this
interface and use it in a class and you
can inherit from a class and an
interface or just as many interfaces as
you like so to America man interface as
well we just put a comma and then the
interface name and we're going to pair
it from my interface and now in here is
where we can create a definition for um
void my void we just do my void or
actually its type will make it public
and then do void I void and then we can
define it however it must be the same
thing it must be like a void it must be
called my void and it must have the same
parameter numbers or same parameters in
it so we you should just copy this
directly just paste it in there and then
you can put your curly braces green
now inside up here we can make it do
something all this little message box be
displayed actually I might as well use
this uh this method right appears we're
going to base show message and we'll
just have it display a message saying my
to Boyd so now we can use this just like
we would normally use it and you're
probably wondering well what's the point
of having an interface if you can just
declare in here anyways well you might
interfaces are used for if you have like
multiple classes and you all want them
to do something similar and you all want
them to have the same methods inside of
them for example if you are having if
you a bunch of classes that handle
different file formats and they all do
essentially the same thing of those file
formats such as reading from them and
writing from them well if you had an
interface that um had to void in here
such as reading and writing then you
could inherit from this interface and
use them both in all those classes so
that when you went to you those classes
wouldn't have to know anything about the
file formats you could just know oh it
reads from it so we can see that method
so now here you go back out here and
create a new instance of my second class
and so you can do it nice and close and
see my void and then we should just get
a message box that says my void yep
all right so that's basically it on
interfaces and it's really not much to
it so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
