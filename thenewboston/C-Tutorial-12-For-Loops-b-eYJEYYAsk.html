tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
to be talking to you guys about
something called off a loop in the first
kind of loop I want to go over is a for
loop and sprout fo r ll o P so you know
what I'm talking about so what this loop
does is allow you to perform a task a
certain task a bunch of times without
having to type it over and over
you just type a task in and tell C++ how
many times you want it to run and it
does it for you so let's get started as
you can see we already have both our
includes and our just our basic what we
always have to start out so I move this
somewhere you can see there we go
and the syntax that we first need to get
started is first declare a basic integer
variable oops we don't want to be typing
up there right in your main function so
let's type int X we'll just name the
variable X to make it easy and the
syntax for the loop itself is the word
for and this means that you're going to
begin a for loop then you want to add
two parameters to the loop and you don't
need to put a semicolon at the end just
leave a blank now inside these
parameters there's going to be three
separate things and what we're going to
be doing is giving it a range giving the
variable arrange to tell c++ how many
times we want to perform this task and
we use our variable that we declared
right here and the first thing we want
to do is tell c++ where we want our
variable to start in 99 percent of time
we're going to be starting write is zero
and then add a semicolon and the next
thing you want to do is tell c++ word
stop so let's put X is um less than nine
so right now we have a range from zero
to nine the first and second thing and
the last thing you have to do is tell
our program how much you want to
increment it by and we're going to
increment it by one every time
so instead of typing x equals x plus one
a quicker way to do that is type in x +
+ and this adds one to it every time an
x - - would subtract one so now that we
have range zero to nine in air per
minute by one we're going to have it
we're going to have our action perform
nine times
so what action do we exactly want to do
well the very next line under our for
loop is our instructions about what we
want to do and as usual let's just make
a simple output statement and I'm just
going to write hey there and give it a
new there we go give it a new line so
what this is oops so this is going to do
right now we declared our variable we we
said our a zero to nine do it one for
each time and for every one of those
times just output hey there on the
screen so let's save this and show you
guys what it looks like hopefully I
don't have any errors or nothing and as
you can see our program executed hey
there
nine times
and this is one way where you can
perform a series of tasks again and
again without having to type it over and
over and as you can see if we didn't do
this before it we would have to write C
out this whole thing nine times but with
this simple syntax you all you have to
do is write this and it can perform it
all for you without having to go over
and over and I'll save you a bunch of
space and a bunch of done now another
thing I want to show you guys real quick
is you can just output the variable
itself to so say you want to start at
zero and go to nine and this isn't going
to show up nine because it's the less
than nine so it's only going to show
eight but this might be a little easier
for you guys to grasp on let's see
what's going on right now as you see we
first declared the variable then went
zero one two three four five six seven
eight so this is another way where we
can use a for loop to save a bunch of
time and a bunch of code so save this
and once you learn this you can start
using your programs to perform
repetitive tasks with only a very small
bit of code and in the next tutorial
we'll be going over probably another
kind of loop so I hope you enjoyed my
tutorial and remember subscribe thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
