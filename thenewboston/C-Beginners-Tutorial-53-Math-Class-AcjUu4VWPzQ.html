c-sharp tutorial that I'm making for
them in Boston and in this tutorial I'm
gonna be showing you how to use the math
class so all you're going to need for
this tutorial is a button and illegal
once you have those on your form just
double click on the bottom so in order
to access the map class we're just going
to want to type out math in order to
access the methods inside of the math
class we're just going to use a dot
operator since all the methods inside of
the math class are static the first
method that are going to be looking at
inside of the math class is the absolute
value method and this will just return
the absolute value of a number so if we
just put negative 4 in here and it will
just return absolute value of negative 4
and we're going to go ahead and set
label ones text equal to the absolute
value of negative 4 just to make sure
that that class is working properly so
it's going to be bug here and we should
get four yep is the absolute value of
negative 4 is 4 and you can get the
absolute value of pretty much any
numbers so whether you get the absolute
value of 833 you can do that should just
get 833 do the math class doesn't only
contain methods there are also a few
values as well for example we can access
pi if we're trying to do some
calculations with circles or something
we can excuse that and we're just going
to set label ones texts equal to pi and
we should get 3.1415 whatever yep
also inside of the math class there is
the how method or raising a number to a
power or exponents whatever you want to
call it and say we wanted to square the
number 4 we put 4 right here and then
put 2 so the number that you want to
square will go right here and then
however many times you want to raise it
you'll put here and we just want to do
for the second power or
or squared or whatever you want to call
it and we're just going to use the dot
two string method here to convert it to
a string so that we can not set it as
legal once text and we should get 16
cents for square root of 16
yep and you can put any numbers here
just I'm going to do 32 to the fourth
power you could do that as well should
give some crazy number yep
also in the math class there is the
round method and the round method will
basically round any double value or any
number that has a decimal point in it so
say we want to round four point seven
well it'll do that will return five
since four point seven rounded to the
nearest whole number is five again we're
going to convert a new string here so
now let me click button one you should
just get five yep and default Li it will
round to the nearest whole number but if
you want to specify how many values you
want it to round two like for example Q
looks like pretty decimal right here
like that and you want to round it to
the hundredths place you can do that and
right here you're just going to specify
how many decimal places you want it to
be back so this would be 1 and this
would be 2 so we're going to put it back
we're going to put it back to so around
the nearest onions place we're just
going to here and it'll round to nearest
hundreds place so it should get like
four point seven three because this is a
four yep and if you wanted it to round
to the nearest whole number you could
just even leave this out or here just
put 0 so that's pretty much it for this
tutorial on using the math class I know
I didn't go over every single method
inside of the math class but they're
pretty self-explanatory they give a nice
little tooltip right after it and I
don't know all the math things since I
haven't gotten into those
pants math classes yet but yeah so see
you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
