tutorial
let me check that's right 77th tutorial
for the new Boston so basically what
we're going to do in this tutorial is
something really simple basically it's
real quick real easy last thing we're
going to do for this graphic surface
class I know I told you guys we're done
with that but since I'm going to relate
release this app on the market for you
guys to download some of you guys mater
you've downloaded it if you are living
in the future because then it would
already be on the market place and you
know this video would be made in your
past I don't know what I'm talking about
it's too late but basically we want to
be conscious of slower devices that you
know will download our app from the
marketplace so how we can kind of kind
of utilize our thread and make it you
know use less processing speed so slower
devices can run at kind of the same rate
as higher devices we want to set up kind
of a frames per second atmosphere when
we work with animation or game
development because as of now within
this on touch method it's basically the
only thing that's kind of going as fast
as it can because we have this return
true here it's just cycling through and
updating and updating like sweating or
like hey man you want some water he's
like no I got to do this I got to do
this man get other way and you know
using all the processing speed at can we
we kind of want to be like hey man just
sleep for a little bit yeah you're like
sleep we're not to do that yeah I mean
it's a pretty simple concept but when
working with game development it comes
in very beneficial to have a set frame
rate that you work with and kind of
concept we're kind of how to create a
frame rate is just doing some simple
calculation for example if we want to
have a frame rate of about 60 frames per
sec
all we have to do is take 1,000
milliseconds which is one second divided
by our frame rate that we want to
achieve so 60 not equal you know sixteen
point six six six six six six six six
six six six seven frames or I mean
that's the sleep time that would one
have but we're going to be even more
generous and just say sleep earth red
dot sleep and then we're going to say
like fifty instead of sixteen point four
sixteen or seventeen something like that
so this will give us a frame rate of
twenty frames per second for the most
part and all we have to do now is again
surround it with a trying catch so just
hover over and say surround with try and
catch and it sets it up for us very
nicely again this is within our on touch
method and that's going to allow again
our application just to sleep every once
in a while you know not use all the
processing speed that it needs and it's
not really going to affect you know the
way our application runs the most part
is just going to save some of that
processing speed I know this tutorial is
pretty much pointless but you know the
frames per second is important concept
for you game developers that that you
want to consider in the future but as
you can see it doesn't really affect how
our application runs for the most part
it actually makes it run faster because
we have more processing speed and it
doesn't really affect the performance so
hopefully I don't know it these tutorial
this tutorial is just pathetic I'm sorry
guys but again frame rates frames per
second is a portent concept I'm just
going to leave with that because I
didn't go to bed and we're going to get
into an awesome topic on the next
tutorial
so awesome in fact I don't even know
what's going to be about yet so look
forward to seeing you guys then and have
a good one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
