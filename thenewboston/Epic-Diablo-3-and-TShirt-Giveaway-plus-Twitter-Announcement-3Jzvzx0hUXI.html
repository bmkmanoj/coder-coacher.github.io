wanted to make this video to let you
guys know about another awesome giveaway
I'm having now since the new boston is
primarily a computer-related channel i
figured that it would be a good idea to
give away one of the most anticipated
computer games this season diablo 3 so
here it is i decided to give away one
copy of Diablo 3 but then I got to
thinking and I was like you know what
Bucky wouldn't it be cool if instead of
giving away a copy of Diablo 3 you could
give away 10 copies of diablo 3 so there
you go how awesome is that i'm giving
away 10 copies of one the coolest
computer games come out the season
diablo 3 so i know that whenever i have
contests a lot of people enter and only
a limited number of people get to win
you know for example only 10 people are
going to get to win the video game
diablo 3 so this time I decided to have
a secondary prize i'm giving away 100
the new boston t-shirts these are black
t-shirts and they say the new boston
classic right on the bottom pretty
freakin sweet t-shirts so 100 the new
boston t-shirts and 10 brand new copies
of diablo 3 one of the coolest computer
games of the season but you know what
it's not good enough so i'm also giving
away 100 more the new boston t-shirts
these are some of my favorite t-shirts
their navy blue and they have a red my
friends who are alcoholics say that this
looks like a beer label but you know I
just think it's a cool design if your
alcoholic then you probably think it
looks like a beer label band noise 100
of these navy blue t-shirts 100 black
the new boston t-shirts in 10 copies of
diablo 3 so 200 t-shirts in total in 10
copies of diablo 3 definitely the best
giveaway that I ever had but still I
thought that I could do better so I'm
giving away another this is the t-shirt
that I have on actually 100 of this is
my favorite t-shirt that I ever made in
my whole life it has kind of a it's on
ash gray t-shirt and it has wooing kits
kind of a skater logo
it says the new boston with a really
awesome design in guys I love this t
shirt I wear all the time as you can see
definitely the favorite or my favorite
t-shirt that I ever made so there you
have it 310 prizes that i'm giving away
and if you never watch one of my contest
before it's really easy to enter
probably more easy than any other
contests on youtube you basically don't
have to do anything you don't have to
favorite this video share it you don't
even have to leave a comment the only
thing that you have to do is be a
subscriber to the New Boston that's it
takes one button one click easy enough
so once your subscriber of course go
ahead and send me a message through
YouTube in as the title of the message
tell me which prize you want if you want
the video game then go ahead and write
diablo 3 or if you want a t-shirt then
go ahead and tell me which t-shirt you
want as well as the t-shirt size so
again if you want the game just go ahead
and write diablo 3 as the title if you
want a t-shirt then say something like
um black t-shirt medium as the title now
in your message body go ahead and leave
me your full name so i know who
descended to as well as you're properly
formatted mailing address or shipping
address so that way i know which brands
you want who to send it to and where to
send it and another thing that people
usually ask what size t-shirt so i have
i have small through 3x L so pretty much
any size that you would want um another
thing everyone in the world is eligible
as long as your subscriber then I will
ship it anywhere in the world because
you know I know you guys watch my videos
from all over I don't want to exclude
everyone so everyone is able to win and
the last thing people always ask do I
have to pay for shipping I will pay for
shipping myself just give me your
address I'm not going to ask any money
from you not even shipping not the cost
of the game not the cost of the t-shirt
every single thing is free my way of
saying thank you to my subscribers for
supporting my channel watching my videos
commenting thank you guys so much now
the last thing I want to say is for
everyone who has been asking me to get
to Twitter why you'd want me to get a
twitter I have no
idea I figured you guys would be sick of
listening to me by now but if anyone
wants to get inside my crazy head hear
some of my crazy thoughts I finally got
a Twitter my name is Bucky Roberts I'll
put a link to it in the description
below so go ahead and follow me if you
want to you know um here's some of my
ramblings crazy thoughts and you know

personal life so one more thing before I
let you guys go this morning I looked at
my youtube channel of the new boston and
i saw that it's almost about to hit

to get there either tomorrow or in the
following day so thank you guys so much
to everyone who has subscribed and
favorited commented watch my video

idea that that many people whenever I
