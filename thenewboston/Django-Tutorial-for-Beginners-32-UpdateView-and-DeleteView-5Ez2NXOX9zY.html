video I want to talk to you guys about
the update view which is essentially a
view that you can edit in an album or
object and the cool thing about this is
it's actually the same exact form as
adding it
we just pre-populated with whatever
information is in there so it makes it
really easy and also the delete view
which gives the user is a really quick
way to delete objects so we actually
need to import one more module so that's
from django core your rubbers Auvers
import reverse lazy and we're going to
see what that does in just a second so
since creating an album and editing it
are so similar we can actually just copy
this and plop it right there so again
this is for creating a new object
however whenever you edit it you need to
inherit from update view and of course
it's not album create its album update I
will say name to edit but you know
whatever I didn't make Django so there
you go now the last thing we need to do
and guys that's it
that's all you need to do for update so
whenever you make the delete view and
this view is going to occur whenever the
user just clicks a delete button like
this trash can right here so I'll name
album delete and we inherit from this
class right here delete view so of
course the first thing just like all of
these you need to say what model it is
what kind of object you're trying to
lability to delete now another thing
that's a little bit different from these
you see whenever you're making a new
album or editing it you're pretty much
going to use this form right here
however whenever you just click delete
it doesn't take you to a new form and
you don't have to like fill anything out
it just pretty much deletes this and
then it's going to say okay after you
delete an object where do you want me to
go because maybe you're on this details
page and you delete it well then this
page doesn't exist anymore so what we
need to do is we need to use this module
right here
and it pretty much says where do you
want me to redirect to
so it's actually called success URL so
whenever you successfully delete an
object just call reverse lazy and then
pass in the name of the view and we're
just going to redirect them to the home
page
so again if they're anywhere in the
delete and album is just going to go
ahead and redirect them to the home page
simple enough so again the view is music
index and that's all we need to do right
there easy peasy so after this we need
to hop over in URLs and make our URL
patterns to link an update view to this
and a delete view to this so let me
actually just copy these and I'll make a
little comment above for the URL
structure of each so you guys can kind
of you know see what's going on so
whenever we want to update a view what
we're going to do is instead of album ad
we're actually going to go album and
then I'll just read something like two
right here so this is the URL we're
going to use in this signifies we are
updating or editing the album with a
primary key of two now of course in our
URL structure we can't have a door here
we need one of these thingies and of
course instead of album create it's
actually album update and the name of
this will just put album update all
right looking good
so for deleting it what do I want to do
first I'll just copy this alright so
this is for editing it whenever we want
to delete it is pretty much the same URL
except we call delete right after so we
can actually copy this entire ruler
expression and then plop deletes right
onto the end of it so instead of album
update it's album delete and instead of
album add it's album delete all right so
this is the URL that you're going to
redirect the user to whenever they want
to create
new album whenever they're editing and
whenever they are deleting it so the one
thing we have to do is over in our index
now that we have everything set up we
can actually link this button to this
URL so how do we do that
well if we go in the delete button right
here what we can do is this
so it's URL and make sure our name the
right thing album delete so it's music
album delete and again whenever you
delete an album we need to pass in the
primary key of that album so on the home
page we use say album dots ID and there
we go and we actually don't even have a
link anywhere that we can click and edit
this album but we can go ahead and check
it out real quick
so let me do this all right
so let me copy this structure because
I'm too lazy to type two things of text
and let's say we wanted to add a link
somewhere so users could edit this album
now this album as we see has the primary
key of six so how would we do that we
just read music album six now check it
out it gives you the exact same form but
now all the information is pre-populated
so instead of rap this was actually a
country album hit submit and there you
go now of course to delete it all you do
is you go over to this button right here
and it deletes it and then remember it
always redirects you to the home page
and we stated that right there so if you
want to redirect them to another page
maybe says hey congratulations you
successfully deleted in album this is
where you would change it but again look
how clean our code is right now and a
lot easier whenever we let Django take
care of everything behind the scenes so
then guys watching don't forget
subscribe and I will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
