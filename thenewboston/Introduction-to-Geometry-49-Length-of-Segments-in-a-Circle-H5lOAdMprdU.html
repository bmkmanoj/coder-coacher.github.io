segments in a circle so when two chords
intersect the product of the links and
just remember a product is a fancy word
of saying the multiplication of the
length along one chord is equal to the
products of the lengths of another chord
so if i have this cord right here and
enter a sexist cord right here a times b
is equal to c times d and if you
remember multiplication is commutative
so i can multiply in any order and i'll
still get the same answer as long as i
multiply the right parts together i want
part of one chord times part of another
chord equals part of one chord times
part of another chord so now we're going
to do an example okay find the indicated
link so we have this cord right here in
this cord right here we're trying to
solve for a so we need to take part of
this cord right here which is eight
multiply it by this other part which is
three and set it equal to six times a so
8 times 3 is 24 equals 6 a-2 sulfur a
we're going to divide both sides by 6
and if you do that you get a is equal to
4 and we can check that by doing eight
times four equals six
oh I made a mistake it should be 8 times
3 is equal to 6 times 4 so 8 times 3 is
24 and six times 4 is 24 so that's a
good way to check your answer so now I
want to find the measure of I and this
is a 2 by the way not in a so I'm going
to take two times I and set it equal to
3 times 4 so 2 I is equal to 3 times 4
which is 12 to solve for i i'm going to
divide both sides by 2 and i get i is
equal to 6 so that's all for our lesson
today make sure you come back because
the next lesson we're going to shift our
focus to a perimeter of shapes and
polygons more specifically</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
