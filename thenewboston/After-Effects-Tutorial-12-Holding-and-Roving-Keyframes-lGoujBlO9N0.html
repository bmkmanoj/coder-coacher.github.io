Effects tutorial and in this story I'm
going to be teaching you how to hold
keyframes and also how to even out your
animation path really easily so the
first thing that I'm gonna want to do is
teach you guys how to hold keyframes now
holding keyframe means is this if you go
to our animation to watch you see that
Charlie the chupacabra is gonna go along
this motion path in a nice smooth manner
just like that but sometimes you're
gonna want them to jump from one
keyframe to another and this is called
holding a keyframe it holds the object
at one keyframe until it gets that point
in time where it reaches the other
keyframe and then it makes them jump to
that keyframe so go ahead and select
whatever keyframe you want to hold I'm
gonna go ahead and select the first one
since I'm gonna want to hold them on the
first one once you have the first
keyframe or any keyframe selected go up
to animation go down the toggle hold
keyframe and as you can see this dotted
line now change to a straight line and
when we play our animation it's gonna
hold Charlie here until he gets to this
point in time and then it's gonna jump
them to the next keyframe so let's watch
it in action as you can see Charlie
stayed at the first keyframe until it
was time to go to the second keyframe
which it held them there now remember
whatever keyframe you hold it's gonna
hold them there until it gets to the
next keyframe so if we're gonna hold
your last keyframe it's not gonna do
anything it's gonna be worthless
so another easy way that you can do this
is hold down the ctrl alt tab it's a
ctrl alt and click your keyframes this
is a really easy way that you can toggle
them on and off so let me just play you
guys that real quick show you guys what
that means as you can see he
automatically jumps from one keyframe to
that to the other
keeping his other animation properties
so let's change that back to normal and
I want to show you guys the next thing I
wanted to go over today and that's
called roving keyframes or what I call a
evening out the speed of your animation
now once you have a huge motion path you
can see that it can be a pain that all
of these speeds are different for
example this one goes slower and this
one goes real fast now I could try to
adjust those by hand in the graphical
editor but there's a lot easier way to
do this first we need to open up our
graphical editor so we can see what's
going on and now we can see the speed of
Charlie first he's going kind of slow
and then he's going kind of fast now if
we have a huge path then it can be a
kind of a pain to even all these out so
here's a shortcut go ahead and make sure
that your position is selected so and
once you click this it'll select all
your keyframes then you want to go down
to the triangle right here and you want
to click roll across time now before I
click this take note of how close these
dots are and how far away these dots are
right here when you click a roev across
time you can see all your dots are even
out and now when we play our animation
Charlie goes at a nice constant speed
throughout the whole animation just what
we wanted and again you can see it
graphically here that instead of two
different speeds in your graph you now
have one constant speed and this is very
useful when you have a huge motion graph
with a bunch of keyframes then you can
just press this flow triangle press row
across time and this will make your
animation to remain a constant speed so
if you try to anything else before I
just wanted to show you guys that it's a
lot easier way so thank you guys for
watching and I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
