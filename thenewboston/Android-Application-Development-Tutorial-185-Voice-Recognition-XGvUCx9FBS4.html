enjoyed soil for the new Boston and what
we're going to be doing is building
basically voice-recognition activity
we're going to speak in it's going to
you know interpret what we say and put
it into a list of some sort so let's
just get started
I created a class called voice extends
activity and onclicklistener
set up our art on create method to the
set content view of an XML file that
we're going to create called voice let's
set that voice XML file up real quickly
it's just going to be a button that
they're going to press to speak and
we're also going to put a ListView
within there so we're going to go to
composite and then ListView throw that
in there you know make it fill whoa
that's crazy
format and height we're going to change
the fill parent for a list and for a
button we're going to call it button
voice and for our ListView
say lb voice return so again nothing new
for the most part again when we started
if guys remember we did a ListView and
you guys were probably pretty confused
at that time but hopefully this time
when we go through this list view will
be a little bit easier a little bit
simpler as well so what we're going to
do is we're going to set up a list view
that our whole class can use so we're
just going to say ListView LV add our
imports and there we go
we're also going to set up our ListView
to you know have that reference bridge
or whatever find view by add a r dot ID
dot ListView voice and we're going to
set up our button as well so button B
set that equal to
our button within our view there so
button voice set that up at our imports
set our onclicklistener and we're just
going to say this as well now basically
all we're going to do is have this
button open up the voice recognition
intent and then we're going to have a
also a method that's going to you know
return some data to us so we're going to
do is we're going to right click go to
source override implement methods and
we're just going to look for on activity
result it takes in again three ents are
to incent an intent I should say and
we've used this before as well but the
new thing is again the voice recognition
so I'm just going to move this down to
the bottom just cuz I don't know I just
like my unclick listeners or my click
listener to be closer to the create
method I don't know I'm just weird like
that even basically basically within
this on click all we're going to do is
we're going to set up an intent we're
going to call this I or we're going to
set this equal to new intent and again I
told you guys that they have a lot of
default intent so I'm going to try and
go through a few of them maybe but this
one's going to be recognized recognize
your intent
dot action and we're going to recognize
speech so that's basically if you guys
want to read through I'm just going to
kind of go quickly through this but you
know obviously recognizes recognizes
speech hopefully that's what it does
otherwise it's kind of a weird name for
that and then what we're going to do is
we're also going to kind of determine
what language has been spoke which
language is being spoken so we're just
going to say I dot put extra and then
we're going to refer to again the key
and the value
and the key reference is going to be
again the recognizer intent dot extra
and we're going to say language we're
going to say language model for our key
reference and for value what we want it
to do again refer
the recognizer intent and we're going to
have it refer to the language model
freeform so that's basically going to be
the value again it's just kind of
fine-tuning everything getting you know
the specific language fine-tuning it
that way as well and this basically this
extra that we're adding to our intent is
required when we use this action
recognized speech so just keep that in
mind if you guys are doing recognition
then we can also put in like an extra
prompt or something that we want to tell
the user of our application so we're
just going to say extra and then
recognition class again a recognizer
intent and we're going to say dot dot
extra underscore prompt and then we can
just say speak up son something like
that so that's just extra prompt and
then all we're going to do is we're just
going to say you know we got to start
that activity for the result that should
be nothing new and we're going to pass
in our intent and also basically
something else that we're going to have
to check for and we're probably going to
get into that in the next tutorial
so as for now I'm just going to leave it
as that and you guys should check out
the next tutorial we're probably going
to finish this this little activity here
so have a good one guys see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
