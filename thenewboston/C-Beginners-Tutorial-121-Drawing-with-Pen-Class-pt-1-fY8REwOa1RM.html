twenty first c-sharp tutorial that I'm
making for the new Boston and in this
tutorial I'm going to be showing you how
do you keep any class to draw instead of
the brush class so for this tutorial you
just need to have a panel that we're
going to be drawing on that panel and
just create an event handler for when a
user clicks on that panel so the first
thing that we're going to do is create a
new pending class and like I said before
the pen class will just replace our
brush class so we're going to create
1010 City you could do a new pen and we
just have to pass through here a color
that we want on our pen that you're off
I'm going to have it draw register a
color not regret all right and just like
before we're going to create new
graphics so that we have something to
drawn up 12 G's and set it equal to no.1
dot create graphics so that we can draw
on our panel all right so or when we
were using the brush class we would use
bill a bill ellipse filled pie bill
polygons etc well when we're using the
pen tool or the pen class we're going to
be using draw so let me say like draw a
line draw polygon stuff like that but
the first thing we're going to do is
draw a rectangle so we're gonna say draw
a rectangle we're just going to pass
through the pen that we created so pen
and then we're just going to put the
positions that we want it to draw it on
so I'm just going to say 2020
I'll make the width 50 by 50 all right
so now I'm going to bug here and click
should disappear should draw a rectangle
well I guess will be a square since we
made the size of the same yeah so and
the difference here between the pen and
brush is obviously with a pen it doesn't
fill it in it just draws the outline of
the square and let's say we wanted to
change how thick this pen tool is well
all we can do here is pass some
different parameter which will be
the pen tool so I'll just make it be
three pixels wide so now I'm going to be
bug and click we should see that the
outline or our rectangle should be a lot
yeah now it's much thicker ku pixels all
right so instead of using like Bill lips
or something we can just do draw a lips
and so we're just going to do draw a
lips first on a pen through here it's
just the exact same thing stop using the
fill lips so let's do 20 2015 all right
so now I need to bug click we should be
take the outline for our ellipse or it
should be a so far yep perfect and we
can do the same thing with like polygons
and the rectangles well I'll just draw a
polygon so Rin you that our pen tool
right here your pen and then if you need
an array of points so let's create two
new points up here I'll just have it
draw rect enter I'm in a triangle so
we're creating a point at 0 20 another
point at 0 0 0 and another point at 1 2
0
so should end up with just a right
triangle in the corner of our panel so
now it's professor coming through here
yeah it's just the exact same thing as
fill polygon yeah perfect
all right so that's pretty much it for
this tutorial you can obviously do the
same thing with draw a pie it's not
going to do it again we learned that in
previous tutorial so that's pretty much
it for this tutorial so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
