to another tutorial series in this video
series I'm going to be showing you guys
how to use the Windows command line all
the cool things that you can do with it
all the different tools and tips and
it's going to be awesome so well let's
just go ahead and get started
so first things first how the heck do
you open the command line well what you
can do is you can go to this Start menu
down here
and you can just type CMD in hit enter
in boom
roasted look at that or if you don't
feel like moving your mouse what you can
do is you can actually just hit the
Windows key on your keyboard just like
that
you can type CMD hit enter and look at
that you never even had to touch your
mouse so anyways check this out this is
the Windows command line help you how
beautiful looking is this so before you
get started learning how to use it how
to move around and all the cool things
that we can do let's talk about why we
would ever want to use this I mean we
already have this awesome graphical
interface I mean that's kind of the
point of Windows so we don't have to use
this command line so why would we even
bother with it well actually in a lot of
cases depending on what you're trying to
do the command line is actually faster
than using the GUI and whenever I say
GUI I mean graphical user interface
pretty much are all of these cool icons
and you know pictures dragging with the
mouse so this is called a graphical user
interface what you usually use and it's
pretty much the opposite of this old you
know outdated looking command line but
like I said in a lot of cases it's
faster than using the GUI and also there
are certain tools and software that are
only available to the command line so
for example I'm going to be showing you
guys a program called teach arc later on
and you can only run it from the command
line you can't use it you know in a GUI
type of way so that's pretty cool and a
lot of like security and networking
tools are also only available from the
command line and yeah in another cool
thing the last thing I want to say is
later on I'm going to show you guys how
to build your own programs and scripts
for the command line so enough for me
rambling let's go
get started so the first thing you're
going to notice is whenever you pop this
open you have a little indicator and
this is called the current working
directory it's basically where you are
on your computer so let me open up just
this old Windows Explorer and I'll show
you guys the equivalent of it so right
now it says I'm in see users Bucky so my
main hard drive in a directory called
users and the user I am is Bucky so this
is where I'm at right now now if you're
just using this Windows Explorer in
order to move around to a new directory
you just find one and double click it
like this say I wanted to move in my
desktop double click that easy stuff now
if I ever want to go back I'll just
click this back button or I can click up
here however in our command line we
don't have that luxury we don't have
anything to click except this big black
background so how would we move into the
desktop well any time you want to change
your directories you type the keyword CD
that means change directory so from here
remember we can just go desktop and hit
enter and that means I want to change or
go into my desktop and look at that so
now we are basically in the desktop so
now we can run whatever tools and you
know make files from here make
directories whatever we want to do now
you're thinking ah right
well how do we get back because in
Windows Explorer you can either click
this right here or has a big old back
button with the command line we don't
have that back button so any time you
want to go back or up a directory what
you do is you're a CD and instead of
back or anything like that you write dot
dot this means take me to the parent
directory so if you see my path is see
users Bucky desktop so it's pretty much
going to bump us back into Bucky right
there pretty cool now you know how I
said that anytime you want to change a
directory you pretty much write CD and
then the name where you want to move in
- well you're not only limited to move
one step at a time you can actually move
multiple steps so you see like in this
Windows Explorer if you want to get to a
file or folder inside my desktop you
click desktop and then I don't know
maybe you want to go into videos two
clicks so from here we can actually do
is this type desktop and then backslash
and then videos so hit enter and boom
look lad so we already see that whenever
you use this it only takes one step
typing in one path rather than two
clicks so that's pretty cool and now if
you guys are like alright well what if I
want to go back two steps so I want to
go back in the desktop and then back
into Buckey what what you do is CD dot
this is going to take you up one however
if you do forward slash dot again this
means take me back to directories so
look at that so that's the basics of how
to navigate around and I'll show you
guys something else that's pretty cool
so if we are just in Bucky right now you
see that we have um let's say that we
want to go to downloads so what we can
do is we can actually type CD and then
we can start typing the word downloads
but see I'm lazy and I don't feel like
typing in the entire word because it's
going to take half a second and I got
stuff to do so instead what you can do
is you can actually hit tab on your
keyboard now what hitting tab does is it
pretty much tries to autocomplete it so
since I take D it said okay you want to
change to a directory but I have two of
them that start with D desktop in
downloads so I'm going to hit tab and
it's going to fill in whatever it thinks
I'm at first it just looks at
alphabetical order the first directory
that starts with D now if it doesn't get
the right one then I can hit tab again
and boom look at that so pretty much use
tab whenever you want to autocomplete
and if there's only one
gah let me do this see the desktop with
OCD videos so I only have one directory
that starts with v on my desktop so it's
just going to give me videos by default
but again use tab to autocomplete and
save you some time and it doesn't only
save you time but it also helps with
typos since you know you might actually
accidentally spell videos like that I
mean you probably wouldn't but it's
pretty much saves you time and helps
with typos so there you go so that is
your real quick introduction to the
Windows command line I'm sure you guys
are thrilled already you know if you're
like alright so I can move directories
wow this thing is useless well wait to
like 5 tutorials from now you guys are
going to see just how awesome it is so
thank guys for watching and I will see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
