third tutorial of Photoshop last time we
went over all of the basic tools but
what I didn't tell you and we're going
to be going over this time is this a
little toolbar up here anytime you
select the tool from the left-hand side
of the toolbar provides you a sub
toolbar right here and these give you
any of the details of the tools you are
using so example I selected the brush
tool it gives me all the different size
of brushes and how hard it is and also
the opacity and the flow of it
album also gives me all the different
types of modes and for all of these
tools there's a little menu bar right up
here to display the different details of
that tool and once you get the detailed
just how you like it you can use this
button right here this low triangle if
you click triangle down then then
triangle to there right and select a new
preset and you can save your tool call
it anything you want and then click OK
and it will save it for next time just
how you like it so you don't have to
remember exactly what options you chose
and now let's move on to the main menu
bar the main menu bar is the menu bar at
the top of Photoshop it includes file
edit image and all the good stuff and
file under this you have all your basic
options you can open a new image open
one that you already saved close save as
and it has your prints as well and this
other stuff we'll get into later the
Edit has all the stuff that you want to
edit your image and this has things like
undo step backward which is a lot more
useful than undo or you can also use alt
control Z it's a lot faster way of doing
undo it has your cuts your copy your
pace and also has these right here
transform which gives you all these
options that you can transform your
image or free transform right here if
you click that as you can see our entire
image is outlined and we can stretch it
and shrink it we can even rotate it
move it and lock it in place pressing
enter so that's what the free transform
tool does and all of these other edit
options you can play around with if you
like but the next one is image and this
is a very important one to change your
mode of your image to either grayscale
or if you wanted to use a different
color it's right under here the
adjustments you can make your image such
as lighting and color details you can
add contrast brightness or add
saturation and you can also adjust the
image size which is the image itself or
the canvas size to give you more room to
work with another reason you can do is
rotate the canvas any way you want or
you can also trim your image if you have
any left over space and you want to crop
it down now the rest of these will go
over later because they won't do much
good me explaining them now because
they're used for things that we didn't
quite cover it so let's move on to
getting all of the interface a little
bit more to the right side you can see
that we have these things and all of
these things are called palettes and as
you toggle between you can see that the
info palette histogram and navigator are
the three basic palettes by default that
they give us you also have these sub
palettes right here this one right here
gives you all the presets if you saved
any
right here the brushes let you specify
what kind of brush you would like to use
when you're using when you're painting
and all of these right here the three at
the bottom are for aligning paragraphs
now these palettes right here the color
the swatches and the styles are also for
defining colors so say you want to type
paint with green or real quick you're
just select green and you can now have
green to paint with and the color is
just for finicky finishing your color a
little bit so say if you wanted to make
green a little darker you just put the
slider over and now you can do it that
way and the layers channels and paths
palette we'll be talking about more
later on and you can also anytime you
want to move these around move them
around or you can even bring them right
out and anytime you want to get back to
what you're doing just click window
arrange I mean workspace default
workspace and this will reset everything
and anytime you want to see a palette
that you don't see
just click window and this is your list
of palates all along here the check ones
are the one that we have opened right
now by default you can also opens up
other ones too so let's say you wanted
to open the actions palette just click
that you now have your actions palettes
open so now that we got to know the
interface in the next section we'll
actually start learning some stuff that
we can actually do with Photoshop and
get in the real fun stuff and if you're
not already there you can go to www.hsn
