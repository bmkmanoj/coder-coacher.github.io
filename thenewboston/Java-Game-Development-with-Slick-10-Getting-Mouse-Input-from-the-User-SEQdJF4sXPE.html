and in this video what I'm going to do
is I'm going to show you guys how to
receive input from the user
because right now check out our game
it's not really a game it's just a bunch
of images some text on the screen in
order to create a computer game the user
needs to be able to interact with it in
some kind of way so right now if we just
show them a bunch of images that would
be more like a presentation or a
PowerPoint so what I'm going to be doing
is I'm going to be building a program
that tracks the location of the mouse
and instead of saying are you ready to
blast some ham it's just going to
display the mouse coordinates not a very
fun game but later on we can actually
use this technique to do cool things
like find out where the user is clicking
and maybe blast an enemy there or move
the character there or maybe move the
camera do a whole bunch of stuff but for
now we just start with the basics and
the very first thing we have to do
before we get to the good stuff is we
need to import something for the mouse
so import oh our G dot L WJ g l dot
input dot mouse alright looks pretty
good so now what this does is it well
pretty much imports the functionality
that we use to track the location of the
mouse so what I want to do is how should
I display this okay so you know where it
says are you ready to blast some ham
well I don't want any of that anymore
I want a variable so the reason that I
want a variable because if we have
static text there then it's never going
to change we need a variable because
this text is going to change depending
on where we're moving the mouse so let's
go ahead and create a variable above all
of our functions so public string and
we'll just go ahead and name this mouse
now what we can do is we can actually
give a default text so as soon as you
start the game if you don't have the
mouse on the window we'll just have a
say no input yet because the mouse isn't
currently over the window yet
so again the text is going to be stored
in the variable called a mouse so go
ahead and copy that now whenever we draw
that text instead of having static text
like this what we can do is actually
throw a variable into here and again
currently right now if we go ahead and
run this program it's going to say no
input yet because that's what we set the
variable equal to now no matter where we
move our mouse it's always going to say
no input yet because we didn't add any
functionality to change that but we are
going to do that right now so like I
said the render method is just for
drawing things on the screen but the
update method is for when things change
so what things are going to change well
the only thing that's going to change
that we're concerned with is the
coordinates of the mouse so how do we
get the coordinates of the mouse well
I'll show you guys the first thing you
need to do is you need to create a
variable to store the X&amp;amp;Y location the
well Java already knows where your mouse
is on the screen and it's built into the
system and what we need to do is pretty
much retrieve it from java and store in
variables so we'll put x position equal
to mouse get X and what this is going to
do is of course it the x position which
is left and right or horizontal position
of your mouse and store in a variable
called x position now since our game is
how BIG's our game I forgot ok 640
pixels wide this is going to be anywhere
in the range of 0 to 640 so now we do
this exact same thing with y so the
variable called Y POS is going to store
the Y location or the vertical location
of the mouse which is going to be
anywhere from 0 to 360 now if we go
ahead and run our game you can see that
nothing happens why is that because even
though we stored those values in
variables we didn't do anything with it
what we want to do is update this
texts whenever we move the mouse so how
do we do that well we do that by
changing the variable because remember
it's the variable that gets drawn on the
screen so how do we update a variable oh
come on guys you should know this just
set the mouse equal to and again this is
why it's so important to make it public
and outside every other arm method
because once it's outside every method
then every other method can access it so
mouse equals and I'll just go ahead and
make cool little prompt like um mouse
position look and put X and add a space
plus what is my variable X POS plus y Y
POS piece of I'm just going to do the
same for that and well I think that's
pretty much it I think we're good to go
so hopefully if everything went as
planned what should happen is this by
default it's going to say no input yet
and it's going to draw on the screen we
already know that that works because we
tested it however in the update what
it's going to do is is going to track
the x location in y location of my
pointer my cursor and then it's going to
update this variable so it no longer
says no input yet it now says okay Mouse
position X is on I don't know something
like 100 and Y position is it 200 so let
me go ahead cross my fingers and check
it out okay now it says Mouse position 0
0 and it's because I moved it and check
it out and I want to point out one other
thing now I can move my mouse all around
and as you can see the X and the y
positions change if I you know I
probably can't do it steady enough but
if I move left and right only the X
changes and if I move up and down only
the Y changes and if you notice if you
paid really close attention you're going
to notice a few things
first of all I told you guys whenever
you're positioning graphics that this
was zero zero right so why does it say
zero 357
well that's because in these gaming
libraries they're coordinate system for
tracking the mouse starts at the bottom
left so let me hold my cursor on the
bottom left that's why it says zero zero
at the bottom left right there if I can
get it positioned properly so just
remember that for these gaming libraries
or the examples that are demonstrated so
far for tracking the mouse it starts the
coordinate system in the bottom left
however the graphics with our graphics
object that's built into Java in order
to position graphics it starts in the
top right so anyways that's how we get
input from the mouse and in the next
tutorial what I'm going to be doing is
well maybe not the next Sora but in the
upcoming Soros I'm going to be showing
you guys how to utilize this tracking
information to do things like move
images around move characters around
blow up crap it's going to be awesome
but for now thanks for watching and
we're going to subscribe and I'll see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
