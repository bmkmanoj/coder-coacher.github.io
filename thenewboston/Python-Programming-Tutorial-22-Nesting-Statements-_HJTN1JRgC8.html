tutorial and in this story I'm going to
show you guys how to nest if statements
so uh the first thing we're going to
need is some variables and to build a
basic if statement so let's go ahead and
make thing equal animal and uh let's go
ahead and make a animal equals cat
they're good now once we get to
variables that are really matter what we
can go ahead and make our if statements
so let's go ahead and put if thing is
remember when you're making an if
statements use two equal sign I mean
test conditions if thing equals animal :
um and then we're going to have a block
code right there
and let's just make a else statement or
put else print let's think of something
print real quick I don't know what this
thing is so we're going to have a thing
equals animal do a certain block of code
else do print out I don't know if this
thing is now inside this if statement we
could have a certain block of code like
a print statement or something like that
or we can have a whole nother if
statement and that's what I'm going to
teach you guys how to do today so inside
this if statement in the first line of
code you put if and have another test
condition right there so if thing equals
animal which it does and if animal is
equal to cat which is we want you to
print out this is probably needed prints
they marry their prints this is a cat or
there we go not a car a cat there and
now we can have an else statement in
here also else um print like I don't
know what this animal I don't know what
this animal
so let's go ahead and run this right now
and make sure I didn't mess up anything
press f5 save it it says this is a cab
and where's my code right there so what
it did is thingy equals animal and
animal equals cat the first thing it did
is test this if right here if this
wasn't an animal it would go right down
here so let's just change that thing
equals
house let me show you guys what would
happen I don't know what this thing is
if this even though that this is a cat
this code never gets ran if this main
outside if condition is false so again
that is the basics of how you can put
one decision which is this in a bigger
decision which is this
so do you reiterate one more time you
have one main test condition right here
the first thing it checks for if it's an
animal if and only if it is an animal is
it going to chest or excuse me test if
it's cat or not if it's not an animal
this code right here that's highlighted
this never gets ran so and then the
default would just go straight to here
so again that is how you embed an if
statement in a larger if statement and
again our not again I didn't tell you
this yet but you can even put an if
statement in here and in another one and
another one and you can put as many if
statements and if statements is you want
but any more than this kind of gets
confusing even though we're probably
going to have to do it some time there
in these tutorials but for now we're
going to just stick with a decision and
if that decision is true then you give
another decision to make
so that's your basics of if statement in
the if statement so thank you guys for
watching in next tutorial I'm probably
going to be talking about something else
about conditions
I guarantee it's going to be terribly
exciting so stick around make sure to
subscribe thank you for watching and
I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
