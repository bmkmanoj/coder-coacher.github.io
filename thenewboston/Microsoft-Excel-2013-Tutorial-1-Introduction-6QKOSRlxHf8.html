found it the greatest tutorial series on
Microsoft Excel ever created now before
I start teaching guys about Microsoft
Excel I just want to warn you this
tutorial series is going to be
incredibly addicting not only am I going
to teach you guys everything you
possibly wanted to know about Microsoft
Excel but it's going to be entertaining
as well so I'm just saying that because
when you stop hanging out with your
friends and you become distant from your
family because the only thing you ever
want to do is learn more excel from
these videos well don't say that I
didn't warn you so that's my little
warning so you know just heads up
that's how addicting excel can be now my
guess is that if you have this program
on your computer and you're trying to
learn it right now then you probably
already know what it is but for those of
you who may just be learning it because
your boss told you to or maybe you have
to learn it for school or something and
you are immature exactly what Excel is
let me go ahead and give you a quick
little explanation Excel is a
spreadsheet program one of the most
popular ones in the world and that
allows you to work with data in really
cool ways so what can you do with it
well on the home screen right here you
kind of see a glimpse of all the
different things you can do with it you
can make invoices you can make budgets
schedules it's actually really cool for
making schedules also it allows you to
make calculations really easy graphs
charts and all this stuff is not only
really easy but it's also really
powerful gives you a lot of control over
exactly what you want to do so if you
never use a spreadsheet program before
then get prepared to work with data in a
way that is just going to blow your mind
so let's go ahead and get started using
this program now like any project I
guess that's a kind of overall word for
it it has its own unique name in Excel
and Excel projects are called workbooks
so that's why this first option right
here is just called a blank workbook
think very
right now like a blank project now to
open it we can either click on it but
part of this tutorial series is giving
you guys some cool tips so you know if
you don't have the energy to move your
mouse all the way over there and click
on it and also this is what I like to do
from this home screen right here just
hit escape on your keyboard and whenever
you do that it opens up a new blank
project also called a workbook now think
of a workbook like a regular book this
is made up of different sheets now by
default we only have one sheet right
here that we can add a bunch of data to
and I'll explain that later if you ever
want another one then you can just click
this little plus button right here and
this will add more sheets and they kind
of look like tabs right now that you can
click between so each of these kind of
resembles like a new piece of paper that
you can add data to now if you ever want
to go back to that home screen just
click this file tab right here in order
to bring you back so again new this is
where you start out either click blank
workbook or just hit escape and that's
going to take you to where we want to be
so now that we got kind of the main
interface let me go ahead and explain
kind of the basic overview of this
program now what I'm not going to do is
in the first couple videos I'm not going
to go through and explain every single
little button and widget because first
of all it'll be incredibly boring and
second of all is going to overwhelm you
before you even understand how to use
the program so what I'm deciding to do
is we're going to cover all of the stuff
as we need it but for now just so you
guys feel a little bit more comfortable
let me give you like the five-second
overview of the interface now one of the
main things that's different from Excel
rather than probably most of the
software you've been working with and
past is that instead of a main menu bar
at the top this piece of software right
here it has these tabs so it doesn't
have like a generic menu bar like most
pieces of software these tabs
right here are pretty much a way to
access every single tool that you're
going to use
now instead of drop-down menus of course
since we don't have the main menu bar we
have this thing right here you see it
has a bunch of different icons and I
don't know probably a bunch of stuff we
don't really understand right now this
area right here with all the icons it's
called the ribbon so whenever I say go
to the ribbon ribb o n this area is what
I'm talking about
so let's go ahead and talk about this
main area right here so this is of
course a worksheet and it's we're going
to be spending most of our time so a
blank worksheet right now of course
we're going to be filling those stuff
with it's blank right now it's composed
of rows 1 2 3 4 all the way down to
pretty much infinity it actually has a
limit but um none of the projects we're
going to work on will even bother with
the limit so it's made up of rows and
columns so in a nice orderly grid
fashion now where they intersect these
boxes right here they're actually called
cells and I'm going to be talking about
cells a lot so remember whenever I say
that I'm talking about one of these
little boxes now each of these cells
they actually have an address and the
address is the column and the row so
this first one is a 1 this one right
here is d6 column D row 6 and the cool
thing is if you ever click on one of
these and you don't feel like on okay K
+ 8 9 you can just look right here and
it will say the address of whatever so
you have currently selected and also
another thing I probably should mention
is whenever I say currently selected
cell the proper terminology for it is
actually the active cell so say right
now C 3 is the active cell
d9 is the active cell and I say this
because we can actually select multiple
cells at once
so there is a difference between what
sells you have selected and one active
sell and I'll be talking about the
different ways you can select later on
but I just want to you know throw that
out you at you at first so in this very
first tutorial series I'm going to be
talking about a lot of things and don't
feel overwhelmed because this is just
kind of an overview I don't expect you
to retain everything just kind of sit
back kick up your feet follow along and
if you don't you know soak everything in
your brain don't worry about it we're
going to be talking about everything in
detail later on now
of course any time you want to select a
different cell just like you saw I'm
clicking it with the mouse right now but
for the people who love the use of
keyboard you can also use the arrows on
your keyboard as well so you see that my
mouse is right here if you ever click
left right down up on your keyboard you
can move around your spreadsheet or your
worksheet with the keyboard as well
simple enough all right so we know what
this program does and we also know that
this entire thing is called a workbook
made up of these worksheets okay pretty
stinkin boring let's go ahead and jump
in to actually start putting some data
in there all right I heard you guys
let's go ahead and do that so what data
can we put in there um let me just think
of something off the top of my head and
by the way another warning these
examples that pop that pop into my brain
they're going to be kind of weird
because I don't I'm not going to plan
like a bunch of this stuff I don't have
like a script I'm reading from so these
are probably going to be some pretty odd
examples so this first one which just
popped into my head like two seconds ago
say that last week um I was training for
a hot dog eating contest so the hot dog
eating contest was on Saturday so on
Monday through Friday I trained I a is
many hot dogs each day as I possibly
could so let's go ahead and make us
really simple worksheet to kind of
resemble that data so go ahead and hover
your mouse over the a1 cell and just
click it so that right there is the
active cell
so right here um once it's active so you
can start typing stuff in I'm going to
type day now hit enter and that sets the
Texas day to this cell all right so
let's go ahead and fill in we'll put the
days of the week right here and we'll
put how many hot dogs eight right here
so the first day of course I want to
track is Monday so again select a to
type Monday in hit enter now we have a
couple options right here I could type
Tuesday Wednesday Thursday by I am
incredibly lazy as you will come to find
out so I wish there was an easier way to
fill in the rest of the days a week well
here's another tip that is going to come
in handy a lot if you select this Monday
cell right here you're going to notice
that there is a box in the lower right
corner this is the autofill box and what
it does is whenever you hover over it
you see how your cursor kind of looks
like a fat plus sign right now as you
hover over this fill handle it's going
to become a smaller thinner black plus
sign this means that you are going to
select this data with a fill handle and
start dragging it down
it says Tuesday Wednesday Thursday and
Friday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
