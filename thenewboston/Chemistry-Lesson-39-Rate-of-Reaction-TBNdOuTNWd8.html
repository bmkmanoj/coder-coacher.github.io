chemistry tutorial and in this video I
want to talk to you guys about rate of
reaction now rate of reaction is
important to understand because first of
all it's important to understand why
some chemical reactions happen fast and
some other chemical reactions have been
relatively slowly and it's important to
understand that because say that you
want to start cooking meth in your
bathroom well if you have a bunch of
meth users or meth heads outside your
house being like dude we want our meth
hurry up and you know make it already
you want to be able to speed up the
chemical reactions so you need to
understand the factors that contribute
to the rate of reaction so in this
tutorial I'm gonna be basically teaching
you guys how to make meth faster well
not a you know exactly meth but any
chemical reaction the different factors
to contribute to how fast or slow that
reaction occurs so the first thing I
wanted to do is I want to talk about the
first factor oh sorry I got freakin
Fleming my throat it's gonna be annoying
all Tesoro but you know I guess you guys
got deal with it and the first factor is
basically the size of a size -
complexity and I don't mean complexity
of the entire reaction I mean the
complexity of the molecules themselves
so say that for example we have well
just remember this whenever a chemical
reaction occurs there must be a
collision at the reactive site of the
molecule now obviously for a large and
complex molecule there is a less chance
just due to the nature of the molecule
that it's very big in complex so what am
I talking about well say that you have a
molecule like X and it's bonded to a
well a bonds with B just like that so if
you have these two molecules right here
X a and B obviously B has a good chance
of bonding or colliding with a alright
makes sense now say we have another
molecule um let's do this X X
put a couple more why-why-why X in these
of course you know would be some kind of
element X and then we have our a right
down here again there's our a in the
bottom right so this obviously is a very
large and complex molecule and then we
have our other chemical or element B
floating around well check this out B
doesn't have a very good chance of
coming into contact with the reaction
site because this molecule right here is
a very large or complex molecule as
opposed to this molecule and basically
if it hits it has a 50/50 chance of
reacting but with this one right here
since the molecule is so big and so
complex then B is gonna have a very hard
time hitting the reactive site which is
a which is pretty much a sweet spot on
the molecule that needs hit in order for
a chemical reaction to occur so
basically the larger or more complex the
molecule the less chance of collision
now another thing that I want to talk
about is particle size or it may be
better if I put surface area that may be
a little more clear to understand and
the best way to you know kind of talk
about this is to give you an example if
you go ahead and you took a large chunk
of coal will say that this is coal and
you pretty much took a match let me find
a good color for a match so here's a
match right here and let me get my
little yellow flame wow that's the worst
yellow ever I'm gonna fix that alright
so here's a match a beautiful-looking
match and if we held it up to a chunk of
coal and we you know obviously we had
the match lit nothing is gonna happen
why is this because you're only hitting
a very small part or very few amount of
particles a very low surface area now if
we took that same piece of coal right
here and we grinded it up so it was
basically no longer one big chunk but a
lot of fine you know powder and
basically toss that in the hair and then
we took our match which is evidently
black now and we lit on fire then do you
know what would happen well in that
instance you would actually get an
explosion so the same molecule right
here the same chemical that we can say
it just is in a different form this is
one solid chunk and this is finely
ground powder so why does this chemical
reaction basically not occur at all at
all or happen really slowly while this
one right here happens almost
instantaneously well the reason is
because particle size or more you know
maybe it's easier to say surface area
when there's more surface area basically
there's more space or more particles
that the chemicals can react with so
that's basically why not only the nature
or size or complexity of the molecules
is important whenever we're talking
about rate of reaction but also as we
demonstrated in this example the surface
area or how many particles the chemicals
have to react with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
