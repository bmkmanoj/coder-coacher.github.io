roberts and welcome to your very first
tutorial in django now if you guys were
wondering what the f django is it's not
the movie i mean it is a movie but in
this tutorial series i am going to be
teaching you guys about the Python web
framework django and if you guys don't
even know what that is it's basically a
way that you can create websites using
Python now whenever I say create
websites I'm not talking about the front
end in other words I'm not talking about
the colors of the buttons and you know
making all the font look cool and stuff
like that I'm talking about the backend
of web development in other words
working with the servers and databases
and all the fun stuff so that's what
we're going to be doing and we're going
to be learning do that with Python so
just a bit like PHP if you guys are
still kind of fuzzy on it but cooler so
sounds pretty cool how the heck do we
actually download this set it up and
install it on our computer well what we
need to do is pop open a command line so
if you're using Linux or Mac just open
up your terminal if you're using windows
then go ahead and type in PowerShell now
if you right-click this and hit run is
administrator then follow along with me
now if you are watching this tutorial in
your on Linux or Mac then everything I
do in this on Windows is going to be the
exact same however the one difference
that you need to do is before every
command I type type the word sudo that's
going to give you super user privileges
and the reason that I'm not doing it on
Windows is because Windows doesn't have
a sudo that's what administrator is on
Windows so again that's why you need to
open it is administrator so you have
full privileges on Windows but again on
Mac and Linux just type sudo before
everything so again since we're using
Python to develop websites the first
thing that we need is Python now by the
way you guys need to know Python before
watching this video series I'm guessing
you do already like if you know just go
ahead and watch my Python series now
just to verify that you have it
installed correctly
just go ahead and type Python - -
version so I am using Python 3.4 however
if you use any version 3.5 or later
you're going to be a little able to
follow along with this tutorial series
just fine
so the next thing we need to do is we
need to make sure that we have easy
install or pip setup now these are
actually tools that we got whenever we
just downloaded Python however the
reason that we need these is because
what easy install and pip are are tools
that allow you to download things online
so the thing that we're going to be
downloading is Django and that's the
tools that we use so if you want to
verify that you have those tools then
again just very easy underscore install
or pip and right - - version so it says
all right you have version 12.04
then I'm guessing that you do have this
tool but it's just not configured
correctly so I'm going to show you guys
how to fix that so go ahead and open up
Windows Explorer and go to your hard
drive right here and by the way if you
just see this a version number then just
skip ahead like two minutes and just
nevermind what I'm saying but for those
of you who don't from your root hard
drive
go ahead and click python 3 4 or
whatever version of it and go ahead and
click scripts so this is the tool right
here easy install it's just that your
computer it doesn't know where it is so
that's why it's like um I don't
recognize this command so in order to
tell your computer hey whenever I type
in easy install look here just go ahead
and right click this and click
properties and then go ahead and copy
this path so go ahead and right click
and copy so that's the path that we need
to tell our computer look but where do
we set that once you have that copied go
ahead and open up this menu again right
click computer and hit properties now if
you go to advanced system settings in
environment variables
then what you can do is you can look for
a variable called path now if you don't
have this variable then you can just go
ahead and make it but I'm guessing that
most of you do so go ahead and select it
and hit edit now by the way if you guys
are wondering what the heck we're doing
this is where you tell windows to look
when we type in something into the
command line right here so it already
has python set up so this is how it
knows to look in this directory for
python however if you didn't have this
little line of code then just go ahead
and add a semicolon at the end and paste
in that path so again click OK okay okay
close out of there close out of
everything now another thing that you're
going to need to do is you're actually
going to need to restart this and that
just you know allows um PowerShell to
get all the new paths that you just
updated but again once you restart it
and do this again then it's going to
know exactly where to look now again if
you were looking in your computer and
you're looking here here and you didn't
even have easy install in there then
what you can do is this you can go ahead
and go to this address right here and
that's bootstrap py Pai oh I'm not even
going to read it because it's right
there so this is a script that you can
use to manually install easy installer
so how do you actually run this well
just go ahead and right-click it and hit
save as and then just save it as a file
on your desktop and then once in you can
actually save it anywhere you want but
once you have it saved somewhere on your
computer and you downloaded it then what
you can do is you can just CD in other
words change to your desktop by clicking
CD the squiggly brace on the top left
every keyboard the tilde or whatever
it's called and then just start typing
desktop hit tab and hit enter so that's
going to move you to your desktop and
now what you can do is this if you just
write Python then whatever file you
right after this is essentially the file
that
Python is going to run so it's going to
be called easy underscore set up dot py
or if you saved it as a different file
then just go ahead and then type that
file name but once you hit enter then
it's going to run it manually
so again just clear out of here
so now everyone should have Python and
easy install installed properly so the
last thing that we need to do is we
actually need to install Django so from
here all we do is rewrite easy install
since that should be set up properly
Django so whenever you hit enter this is
going to install the latest version of
Django now if you're watching these
tutorials in the future and maybe like
Django 1.10 came out or something like
that
and you want to make sure that you're
working with the version that I am
working with like 1.9 then what you can
do is you can just specify a specific
version so anytime you want to do that
just write equals equals and then the
version number which is 1.9 so again if
you just want the latest version just
very easy install Django if you want 1.9
1.9 if you want an older one like 1.8
then go ahead and do that but again I
already have it installed so I'm not
going to run it however after you have
it installed and after you're in that
then what you can do is you can just
verify that you have it installed
correctly vibrating this Django - admin
- - version and once you see this 1.9
point 1 or any version number after this
then you're going to be able to follow
along with the rest of this tutorial
series just fine so again make sure that
you have Django installed correctly if
you have any questions then just go
ahead and leave a comment below I'm sure
that you know a bunch of people are
willing to help you out if not then you
can ask in my forum and there's a link
below this video to get there so yeah
there you go in the next video we're
going to be learning how to set up a
jingo project</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
