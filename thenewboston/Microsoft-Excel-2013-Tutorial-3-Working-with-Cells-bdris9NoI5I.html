video and in this tutorial what I'm
going to be doing is I want to talk to
you guys about editing and a little more
in detail about formatting the
individual cells in a worksheet but
before I begin I want to mention one
thing in a lot of these upcoming videos
what I'm going to be doing is I'm going
to be working with a bunch of data that
I either downloaded from the internet or
maybe I just made it up off the top of
my head just a bunch of sample data and
instead of taking like five minutes and
typing it all in which would be an
incredible waste of time what I'm going
to do is I'm going to take all of these
files and post them on my website so you
guys can just download them for free so
if you go to this link right here or if
you go to my forum in the Microsoft
category it's a thread called example
files again there's only one link in
here right now but eventually once I
start making more videos and start
making a you know more projects there's
going to be all of my example files that
I'm working with so for right now just
click on this one it's called
fantasy hockey game and that's what this
is right here so open it up and this is
what you'll see
so again none of those are gonna cost
anything they're all going to be free
don't worry about it it just saves you a
bunch of time from typing everything out
actually I got to tell you guys a story
real quick when I was in college um this
was a few years ago I took a class in
Excel in for like half an hour at the
beginning of each lesson my teacher put
it was like a slide of this up on the
big board and he made us type it all out
I don't like dude you're a computer
teacher just like send us the files and
also if we missed anything like if we
spout anyone's name wrong then he would
take points off I'm like this class
sucks and that's why I eventually know
well eventually dropped out of college
not because of that but because of dumb
things like that so you know I just had
to vent a little bit my bed alright so
for this it really doesn't matter what
type of data you have since we're just
going to be like clicking cells learning
how to use them but I'll explain to you
guys what this is real quick
if you know if you're just curious I
play a game online because I'm a big
hockey fan so this game that I play
online that's where this data is from
and what it is is every player starts
out with $50,000 it's just pretend money
really wish I had $50,000 real money but
with a $50,000 you pick whatever players
you think are going to do good that
night and the players that usually do
better
for example this guy's pretty good Zach
Parise he's worth seven thousand eight
hundred dollars the players that usually
don't do that good like John Moore he's
a defense or he's a defenseman he only
scores like one and a half point each
night so he only costs $2,500 so again
that's what the game is it doesn't
really matter this is just example but
if anyone was wondering um that's what
data you're looking at right now so
let's go ahead and start learning well
you know I meant to teach in this
tutorial so the first thing I want to
explain to you guys is this we already
learned last time how to insert data in
cells you pretty much click a cell until
it becomes the active cell and you type
something in there like Bucky and look
at that I just spelled my name wrong so
the first thing that we should learn is
how to get data out of the cells or how
to delete data well it's pretty simple
pretty intuitive all you do is you
select the cell and you hit delete on
your keyboard simple enough now you can
also delete a range of cells at one time
so select a multiple range and hit
delete and of course this deletes the
data in the cell and another thing that
you can do is if you actually um
highlight an entire column like this and
hit delete it deletes all of the data in
that column now if you hit ctrl Z let me
undo that say that you wanted to do this
say that you just didn't want to make
all these cells blank but you actually
just wanted to get rid of this entire
column because I really don't care about
this game and
oh let's say I really don't need it for
whatever program I'm making now if I
just highlight that and hit delete I'm
left with a blank column and it doesn't
look that great so instead what I can do
is right-click this column and hit
delete and it gets rid of it completely
like it never existed so that's the
difference between right-clicking and
delete and the delete button on your
keyboard so another thing that I want to
show you guys had to do is how to edit
um some data in a column so say that
this guy's name was spelled incorrectly
which it isn't this is the correct
spelling but say that his name was Darcy
Cooper so if you ever click this and
just start typing what it's going to do
as soon as you start typing is it's
going to clear everything out and start
it from scratch now sometimes that's not
what we want sometimes we just want to
edit part of this without having to
delete everything look at that as soon
as we start typing so how do we do that
well in order just to edit the contents
of the cell without deleting anything
you can either just double click it and
what what's that going to do is it's
going to put your cursor right in there
so now you can move around and put I
don't know maybe something like that
Darcy Cooper another thing that you can
do is you can just select a cell and hit
f2 now if I do that it accomplishes the
same thing so again double click or
select the cell and hit f2 and the last
way and this is how I always edit is if
you select the cell you can just edit it
right on top here this is called the
formula bar and I don't know why I like
it so much maybe because it gives you a
little more control like you can expand
it and contract it if you want it's just
uh I don't know I'm more comfortable
working with a big area than I am in a
little cell so again three different
ways if you just want to edit that
inside a cell double click it or select
it and press f2 or just select it in
edit
everyone in the formula bar right up
there now another cool tip that actually
even people that have been working with
Excel for a long time
they really don't um I guess I noticed
that they really don't do this too often
whenever you want to add data to
multiple cells at once this is what you
do you select a range of cells just like
this and you can start typing your data
like Bucky now if you hit enter
it only adds data to that very first
cell the active cell that you selected
even though you selected a range of
cells like this so in order to add my
name Bucky to all of these cells at once
this is what I do select these multiple
cells type whatever I want to add and
then if I hold down control on my
keyboard and hit enter check it out it
fills in all of those cells with
whatever I typed in that very for so so
again type your data hold down ctrl and
hit enter and boom you're good to go now
the last thing I want to talk to you
guys about is this this is something
that annoys a lot of people so I figured
that how to show you right now actually
let's go ahead and delete this because
it's annoying me select it all hit
delete whenever you're working in a
spreadsheet program and you want to add
armed text to multiple lines within the
same cell you might think you'd do
something like this so say that I wanted
to type um I don't know what I just like
my name again so Bucky and then within
the same cell with an f1 I wanted to
move to a new line and type I don't know
something about myself
so I would just go ahead and hit enter
crap look at that it actually moved me
down a whole cell and I just wanted to
move to a new line in this cell so I
can't hit enter and that's usually what
I do in most programs so in order to
accomplish that what you want to do is
double click the cell
that you want to add multiple lines to
and whenever your cursor gets to the
point where you actually want to move to
the next line hold down alt and hit
enter on your keyboard now as you can
see instead of just moving your active
cell to the next line it stays in that
same active cell
f1 but now you can type something like
Roberts hit enter and check it out now
f1 is made up of multiple lines pretty
stinking sweet if you ask me so again
that's alt enter and what that does is
allows you to move multiple lines or
typed multiple lines in the same active
cell pretty stinking suite thank you
guys for watching that's all I have for
this tutorial
the next sorrel is actually going to be
really cool so don't forget to check it
out I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
