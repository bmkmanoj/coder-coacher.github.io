tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
to be teaching guys how to input and
output files actually I'm just going to
be teaching you how to create a file but
eventually we will be learning that so
just stick with me the first thing that
we're going to want to do is include
something that's going to allow us to
input an output files and this is called
the F stream so let's go ahead and put
and add another include move this out of
the way and the syntax for this is f
stream now this little bit of code right
here it's going to allow you to stream
text files in and out so just make sure
you have that anytime that you're
working with getting a file or
outputting a file you don't really need
to know the workings behind that but
make sure you got it
the next thing that I'm going to show
you guys to do is how to input or output
and create a file the first thing that
you're going to want to do is go in your
main function and type in Oh f stream
and this is a syntax for creating well
let me just finish this my file with a
semicolon
and what this does is it creates an
object called my file and this object is
going to allow you to output files on
your computer or create files so let's
go ahead and do that right now the first
thing that we're going to want to do is
use your object to my file it says
alright we have this object that's that
allows you to output files so the first
thing that we're going to want to do is
open a file and to do this type the word
my file period open and in your arm
parentheses name the file that you want
to open now I'm going to say new file
because I don't have a file on my
computer yet
and if you open a file that you don't
already have on your computer it's going
to create a file for you so right now we
used our object that we just created in
my file and we are going to open a file
called new file that text we're going to
open a new text file and I don't have
this on my computer yet so C++ is going
to create a text file for me the next
thing that we're going to want to do is
um add some text to our file just
because we don't want to be opening up
an empty text file so to dilute to do
this get your object my file and since
we already have this text file open
whatever we input to my file is going to
input to this text file so what do we
want to write in oops there we go let's
write on this will show up in the file
and we'll add a new line for ease of
reading so now what we did is we created
an object that allowed it allowed us to
open files we opened or created a file
called new file text and we added some
words or a sentence to our text file
just because we didn't want to empty and
after you have created all your files
and added some text fit you always want
to close on whatever you've been working
on and just this just helps so you don't
have any memory leaks or anything like
that so let's go ahead and execute a
compile and run and I know you guys
can't see my desktop because my screen
recorder but you guys have to believe
that I don't have a file already so this
is compiling and it's a when it's
running it's creating a file right now
and it says press any key to continue
and in case you guys can't see it or not
in case I know you guys didn't see it
but there's a little icon that popped up
let me try and drag it I can but there's
a little icon that pops up in a new text
file just created on my desktop so let
me click and open that and show you guys
this file was just created when I ran
that in the text on it says this will
show up in the file so I have a file
called new file that was just created
here and the text that I input it says
this will show up in the file is this
text right here so let me close that and
again let's recap this one more time so
it sticks in your head the first thing
you're going to need to do is include
this in this allows you to input and
output files and not just text right
here creates an object so you can work
with files and this object you use
throughout the rest of your program and
you can open your files with it close
files write text to a file and that's
what we did all right here so study this
um practice creating a files and writing
some text in them and again just in cut
just in case you guys wanted to know if
you guys have a file that's already
created and you do this um let's just
put a new line if you already have a
file that's created and you try to make
a new line or open it and do this it's
going to replace what's already there
it's not going to just um add something
else under your recipe thing so again as
you can see it didn't just say this is a
text we created then added a new line to
it it totally replaces it so if you
already have a file and you open it it's
going to totally replace it and give you
that what you just saw happen so again
learn how to do this it's really simple
if you practice with it like two times
you'll be an expert on it so in case you
guys want to get this code I'm going to
put it on my site the new Boston comm so
you can get it there so thank you guys
