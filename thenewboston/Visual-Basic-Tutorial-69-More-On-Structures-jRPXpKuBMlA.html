slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
taking another look at structures and
we're going to be working more on the
program that we created in the last
tutorial now if you don't know what I'm
talking about right here or what this
form is then go ahead and move back one
tutorial - I think tutorial 68 and
you'll see how to make this make what
we've made so far so we declared a
structure and we call it customer then
we created an object that is a customer
which is a structure so now what we need
to do is we need to assign some values
to the first name last name and email of
this object customer so we'll go ahead
and click Lisp customer or button one
click so let's go ahead and change this
the name of this to button list customer
okay so now we'll come back here and
let's just go ahead and assign the first
name last name of an email of object
customer whenever they click button one
we could do this when the form loads and
we could do it outside of it but let's
just do it under button one click so
we'll type object customer and then we
if we use dot you're going to see that
we have you can see all of the ones with
the blue boxes right here now that
stands for a variable so we got email
first name and last name so we'll set
first-name equal to Jim and now we will
set the last name
equal to Jones and we'll go ahead and
set is email to equals let's just do
Jones dot gym at live.com okay so now
that we have set of value I mean a yeah
a value for each of the variables inside
of the structure object customer let's
go ahead and add those add the customer
to these text boxes right here so we
could do this right on the button one
dot click but we want to use a sub
because this makes it easier to reuse
code and we're not going to have to copy
and paste which is a very bad habit that
you don't want to get into so what we're
going to do is we are going to create a
sub called display customer now what
this is going to do is going to get our
structure and it's going to add it to
the text boxes so we'll go ahead and
type private sub display customer and
now for our arguments we're going to
have to pass a customer object to it so
I'll just type by Val we could use by
ref but we don't want to accidentally
change the values of object customer so
let's go ahead and make a copy of object
customer by using by Val and it's just
going to be used on this sub and then
when the subs exited it's gone so we'll
just type trust as customer which is the
data type so now what we're going to do
is we are going to type text first name
dot text equals cust
which is the customer object that is
passed to display customer dot first
name now we're going to do text last
name dot text and we'll set that equal
to cust
name and now I'll do this one more time
for the email so text email dot text
equals cust dot email okay so now let's
go ahead and run this and see what
happens so if we go ahead and click list
customer looks like we're getting an
error here
no never mind we're not getting in there
we need to go ahead and call display
customer so whenever they click it
whenever they click button one is going
to call display customer and we will
just pass object customer to that so it
sets the values of that and then
displays it on the text boxes okay so
let's go and run this and if we click
list customer we get Jim Jones and Jones
gym at live.com so go ahead and make
this program if you haven't already you
can play around more with this structure
see what you can do with it and then
once you have done that you can go ahead
and move onto the next tutorial and in
the next tutorial we're going to be
working more on this program and after
that we're going to be done with this
program and we're going to be moving on
to other topics so I'm go ahead I'll
scroll up and down through this go and
pause wherever you want if you want to
see the code so thanks for watching guys
and stay tuned for the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
