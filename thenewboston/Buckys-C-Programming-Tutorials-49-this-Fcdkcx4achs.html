welcome back to your 49th C++ tutorial
and in this tutorial I'm going to be
talking to you guys about the this
keyword but before I get into that let
me tell you guys I'm sorry it's been a
couple days since I made a tutorial but
I had to upload 200 PHP videos to
YouTube ND guys have any idea how long
it takes to upload 200 videos to YouTube
quite a while so anyways that's my
excuse so now we can get back into C++
so let's go ahead and for this example
I'm going to be making a new class
because if I put it all in the same file
it's going to get a little clustered so
I'm going to name my class Hannah and
actually I already messed up yes okay I
actually made a Deconstructor and I
didn't want to so let's go ahead and
just delete that right there and now we
can get coding our project so let's go
ahead and first let's do a couple
housekeeping things
take this hand eh and paste it in here
and now I'm going to take this and paste
in here so basically your dot cpp files
see this one and this one should
basically look the same at the very
beginning and what i also like to do is
get rid of this protected crap right
there because we didn't learn that yet
so you know no use using it so basically
what this hannah class is going to do is
it's going to have a private variable
I'll just name that int H now whenever
we create an object we're going to pass
in a value and integer value and all
that's going to do is you know say we
pass in 20 it's going to set H equal to
20 so that's all we're doing in the
constructor and then we have another
method to print out the H variable on
the screen so we'll name that print crap
because that's my favorite name for a
function if you couldn't tell already so
basically what we're doing is we have a
variable called H and we're going to
print it out on the screen and you're
saying alright then what the heck's the
point of the story well I'm going to be
printing out this variable in three
different types of ways the first way is
normal like we talked about before and
the two different ways are using the
this keyword now we don't know what
those mean yet so that's why I need to
watch this tutorial
so now that I got you hooked and anxious
let's go ahead and start coding this
constructor so again as I talked about
we are going to pass it in a variable
and X oh I mean I'm we're going to be
passing in a value there we go I got a
little tongue-twisted and we're going to
set the variable H equal to that value
so you say we pass it in 66 it's going
to take H and set equal to 66 simple
enough so now let's go ahead and start
coding our print crap method right here
so let's go ahead and make void an a
print crap and it's not going to take
any parameters like I said it's just
going to print some crap out on the
screen and let's go ahead and make a
template first and in line so this is
what I do whenever I code by myself I
probably shouldn't do this whenever I'm
making tutorials but I basically make a
shell of whatever I can and then fill in
the blanks so the first thing we were
going to want to print out is what h
equals and it's just going to be you
know H so say we passed in so say H is
equal to 99 it's just going to print out
H equals 99 on the screen so now let's
get in the good stuff the meat of this
tutorial and that's the this keyword now
I'm actually going to be doing this
story a little bit different than before
in order to teach you guys the full
concept I'm actually going to make a my
entire program first and then walk you
guys through I usually you know um walk
you guys through what I'm doing as I'm
typing but it's going to be easier to
understand if I actually make my whole
program first so this H equals this H
this is going to pronounce me you guys
will know by the end of this tutorial
and actually this weird kind of H is
also gone
let me add my equal signs equal signs I
know you guys are anxious to see what
this all is but I'm not going to tell
you guys yet so now we're basically
printing out H in three different kinds
of ways this way this way and this way
get it this way it's a cheap little joke
but anyways let's go ahead and now we
have to create an object to actually
call those functions so Hana H oh and
let's just pass it in like 23 or
something like that so first what this
is going to do is it's going to take the
value of 23 and set it equal to the
variable H so when everyone's program is
going to print out 23 23 23
so now after that we of course need to
call print crap right like that
so let's go ahead and build and run this
and see if I got any errors which I did
because I forgot a semicolon let's run
it again and check it out H equals 23
make sense we already knew that
now this arrow H equals 23 all right
oh we're not exactly sure what that
means and whenever we use parentheses
star this that H that equals 23 2 so
basically we can see that these are
three different ways of printing out the
same variable so we already know that
whenever you print out on a private
variable we can just use that private
variable name and it prints out the
value so we already know what that one
does from the you know the last 80
tutorials so let's go ahead and skip
right on down to this one and that's
this arrow H well remember in tutorial
like 42 or something I told you guys
whenever you use the arrow it means
you're going to be working with a
pointer so that's kind of weird so that
means this is a pointer well yes it does
in a C++ program whenever you use the
word this it's actually a keyword that
identifies a special type of pointer the
key word this stores the address of the
current object that you're working with
it sounds kind of weird huh so that's
why action needed to build this entire
program first because I needed to build
an object and the object we're currently
working with is
H Oh so whenever we use that object H oh
it took the address of it and by the way
H o is stored somewhere on our computer
and memory deep down you know some weird
location but it took that location and
it stored it in the key word this so now
that this key word identifies a special
type of pointer like I said that stores
the address of H oh if we made another
object called Bo it would then hold the
address of Bo so whatever object you're
working with it's going to take that
address and store it in a pointer called
this so basically it's saying the
address of H Oh use that object in that
object has a variable H so that's why
this and this are basically the same
thing and you're saying all right so if
they're the same thing why does this
work and why does this work this
whenever you print out H it's just
implied that whenever you're working
whenever you're here let me say it like
this
whenever you print out this variable
right here c++ assumes that you're
working with a curved object whenever
you print out like this way using Heuer
this it's basically explicitly telling
c++ so this is usually you know just
assuming that you're working with the
correct but this is explicitly telling
c++ you're working with this current
object it just you know a different way
to do things but actually this keyword
is pretty important I'm going to show
you guys why it's actually useful aside
from just printing out variables so
basically what I want to stress you guys
in this soil is whenever you use the
keyword this it stores it as a special
type of pointer and that pointer stores
the address of the current object in
this case was H oh so this is saying the
address of H Oh get that object and that
object has a variable H and H is equal
to what do we set equal to 23 so that's
why this prints out 23 now that I
confuse these guys let's move on to this
one down here
now this is basically a different way to
access the object the this with a weird
pointer and then surrounded by
parentheses this is called dereferencing
a pointer and what this means is it's
literally taking the memory location of
the current object which is you know
some long hexadecimal x 0 j 42 yada yada
and it's taking that memory location of
the current object and calling the
variables value right there so this is
basically saying alright whatever
current object we're working with what
is h0 that h0 has a variable called h
now print out the value of h in this you
know just assumes we're working with h
oh right here we're saying we're going
to be using this keyword to talk about h
oh and right here we're using the
explicit memory location of the object h
oh so this is basically implied explicit
explicit just two different weird ways
of doing it
so now that i taught you guys that in
the next store i'm going to show you
guys why you would use the this keyword
and you know it's not just something
that you can use the show off that you
know more about sleep plus plus it
actually is useful in some programs so
maybe the next tutorial will be a little
bit more useful but for now that's all I
got for you guys so hopefully I can fuse
the eyes if you need some more
information check out my website the new
Boston comm and you can ask me a
question there but for now thank you
guys for watching and I'll see you guys
in next door</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
