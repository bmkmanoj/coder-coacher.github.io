this video what I'm going to do is I'm
going to show you guys a few simple tips
of things you need to remember in order
to help out these BOTS and spiders
whenever they're trying to crawl your
site so remember I said that a bot is
pretty much an automated program that's
going to go to every single web page and
it's going to start gathering up
information about it so it's going to
gather up all the text and stuff and
it's also going to gather up all of the
links that are on this web page now for
each of those links what it's going to
do is it's going to go to those and that
basically as well a spider is it goes to
those links and now once you get to this
page you're going to gather up all of
these links and then you're going to go
to them so why am I saying this I'm
saying this because if you ever have a
page that cannot be accessed by clicking
links let's say that you have a page
that you actually need to type in the
full URL into a browser then there's no
way that that spider is ever going to
find it so let's say on my home page I
you know have a bunch of different
sections but I put these links to all my
you know programming videos and computer
science videos but I also have this math
section right here that has a bunch of
math videos now the thing is there are
no links to that math section or any of
those math videos anywhere on my home
page
so how the heck is Google going to find
this it doesn't just you know start
typing in random crap in a browser and
you know hope it's a web page what it
does is it crawls it so make sure that
everything is connected via links very
important another thing I want to point
out is do not put text inside images so
you see we have a link to the Java
beginners video right here this link is
text so whenever Google goes to this
website it already has a little
indicator of what it is because of this
text right here now if this button right
here was just an image like one ping or
jpg or something it would have a very
difficult time of reading that this is a
stream that this is the forum so same
thing goes with logo
whenever you have a logo google has no
way of knowing that this says the new
Boston education I mean I'm sure Google
does because they're pretty smart and
they probably built a million programs
for it but the crawler is going to have
a very difficult time of reading text
inside images now there's actually a way
a cool technique that let's say you have
a picture of an elephant on your
homepage for some reason there's
actually a cool way that you can tell
Google hey this is a picture of a
elephant
since it can't just look at it and
automatically know it so we're going to
be taking a look at that later on to
kind of help it out but for now as a
general rule do not have text inside
images at least important text and the
last thing I want to mention for this
quick little tip video is these bots
that Google and Bing and Yahoo make
they're actually really really good and
really smart however there are a few
things that they're not really good at
one of them is filling out forms so
let's say that you have I don't know
some web page that you go to what you
need to fill out a form to get there
maybe you need to enter your email or
name to see it or whatever Google is
going to have a really difficult time of
ever finding what is behind that form
and another thing is a lot of these
social networking sites what you need to
do is you need to be logged in to
actually see the content so let's say
that on my website I don't know a lot of
these videos were public you don't need
to make an account or anything but maybe
and this is in the case with mine but
let's say that you had to make an
account to view someone's profile so
kind of like Facebook well if you need
to make an account to view someone's
profile Google is never going to do that
it can't just automatically make
accounts for social networks that would
be cool if it did though and all of this
content right here is therefore never
going to be crawled never going to be
stored in their database never going to
appear in their search results so again
remember a couple key things make sure
everything is connected by links if you
go to your website and you can't access
it just by clicking links then Google is
never going to find it make sure you
don't have text inside images and also
make sure that you don't have
a lot of your important content behind
private pages or pages where you need to
be logged in to access so again some
quick little tips just to get started
just to help out your crawler and in the
next video we're going to be really
giving into the good SEO stuff it's
going to be awesome we'll see you that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
