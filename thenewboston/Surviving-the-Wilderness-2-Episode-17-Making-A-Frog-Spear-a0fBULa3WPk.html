start a fire
then boil some water get hydrated and
then down here you see this little
here's the main lake right here and then
there's this little I don't even know
what do you want a gully or something
and I'm guessing that there has to be at
least one frog somewhere in there I've
been hearing them I'm hearing them right
now actually but I think that uh that's
I'm gonna do fire you try to catch a
frog and this time I'm definitely gonna
cook whatever I catch because no more
eating crap that I don't cook because up
those worms I feel sick to my stomach
still and that was hours ago when I ate
those so uh that's the plan for right
now so now I want to find a spear or a
branch that I can make a spear out of
and it's definitely gonna be a lot
thinner than my other spear because the
other spear is this I don't know I think
it's a little too big for fries so I
want something about this thick right
here but this one wasn't a very good one
snaps in half easy so I probably need to
find something live for you like this or
something see this wouldn't be pretty
good if I could get the branches off it
that's about how thick I want and then I
can make prongs on the end well this one
looks pretty lively enough now I'm gonna
be able to pull this out of the ground
so I'm gonna keep looking for something
that I can make a spear out of and once
I do I'll let you know hopefully I'll be
catching my dinner soon so I found this
guy right here it's not that alive had
to snap it off but uh I think if I break
these branches off and sharpened it to
the tip and
it's long enough and it's thin enough or
should be able to make something out of
it
so there it is
didn't take too long at all actually
it's too thin and too dead to dry where
I can't make prongs out of it so I just
made that one tip on the end it's not
razor sharp like the like the other one
I wanted to kind of dull but it just has
to be enough where hopefully they can go
through frog if I can find a frog or
anything so now let's go hunting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
