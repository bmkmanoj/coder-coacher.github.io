we're going to setting' we're going to
be setting this a value to zero
initially when the button has been
clicked and then we're going to just
create a set interval timer which is
going to gradually increase this value
and this obviously doesn't have
practical applications but it shows us
what the progress bar will look like
once it is in place and actually has a
real value to to feedback to this sir to
this widget so just for now I'm going to
go ahead and get rid of this line here
and I'm going to create a new variable
called interval and that's going to be
equal to set interval and inside here we
have a function so we pull this down now
inside here is what's going to happen
every X amount of seconds and we define
the second just after this here so I'm
going to do 50 milliseconds which is
obviously point zero five over second
and this is going to allow us to if
gradually increase this particular value
every 50 milliseconds so let's go ahead
and update this value each time so we're
going to say Val equals of hour plus one
so that's going to increase the value
here by one every 50 milliseconds and
then what we can do is go ahead and
implement or or put this into the value
of the progress bar so again we create
we reference or select the progress bar
div and we use dot progress bar as we
did before but this time we're going to
go ahead and define a value in here
which will be equal to Val and because
it's equal to Val every 50 milliseconds
this will increase by one and therefore
the progress bar will constantly update
with this updating value here this
variable Val so let's go ahead and test
that out and then we're going to go on
to look at how to relay this back to the
percentage so when I click upload' you
can see that that gradually increases
all the way to the end however we do
have a problem when it gets to the end
now the percentage the value is
constantly increasing now so what we
want to do is we need a way to break
this interval because obviously this
interval is still
on this page now even though we can't
see this beyond fit beyond 100 so the
interval is still happening so this is
wasting resources it's taking up you
know too much processing power so what
we want is a simple check underneath
here to say if Val
in fact we won't do this bit yet we'll
go ahead and update the D percentage so
essentially all we want to do is we want
to reference this percentage so we use a
selector percent and we want to apply
text into here and that text is going to
be Val and then we append on a
percentage sign so now when we preview
this in our browser you'll see that not
only do we get the progress bar but we
get an updating percentage as well and
you can see that going all the way up
when the progress bar reaches the end we
assume it's still at 100 but in actual
fact that timer is still in place so
this percentage is gradually increasing
so obviously we don't want this so we
want to break out of this interval so
although this is only for demonstration
purposes we want to keep it as efficient
as possible if you do decide to run this
on a live on a live page where people
can access it so I'm going to create an
if statement with a block and the
condition is if val is equal to 100
obviously that's at 100% we want to
clear interval and the interval we want
to specify is this interval here that we
set because we set the interval into a
variable called interval so we just
clear interval interval so we define the
variable that holds this set interval
function so now that that's happened we
will have this value stopped at 100 and
the interval will be cleared and
therefore nothing else will be happening
you can still this see this is still
going up now so let's go ahead and press
upload you can see this is gradually
increasing this time when it reaches 100
the interval is going to be cleared so
elite we end with the Val equal to 100
so now that we've seen the practical
application of this obviously it's
important to think about why you
wouldn't just use this on its own
the progress bar has a limited amount of
options for this because of this it's
essentially because we don't use it on
its own we use it to simply feed in a
value this might be from you know like I
said earlier an external PHP script that
uploads or something on the page that
feeds back a value with PHP you can feed
back the percentage of a debt out of an
upload and therefore you could implement
it into this value here as opposed to
the mock-up value that we've created so
that's how easy progress bar is to
implement and the value option to define
how far along the progress bar is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
