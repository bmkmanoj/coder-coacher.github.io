20th java game development story and in
this tutorial we're going to be working
in our bucky class so right now we have
an animation class it's all done I
promise not touching it again we have
our screen manager class to manage our
screen and now we have our Bucky class
with our main method in it there is this
properly named something differ because
your name isn't monkey
now I already filled in some stuff for
you not waste any time
it's pretty much just our main method I
created an object for this class and
called the run method which we are going
to be building later so now let's go
ahead and outside your main method again
don't forget you need to be outside your
main method but inside your bucket class
though let's go ahead and do some things
okay take a breath first we're going to
create three objects animation a because
remember I had an animation class so
we're going to create an object after we
changes the private to access our
animation class done private screen
manager s so now we can access the
methods in our screen manager this is a
little too easy
private image BG and what this is going
to do is going to be our background
image or that gradient that I had from
less stores I didn't change it
I kept it since it was so awesome so now
after this the only thing we really need
is a list of display modes now I'm going
to give it six default display modes and
what it's going to do is take those
modes and match them up against the
graphic card modes and when it finds one
that matches is going to take it out and
it's going to use that one so let's go
ahead and put private static final
display mode will name it modes one or
something like that and it's going to be
an array I told listen array the same
thing just get used to it new or excuse
me
the first element in the array is going
to be our first display mode
new display mode and the settings for
this one are going to be 800 by 600 32
bits and zero so let's go ahead and copy
this and let's go ahead and duplicate it
two more times
same resolution but the bit depth is
going to be 24 and 16 now 26 16 so now
we need to put commas in there instead
of colons because that is just silly and
actually we can put semicolon down here
and now let's do this for 3 more display
modes so these are all going to be 640
by 480 and I'm doing these because these
are common display modes and just copy
this two more times and you just can't
like make your own custom display modes
since it's going to be comparing it
against a graphics card you usually want
to put in ones that are rather common so
now we have this array called modes and
it stores 6 very common display modes so
at least one of these should match up
against your graphics card and when this
mode matches up against your graphics
card that's going to be a display mode
that's going to be used when they're
playing the game and you're saying
alright what if all of these match up
well then it's just going to take the
first one that matches up so now that we
have pretty much three variables in an
array of display modes stain that up a
little bit we can move on to the next
part of our tutorial and the first thing
we want to do is go to method that loads
images and adds scenes to our movie so
load images and add scenes and why only
spell two things are on method load and
see it's just like that so we'll go
public void load images I can take any
parameters
and once I scroll down we're going to
set that background equal to new image
icon and then again we put the always
called directory or file path and mine
was in C and it was in a folder called
test and it was called I think it was
called back dot JPEG I'm pretty sure
that's what it's called
and now we just have to get the image
from that file and now we need the two
other ones which are my face with my
eyes open in my face with my eyes closed
so image face one equals new FF let's
just copy this crib BAM and just changes
the face 1 dot ping let's go to me let's
go to you good and then copy this and
face 2 equals face 2 dot ping I'm pretty
cool how I did that on so now we loaded
all these images in two variables so now
we can go ahead and add them in our
animation so let's go ahead and create
an animation object new animation so now
we can use our methods from the
animation class and the two things we
want to do is add scene and this is
going to be the first thing we want to
add is face 1 for 250 milliseconds and
then after that we want to add one more
scene copy phase 2 for 250 milliseconds
and we don't need to add our background
because our background is going to stay
static these scenes are going to be the
only thing that's changing on it so
that's why we needed to add a new
animation again we could add the
background in our animation but I mean
it would just take up too much space and
we're just going to have a stay still
and add these scenes because that's
what's going to be changing so for now
in the next story we're going to be
building our run method and also maybe
our movie loop if we have time but thank
you guys for watching that's it for this
story at least two more tutorials and
then we're going to be finally done with
this and we're going to be finally
building anime
and that doesn't have Flickr and we're
going to use for the rest of our game
programming so again one last time thank
you don't forget subscribe and I'll see
you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
