second WX Python tutorial
I bet you all are terribly excited for
this because in this tutorial we are
going to be making panels in our first
button that's what I'm talking about
and in case you don't know what a panel
is it's pretty much the container that's
going to hold all your buttons and all
your other cool stuff so let's go ahead
and we're going to be working inside the
class that we built last time so let's
get on inside this init method we just
built let's go ahead and add some more
stuff so we have a frame built right
here but we want to build a panel as
well so in order to do that let's go
ahead and name it whatever we want I'm
going to name it panel so I don't forget
and set it equal to W X dot panel with
the capital P and the parameter it takes
itself BAM look at that our panels
created so this is pretty much well
let's go ahead and add button then
you'll see what it is so create a button
we do is set it equal to W X button
period
button with a capital B and the
parameter it takes is first the parent
of it which is panel now again since
this button is in this panel that's why
you have to write what the parent is
right here if you don't right panel it's
not going to be inside the panel so make
sure to do that so after that we need to
give our button a label and this is what
text is on our button so what I'm going
to want this button to do is exit the
program so I'm going to write label
equals exit again you can write whatever
you want but I'm going to make a exit
program so that's what it does the
parameter after this is the position so
that's POS equals in your right to
whatever you want to position B on the
screen the first is the x coordinates or
left and right and I'm going to have
mine let's say one
130 away from the left hand side and 10
pixels down from the top so that's where
my button is going to be but we didn't
say how big our button is going to be so
let's go ahead and do that right now
with our size parameter and let's say we
want it 60 wide by 60 tall so now we
created a panel and a button inside the
panel that's going to say exit it's
going to be right there and it's going
to be 60 by 60 it's going to be a square
box so now we have a panel and button
but we don't really have any actions on
them yet so let's go ahead and we have
this button but we want to say all right
when we click the button we want to exit
the program right now we just have a
button if we click on that is just going
to say all right you're clicking on me
now what so let's go ahead and what we
need to do to do this do to do this edit
it in is bind an event to a widget or
bind an event to the button so let's go
ahead and type self period bind and this
allows us to bind events like clicks to
actions such as exit the program so
let's go ahead and of course we need
parameters in the first comp thing we
type is what well let me show you
WX the event e VT all in capital is
underscore button and this means the
event we're talking about here is
clicking the button so now that we have
an event we can have an action so what's
the event clicking a button what's the
action well let's go ahead and make a
function called close button now this
function isn't created yet we're going
to have to create that ourselves but for
now let's just say whenever we hit this
button or call the event button we want
you to do a function called close button
and again we want to apply this to the
button so go ahead and whatever you
typed for your name up here put it right
here
and we also want to close on the window
whenever we have X on the window so put
self bind and in our parameters for this
put EBT WX e VT underscore closed
come on keyboard underscore closed and
whenever we do this we want to put self
on one name a closed window or something
so now whenever we hit the button it's
going to make a function called close
button and whenever we hit the X on our
window it's going to call a function
called close window but we don't have
those functions yet so we have to write
them right now so our first one is
called close button and we want that to
take the parameters of self and event
and I'll go over that more in-depth
later but for now um what I want to
happen want to close this button is just
to close this class so press self close
and in parameters put true and now this
is our function so whenever we hit the
button we want to do this function right
here so whenever we hit the button call
self close button close button closes it
and we need to build one just like this
for what do we name this close window so
close window and this is going to of
course take the same parameter so event
and this one is a little bit different
self destroy look more violent so this
is how you close it using a button this
is how you close it using the window so
let me go ahead and run this and down
talk to you guys through one more time
first we need to save it don't want to
forget that hit f5 hopefully I didn't
get any errors so the first thing I'm
going to do is hit this to escape it and
then let's run it again and also when I
hit X it escapes so let me bring this up
one more time and I'll talk you guys
through it
where yeah where yeah right there
so what we did in this tutorial is
created a panel and this panel is the
background you see the buttons right
here the panel is what's around it now
if you're saying right and he just put
the button right in the frame instead of
it having put in the panel and then the
panel in the frame
well it just organizes better and in a
couple tutorials to come you'll see why
but after that we created a button with
the label exit as you can see and the
size was 60 by 60 as you can see this
button is a square box 60 by 60 pixels
next we had an event and we wanted to
bind an event with a function so the
event was button which means whenever we
click the button and the function was
closed it so whenever we click the
button it did this close this class and
aside from that we also let me get rid
of this we also made another event which
has closed the window and we had this
destroy this class so again this is one
way to close it this is another way to
close it
so that's your a quick tutorial on how
to make panels and also how to bind
events - well buttons or windows
whatever you want and how to call a
function whenever you hit one of these
events so again you can make a function
like say output something and then it
would say whatever but that's for
another tutorial at another day at
another time
so for now just play around create a
couple buttons right a couple functions
and I'll be going over events in depth
and also functions on W X and depth but
I know you guys were getting antsy and
you wanted to add something so that's
just a quick tutorial if you don't
understand it exactly for now then trust
me it's fine I'll clear things up as you
go on but for now thank you for watching
