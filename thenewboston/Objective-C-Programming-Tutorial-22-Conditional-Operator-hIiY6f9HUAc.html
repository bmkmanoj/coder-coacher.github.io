to your 22nd story oh maybe and this
tutorial we're gonna be going over a
conditional operator which is pretty
much a shorthand version of the if-else
statement and this is probably the last
thing we're going to be doing with else
or anything like that for a couple
tutorials and anyways we're also going
to be going over boolean variables what
they are and what they mean so let's go
ahead and jump right into it I'm not
even gonna give you a background of
anything first I'm just gonna go ahead
and build program because this is gonna
be the easiest way to teach it so let's
go ahead and set a variable a equal to
set a variable B equal 3 and set a
variable C equal to 0 and these are just
gonna be some demonstration variables so
the first thing is the condition
operator and what this does is like I
said it's just shorthand term for
if-else and what you do is you give a
condition which is a test and then you
give it an expression 1 and expression -
expression 1 is going to happen if the
test is true expression 2 is going to
happen if the test is false so let's go
ahead and make a simple test a equal to
B now after this test what you do is you
put a question mark and this kind of
makes sense one of the only things that
makes sense is a computer program so
it's like you're asking it is it true or
is it not true with the question marks
and after question mark you give it two
sets of expressions the first and by the
way these expressions are going to be
separated by a colon the first
expression which is just a statement any
bit of code you want is what you want to
happen if this is true so if a is equal
to B then just go ahead and output they
are equal now for your else what you do
is you put a colon and after the colon
it's another expression now after the
colon you want to write an expression
what's going to happen if the statement
is not true or in this case they aren't
equal to each other so and
log let's go ahead write different so
here's the syntax for this you give it a
condition and then you give it an
expression what do you want to happen if
it's true separated by : what do you
want to happen by it's false if it's
false and again well let's go ahead and
just run this and see what happens
so save and it says different right here
because right here cuz a is not equal to
B now let's go ahead and change those to
two and two and see what we get build
and run save it they are equal BAM right
there so again one last time you give a
condition which is pretty much a test
put a question mark after it to know the
separate the condition for the
expressions give the true expression
separated by : in the false expression
so that way it can test whether this is
true or false in half code output either
way so that's kind of the shorthand of a
condition operator so now let's get into
boolean variables now aside from
conditions testing whether they're true
or false you can also test the variables
themselves are true or false so let's
give you example well let's go ahead and
just copy this entire thing just because
we already have the syntax all there and
instead of a equals B let's go ahead and
test one variable C and you're like
what's the test for this C true or false
how the heck can you test one variable
if it's true or false well let's go
ahead and first rate true for the true
statement and false for the false
statement now instead of integers
characters there's also another data
type and this is called boolean or
boolean now anytime you have a variable
and it's equal to zero your computer is
going to see it as false anytime you
have a variable what
is not zero in the most common thing
people set it equal to is one but you
can set it equal to 99 or anything
anything that's not zero your computer
is gonna see this is true so the idea
that a variable itself can either be
true which is not zero or false which is
zero is the type of Abu lean or boolean
however you say it so let's go ahead and
run this so right now what we can delete
this we're saying see what in essence
means is C equal to zero if it is it's
gonna be false so this should output
false if it's not it's going to be true
so let's go ahead and build and run this
and as you can see it says false right
there now let's go ahead and if we
wanted to make this variable true we
would go ahead and set equal to one so
now if we go ahead and build ran this
again it would output true so that is
the basics of a boolean variable and
like I said you can also set it to 99 or
anything and still build it save it and
it'll output is true so why am I telling
you this random variable stuff without
even giving you a real need for it well
later on we're going to be using boolean
variables and I want you guys to know
whenever we use them and I'm gonna bake
if C then you guys actually know what's
going on and by the way since you can
use it there you can also use it in an
if statement like if C and then output a
bit of coda right here so whenever I do
stuff like that now you guys will have
an understanding of what it means and
when you see it running program and see
the usefulness of it then it might click
in your head but anyways just want to
tell you guys that there is something
called boolean variable if your
variables set to zero it's going to be
false anything else than 0 it's going to
be true and that's that for this
tutorial so thank you guys for watching
I got nothing else to say so make sure
to subscribe and I'll see you next
