45th C++ tutorial and in this story I'm
going to be talking to you guys about
member initializers now I don't even
know if I told you guys this but a
member is pretty much fancy term for
anything in your class so when some
people talk about variables they call
them members it's basically anything in
your class is a member of that class so
let's go ahead and let me explain this
we're going to probably have a bunch of
variables in our class some of them are
just going to be regular variables and
some of them are going to be constant
variables so we know constant variables
have a couple of weird rules and
creating them is one of the weird rules
so remember a constant variable is
basically a variable that we can't
change and we also have to initialize it
using a special it's a special syntax
it's called member syntax now the cool
thing is we can also initialize regular
variables this way but you don't have
that option of when using constant
variables you have the option of
initializing regular variables this way
or the way we learned before but
constant variables definitely need to be
initialized using member syntax so let's
go ahead and first thing let's go ahead
and make two private variables I'm going
to make one just regular variable
because some be integer variable reg var
stands for regular variable and I'm
going to make another constant variable
so constant just make this one the injur
as well and we'll name this one Const
var so now we have just a regular
doubled variable and a constant variable
so now what I want to do is whenever we
first create our an object let's go
ahead and assign a value to this
variable and assign a value to this
variable so our constructor is going to
take two parameters one value for this
one and one value for this one so go
ahead and just type in a
and enbe and we'll be tossing numbers in
there later on but now that we have
values assigned to these variables we're
going to need a way to print it out on
the screen so go ahead and we'll make a
function called print simple enough so
now we have a constructor that takes two
values assigns one to their regular
variable one to our constant variable
and then we'll print it out on the
screen so now we probably need to change
our constructor around a bit the first
thing we need to make a do is take those
two parameters a and int B now you're
saying alright I probably go ahead and
in the body somewhere in here I'm going
to type all that syntax that special
syntax you've been talking about but
check it out
you actually don't write anything in the
body yeah think about that for a second
it'll freak you out you actually don't
write any of your code when initializing
variables in the body so you're saying
where the heck do you put it and this is
the weirdest place you put it in between
the parameter list and the beginning of
the body so between the parentheses in
the curly brace this is where you're
going to put it so that's what confuses
the most people and that's why they have
a hard time understanding because
usually nothing goes here but that's
where we're going to be putting the
syntax why they made it go here I don't
know and the syntax for it was this the
first thing we need is a colon and the
colon tell C++ that we're going to be
working with member initializer syntax
now it's actually quite simple all you
need to do is write your variable name
such as red var and inside parentheses
you give it an initial value which this
one we're going to be passing it in a
now whenever you have multiple variables
you want to set equal to you know the
initial value you just separate them
with a comma it's basically just like a
list
so our next variable is Const I was a
constable and this one is going to be
equal to B and what people sometimes
like to do is put their variables on new
lines but it really doesn't matter
and another thing make sure that you
don't put a semicolon at the end of this
these aren't statements it's just a list
it knows when you're done because the
body is going to begin
so basically start with a colon
and make a list using the syntax
variable value if you have another one
separated with a comma variable value so
I know it's really weird syntax but what
this is going to do is we're going to be
creating a constructor that takes two
values and it's going to be setting them
equal to a regular variable and constant
variable and like I said before whenever
you have a constant variable in your
class this is how you need to do it of
course we can set this variable equal to
you know initialize it like we have
before but you know we might as well use
this list since we're you know learning
this tutorial so now let's just go ahead
and make another function avoid print
just to print this stuff out on the
screen so void okay there void sally
print and all this is going to do is be
like see out regular ver is and then
just put reg var and then put
constant variable is :
Const VAR just like that and now let's
go ahead and and that line and you guys
can't even see a you guys still can't
see there we go
em line definitely sped that wrong and
that line so now I'm just going to print
out our regular variable is 10 and our
constant variable is 20 or something
stupid like that as long as I spelled
this very let me just double check
alright we should be good to go so now
all we need to do is create an object in
our main so let's go ahead and create a
Sally object just name it s oh and
remember this is a constructor so it's
going to take two parameters just make
like three and eighty-seven two random
numbers just make sure they're integers
and now as soon as we created that
constructor it's going to take three and
assign it to our regular variable and
it's going to take 87 and assign it to
our constant variable so now reg var
equals three cos Phi R equals 87 so now
when we call that print method and let
me just I don't like typing stuff on the
first line for some reason um s Oh dot
print it should print that out unless I
forgot a semicolon or something so let's
go ahead and see and check it out
regular variable is three constant
variable is 87 mmm my spelling right
there that actually does spell variable
well I'm close enough so anyways one
last time here is what we did we had a
constant variable in our class this
pesky little thing right here so
whenever we have a constant variable in
our class we can't initialize it like
before we need to initialize it in a
special way and that's through the use
of member initializers whenever you want
to create a member initializer list and
basically this is just a fancy term for
setting your variables equal to values
you need to make a list in between your
parameters and the body of your
constructor and make sure whenever
you're making that list to start with
the :
that tells c++ you're going to start
making a mem
list and just use this in text and don't
forget to separate each variable with a
comma and then of course whenever you
create your object you need to pass it
in the two parameters that need it
because right here it said it asks for
two parameters and then later on we can
just use those variables in any old
function just the print amount like
regular variables blank constant
variable is blank and then actually I
got inside shrek you guys not have this
function works actually I want to ask
you guys this now I'm thinking about it
is there a way to a like word wrap
because like whenever I'm working with
this you see I was going off the screen
um let me know if there's a way to
automatically word wrap so you guys well
I guess I'll just scroll from now on I
don't like my lines of code on new lines
anyway so forget that like the last 30
seconds of this tutorial but anyways now
that you guys know how member
initializers work um yeah I'm just going
to quit this tutorial now so thank you
guys watching don't forget subscribe and
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
