tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm gonna be
showing you how to be notified when a
file has changed like when it's written
in when you rename it move it or
something like that so you're really not
going to need anything for this tutorial
because we're gonna have it all do it
when the form is loading so we're just
going to go ahead and select our form
right here and go over to the events and
double-click on the load event so it'll
create an event annular for when the
forum loads alright and you're gonna
need to be using the system dot IO
namespace since the filesystemwatcher
class is located in there and like I
said we're going to using the
filesystemwatcher class to check to see
when that been changed or moved or
something like that so just music file
system watcher I'm gonna call it fsw
filesystemwatcher and setting equal to
AU
filesystemwatcher and the first property
that we're going to want to set is the
path to basically where we wanted to
check the files and you're going to want
to make it be a directory and I'm just
gonna make it check for all the files on
my desktop so I'm going to say the path
so I'm gonna say the path equals my
desktop so I'm going to say environment
got get a folder path of my desktop and
then we're gonna want to set the notify
filter and the notify filter is
basically what we want it to look for so
if we want it to look for um when you
save it or edit a file we're just going
to do notified filter dot last right so
I know if I filters that last right but
there are a lot of other ones in here
for example if you were to create a file
if you were to rename it or move it or
something like that there's stuff pretty
much everything in here but we're gonna
have it when you save it so we're gonna
set the notified filter to last right
next we're just going to want to set the
actual filter itself so for file
extensions or certain types of files you
can do so FS w dot filter people and
then you're just going to want to treat
this just like a
therefore like an open file dialog or
something like that so you can say like
Hecht so you can say like text right
there or if you wanted to do all files
you can just delete the text and then
just have a dot but you can't have
multiple extensions so you can't just do
like a line and then a different
extension you can only have one type of
extension and if you wanted to do only a
certain type of file I mean only a
certain file you can just put the actual
name of the file so for example if you
only wanted it to check to see when you
save document dot text and it would only
notify you when you saved document dot
txt all right so we're gonna have it to
you before all text files though and
next we're gonna want to create a new
event handler for the change event and
the changed event will occur basically
when every change the file so if you
save it or something like that we're
just gonna say FS w dot changed and
we're just gonna say plus equals here to
creat a new event handler for it and
then just click tab twice so we don't
have to write out this method and then
we're just gonna have a message box be
displayed whenever a file is saved so
you say you save a text file and before
we can do this this event won't be
raised because we have to set the
enabling events property to true because
he Paulie that set of false and if we
don't set it to true this event won't be
raised so we're gonna say fsw enable
raising events and worse than one set
the stick truth basically so events can
be raised all right so let's just go
ahead and debug here and make sure that
it works now if we go on the desktop
here and save this
Adam text file we're gonna change the
text to Adam and save it should get a
message box here saying you have saved a
text file
yep perfect all right so let's look at
whenever the file is renamed so we're
just gonna want to
for right here the file is renamed so
mom file name and then we're going to
want to create a new event handler one
you files your names so FS w dot rename
and they're going to say plus equals
obviously a new event handler and we're
just gonna click tab so we don't have to
write that out ourselves and now we have
a new method for when that event occurs
and just like before we're going to have
a message box show saying a text file
has been renamed file has been renamed
all right so let's just go ahead and
debug and make sure that this worked
just rename this text file here to hello
and then as you can see we got a message
box saying that text file has been
renamed all right so that's pretty much
it for this tutorial and there are
obviously a lot of other events that can
occur like let me delete a file and move
it but it's pretty much the same thing
as what we've already been doing so
that's it for this tutorial so see you
