kyle here using or playing another team
deathmatch gain on a sub base for at
least a little while using a UMP or
silenced UMP and a spaz 12like marathon
until I get knifed by some faggot right
there um cold-blooded i believe and
ninja this game i want to let you know
so you don't spam comments or something
like that yes we yes we do lose this
game but that's only because everybody
besides me on my team absolutely sucked
and or didn't know what they were doing
and I don't get how burst or a shotgun
burst doesn't kill a guy um anyway um
for a little while i am using my silence
UMP until i switched over to my bear 50
cal and that's actually when I got most
of my kills and I don't know when but
that's when I do um in this video I'm
going to be talking about sniping for
this particular map and another
commitment same commando faggot from for
I'm going to talk about sniping on this
map laughter when I start sniping until
then basically I'm just going to be
running around with my silence UMP
actually I'm going to talk about sub
base for a second a sub base I'd have to
say uh it's a preference whether you
like it or not I personally do like it
for search and destroy and sometimes
domination cause people are actually
separated enough so i left a shrek rated
don't judge me they're separated enough
to the point where you you can spawn
kill them but it's not like severely
spawn killing like it's not to the point
where you like I it's not to the point
where you want to throw your controller
against the wall ok here I do stuff
here's when I start sniping and um I
wanna let you know when I'm sniping
don't expect like a flawless game or
like one death or something like that
when you're sniping on a map where the
people could be like a person in front
of you uh it's difficult it can be very
difficult GM sniping people from like
across the map but still it can be very
difficult to snipe on a map like this or
another another video I have where
people don't usually snipe is terminal
terminal is not terminal is also a not
very highly used map for sniping in
particular and over here I see this guy
I'm trying to follow him and get over
here apparently he must have died or
something like that and then over here
my team basically is in this one this
one just huge area over here uh I don't
want to say spawn trying to spawn kill
oh and we'll just watch this just watch
this retarded pneus
I'll and as closest in front of them as
you possibly could literally as close as
you possibly could and there's a night
there's a nice quick scope right there
and then I think I died over here oh
okay before I forget I'm going to go
back to talking about sniping on sub
base uh the sniping in this game are on
sub base um again as I said in my
terminal sniping video don't unless you
actually know what the hell you're doing
because if you want to snipe do it on a
map that's meant for sniping here I'm
just doing this because i like to goof
up because I just wanted to goof off and
because I ended actually another reason
is because I'm trying to get at least
somewhat exciting gameplay for you guys
who are watching this you the viewers
get what I'm saying no don't take the
paint blue now damn it and you okay here
i just start going on like a sniper
spree i guess you could call it and then
here is absolute proof that the replicas
are complete ownage it's just amazing
about right here it's got like four
kills right there with the RAF cos
friendly adios
and that I of course died from a grenade
okay um this over here is actually kind
of funny this table just trying to get
their care packages there's about like
five of them or something like that then
I just basically just ruin a couple of
dudes a day over there and um ok back to
sniping on Skid Row real quick um I'm
not sure actually I'm going to talk
about something really quickly I'm not
sure how many of you watch machinima but
um you see what I just did earlier us
what I just did a second ago uh use your
sidearm really didn't really do it'll
save your butt like I would like me even
being the good the good sniper that I am
I'm never gonna be I would have never
been able to snipe all those like four I
don't know four people was it really up
close um and that's it as I said at the
beginning we were gonna lose but this
was still an awesome gameplay so I had
one so I wanted to put it up um 24 and
11 I believe Kyle out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
