now let's just go ahead and do the easy
stuff so in my main activity what we're
going to be doing is remember implements
and top section fragment that top
section listener suite so again I
already explained what all that does and
our promise that we make the top section
fragment is okay I promised that I was
going to have this great mean that you
can take away a man so let's go ahead
and head out insert and implement that
method create meme actually let me add a
little comment right here so what this
gets called by arm the top fragment when
the user clicks the button so now you
know when this gets called there you go
now before we actually start adding any
code to here and this is actually a
really simple it takes like two lines of
code what we need to do is we need to
have a method in this bottom picture
fragment and all this method is going to
do is we just go to my activity main so
this is actually going to be really easy
it's not even any weird communication
stuff is just normal Java we're just
going to get a reference to both of
these text elements and then we're going
to set the text of them to whatever gets
passed in simple easy wheezy stuff
alright so under view group of course we
need to import one thing Android dot
widget dot text view and both of those
things are textview so that's why we
only need to import one thing now of
course we need to reference both of them
so static text view and I think I
actually
sozin bond picture alright textview
alright so I didn't give them an ID
should I yeah I probably should
all right so we're yeah we're yeah all
right so for the top textview let's just
go ahead and give it an ID of subtext
for you I'll just put top meme text in
for the bottom one
I'll give it a text view of bottom meme
text all right so now they have IDs that
are a little more proper so private
static text view top meme text and grab
it static text view bottom mean text my
way it's Christmas Eve so happy
Christmas Eve or no you know say happy
Merry Christmas Eve I don't know what
you say just never run you know what
just forget about it
alright so now that we have variables
that can actually accept a reference
let's go ahead and create those
references right now so topping the main
text we already know how to do this cast
that bad boy to a text view and view dot
find my ID r dot a dot lalala where you
add top text it's actually not it top
meme text now for bottom main text set
this equal to
view dot fine flow da r dot ID dot
bottom meme text so again both of these
variables right here reference this bit
of text and this bit of text easy enough
so now the only other thing we have to
do is we need to create one last method
public void set meme text now what this
is going to do is just going to take two
parameters string top and string bottom
and it's going to set these text fields
equal to whatever we pass in so top meme
text set text equal to top and lows are
on bottom mean text set text equal to
whatever we passed in for the bottom and
that is actually all we have to do so
again just to recap one last time we
imported this so we could actually use
those things and once we did we could
create a reference to that top and
bottom text and why do we need a
reference to them well since we can then
programmatically change the text of both
of those widgets so thanks guys for
watching and in the next tutorial we're
going to be finishing this up and
running it and hopefully it'll work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
