16th chemistry tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm going to be talking to you
guys about nucleic chemistry sounds
pretty cool when you say like that a so
anyways
most of the time in chemical reactions
what you have is a bunch of elements and
they're going to either gain or lose
electrons now this happens because
electrons are really fast and they move
around a lot and electrons are really
unpredictable in your nucleus where all
your protons and neutrons are they
pretty much are stable they don't they
pretty much are just chillin in the
nucleus minding their own business not
bothering anyone else it's a lot more
stable than those crazy electrons
however sometimes in rare cases the
nucleus does indeed change and when it
does we have something called nuclear
chemistry pretty awesome huh so anyways
in nuclear reactions you start out with
something called reactants that's your
starting point it can either be one
element or a combination of elements and
then some sort of nuclear reaction takes
place and you end up with products so
just remember that that isn't only my
own terminology that's the technical
terminology that you have so if you're
taking a chemistry test or anything like
that remember you start out with the
reactants and you end up with products
in this arrow right here it actually has
a name - it's called the reaction arrow
it just symbolizes some sort of nuclear
reaction that takes place so you're
saying okay this equation is pretty
useless when the heck would I ever need
this well you actually use this equation
a lot whenever you're figuring out which
kinds of cool products that an element
can make or a combination of elements
and this is called balancing nuclear
reactions so there are two rules that
you need to keep in mind before you
start balancing nuclear reactions first
the sum of the atomic numbers I'll just
write a numbers needs to equal the sum
of the atomic numbers on the left and
right hand side and also the sum of the
mass numbers needs to equal the
some of the accidently don't mind that
we'll just pretend that never happen
the mass numbers on the right hand side
so we're saying all right I need to see
an example here well lucky for you I'm
about to do one so say you have an
element like uranium which is 238 92
uranium and then some sort of nuclear
reaction takes place and you end up with
two 3490 thorium and some other element
well what you want to do is you want to
find out what this other element is so
what you need to do is say okay 238
minus 234 is 4 and 92-93 make my four
little better and 92 minus 90 is 2 so 4
2 we know that any element with 2
protons is called helium so in the case
of 238 92 uranium it can break apart
into two 3490 thorium and four to helium
which means again the mass number is
excuse me the mass number is 4 which
means protons plus neutrons and 2 is the
atomic number which means the number of
protons so let me go ahead and show you
guys one more example say you have two
helium's for two helium and you combine
it with another for two
I don't know why just put it over like
like what's it called a numerator and
denominator but I did it anyways so say
you have for two helium and for two
helium and you combine them and you get
to one hydrogen and something else you
want to find out what that other element
is so what you need to do is you need to
add up 4 and 4 which is 8 and you
subtract 2 so you get 6 and you add up 2
and 2 which is 4 and you subtract 1
which is 3
so 6 3 any element with 3 protons in the
nucleus is lithium so the missing
element is
6:3 lithium pretty cool huh
and I guess another fun fact is whenever
you convert one element to another
it's called transmutation converting
helium into hydrogen and lithium is
called transmutation just a fun factoid
but anyways that's the basics of nuclear
chemistry and also balancing nuclear
reactions while we aren't done yet we
got a whole nother slew of crap to talk
about concerning nuclear chemistry so
that's what you guys have to look
forward to in the next tutorials but for
now thank you for watching don't forget
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
