tutorial and CSS now before we all start
actually learning CSS I just wanted to
give you guys an introduction if you
don't know what CSS is it stands for
cascading style sheets and it's a way to
format your webpages so that not only
they look a lot better then you can do
just basic XHTML but they load a lot
faster too so again you don't actually
make any of the content you see in the
website but you present it a lot better
and it's a lot prettier and it does this
by the use of style sheets now as you
can see I have a website array up here
right now and if you're familiar with
XHTML which it should be if you're
watching this tutorial you can see that
this presentation would be nearly
impossible just with the use of tables
so what CSS does is use something called
style sheets
and what we're going to learn is
actually how to make these style sheets
we're going to learn the syntax of CSS
in how to write it and we're going to
learn how to use these style sheets to
reformat your website in the next
subject we're going to actually be
learning the basic syntax of CSS and
start making our very own style sheets
so here's another sample right here
and I'll leave you guys with this and in
the next subject like I said we're going
to be start actually making our first
style sheet and if you missed anything
that I went over today and you want to
review it you can go to my website the
new Boston com
I'll go over everything that we learned
today thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
