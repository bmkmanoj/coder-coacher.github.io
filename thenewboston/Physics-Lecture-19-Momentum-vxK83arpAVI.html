19th video and in this video I want to
start talking to you guys about the
conservation of momentum and energy now
the first thing I want to do is give you
guys a definition for momentum because I
don't think I defined it before if you
go ahead and look on Google or your
textbook they'll say something like the
force of movement and that really
doesn't make sense the force of movement
so my definition is the force that keeps
stuff moving okay what exactly do I mean
by that well let's go ahead and say that
you had your arm right here and let me
try to draw a hand that's pretty good
looking hand now what you're doing is
you're throwing a baseball let me draw a
quick little baseball and you're
whipping it through the air as hard as
you can well obviously the baseball is
the object that we're talking about in
the force that moves this or it's
causing to accelerate is your hand but
if someone took a picture of it when it
was in midair you would notice that this
force is no longer applied to this
baseball of course you threw it before
and you were touching it but as it's in
midair even though the force isn't
directly applied to this ball the ball
continues to move and move and move even
without the force being applied to it so
the reason that this ball keeps moving
is of course the dumb answer is of
course you threw it but the technical
physics answer is because this object
has momentum now the formula for
momentum then it's better to write out
this entire formula because you have two
things with the letter M is mass times
velocity so since mass and velocity are
directly related to momentum the faster
and more massive an object is the harder
it would be to stop so basically let's
go ahead and take two objects with the
same velocity traveling at the same rate
of speed a baseball
and a bowling ball even if both of these
were travelling into velocity of like
three meters per second the bowling ball
would be harder to stop because it was
more massive now say that you had two of
the same objects two baseball's well
baseball a was traveling at you know 80
meters per second and baseball B was
traveling at 10 meters per second
well of course baseball a would be
harder to stop because it has a faster
velocity so that's all momentum is it's
really an obvious word but they decided
they needed to put a vocabulary word on
it to I don't know just to complicate
your life a little bit more so in the
next tutorial what I'm going to do is
I'm going to show you guys an example of
the conservation of momentum and it's
really cool and probably the most famous
example in physics so you definitely
don't want to miss it and I would do in
this tutorial but you know I spent all
my time talking rambling on so I'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
