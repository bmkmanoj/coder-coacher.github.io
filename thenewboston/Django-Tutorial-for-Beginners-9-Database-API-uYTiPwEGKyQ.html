we got our table set up in our database
what I want to do now is I want to talk
to you guys about the django database
API one of the coolest things about
Django I do say that a lot like
everything is the coolest thing about
Django but I really like it so in order
to use this tool just for learning it
the best way is to open up the terminal
and I am actually going to open up this
one powershell again just because this
one can take up the entire screen and in
order to use it just go ahead and
navigate to your main directory and type
Python not my phone that would be kind
of cool word of my thumb python managed
EUI shell now this is going to look a
lot like the regular Python shell but
again the regular Python shell that you
may have used is just Python shell once
you type Python manage it up py shell
that's going to give you the special
Django database API shell so again it
gives us this little prompt and now what
we can do is we can start writing
database commands and we're going to
learn a bunch of them but what we're
going to be doing is since in the last
video we made the tables for album and
song so right now in the database we
have two tables we actually have a bunch
of them that Django created himself but
what we did is we created two tables and
the album table has four columns artist
album title genre and a logo and song
has an album column a file type and a
song title now they actually have some
other columns and will talk to you or
I'll talk to you about those in a second
but anytime you want to use those models
you actually need to import them just
like you do in regular Python code so
for music dot models go ahead and import
album come on Bucky I know you can spell
it and song alright now that we have
those models imported we can go ahead
and start performing some functions on
them so right now I just want to see all
of the items that are in the album table
so if I go album objects all then look
at that
nothing alright so obviously we don't
have any items in there because we did
add any so let's go ahead and do that
right now so just go ahead and make a
variable called a and set this equal to
a new album object so this is just a
regular Python object and if we look at
album the album class has four
attributes artist album title genre and
album logo so you can just go ahead and
add them like this so artists I'll say
Taylor Swift and was the next one album
title I think she had a album title
named bread and what is her genre
country actually don't know if that
album in this country but in this
tutorial is now for album logo again
later on I'm going to be showing you
guys how to actually upload photos and
how to store those files on your server
and how to store the file path in your
database so you can use in your code but
for right now I did not do that
so what we're going to do just for now
is go ahead and grab any image off the
Internet and I got this one and this
isn't actually on the logo for the album
because I didn't want to get sued in
these tutorials this is actually just I
don't even know if this is an image of
me like my face or the New Boston logo
but whatever just go ahead and hit enter
and now we have this object in memory so
what we need to do after this is we
actually need to save this to the
database because right now is just in
the shells memory so how do we do that
just go ahead and hit a dot save so this
is a function that actually takes it and
saves whatever object this is which is
this album to the dad base now another
cool thing is you know how I said that
right now we have one album in there and
it has all these columns so if we just
want to you know print one out we can
just go a artist Taylor Swift a album
title red now we can do that for every
column but I also said that we had
have another one that automatically gets
added called the primary key or ID now
some people call it a primary key and
some people call it an ID or a unique ID
and you can actually see that Django
lets you call it whatever you want so if
you want to just refer to as ID or
primary key
it doesn't matter these are literally
the exact same thing they point to the
same thing so there you go so now you
see that we have one item in our
database this is how we created it and
this item has artist album title genre
album logo and also a unique ID so the
next album that we add to our table it's
going to have the ID 2 ID 3 so on and so
forth so let's go ahead and just add
another one real quick and I'll show you
guys another way to do it so I'm just
going to name this one B maybe I'll name
it album 2 now just keep it B whatever
so you can also do something like this
you can create an empty album and then
with that album you can go ahead and
just say artist equals there's actually
a band a pretty cool band in my school
when I was growing up my high school
gone myth so I'll stick with them now
what is the other attribute album title
actually don't even know what the album
title was I'll name it high school and
genre I'll say punk and their album logo
let me just go ahead online define our
alright so this is just the image of me
and my sister but that will work for now
so again whenever you create an object
you can do so in one of two ways you can
just pass everything in through the
constructor or you can just create a
blank object without any attributes and
then add them all manually anyways at
the end whenever you're done with
everything what we can do is just write
be save so that saves this object to the
database
so just like before we still have a
artist which is Taylor Swift B artist
which is myth and if we ever wanted to
change one of these attributes for
example I'm like oh actually I just
remembered that they did have a album
title and it wasn't called high school
it was called middle school then we can
go ahead and save that as well so look
at that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
