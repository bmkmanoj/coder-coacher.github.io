congruent angles and congruent angles
are just angles that have equal measures
and we measure angles in degrees so we
have right here angle ABC and if we
measured it we would find that the
measure of angle ABC is about 63 degrees
and over here we have angle D EF and if
you measured that you would find out
that that is about 63 degrees as well so
since the measure of angle ABC equals
the measure of angle D EF we can say
that angle ABC and angle D EF are
congruent angles okay so now that we
know that we're gonna go onto something
else which is called the addition
property of angles so we have Ray I n
which is this one directional line right
here and it lies between ray I M and Ray
I K so that means that the measure of
angle mi n plus the measure of angle n I
K equals the measure of this entire
angle which makes sense because if you
add up the parts of something you're
going to get the total of the whole so
say I know that the measure of M I n is
equal to 63 degrees and I know that the
measure of n I K is equal to 55 degrees
I can take each one of those parts and
add them together in order to get what
the whole angle is equal to and if you
add 63 plus 55 you get a hundred and
eighteen degrees
so therefore the measure of angle M I K
is equal to 118 degrees okay so now that
we know that we're gonna do a couple
examples using these two properties okay
so I know that angle QR T is equal to 62
degrees if the measure of angle TRS
which is this angle right here is equal
to 43 degrees what is the measure of
this whole angle so I can take 62 plus
43 and I get a hundred and five so the
big angle angle Q RS is equal to a
hundred and five so for number two I
know that the measure of h IJ which is
this entire angle is 138 and I know that
the measure of this part angle H I K is
equal to 30 degrees so what is the
measure of K of angle K IJ which is this
part right here so since I know the
measure of the total I can take the sum
of the parts
and set it equal to 138 with X being the
measure of this angle so if I subtract
38 from 138 I'm gonna find out what the
other part equals which is a hundred so
therefore the measure of angle K IJ is
equal to a hundred degrees that's using
the same property I'm just doing the
opposite okay so now we have one more
example example three angle ABC and
angle CBD are congruent if measure of
angle ABC or excuse me measure of angle
abd is equal to 120 what is the measure
of angle a B what is the measure of
angle ABC and CBD well since these two
angles are congruent that means that
they have the same measure so if we let
the measure of ABC equal x equals x we
can take 2x and set it to the total
because these two angles represent two
equal parts of the whole angle so to
find out what each angle equals we can
just take 120 and divide it by 2
and you'll find that each angle equals
60 degrees
okay so now that you know the properties
of angles be sure to watch the next
video which will go over special angle
pairs and how they relate to one another</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
