tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and today
we're going to be using a path fill an
area of the image for example we're
going to fill in this screen here with
an image so we can put our picture on
the on the TV screen so open up anything
you want and go ahead and start making
your path and I'm going to make it the
size of the TV screen I'm going to zoom
in and it's I'll just do this real quick
and I'm not going to try to be like
really perfect and there we go so I've
got my path there and that's basically
the same size as this screen so what
we're going to do is we're going to go
in to fill this path so let's go to the
paths panel and you can see you have
your work path there let's go up to the
path options and then go to fill path
now we can use a foreground color we can
use a pattern if we wanted to we can
yeah there's a bunch of things that we
could use background color colors other
things so I'm just going to select
pattern and let's see if I got any like
any patterns here's some static that
might work well hit OK and now you can
see on my TV screen that I've got static
now you're going to want if you want
other stuff you want to import your
patterns and you can check out the
tutorial on that that has was a while
back so that's actually pretty easy but
there were a bunch more other options on
there so let's go to those so fill path
and then we've got our options here
we've got our different blending modes
and this is how it's going to blend in
with the with the image we've got our
opacity here so if I brought the opacity
down
hit okay the opacity went down a little
can't really tell that much on that one
and then we've got our rendering down
here actually we've got this box here
that says preserved transparency and
what that does is it protects any
transparent areas in the image like this
background and everything like that so
we've got rendering down here we've got
our feather radius and that can go from
0 to 250 and it feathers the edge so if
I put on 25 or something like that we
got that anti-alias here it softens the
fill and down here we've got the
scripted patterns here which is new for
the pet it's for the oil that's for the
pattern option so if I take it off
pattern it's not on there if I go back
to pattern it is on there and we've got
our different types of scripted patterns
and you can pick one of these to see how
it's applied I'll just do spiral and see
what that looks like and hit OK and you
can see that the path is applied and
like a kind of spirally way let's go
back to it and obviously that's not good
for the TV we don't want it to be
spirally so hit fill path and you can
see on the edges how the the feather
radius affected this and the it blended
on top of the edge so I obviously I
don't want this because I got a hard
edge but if you have something that
doesn't have a hard edge on it then you
want to use that feather radius so let's
try something like brick fill and see
what that does now that's what brick
fill does or we can just take it off and
keep on what we just had which probably
looks the best so there we go we've got
um you now know a way how to make a
and then fill that path with whatever
you wanted to use so that's it for this
tutorial and the next tutorial we're
going to learn how to use this stroke
path and be sure to stay tuned for that
one so thanks a lot for watching you
guys and have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
