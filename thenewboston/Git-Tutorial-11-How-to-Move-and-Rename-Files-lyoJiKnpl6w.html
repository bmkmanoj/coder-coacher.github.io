commands I want to go over is first how
to rename files and second how to move
files around so it's pretty easy you
know if you just do it through your
desktop but with git it's a little
confusing but first let's just go ahead
and actually just rename one of these
files so say that we're working with
this first right here but actually what
we can do is this is going to be the
home page of our website and as we know
all home pages you named index are
actually just the name at home you can
do that too so right now we named first
two home okay well we just did it in a
Windows Explorer let's see what get
thinks about that so if you do get
status and hit enter it says okay what
you pretty much did what get things we
did is not rename but it actually thinks
that we deleted this first text file and
added another file called home right
here and if you think about it that is
kind of what we did whenever we rename a
file we delete the first one and we add
the exact same file with a new name so I
mean it's not like it is wrong it's just
you know looking at it look in the world
of a different kind of way so what we
can do right near right now wow I cannot
talk today right near what the heck does
that even mean so let's just go ahead
and now play get silly game and it says
okay if you want to look at it that way
then we'll just go ahead and get add
home
texts and we can also get remove first
text and whenever we do that it pretty
much looks at it like get those so now
when we do get status and hit enter it
goes oh okay I see what you did now you
actually didn't delete first text and
then add a new file called home you just
renamed it so now it's saying I always
read this Oh branch master like I'm the
master or something but and that's not
what I'm saying
basically it realizes that you just
renamed a file and now once it realizes
that we can go ahead and commit our
changes so get commit with a message
renamed a first thought text to home dot
txt hit enter and there you go so you're
saying all right that was a that is how
you rename files it was kind of
confusing well yes it was and you know
it is kind of like us and get we're on
two different wavelengths so I'm going
to show you guys a really easy way to
rename files so let's just pick a file
let's go ahead and rename the second txt
file right now so the really easy way to
do it is this get MB now what MV means
is move however whenever we move second
text file to let's just name it um
putting dot text whenever we remove or
excuse me whenever we move one file to
another file with a different name and
hit enter check this out what it does is
it's basically armed renaming it so in
get just remember that moving a file is
pretty much the same thing is renaming
it kind of confusing but uh you know
that's one way to look at it and that is
also a really
really easy way to rename files so check
this out this command get move one file
name other file name was a lot easier
than doing all this crap right here so
um I guess uh I guess I have time to
show you one other thing and that is how
do you move it into a folder or how to
move well let me show you guys what I'm
talking about
so um say that this putting text file is
actually a love note to my crush and her
name is Patricia pudding
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
make a new folder and I'm going to call
this love notes alright so what I want
to do right now is add this pudding file
in this love notes folder alright so
let's go ahead and do that baby let me
delete all this so what we can do is we
can just put get move or was is not
third anymore you guys hear that
I apologize every time I do video like
my neighbors decide to like trim their
hedges and cut down trees and do the
loudest possible things they can think
of anyways let's go ahead and move
putting text and we want to move it to
love notes slash um what we can just
keep it name the same thing or if we
want to rename it and move it at the
same time we can do that as well
paty text because remember my crushes
name was patty pudding Patricia pudding
whatever the heck I said so basically
what we're going to do is we're going to
take this file move it in love notes and
give it a new name let me just go ahead
and delete that
so whenever I hit enter that's what it
does so as you can see we no longer have
the pudding file but we now okay
I got to pause this for a second okay
I had to freakin close my windows
ticking me off so where was I basically
what we did pretty self-explanatory
moved it into a new folder and change
the name of it and now the only thing we
have left to do is actually let's go
ahead and get the status first says you
rename this file while pretty much out
moving it into a new folder and if we
just do git commit or much could be
renamed file and uh mmm let's say put in
love notes folder hit enter and bam so
that's how you do that mmm
sorry so that's how you rename files
that's how you move them around move
them in the same folder or move them in
other folders and that's pretty much it
I mean to be honest we covered the
basics right there um so in the next
tutorial I think we're ready to step up
our game
so it's going to be a little more
complex but uh hey if we want to be pros
it-get then we gotta learn all the stuff
so I think as for watching it next video
is going to be freaking awesome see you
then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
