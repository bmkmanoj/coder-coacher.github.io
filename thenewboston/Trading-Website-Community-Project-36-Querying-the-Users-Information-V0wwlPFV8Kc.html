guys sorry if you know I sound a little
funny in this tutorial because I got a
strawberry in my teeth because you know
I decided that I needed my fruit
servings for the day so I had a
strawberry pop-tart but anyways that's
not important what we are here to do is
set the user and make them able to log
in so we already pretty much have the
interface taken care of now we just have
to take care of the code and guys you
guys are going to love me because I'm
going to cheat big time now check this
out what the register page did and I
know I'm talking about the register page
is it basically took a bunch of form
input and it submitted it and with that
input it ran a little bit of code in
this case registered the user well the
login page is going to do a lot of the
same thing the user needs to use a form
and needs the validate the username and
password and then once the information
is validated then they can run just a
little bit of code so what I'm going to
do is this check it out for this if is
set form this is all your form handling
script right here so this is another
code trick whenever you just click right
here in PHP you see this curly bracket
how it turned red if you scroll all the
way down the ending curly bracket that
you know what's it's gone syncs up with
it I guess is the best term terms turns
red as well so go ahead and select all
of this form that up and copy that and
once you have that copied you can go
ahead and close out of the register dot
PHP page because we are done using and
abusing it we just needed to use it to
steal its crap now check it out paste
all of that information in here so
pretty much right now we have the
register dot PHP forum handling in the
login PHP page however even though they
are similar they aren't the exact same
the first and major difference is while
the login page does work with the
username and password you don't enter
your email whenever you log in so that's
what we need to do
take this email validation out of here
completely now if we take a little bit
closer look all of this code is perfect
already it says okay whenever you submit
the login form we're going to build that
error ray and we're going to validate
your username and password just like we
did the rope with the register page but
instead of running all this code because
all this code right here is what you
want to happen whenever you have a new
user and they register for the website
for the first time so go ahead and
delete all of that and well we might as
well add a little comment because login
code here so this is pretty much the
only code that we need to change with
one exception and that's this thing
right here if I am correct then prompt
actually let me just go ahead and open
this rope real quick because I kind of
forgot what is this x equals 2 yep right
here this error message is specific to
the register page that email address or
username has already been a registered
so obviously we need to change this
error message right here so what's going
to happen is we want to change this
error message just to say okay if you
messed up the login form we'll just give
them a simple message that says username
or password is not correct you are
unable to login or something like that
so what we need to do is of course echo
out an error message now we don't use
the echo statement because that would
just print it out on the top of the
screen above all the HTML what we need
to do is we need to set that error
message equal to a bit of code so go
ahead and just copy that I probably
shouldn't even copy that but anyways and
span class air and in that span and I
probably should have some breaks at the
end should I yeah bro should
and I'm just doing this again because
that error message that we had before
was specific to the register page and
this one is for the login page so what
do we want to say if they mess up let's
just go ahead and say um username or
password is incorrect and this is the
message that can is going to pop up if
they mess anything up so again unlike
before where if their username and
password were valid then we ran the code
to pretty much register them for the
website what we want to do in this
instance is log them in so how do we log
a user in to use the website well the
very first thing we need to do is we
need to query the user stable because
that's where all the permanent users
information is now if they already are
registered for the website website then
their username and their password should
be in that users table so let's go ahead
and make a result variable and this is
going to be equal to you guys have
probably seen this before actually I
should probably copy it I'm Way too lazy
okay this is like ultra laziness right
here I can't even like type one line
without having to copy it all right so
instead of this little queer right here
that i copied from register dot PHP page
what i'm going to do is query the
database select all from the users table
where the username is equal to whatever
username they entered for the login page
i'm basically going to say query the
users table where users username is
equal to Bucky and password is equal to
password now hopefully we should only
get one result back because you know
more than what people can't have the
same username so just do a little copy
and paste in here where username is
equal to the username they entered and
password is equal to the password they
enter and hopefully if anything if
everything ran successfully we should
get one row of information back we
should get there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
