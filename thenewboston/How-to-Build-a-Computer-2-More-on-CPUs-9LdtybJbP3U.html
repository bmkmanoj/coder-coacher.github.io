again we talked about the brand that's
just pretty much a personal choice there
are being different articles where
different people say that one brain is
better than the other but just try to
decide that for yourself the next thing
I want to talk to you guys about is the
speed of the CPU and this is one of the
main things people look for when buying
the CPU now the faster the speed of the
processor the faster is going to process
information and therefore the fastest
your computer is faster computers now
the speed of the CPU is going to be
measured in gigahertz now just to give
you guys kind of a range of what you're
going to come across anything between
1.5 and about 2 gigahertz is going to be
good for like browsing the Internet in
typing documents like in Microsoft Word
and stuff anything between 2 and 3
gigahertz is pretty much suitable for
small games or if you're going to be
using your computer pretty often and a
little bit bigger bigger programs in
Microsoft Word now anything above 3
gigahertz on your CPU now you can get
into the big games and you can start
editing photos and video and things like
that but if you're going to be working
with editing photos or playing huge
games I won't go any lower than 3 so now
that we got the speed in the brain the
next major important thing I want to
talk you guys about is the socket of
your CPU now this isn't really important
as far as performance goes but making
sure it's compatible with your
motherboard it's very important now what
the socket is is pretty much 2 pin
configuration you don't really have to
know about too much about pin
configuration but you just pretty much
have to know that your socket has to
match up with your motherboard and in
this case I'm going to be used
am ii socket so when I bought my
motherboard I needed to look for a
motherboard that supported an AM to
socket now the last fine consideration
I'm going to talk to you guys about is
my favorite it's my most exciting one
it's the cores and what this is is
pretty much how many CPUs are packed
into one CPU and I know it sounds
complicated but that's pretty much what
it is the most common types of course
are your single core CPU which is the
baseline CPU dual core which is pretty
much two processors packed into one in
the quad core which is just a beast
of CPU now what the benefits of multiple
cores have is the more cores you have
the more applications you can run at
once
and therefore you don't have to wait for
other applications and load and it just
makes your computer run a whole lot
faster so again you're buying
considerations brand speed faster better
socket make sure it's compatible with
your motherboard and course the more the
better now in our build today we're
going to be working with an AMD which is
the brand Athlon 64 X it's 64 x2 which
is pretty much you just have to know
that is compatible with your motherboard
2.0 gigahertz
that's our speed we're going to be
working with a dual-core and an AM 2
socket now the thing is I have to make
sure that they're compatible with my
motherboard AMD I need to make sure I
got AMD motherboard Athlon 64 x2 that's
the type it's kind of like Ford Mustang
or for a Taurus this is the Mustang or
the Taurus this little part that is so
that and I'm going to be working with a
am2 socket so again socket type the
brand and the a.m. - whatever it is so
now we got our CPU picked out we're
ready to move on to choosing our
motherboard so make sure to watch my
next tutorial and make sure to subscribe
to my channel to get all my latest
videos so I hope you learn something and
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
