let's see what number it is a sixth I
believe I forget this up I forget this
more than I should but welcome to your
sixth MySQL tutorial and in this lesson
we're going to be going over the Select
statement a little bit more because in
the last couple tutorials what I did is
I told you guys how to retrieve one
piece of information using the Select
statement for example I taught you guys
how to retrieve that name or you could
retrieve the city and if you wanted to
retrieve more than one piece of
information you would have to write
multiple select statements or do you
well let me go ahead and show you guys
this first you can retrieve more than
one column in the same select statement
for example let's say you want to
retrieve name and zip code from
customers well you go ahead and write
name and then go ahead and write a comma
and then write the additional piece of
information you want to retrieve so as
you can see using just one select
statement it's easier than using you
know two or three just separate the
columns you want to retrieve with a
comma now let me go ahead and type this
then explain something now one very
important thing that you want to keep
note of is this whenever you retrieve
multiple select statements you don't put
a comma after the last one I see people
do this a lot and it's a mistake so for
example since we're retrieving two
pieces of information that means we
would use one less comma so one if we
retrieved all of these what are those
six columns then that means we would use
five commas so that's through one less
comma than columns remember that never
put a comma over the last one so let me
go ahead and copy this first then hit go
and check it out it now retrieves both
the name and zip in the exact same
select statement we don't need multiple
select statements so that would save you
having to type a whole bunch of select
statements however let's go ahead and
take a look at this customers table
again let's say that you know okay
our boss wants us to retrieve all of the
information in this table so we say okay
boss I mean go ahead and write your
script that can do that ID we would
write something like this select ID
comma name
name come address comma City take a
break here go eat some lunch comma stay
commas if that can take a whole lot of
time and whenever we type more than one
columns then the chance that we're going
to make a err greatly increases so let
me show you guys a little trick instead
of writing every single column whenever
you need to retrieve all of the data you
can just go ahead and write this little
asterisk now this is formally called the
wild-card like symbol or whatever so I
call that the asterisks or the all
statement it's that little key above the
a on your keyboard but if you're in
school and you're taking a test make
sure the call the wild-card statement so
basically what this means is whenever
you need to retrieve all of the columns
you can just go ahead and write this
little asterisks and it just is like a
shortcut so now let me go ahead and hit
go and check it out it retrieves all of
the columns and all of the rows from
Roache ever table you specify now I want
to mention this I know I didn't talk to
you guys about how to use MySQL with PHP
or whenever you're making websites or in
any type of application actually but
whenever you do you can do something
like this you can retrieve all of this
or excuse me all of the data that you
want to using MySQL and only display
what you need in your application and by
application I mean you can go ahead and
retrieve all this data but only display
the name and City on your website or
something
so a lot of people just use this
statement all the time select all from
customers and then they worry about what
information they want to show the user
later on but I want to say this don't do
that please that is a big mistake that
beginners do only use what is absolutely
necessary because if you do this
whenever you select all of the
information and you don't even use some
of the information then it's going to
slow down your query or the execution of
this MySQL script well it's not really
important and this one because this is a
relatively small table but whenever
you're working with a whole bunch of
data with a whole bunch of users it can
cause significant problems and it could
slow down the website
for people it could run into you can
have something called mysql' slow
queries and then whoever your host is
for example hostgator would start
limiting my bandwidth so guys i just
want to say even though you can retrieve
a whole bunch of data and only display
what's necessary to the user please
don't do this please
only select what is ever necessary and
only uses special shortcut whenever you
absolutely need to so I know I talked
about that for a while but guys it's a
very important more important than I
could stress oh so anyways thank you I
need to go get a drink of water or
something so anyways I'm going to save
the rest of the information for the next
tutorial so like I said thank you guys
for watching and subscribing I'll see
you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
