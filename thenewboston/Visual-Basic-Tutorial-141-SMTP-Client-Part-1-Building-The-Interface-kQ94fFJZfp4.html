slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're gonna be
making a program that will send emails
using SMTP so let's go ahead and create
a new project and get started so we'll
select a windows forms application and
we will name it mail client go ahead and
click OK and wait for that to load ok so
now once that's loaded we're going to
open up our toolbox let's add some stuff
to our form so we'll add some labels so
we're gonna have label from you're gonna
have to input your password for your
email account and then we've got to
you've got subject and then we've got
the body so let's just go ahead and set
the text value for each of these so from
password
to subject and body okay so now let's
move these down a little bit and we will
add some text boxes so we will add one
for each one of these labels so we've
got from password
to
subject and then the body so we'll make
the body of it multiline by just
clicking this arrow and selecting
multi-line and let's go ahead and we
will move some stuff around here to make
better use of our form so
okay so let's drag the body up here and
then make that a little bit bigger and
then we'll start adding the code to our
form and now I need to add one more
button when you add a button that says
send so we will change it to will change
the text to send and then we will set
the name to button send let's go ahead
and add another button so they can reset
the fields without having to go through
and doing it themselves
so we'll do button reset fields and we
will just set the text to discard
make sure that these buttons are the
same sizes
okay so now we've created the user
interface for our email client so what
are the title of form 1 - email client
okay so now let's go ahead and double
click on email client to open up public
class form 1 let's just go ahead and get
rid of for more load because we're not
going to be using that now let's go
ahead and come down here and what we're
going to do we're gonna have to do to
use email is import system dot net dot
mail so this is our mail namespace that
has everything we're going to need to
send emails now let's go ahead and
create two objects so private my message
as new message so it's a Windows message
which him be used to send email messages
and let's go ahead and make this a mail
message instead of a message sorry I
messed that up there and now we're going
to need to do is create an SMTP client
so SMTP sender as new and now what we're
going to use is the SMTP client so we're
going to create a new SMTP client and
they says allows applications to send
email by using the Simple Mail Transfer
Protocol so that's what SMTP stands for
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol ok so in
this tutorial we set up the user
interface for our email client and we
went ahead and created two objects so go
ahead and do this if you haven't already
I highly suggest that you do everything
we do in their tutorials it'll help you
learn a lot better and a lot faster and
once you've done that go ahead and move
on to the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
