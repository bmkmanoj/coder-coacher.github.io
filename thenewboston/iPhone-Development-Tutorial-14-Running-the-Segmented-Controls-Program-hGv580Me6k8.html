development tutorial and in this story
we're going to be finishing up this
segment and control switch is whatever
you name this program that we're
building i named my project bacon too by
the way so let's go ahead and open up
interface builder make sure you got
everything built right you don't have
any errors in your code first because
you know that would not be good so the
first thing that we want to add is a
segment in control and the symbol for
this is this little one to button so go
ahead and grab it and drag yours over on
the screen and put it anywhere you want
now these first and second those titles
are you know they're pretty good but you
know I'm still tempted to go ahead and
change this one to switches and change
this one to button that's a tid bit
better make it more easier on our users
so now once you're done that go ahead
and select the segment of control as a
whole and we want to add the action to
it that we built for it so go ahead and
make sure your control connections is
popped up or your connections inspector
whatever you name it and where it says
value change that little circle go ahead
and drag this all the way over to files
owner and the method we built for the
segment of control is the main control
switched so then whenever we click this
in any way that method called main
control switch is going to be called and
it pretty much controls what the hide
and what the show on your program so
after this of course we need two
switches so here are your switches right
here go ahead and add one right there
and go ahead and add another one right
there look pretty good right there so
now what do we need to do well we need
to go ahead and add those outlets to the
switches so go ahead and select file
owner control drag and this one is the
left switch of course actually it really
doesn't matter and control drag this one
is the right switch pretty cool alright
so we got that done but now what we want
to do before we add anything else is
screwed since the button is going to be
covering this up and we might have
trouble accessing
later go ahead and select this and in
your connections inspector what we want
to hit is value change make sure it is
selected all right what we want to go is
value changed drag over files owner and
the method we have this is switched
changed so we did that for left switch
now select your rights which connections
inspector switch over value change so
any time you switch either then switches
the method called switch change is going
to be called and remember all the switch
change method is if you hit this one it
changes this one too if you hit this one
it changes this one too pretty cool huh
so now these switches are good to go we
added the outlets we added the action
method so now all we have to do is add
that big old button to the screen so go
ahead and here is your symbol for a
round rectangle button go ahead and you
can add this over right over your
switches pretty sweet huh so since
either one of these either the button or
the switches is going to be hidden at a
time then that's why you're allowed to
add things on top of each other and
that's kind of the beauty of segmented
controls you can add objects on top of
each other if you have limited screen
space and well I mean it's pretty
obvious save space by having a segment
of control button so now what is the
first thing we want to do well let's go
ahead and add the title of this like I
am a button pretty sweet title so now
what we want to do is make this button
hidden by default I mean we have code
later on once you start clicking buttons
to either hide or show it but by default
as soon as your program starts up we
want this button and be hidden so go
ahead and select your button and in your
attributes inspector go ahead and under
your drawing drawing menu I guess is
called there is attribute called hidden
make sure this is checked and now your
button is going to appear below your
switches so that's how you know that
it's hidden so now what do we need to do
from here well remember we have an
outlet to control this bun so go ahead
and in your files owner
control drag to your button and make
sure it's not over switch make sure it's
over that round rectangle button go
ahead and attach the button outlet to it
so now are we done no one more teeny
thing in your connections inspector make
sure you have your button selected that
I saw a clip for let me sit yep all
right now that you have your button
selected what you need to do is whenever
you tap this button we want to call that
method called pause em at button pressed
I think so go ahead and touch up inside
drag it over 250 owner and yep is called
button pressed so now whenever we press
this button it's going to call that
method button press and remember we
didn't write any code for this we're
going to be doing this in Mexico puts
Orioles but that is pretty much how you
connect I mean your action to the button
you knew this before so now I mean
everything should be good to go so go
ahead file save and in your Xcode build
and run and let's see what's going on
let's see if our segment and control
works first switches button alright this
works now let's see if our switch change
method works on off sweet let's see if
this one awesome awesome and hopefully
whenever we click our button nothing
happens awesome amazing so here's what's
going on this segment of control button
what action is handling this well it
actually is this method right here main
control switch whenever you click this
the index is going to be set to zero so
that is why the switches show and
everything else is hidden and when you
click button as you can see button
hidden it's no longer hidden but the
switch is left and right they're both
hidden so yes so then you say alright
well when you click these switches right
here click my iPhone simulator and
really my computer just froze for like
half a second all right now i'm lagging
or something there we go so whenever we
click these switches what methods
control these it switches change methods
right here and what does is it get
whatever switch you clicked
sets it equal to my switch it says did
you click it on or off if you clicked on
I'm going to turn both of them on if we
click the off I'm in turn both of them
off and that's how this works so that's
the basics of this program and the next
tutorials we're going to be enhancing
this program anymore and actually adding
some functionality this button press
method so yeah thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe if you
have any questions just ask me on my
forum and I will definitely answer for
you guys and I also you know I think I'm
going to call that girl from the grocery
store and yeah I'll tell you guys how
that goes to so anyways thanks for
watching and I'll talk to you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
