photoshop project and in this project
i'm going to be teaching guys how to
take an ordinary image such as this one
and make it like a spooky ghost image
and this is what people do a lot of the
time when they're trying make a fake
picture of a ghost then just to put on
the internet get a lot of you so i just
wanted to show you guys that a lot of
these images aren't real and by a lot of
them i mean all of them and here's what
they do to create images like that first
they take a normal image like i have
right here there's a to my friends you
set a party they probably get a better
image of this like a small child or
someone creepy like that and the first
thing they do is go ahead and turn it
into a black and white image since uh
you know ghosts aren't very colorful so
to do this the easiest way is to hold
down your control and shift key and
press the you capital u or lowercase u
whatever so hold down ctrl shift press
you on your keyboard the next thing
you're going to want to do once you have
this black-and-white layer is go ahead
and copy it now you can do that by
dragging it down or right click on it
and pressing copy or duplicate I mean so
from now on we're going to be working
with our layer 1 copy and make sure you
don't get rid of this original layer
because we're going to be using it later
so make sure you're on your layer 1 copy
and we're going to be adding a motion
blur to this so on your layer 1 go up to
filter blur and from here we want to go
to motion blur which is right down here
now as you can see in your preview right
here you want it to be kind of you want
to be able to know what's going on
around it but at the same time you want
it blurry enough to a see that you can't
see the original image so go around I
say it mine 188 you can say yours in
werd 150 from 250 I think those look the
best now go ahead and press ok and as
you can see your copy of your layer is
blurred but your original layer right
here is the same now the next thing we
want to do is show parts of this layer
which is the same through the layer 1
copy so to do this go ahead and make
sure your layer 1 copy selected and go
ahead and click this button right here
what this is going to do is add a layer
mask get rid of this and what a layer
mask is is it it allows you to take away
parts of this layer to see through to
this layer so make sure your mask is
selected and go ahead over this
paintbrush right here now once you have
your paintbrush anything you paint on
your mass that's black it takes away
from the image so make sure you have
black is your foreground have your brush
and make sure your breasts isn't hard
like one of these make sure it's faded
like one of these and now we can go
ahead and start painting now what I'm
going to do before you even start is go
ahead and turn my opacity way down to
about nine or ten and now we just want
to paint so we see a little bit of his
face through the smoke and this is how
people can take pictures and say I took
a picture of volos all blurry but I saw
this ghost through the smoke so now once
we can tell that there's a face there
another thing that I like to do is a
make my mask even smaller my brush size
I mean and go over and paint over the
eyes since I like to see his face kind
of but I really like to see those eyes
since up they kind of give that spooky
the eyes are focus in and looking at
your kind of effect so now that let me
just minimize this so I can show you
guys what it looks like we have a
blurred image with a faint face in the
looker
in the background with a I sticking out
so now it's a getting kind of spooky in
a little more believable like a right
now it's like oh I try to take this
camera but I was kind of moving around
but all I saw was his face kind of
looking at me so that's how people do
that and once you're there another thing
that you can add is filter with a
diffuse glow so go up the filter and go
down to glow where are ya let me find
where it is filter here we go distort
diffuse glow oops make sure you're on
your image not your mask so filter
distort diffuse glow and you can adjust
the graininess right here I want to
leave my right about four I want to give
mine a little bit of glow and this
pretty much just brings out the
highlights and let's just fade that just
tip it right there so I got 5 4 and 16
and what this does is just bring out the
highlights and on give that eerie shiny
looking effect now once we have this the
last thing that's optional that we can
do is add a kind of a green mist over it
not to do this go down here and select
new fill layer and click solid color now
you see I have yellow I want to go down
to a green and get kind of a medium not
too dark not too light so you have a
green right ahead of all your layers
right here on a very top most layer and
we're going to want to set your opacity
down to about I say 20 and now once you
have that you're finally complete so
this is a green layer right here this is
what some people add when they say that
they tried to take a picture of a ghost
using night vision or something like
that or they're at a swamp or something
and it was all green misty so now you
have a spooky image
green and you can see his face in his
eyes showing through the background so
that my friends is how people make fake
ghost images to put online or just want
to try to get a bunch of views they're
trying to stir up a bunch of con for
controversy or something like that so I
just wanted to show you guys how to do
it let all you guys sleep easy let you
know that they aren't real it's easy to
do so I hope you guys learned something
and remember if you like my tutorials
