biology tutorial and in this video I
want to talk to you guys about the last
part of cellular respiration it's called
the electron transport chain it's
actually the process that makes up the
majority of your ATP so most of your
energy that you you know you have in
your cells is gonna come from this
process so pretty freakin important so
let me go ahead and before I get into
the detail of all the different
molecules and how you know your cell
actually creates these new ATP's I want
to go ahead and show you guys where this
process is going to take place
so let me go ahead and draw a
mitochondria sweet-looking mitochondria
and of course it has the outer membrane
and I'll draw the inner membrane right
here and inside your inner membrane of
course is that fluid called the matrix
just like the movie except not as
exciting so there's your matrix right
here and remember that I said that this
right here is the outer membrane and
this yellow squiggly line is the inner
membrane now so far the two parts of
cellular respiration glycolysis and the
Krebs cycle all of that crap has been
going on in the matrix the very inside
of the mitochondria however the electron
transport chain is basically a process
and I'm going to be talking about
several different molecules those
molecules those proteins I'm gonna be
talking about are actually embedded
right on the inner membrane so I'm gonna
be basically drawing a diagram that's
assumed a portion of this so remember
these proteins and molecules come I'm
going to be drawing are actually
embedded right on or in the inner
membrane so another thing I want to
point out before I draw my diagram is
that this membrane right here this
yellow line is actually a bilayer so
just like your cell membrane and
actually has two layers hence the word
bilayer so now let's go ahead and zoom
up on this part let me draw our new
diagram and we can begin talking about
the process of basically the electron
transport chain so let me go ahead and
draw alright so here's my bilayer right
here and of course this is the
matrix and this is the space between the
inner membrane and outer membrane and
right now we already know that in our
matrix we've got a bunch of different
crap we got in a DHS and let's see we
got some hydrogen ions so you see I draw
those blue these plus will be positively
charged hydrogen ions let's see we got
some oxygen Oh - OH - OH - remember the
matrix is pretty much fluid filled up
with a bunch of different crap and I'm
drawing that crap right now because you
know not because I like drawing even
though I do but it's actually pretty
important later on so you also got some
a DP dress some that crap right there a
DP and remember to make ADP ATP we need
one of these phosphates all right so
that's enough crap for right now let's
go ahead and talk about the process
itself so basically the very first thing
that happens is we're going to start
with this NADH now on this NADH are
electrons so these yellow little stars
will call electrons now these electrons
are going to be passed to a new molecule
and this new molecule is called NADH
dehydrogenase and so we'll say that this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
