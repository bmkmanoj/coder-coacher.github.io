lighting setup we're ready to hop into
kismet and start putting all the pieces
together so the very first thing we want
to do is select this light right here
and this is the light that's going to be
taking the damage so go ahead and hop
into kismet all right click and hit new
event using enter Pachter to take damage
now first of all let's go ahead and bump
this damage threshold down to let's say
10 actually let's go ahead and save five
so basically whenever we shoot it then
this output is going to fire so the very
first thing we need to do is again
remember from last Orioles I said we're
going to be replacing this light which
is the glowing light with this light
which is the busted out light so go
ahead and we need an object to symbolize
this light so select that light right
click and hit new object variable using
inter bacter to now we're going to be
having a bunch of variables so it's
probably a good idea to comment these
and just put like lit up light looks
pretty good and now we need an object to
symbolize this right here so go ahead
and select that and right click new
object and we'll just go ahead and write
um busted light so now this object
symbolizes this and this object
symbolizes this and remember by default
as soon as we start our level this is
visible right here and this is hidden so
just keep that in mind so now what we
need is a way to toggle this off and
this on and remember from tutorial like
52 or 50 or something we can do that by
adding a new action toggle toggle hidden
and this pretty much toggles between the
visibility whether something is hidden
or unhidden so now let me go ahead and
drag that over and I'm just going to go
ahead and hit toggle because if you hit
hide it's going to make both of these
disappear if you hit unhide it's going
to be make both of them appear if you
hit toggle it's going to change the
state's boom so when we toggle this one
since it's on by default it's going to
hide it
and since we toggle this one since it's
off by default it's going to make up
here pretty cool huh so that is where
toggle comes in handy now let me just go
ahead and actually select both of these
and move them down a little bit and I
guess I might as well play my level
right now to show you guys before I move
on the next step I'm going to have play
from here and look what happens actually
let me get a kind of better view that's
probably a better view now by default
this is I don't know what's it called
unhidden visible and this is hidden over
here so now let me go ahead and shoot
this and look what happens this one
hides and this one appears pretty cool
huh so now let's hop back into kismet
and get a better view in my perspective
view and we want to change a couple more
things the very first thing we want to
do is we want to show off this spotlight
so in order to do that we need to go
ahead and I guess we can do this first
go ahead and add a new object variable
and this of course represents the
spotlight I think that's pretty apparent
we don't need to comment that so if you
just go ahead and drag that over here
and now what we need to do is toggle
this now toggle hidden is for making
things visible and invisible but
whenever you're toggling lights you just
need a regular toggle switch so go ahead
and add new action toggle and toggle and
now let me go ahead and output this to
toggle we could go ahead and put it turn
off because we want it to turn off the
light but hey since we're using toggle
yeah I just you know whatever floats
your boat so now what's going to happen
is this whenever we shoot our light it's
going to turn our light switch off which
is this light or I don't want to say
like so it's just going to turn our
spotlight off and it's also going to
make this disappear and this up here so
that's pretty cool so let me go ahead
and preview that play from here make
sure everything's working so far
and also aside from making sure that
this disappears in the spirits take a
look at our ground where our spotlight
is lighting up the ground and I'm not
close enough there we go so now whenever
I shoot that check it out our light has
now turned off but the one last thing we
need to change is we need to move this
in the exact location of this so in
order to do that probably the best way
is to go in my side view scroll in even
more and make sure that they sit right
on top of each other and also in our a
so make sure that they are indeed right
on top of each other so that way
whenever we replace them and make one
visible and one is invisible it looks
like it's the same light going on so now
for one last time going to go ahead and
hit play from here and check it out I'm
going to go ahead let me get a real good
angle to show you guys if I go ahead and
shoot this the light now looks like it
blows out and the spotlight disappears
pretty cool huh and now you shoot it
again and nothing happens just as we
wanted to so I'm going to go ahead and
shoot that one more time you know not
really demonstrating anything more just
having some fun it blows out and our
spotlight disappears and if you wanted
to a good idea would be to play a sound
in here like maybe a glass breaking
sound or light popping sound and it
would just you know give a better effect
but one last time what's going on is
whenever our interp actor which was
right here took damage the first thing
it did is it toggled the spotlight off
so this light shut off the game light
the other thing it did is it took this
emissive light right here or the light
with the emissive properties and it
switched it with this light right here
which is basically the busted white mesh
so hopefully you guys understand how to
blow out lights using the UDK again a
really cool effect and it
enhances it if you would add a sound but
you know you guys already know how to do
that you don't need me to walk you
through that so that's all I have for
you in this story'll think yes for
watching don't forget subscribe and I
will smell you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
