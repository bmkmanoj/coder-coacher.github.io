just got an update real quick and I
actually got some pretty awesome news
for you guys so before I get to the news
I want to mention a few things first of
all I know the past few months have been
kind of crazy for the new Boston and
they've been kind of crazy for myself
with having to start up my podcast and
with my work and I've been going up to
New York bunch so my life has been like
super hectic so it's just been really
exhausting trying to make tons of
tutorials for you guys you know trying
to balance everything and juggle all
these things in my life so even now that
Lola is editing most of the video from
my podcast back there things have been
really time consuming with just so much
going on so um on Monday October 3rd
what I did is I went to my bosses and I
put in my two weeks notice so this
Friday that I think it's the 14th I am
no longer working at any official job so
my entire life is now dedicated to
making tutorials for you guys and of
course they're going to continue to be
free and uploaded to the new boss and so
and it sounds weird but this is what I
enjoy doing the most I absolutely love
learning and teaching you guys in making
videos so I just wanted you guys to be
the first to know that I kind of quit
both my jobs as of this Friday I am
I'm leaving both of them and I'm going
to be making tutorials full-time and I'm
absolutely going to love it and for
those of you guys who were wondering
about the podcasts though we are going
to be still having the podcast Tuesday
Thursday and Saturday nights so that
isn't going to change me and Lola are
going to keep doing that and she's going
to be editing the video and in case you
guys don't know what I'm talking about
I'll put a link to the podcast below
again it's three nights a week from 8:00
until 9:00 and also all the videos if
you want to check out are on my other
youtube channel and i'll also include a
link to that below so the one thing I
want to ask you guys is I know I taught
a lot of different subjects and I get
messages every day asking me to continue
teaching May
advanced topics maybe it's Vance C++ or
Java or other subjects like chemistry
biology so let me ask you guys let me
know in the comment section below what
topics or what subjects you want me to
teach the whole reason I'm here is
because of you guys it's a whole reason
the New Boston exists so I figure let me
know I'll leave up to you guys what
topics you want me to teach first in
whatever people leave the most comments
on that's what subject I'm going to
start teaching first and it isn't like
I'm going to teach one topic and that's
going to be it's just the one I'm going
to start on focus on first
so again um the tutorials I'm going to
be teaching first I'm going to leave
that up to you guys so go ahead and cast
your votes in the section below and
again like I said if you want to check
out my podcast make sure to do that
pretty much I'm putting a link to
everything below so uh yeah just one
more time
I cannot wait to start making Sorrows
again I'm super excited and make sure to
check out on my other podcast and my
other YouTube channel and uh thank you
guys for watching and I will see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
