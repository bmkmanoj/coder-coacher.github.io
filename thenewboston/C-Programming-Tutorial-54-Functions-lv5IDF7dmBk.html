story gonna be teaching you guys about
functions gonna be pretty sweet and it's
actually really important in C
programming so well let's go ahead and
get to it now before I actually start
typing all the syntax and the code how
to create a function I want to explain
why you would ever want one in your
program you see the programs we made
right now we're kind of simple some are
pretty long like some of the
demonstrations but most of them were
really basic however whenever you're
making an actual program or a piece of
software to sell to some company or just
for a company you're going to have a lot
of code and it's really useful to break
it up into smaller bits just so it's
more organized so functions allow you to
break your code up into smaller bits and
organize it really well and also another
cool thing about them is what you can do
is you can write a bunch of code and
write it as a function and then you can
use that function whenever you want you
don't have to rewrite the code over and
over and over again so alright they
sound pretty cool so let's go ahead and
create one now I don't know if you
remember from like the first or second
soro
but we already have a function created
in our program it's this main function
right here so pretty much every single
program in C is made up of one or more
functions the one function that it has
to have is this main one and it's the
first function that gets called whenever
your program opens so what's ever in
here between these curly brackets is the
first thing that always runs so outside
of these curly brackets this is the area
where we can create a new function now
there are a couple different pieces that
we need to remember whenever we create a
function and we can see up here the
first part is a data type now there are
some functions that are just going to do
something like print something out on
the screen and there are other functions
that are going to do something like
calculate a number like you're making a
calculator and adding two numbers
together so whatever that function does
it's going to give you something back
like the sum of a number in this
function right here it returns zero
pretty much means give you back a num
however for the function I'm going to
show you first I'm just going to make a
really easy one that just print
something out on the screen so it
doesn't give you any numbers back or
anything so whenever you make a really
simple function that doesn't give you
anything back just put void and it
pretty much says hey see we're making a
function it's going to do something we
don't want anything or return how
generous of us right so after that you
can name your function anything you want
of course just like variables those
start it with any stupid symbols so this
is just going to print something out on
the screen so I think it would be
appropriate in a minute print something
easy enough now after the name add two
little parentheses right now and in the
next couple of videos I'm going to be
talking to you guys about what you're
going to put inside those parentheses
but for right now don't worry about them
but you need to have them again you'll
understand later and the last thing is
two curly brackets now of course you
already know that anything that we want
our function to do goes in between those
curly brackets and this is just going to
be a real simple one so print something
out on the screen what am I going to
print derp I'm a function now another
thing I want to point out is even though
arm this function isn't like calculating
any numbers and giving us back the
answer every single function needs to
have a return statement
so what return means is pretty much
we're done with this function return to
the rest of your program so again
whenever you get an answer back you're
going to have returned the number return
something else but since um this is just
printing something out on the screen
you just write return and it pretty much
just means I'm done with this function
go back to something else easy enough so
we have this function right here called
void print something that prints derp
I'm a function Allen screen so let's run
this bad boy right here hmm all right
where is that text
it didn't seem to print out and this is
why so check it out you know how I told
you that whenever a computer program
runs in Si the first thing it does is it
looks to this main function and it runs
any code in here well that's what it did
it looked in main and said okay lalala
return zero so that's all our program is
doing right now so even though we have
this function called print something
created we didn't tell our program hey
we create this function now we want to
actually use it so what we need to do is
in order to use a function just copy the
name of the function and the parentheses
after it and paste it wherever you want
to use it so right there it's going to
say okay when you get to here go to this
function called print something and
print text out on the screen
now before I run this code there's one
other thing I want to talk to you guys
about and I know that this is a lot just
to use a simple function but this is the
problem that we have computer programs
as you already know they run from top to
bottom so that's why this line occurs
first and then this line and this this
this so it makes it simple just like
people read it runs top to bottom so
this is what's going to happen with your
computer whenever it runs this program
it's going to include all these built in
function and then it's going to say go
to main so it's going to start running
main and it's going to say ok print
something wait a minute I don't have
that a function in here what the heck is
this is it a variable is it something
you make what the heck is I don't know
about this so since C is eventually
going to get this line and not know that
print something is a function that we
made we need to actually warn it above
that hey whenever you get to print
something it's actually a function that
we made so look for it somewhere else in
our program and this is called
prototyping your function and it's
really easy to do you want to prototype
all of your functions that you made
yourself above main
in a prototype it just copy the return
type the name of the function and the
parentheses and paste it right above
main with a semicolon afterwards so what
our program is going to do right now is
say okay
first thing include all these built-in
functions like printf and stuff like
that then let me scroll down okay
so right now you're saying you made a
function called print something so now
whenever I run across that in your
program I'm not going to get confused I
know that it's function so of course
then you just go to main because it's
the first thing it does scroll down here
use this function print something which
prints something out on the screen and
pretty much that's the end so let's run
this and check it out so that's what it
did it just did it incredibly fast now
remember that told you guys the cool
thing about functions is you can write
them once write any code you want in
there and use it over and over again
well to use it over and over again
actually let me throw a newline on here
all you do is paste it as many times as
you want so run this and check it out
Derr Derr Derr Derr Derr I'm a function
pretty sweet so right now obviously this
wasn't very useful you if you're making
a simple function like this you might as
well just print this line out right up
here but I just want to show you guys or
show you guys the concepts of a function
is basically reusable code that not only
helps organize your program but code
that you can use over and over and over
again really easily so now that we've
got the boring crap about functions out
of the way we can begin doing something
cool with them so for now thanks for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
well I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
