video and in this video what I'm gonna
be doing is I'm gonna be starting to
create our registration page now the
registration page is usually the first
page that the user goes to whenever they
want to use the site it's the page that
allows them to create their account
choose their username choose their
password and it pretty much allows them
to like I said create their account
because they need to create an account
before they can add items and tread
trade items make offers all that good
stuff so let's go ahead and make that
first well technically we already made
index but you know I would consider this
a page yet so go ahead and create a new
file in the first thing that we want to
do is we just want to go ahead and
include the code to connect to our
database so let's go ahead and do that
right now if I could move my cursor in
the right place PHP and well actually
you might as well go ahead and save this
save as and I'm just going to name this
register dot PHP and save it in the same
directory is your index go ahead and hit
save now like I said the very first
thing we want to do is we want to
include the code to connect to the
database but actually before I even
begin with that I want to add one line
of code and that's session underscore
start now I know I didn't talk to you
guys about sessions and I'm gonna talk
about sessions more whenever I make the
login script but what a session is is
it's basically a temporary well session
basically and the reason we want to make
this is whenever the user logs in we're
gonna give them an identification it's
pretty much a variable that sticks with
that user now this is pretty much
testing is the user logged in or logged
out if they already are on a session
that that means that the users logged in
so if a user is logged in then there's
no reason they would be going to this
register page you don't need to register
if you're already logged into your
account so later on when we test if the
user is logged in or not and then we
already have that session started and we
can say something like if
the users logged in already then just
take them to their account page but for
now I'm just going to include that so I
don't forget it later on and if all that
confuse you guys then just pretend I
didn't say anything and you'll
understand later on but now like I said
what we wanted to do is we want to
include that connection file to connect
the database and the reason for that is
whenever they choose their username and
password their username and email what
we want to do is we want to query the
database and make sure no one else has
that username or email yet if they do
then they can't like take it from them
you can have two people with the same
username so that's why we are including
this connection file at all so in order
to include a file just go ahead and type
include which is a built-in function and
go ahead and type the name of your file
now remember first of all this
connection file is in a different
directory so we need to go ahead and put
the full path include forward slash
actually I think I named it includes
make sure your file yup includes forward
slash connect dot PHP now what this line
of code is going to do is it's pretty
much gonna take all of the code from
that connection file and place it right
here pretty much we are now connected to
our database so that's all the PHP I'm
gonna write for right now now it's time
to jump in and start coding the HTML so
in order to start coding the HTML what
I'm going to do is keep moving my
freaking cursor around start with the
doctype now like I said this is going to
be html5 so in case you guys are like
where's the big XHTML declaration uh-huh
that's a old school we haven't doing
that anymore
so but hTML lang equals en and as far as
a HTML and CSS goes I'm gonna be moving
kind of quickly because I assume that
you guys already watched my html5 and
css3 tutorials if he didn't go do that
and you guys will understand what all
this crap is right here and now what I
want to do is build my head and body so
head
and by the way I just want to preface
all of my code with saying this the very
first time this very first registration
web page is gonna go kind of slow
because I'm gonna be taking guys through
all my HTML code and also my CSS code
and this first web page is going to be
the longest because it's gonna be like
the template once we build this
registration page then we can just copy
all this and paste it and you know
change the things we need and it's going
to be like five times faster but for
this first one I got to take you guys
through all the boring crap like title
title make sure to end that baby right
there and for this I'm just gonna
register and as well go ahead and make
the body right now so don't forget not
body that's what they call it in a
Russia or somewhere J's the body and
body and inside this body I'm gonna be
putting um three main things the first
thing I'm gonna be doing is I'm gonna be
building a div and I'm gonna be giving
it the ID of a rapper now not rapper
like Lil Wayne WRA pper this is pretty
much gonna surround all of the code or
most of it the rapper is basically going
to be responsible for centering the
webpage so all of the HTML code we're
gonna put inside here now the main
structure for our website on every
pretty much web page is we're going to
have something to the left in something
to the right if you see on this main
search page we have something to the
left in something to the right whenever
we search for items something to left
something to the right so that's pretty
much can be our basic structure are
though later on when we need a specific
page like view item we can overwrite
that if we want to but for now I'm gonna
be putting aside and I'm gonna be giving
this the ID equal to left underscore
side
and just go ahead and end that right
there and on the registration page what
this is going to be is this picture
right here and on the right hand side
I'm just gonna be instead of on the side
this is the main section section and ID
equals write underscore side and this
section is gonna end right there so
basically the main rapper is just going
to make sure our web page is centered
the left side is just going to be the
picture and the right side is going to
be the registration form as you see
right there so now what we have left to
do is if we uploaded this web page right
now it would look like the dumbest blank
web page ever but it would have a nice
title so in the next tutorial what I'm
gonna be doing is I'm gonna be taking
guys through all of the CSS that we need
to make our website look pretty but for
now thank you guys for watching don't
forget to subscribe and I'll see in the
next video where we're gonna be spicing
things up making it look beautiful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
