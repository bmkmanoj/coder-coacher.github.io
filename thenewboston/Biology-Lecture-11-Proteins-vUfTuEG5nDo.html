11th biology tutorial and in this video
we're going to be talking about pro
teens good enough I really need to take
a class in handwriting but nonetheless
we're going to be talking about proteins
and let's go ahead and start off by
talking about why do you even need
proteins in your body and that's
actually proteins are one of the most
diverse things in your body and you need
them for a whole bunch of different
things and I can't even come close to
explaining all of them but some of the
major things is they provide structure
in all of your cells um they carry
important molecules all around your body
to different cells and let's see there
also uses something called an enzyme and
we'll talk more about enzymes later but
they pretty much speed up chemical
reactions so your body isn't waiting
around for crap to happen randomly so
basically proteins do a whole bunch of
different crap and the building blocks
of proteins are called amino acids now
they're called the building blocks
because well that's what proteins are
essentially made of but there's kind of
a mid process in between so say that
this was an amino acid I don't really
think inside your body that they look
like a circle with a in it but whenever
you have a bunch of amino acids ay-ay-ay
they can go ahead and string together
and once a bunch of amino acids are
shrunk together they can form something
called a poly peptide chain so
polypeptide chain so that's what we have
right here in a fun little fact is that
these amino acids are actually linked
together by the process of dehydration
synthesis and we remember that from the
last tutorial so basically a bunch of
amino acids linked together in form a
polypeptide chain and once you have a
bunch of polypeptide chains they can
come together in form proteins so I
probably should know drew so much so
many arrows but let me go ahead and make
this a little bit simple amino acids
form polypeptide chains chains I'll add
a Z gangsta and polypeptide chains can
come together in form proteins and well
that's pretty much all you need to know
for right now and I might want to get a
new slide out and another cool thing is
that let me go ahead and talk about some
different types of proteins in your body
so I'll go ahead and talk about some of
the most common ones right now because
again like I said proteins do a crapload
of different stuff and it's going to
take me forever if I try to explain each
one but one of the most actually the
most abundant protein in humans is
called collagen you may have heard of it
before
now collagen is basically the tissues
that um you're it's kind of like between
your muscle and your bones and it plays
a big role in like ligaments and tendons
and stuff it's pretty much - how can I
say this provide support I guess provide
support in your body and another big one
is hemoglobin and if you hear my dog
crying then uh that's me not my dog so
hemoglobin is another big important
protein in your body and it's found in
your red blood cells so that kind of
looks like a red blood cell actually and
its job is actually to carry oxygen all
around your body so there's a protein
inside here and whenever you have some
oxygen that needs to be delivered to
different places in your body use
hemoglobin and it attaches onto that
oxygen and delivers it to ever your body
needs it so to recap one last time
proteins do a bunch of different crap in
your body a bunch of important stuff and
they're basically made from something
called amino acids
what's joined together through
dehydration synthesis to form
polypeptide chains and once you have
enough of these chains you can form a
protein now proteins like I said do a
bunch of different crap including
providing support which is the main job
of them in your body collagen is the
most abundant protein in your body and
also hemoglobin is another famous one I
guess you
we hear that a lot and its job is pretty
much to take oxygen and deliver it to
different places on your body so
proteins unlike other things have a very
diverse range of jobs unlike you know
just I don't know something else
so I'm going to shut up that's enough
about proteins you guys are probably
sick of it but anyways thank you guys
for watching don't forget to subscribe
and I will see you guys in the next
