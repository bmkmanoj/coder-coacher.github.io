another tutorial series and in this
video series I am going to show you guys
how to make a packet sniffer or a
network sniffer in Python so first
things first what the heck is a packet
sniffer well if you were to go over to
your Ethernet cable that's plugged into
your router or wireless access point
whatever you want to call it and you
were to take a multimeter or somehow
monitor the electricity on your ethernet
cable you're going to notice that there
are pulses of electricity now we see it
just changes in electricity but your
computer sees this as ones and zeros so
whenever there's a pulse
that's one whenever there is no pulse
that's zero now where your computers
going to do is eventually take these
ones and zeros convert them binary and
eventually convert it into data numbers
letters images something that's readable
to humans all right that's interesting
but why do we care about any of that you
know we usually just want to make
something cool in Photoshop and send it
off we really don't care how everything
works behind the scenes unless we do and
unless you're watching this tutorial
series so one of the reason that we may
care about this is because if we ever
want to make a network application in
Python such is I don't know maybe we
want to monitor all the traffic for our
children well what we can do is as that
data is being sent across the network
instead of just letting it go out a
router into you know Internet land we
can actually look at those ones and
zeros and reconstruct them and then
everyone that's on our network we can
actually see what kind of data that
they're looking at what kind of requests
are making who they're talking to and a
bunch of cool stuff and it also helps
you let's say you were managing a big
network and you had a bunch of different
parts in something about your network
was slow well you can actually sniff all
your packets and find out where the
bottleneck is where the problems are so
a packet sniffer or a network sniffer is
good in a lot of instances so that's
what we're going to be doing in also
learning a crapload about networking a
lot
the way so before we begin let me give
you guys a real quick breakdown of how
we're going to code this program now I
assume that you guys already have the
basic knowledge about networking if you
don't go ahead and watch my networking
tutorials is going to help you out a lot
but basically let's say that you wanted
to I don't know look at some dank meme
off of Reddit so what you're going to do
is on your computer on your browser
you're going to want to request an image
you're going to want to request some
meme so you're going to take this and
you're going to wrap inside an HTTP
request so somehow you need to get this
request to Reddit so we can look at it
look through its database and send you
back some thank meme
well in order to send it to reddit what
you need to do is you actually need to
give it the IP address of reddit server
where you're trying to send this request
and also the return address of your
computer so never read it gets this it
knows where to send it back however
before you can even think about talking
to you know some server often internet
land you need to just get that data from
your computer to your router so
basically the HTTP request for that meme
is wrapped up inside in what's called an
IP packet and that's you know pretty
much the address and return dress for
your computers and all of that is
wrapped up inside an Ethernet frame so
the Ethernet frame is the main thing
that we're going to start with and
that's the information that pretty much
is encapsulating everything and that is
how your computer talks to your router
so that's what we have to unpack first
so that's what I'm going to be doing in
this video so before I even make my main
connections and start sniffing packets
I'm just going to build a bunch of these
helper functions and I'll say unpack
ethernet frame and I'll show you guys
this right here this is a little demo I
found online so this is basically what
an Ethernet frame is whenever your
computer needs to send information to
your router this is what it's going to
send now this first part this red part
this sync in this last one this frame
check these aren't really important well
want to say they're not important
they're incredibly important but they
don't have a lot of information that's
useful to humans it's really just how
electronics worth work this sink right
here just make sure that your computer
and your router are in sync so they know
when they're receiving packets and this
last one is just a frame check to make
sure that it received all the data
correctly without any errors now this
blue yellow green and brown one that's
the good stuff that we're looking for so
the receiver and sender those are just
who's receiving and who's sending the
data of course one of them's going to be
your computer one of them is going to be
the router the type is just the ethernet
type or protocol and we just want to
check just to make sure that we're just
working with regular Internet traffic
IP version 4 so you know just a standard
make sure we aren't getting anything
funky and this big brown rectangle right
here it also encapsulate the payload or
the main data so this is pretty much if
you were to think of this like a package
this was be the part the address to and
from that's where you're writing inside
and this would be the data inside the
package so that's what we're going to be
doing so that's what an Ethernet frame
consists of now let's go ahead and
extract it so I'm going to make a
function called Ethernet to frame and we
are just going to pass in data
so basically later on we're just going
to be listening on the network and
whenever we receive a packet just see a
bunch of ones and zeros going across the
network we're going to pass it into this
function and it's going to start
unpacking it finding out what those ones
and zeros are so we already saw that
I'll say dust Mac and I'll say
destination and receiver actually say
destination and source is set of sender
and receiver since it's kind of more
conventional so source Mac and I'll say
proto now again make sure that you
understand the basics of how to unpack
and pack using strut if you don't then
if you look at my Python 3 tutorials I
talked to you guys all about it
basically a way that you can take data
and convert it to and from the bytes
format so if I go strut I cannot type
they all write struct dot unpack what
we're going to do is this alright so you
know that the first argument right here
is the format of it now before you even
write like you know s or I for integer
or effort float make sure you have an
explanation or exclamation mark and what
this signifies is that we're treating
this is network data or if you guys are
familiar with big-endian little-endian
it's pretty much the way that bytes are
arranged on a computer and the reason
that we need to state this is because
the way that data is stored on a
computer is different than the way it
flows across the network why they did
this I don't know it should just be all
the same way in my opinion but they had
to make it confusing so basically the
way that the bytes are stored are a
little bit different so we need to make
sure that this is compatible with every
system so that's why we're going to be
converting it from beginning the little
endian so the destination MAC address in
the source MAC address what computer
it's going to in what computer is coming
from are actually 6 s so 6 characters or
6 bytes 6s for the source and the proto
is H which is um a small unsigned int I
believe so after this remember we are
only going to look at the first 14 bytes
that are in that packet that we sniffed
so that's 6 and 6 for the destination
source and 2 for the end so 14 so how do
we get those first 14 bytes
well that data we pass in all we have to
do is write : 14 and this just means
start at the beginning and get the 14
bytes that follow so what it's going to
do is we're going to pass it in some
ones and zeros it's going to unpack it
and then we're going to have the
destination the source and
the proto which is the type right there
now after this we're just going to
return that information now right now
all of this is in kind of a unique
format it's not in the MAC address
format that you would think of in your
mind so we actually need to make another
function to take this and convert it to
a human readable Mac so what we're going
to do later on is I'm gonna make a
function called get MAC address and this
is just going to properly format a MAC
address and we're going to pass in
destination MAC and we're going to do
the same thing with source Mac always
think a mac and cheese whenever I'm say
Mac for some reason maybe I'm just
hungry I don't know alright so we're
going to return the destination the
source and we're also going to go socket
dot H times and proto right here and
again this is another thing that this
method right here is just going to
convert to make sure that we are either
big-endian or little-endian and
depending on what we need to do
basically take your bytes and make it
compatible so we can actually read it
and the last thing is just the data 14
to the end all right so basically what
we did in this video is we set all right
we see some data flown across the
network and we're going to be passing it
in to this function right here so once
we do go ahead and grab the first 14
bytes and unpack it because we know the
first 14 bytes will give us the
destination the source and also the type
so that's what we're going to do right
here and also what we also want to
return is all the data after that
because the data that comes after that
and we don't know how big it is is the
actual payload the actual data so we're
going to be seeing later on and the
reason that we don't know how big this
is is because
differs depending on what type of data
you're sending um you know maybe your if
you're downloading an image is going to
be big if you're just sending a text
it's going to be small but that's what
we did and yeah ethernet frame unpacked
mission accomplished in the next video
we're going to be formatting the MAC
address and it's going to be thrilling
so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
