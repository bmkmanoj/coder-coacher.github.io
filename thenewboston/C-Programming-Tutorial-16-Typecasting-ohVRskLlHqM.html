sweet video and in this tutorial I want
to talk to you guys about something
called typecasting now typecasting is
pretty much a way that you can
temporarily change the data type of a
variable so you can pretty much turn
turn floats into int int in the floats
tomatoes and tomatoes potatoes and
potatoes so let's make a quick program
let's say that you own a pumpkin farm
and you want to fig really someone it's
freaking text me I'm going to read this
who is it oh it's uh my mom no someone
else Oh buddy is going to Cracker Barrel
later and who I know if I want to go but
I'm trying to make it sore about
pumpkins here so basically you own a
pumpkin farm you sell pumpkins every day
and you want to figure out how much
money you make on average average each
day so let's go ahead and do that so of
course we're going to need a couple
variables to store these values in so
float average profit and this pretty
much is the end goal arm that we're
going to be looking for so in order to
calculate that Bruce pumpkin all right
so we sell our pumpkins for I don't know
how much does a pumpkin cost ten bucks
maybe so that's what that's going to be
our int sales on how many pumpkins did
we sell fifty nine and of course int
days worked and we'll just set this
equal to seven we'll say we worked a
full week no days off because we are the
best pumpkin farm there is so you might
be like okay I know how to do this no
problem Bucky I don't even need to watch
this Oriole what you do is you pretty
much take the price of pumpkin and then
you multiply it by sales and that's
going to give you pretty much the total
amount of money you made and then I'm
just going to go ahead and divide this
baby by day's work and that I think
would give me the average amount of
money I made per day I mean it looks
pretty good right now so let's see what
happens so print f
and we'll just put like average daily
profit and of course it's a flow and
we'll use the dollar sign why not so
dollar sign and then you put ampersand
right amperes in and Orcs Utley not the
hand purse and what the heck am I
talking about and % flow in since this
is a dollar indeed let's go ahead and
use point too because you know arm it
will be like a dollar fifty cents or
something two decimal places and of
course the float that we want to use or
output to the screen is average profit
all right so let's see how much money we
make a day okay so the ever daily profit
is $84 okay whoa hold on a second let me
just check something here calc
calculator you know I have to verify
this I need to be very specific so
basically what I'm going to do is okay
price a pumpkin so that's the 10 and
what do you do you times that by sales
do you so where's the x on this thing so
times 59 and then okay take that value
and you divide it by 7 and well what the
heck is going on this thing the
calculator that we made it's telling me
84 but this stupid thing you know I'm
calling Microsoft they might be wrong
because I know that this code is perfect
we'll check it out the reason that this
doesn't work as expected is because C
doesn't have a very good time or it's
not very happy when you try to combine
floats and int together in equations so
it says okay if you're going to multiply
stuff make sure they're all the same
data type and also make sure that
someone stops freaking texturing in my
middle let's at Oriel anyways so in
order to take these variables and
convert them to floats what you want to
do is right before the variable name add
parentheses and type the data type that
you want to convert it to so now what
this is going to do is it's temporarily
going to change this price of pumpkin
which
int into a float and again it's not
going to change it permanently if you
ever use it in your program again later
on it's still going to be int just for
this line in this line only or this
instance of the variable it's going to
be a float alright so what else do we
need to do we need to convert sales to
float and days work to float because we
want this average profit to be a float
so now let's go ahead and now that
everything is converted we'll go ahead
and run this and check it out
eighty four point two nine that's what
I'm talking about we finally got that
twenty nine cents that we worked our
butts off for so again if you have
something like this in your converting
them to floats all the time then that
probably means that you should have
started with floats to begin with this
is really only for instances where you
need to temporarily change it only you
know not throughout your whole program
only in one place or maybe two so that
is how you do that again it's called
typecasting and oh crap you know what I
got to go work on my pumpkin so um well
I'll see you guys later actually I'm
going to Cracker Barrel I'm not going to
lie so anyways I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
