tutorial that I'm making for the New
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to use threading just
a little bit the following tutorials
we're going to get into threading up a
little bit more all you're going to need
for this tutorial is a button and some
sort of method that will freeze your
application and here I just have
internet for statement and since it can
never finish the spore statement it will
just continue to work and I'll just free
the application and then the button one
click we just call this method freeze so
that when we click this button our
application should freeze and we
shouldn't feel to do anything about it
look freeze and our application is
frozen you can't resize it or do
anything whether we can exit out of it
the only way to stop would be to go on
the task manager or we can just stop you
buggin since we're even critical or
since we're using c-sharp right here
alright so usually you're never going to
have a infinite for statement that
you'll have some way to break out of but
this is just an example like if you were
you would normally use threading if you
were if you had some sort of method that
would take three or four seconds to
complete and threading will allow you to
run a method in the background so that
your application doesn't freeze well
it's doing some sort of process so in
order to use threading we're going to be
using the system that the writing
namespace we're going to be using system
stop reading and up here we're just
going to create a new thread so you can
use the red and then we're just going to
call it something I'll just call it t
I'll study equal to a new thread and
inside of these parentheses right here
we're just going to pass through the
method name that we want it to thread
and you want to thread this freeze
method like a freezer here and since
we're not invoking the method we don't
need to have the two parentheses out
there we're just going to put this one
to close up this thread in order to
start the thread or invoke this freeze
method right here we're just going to
ski
start and it will just start the thread
so now when you debug we should um our
application should not freeze and equip
this freeze button it should run this
method in the background and we only
really know what's going on
yep we can move it around now resize it
maximize with all that stuff but when we
um click the exit button it's not going
to exit out of the application and
that's because this thread is still
running so what we need to do is go on
to our form and go on a closing um event
and clothing or I guess it's for
enclosing this kind of form closing and
we're going to need to make this thread
we're going to be able to use this
thread in other places so we're going to
go up here to thread T and then we'll do
T equals and use the red right here so
now we can access this thread in any one
of the methods inside of our class right
here so now when it's closing we're just
going to do t dot stop I guess a board I
guess I guess support T dot abort so it
will just end this thread right here
so we can actually close out of our
application so now I'm gonna click
freeze right here and that could exit
out it will actually exit out of the
application yep we didn't have to stop
you bugging so that's pretty much all
we're going to look at in this tutorial
I know what we didn't really go over
much but in the next tutorial we're
going to look at more realistic examples
of using threading so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
