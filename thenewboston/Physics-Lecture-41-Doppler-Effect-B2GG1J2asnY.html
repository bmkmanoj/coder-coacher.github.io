tutorial and in this tutorial I want to
talk to you guys about something called
the Doppler effect now if you go look on
Google or go look in the physics
textbook you're going to see that the
Doppler effect is when the frequency of
a wave increases or decreases due to the
source moving closer or further away
pretty hard concept to understand when
you're just reading it but once you look
at this example it's going to make a lot
more sense so say that you have a big
lake just like that pretty good looking
like now of course since we're bored
like we usually are
and since we're super strong in this
tutorial what we decided to do one day
is we thought it would be funny to take
these huge rocks and throw them in the
middle of the lake so this is the spot
where we're going to throw rocks rock
and we'll say that we throw one rock
into the lake every second it sounds
good to me one Rock every second so
whenever we throw rocks into the lake of
course it's going to cause one ripple or
one wave every second all right
cool for us we're having a good time not
bugging anyone however there are two
boaters that we didn't see there's one
boater right here and one boater right
here
I guess they're in little sailboats will
name this boater on the left a and we'll
name this one on the right B so
basically when both of these boats a and
B are perfectly still what they're going
to do is they're going to experience one
wave per second or one ripple per second
because that's how often were throwing
these rocks into the lake now boat B
right here you see this guy he's a
little you know hot-headed he's going to
get real angry so he's going to think
that we're right here and he's going to
start going towards the source of the
rocks since you know he's hoping to find
someone cuss him out he doesn't know
that we're in our cottage over here
throwing them from the edge
but anyways he's going to start
traveling towards the center where we're
throwing the rocks and he's going to
notice that the waves are now
more frequently why is this because as
he is moving towards the source towards
the middle where the rocks are being
thrown that means he experiences waves
more quickly or more frequently so maybe
now instead of one wave per second he's
seeing three waves every second
interesting so now this person is saying
seeing three waves per one second just
go ahead and write that down
now person a on the other hand he is a
little wimp and he's getting freaked out
by these ripples so he's like you know
what I'm going home I'm going in this
direction because that's where he lives
now as person a starts going away from
the source of the waves or away from
this point right here he's going to
notice a decrease in frequency oh well
decrease in frequency so maybe he's only
going to see one wave every five seconds
now let me write this down so this
person due to the motion of their boat
and due to the fact that the source
which is this rock right here is moving
closer to them they're going to see an
increased frequency and this person in
bow a since they're moving away from the
source they're going to notice a
decreased frequency or the waves hitting
them less frequently than they were
before so that's basically what the
Doppler effect is remember the
definition that I told you guys before
is when the frequency of a wave
increases or decreases due to the source
which is this rock becoming closer or
further away so whenever you get closer
to the source you experience a higher
frequency further away you experience a
lower frequency that's what the Doppler
effect is a lot of people talk about
this in relation to sound and later on
once we start learning a little more
about sound we are going to see why
things like ambulances and if you're
watching a motorcycle race then the
frequency appears to be higher as
they're getting closer towards you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
