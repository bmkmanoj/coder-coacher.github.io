video I want to explain the basics
behind a DNS spoofing now DNS spoofing
is actually a type of man-in-the-middle
attack and if you guys don't know what a
man-in-the-middle attack is it's really
a simple to explain so basically and by
the way if you can't tell in this little
example of this is the good person and
this is the hacker or attacker and we'll
just pretend that they're at a coffee
shop or whatever I don't know why it
doesn't really matter but why not
pretend they're at a coffee shop so
normally you know if nothing bad is
going on then what's going to happen is
this girl that I'm going to randomly
give the name Emily she's going to have
a conversation with the access point say
like go to you know Facebook whatever an
access point is going to go off to
Facebook or whatever it needs and then
send it back to her so that's how normal
conversations work like the most simple
explanation of it whatever now a
man-in-the-middle attack can actually
mean a couple things the first thing it
can mean is that we have an attacker and
he is just pretty much snooping or
listening on the traffic so the first
type like I said is just eavesdropping
now another type of man-in-the-middle
attack is a little bit more deadly and
that's what I'm going to be showing you
guys and that is where the attacker
actually positions himself in the middle
of that conversation so now he's just
listening to it but all of the traffic
between Emily and the access point
actually passes through him in that way
he can inject you know packets he can
alter all the traffic any way he wants
and that's what I'm going to be showing
you guys in the next tutorial but before
we do that we actually need to
understand that this attack is actually
broken up into two parts the first part
is the man in the middle so before he
can start altering traffic doing
whatever this attacker first just needs
to gain position in the middle of their
conversation now the way that he does
this is through ARP
now if you guys are completely
unfamiliar with ARP basically what it is
is it's a way that this access point and
all these devices actually know which IP
correlates to which MAC address so we'll
say that this iPad right here it has the
MAC address of a-a-a a-a-a-a whatever
not a real MAC address but there you go
now this attacker his interface he has a
MAC address of bbbbbb
awesome handwriting Bucky awesome
inheriting so whenever these devices
first join a network this router and all
these devices are going to start
learning which MAC address correlates to
which IP address so we'll give this the
IP address of one dot one dot one dot
one and we'll give this the IP address
of two two two two so what ARP spoofing
is is pretty much messing with this
correlation now this way once the router
is aware which IP address correlates the
watch MAC address whenever it gets
traffic from the Internet in that
traffic is destined for let's say 1.1.1
not 1 it says oh ok so I know that is
meant for this device a-a-a a-a-a-a
so routers use this the internet uses
this in art is how it can correlate this
IP address to this device now for the
first part of the attack the man in the
middle what we're going to do is we're
going to be sending these devices both
Emily in the access point the wrong ARP
answers
so basically when the access point ask
who is Emily we're going to be saying oh
that's me right here I am Emily and
whenever Emily says ok I need to send
something to the Internet who is the
access point I'm going to say yep that's
me - so they're gonna believe that well
emily is going to believe that i'm the
access point and the access point is
going to believe that i am Emily and for
most of the traffic what I can do is I
can just send it through
so whenever if she wants to send
something to the internet I can just
pass it through and they are none the
wiser
but some traffic such is you know when
she's going to her like banks website or
maybe while DNS is we're going to be
seeing in the next tutorial we can alter
it in some kind of way you know maybe if
there's a file you may want to add some
cool features to it but that's what
we're going to do so then once we inject
ourselves in the middle of their
conversation and they just believe that
they're talking to each other directly
what we can do is continue with the
second part of the attack which is
actually the DNS spoof now whenever
Emily starts going to websites she is
going to need to know the IP address of
those servers so she's going to go to
Bank of America comm and she knows the
domain name Bank of America com but in
order for computers to actually connect
to that server they need to know the IP
address so domain names are just for
humans IP addresses are what computers
actually need so her browser behind the
scenes it's going to go
what's I'll just write what's the IP of
Bank of America I'll write boa if you
can't read my handwriting
so her browser is supposed to send this
off to a DNS server to get the answers
and that's what question it's going to
ask now the DNS server is going to
respond something like two two two two
and then when it gets to us we're going
to say all right Bank of America that is
192.168.0.1
and that is actually the attacker right
here so whenever like I said she is
wondering what the IP address of the
server is we're gonna we're pretty much
again the lie to her and give her the
wrong answer so then the attacker can
host a fake Bank of America web page and
she's going to type in all of her
credentials and you think they're going
to go to the real Bank of America server
uh-huh so this guy has them she is pwned
and that is the two-step process
remember the first one is ARP spoofing
where you gain entry in the middle of
this conversation in the
second one is DNS spoofing where
whenever she needs the IP address of a
server we give her the wrong answer so
that's what we're going to be doing so
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
