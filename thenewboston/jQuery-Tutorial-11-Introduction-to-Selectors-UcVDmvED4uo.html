and this is a video tutorial for the new
boston in this tutorial i'm going to be
talking a bit about selectors in jquery
why we use selectors and then i'm going
to give a quick example of using a
selector now selectors are basically a
way to select and match a set of
elements in on your page so for example
if we have a paragraph tag here i've
already set up a script called selectors
js-- which i have open in my text editor
essentially we have a paragraph here
what I could then do is just type some
text in here when we are in our
selectors j/s file we've already looked
at referencing objects or elements by
their ID and their class however if you
wanted to select something for example
all paragraphs tags on a page you would
use this notation P so now when we
perform an operation such as P click
like an event handler every paragraph on
the page will now have this event
handler attached to it so we select
elements particularly on a page for
example we reference them by their ID so
for example P ID equals para
we would then use a notation hash and
para so we're only creating this event
handler for this paragraph now there are
many many other event handlers in jQuery
and over the next few videos or the next
set of videos I'm going to be taking you
through some of the event handlers some
of the more useful event handlers and
we're also going to be looking in the
first video coming up next how to select
all elements on a page I'm also going to
count all elements on a page as well as
a short example so basically selectors
in jQuery are a way to match a set of
elements and then perform a specific
operation on them or retrieve a value
from them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
