Photoshop cs6 tutorial today we're going
to be working with the outer glow layer
style and I'm gonna apply it to some
text and I'm gonna go over the
properties and give you some tips so
let's get started make some text or like
a shape layer or anything like that and
then we're gonna go ahead and apply our
outer glow layer style to it and the
first thing it starts you off with is
nothing basically you can't really see
much and that's because the blend mode
here it's on screen go ahead and change
that to something like multiply if
nothing's showing up and then you can
start seeing a glow around the outer
edge now we've got our opacity here
which does the transparency we've got
noise which breaks it up and makes it a
little more noisier as you can see if
you have the noise down low it's more of
a softer blurrier glow we've got the
choice between a solid color here or a
gradient style or any other kind of
style here so if I go to the gradient
style it like fades off a little more
just come down here to our elements and
we've got different techniques and you
can see how these are a little different
I like to use precise most of the time
because it's a lot more pronounced and
you can unless I'm going for like a
little subtle effect but so I'll just
keep it on softer or precise go ahead
pick whatever one you want we've got our
spread here which is going to increase
the thickness and density basically in
fact it changes it to almost a stroke
looking item so keep it down lower if
you want to go all the way up here then
you might as well just use stroke here's
the difference between softer and
precise you can see that softer here if
you look in the in these W parts here
here's softer and then here's precise it
gets a little bit better alright we'll
keep that down there and then we've got
our size which we can increase how
widespread the
actual thing is the actual glow so
that's cool then down here and in our
quality we've got our contour just like
the other layer Styles basically affects
the brightness levels you can see
different effects that's cool that is
that's going on so you got like two
double out ones and double lines but
most of the time you're just gonna want
to stick with this straight linear and
to aliased makes it smooth on the edges
and here's our range where we can soften
it it out or make it a lot more thick
again but as you can see when you guys
start making it thick it gets you some
jagged edges but if you hit anti-aliased
I'll try to clean those up a little bit
so let me bring up the range a little
bit more to what it should be around
something like this then we've got
jitter here and the jitter pretty much
it's just like it gives it a like a
random value to the glow so if you just
move it around it's just gonna give more
of a random value let me see if it does
anything different way you know you
can't really see too much of a
difference but so you don't really need
to mess with the jitter all too much but
that's it for the outer glow and outer
glow is good for creating stuff like me
and so if you use a text with like a
rounded font or something like that you
can you can use the outer glow to make
like a neon color to it and it's pretty
cool put it against the black background
and I'll start looking like neon II so I
like add a bevel and emboss it'll look
cool so I guess we can try that out or a
quick alright let's go ahead and try it
out so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
cancel this and change my text color to
like something like a yellow like a
typical neon color
so there's a neon yellowish color change
my background to black and there we go
no I got that going on and change my
text actually - you want like a rounded
more rounded text like Arial rounded
let's go to that let's see if I even
have it on here no that's odd
oh there it is maybe air we all rounded
it looks like I gotta bring this text
down
alright that's good enough there we go
now I got that and let's go ahead and
use our outer glow I'll change this to
like a yellow color and here we go we're
getting some neon --is-- going on here
we don't want any noise so we got here
we go here we go we're starting to get
we're starting to get there and you can
see how now we're getting neon colors
going on for a range up a little high so
there we go now we've got a neon sort of
looking color let's go to a bevel and
emboss see what we can get going on with
that and then you basically you're gonna
want to mess with these and pretty much
see what you can get to mess with that
spot that's you starting to get the idea
now we've got a neon looking colors
we've got a nice glow going on and
that's what we wanted so that's it for
this tutorial and then the next tutorial
we'll be working with inner shadow and
that'll be cool looking too so thanks a
lot for watching and we'll see you in
the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
