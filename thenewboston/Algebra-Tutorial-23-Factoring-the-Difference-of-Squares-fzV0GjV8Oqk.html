of factoring and today our focus is
factoring the difference of squares and
I know we talked about this some when we
talked about multiplying binomials but a
difference of square equation is a lot
easier to factor because the middle
terms that usually are there when you
multiply binomials cancel each other out
so anytime you see a difference of
squares which just means that the first
term is a perfect square and the second
term is a perfect square and there's no
middle term you're going to factor it
like this you take the square root of
the first 1 plus the square root of the
second one and multiply it by the square
root of the first one minus square root
of the second term because if we were to
foil this back out we get a squared
minus 6 a plus 6 a minus 36 and the
negative 6a and the positive 68 cancels
and we're just left with a squared minus
36 so now let's do a few examples so
first we have to make sure that this is
a difference of squares well this right
now it's not a difference of squares
because 3 is not a perfect square but if
you remember what we did last lesson
finding the GCF you know that we can if
both terms are divisible by 3 we can
pull that 3 out well 48 divided by 3 is
equal to is equal to 16 so that means we
can pull that three out and this becomes
x squared minus 16 and now it looks
exactly like a perfect square
so that three stays out in front we take
the square root of x squared which is X
the square root of sixteen which is for
the square root of x which is x plus the
square root of sixteen which is four and
now this three you only need to put it
out front because you remember
multiplication is commutative so
eventually all three of these things are
going to get multiplied together and
it's going to look exactly like it did
up here okay so this next one might not
look like a perfect a difference of
squares but if you change the order
around so that the variable is on the
left side this becomes 2x squared minus
ninety eight and just like we did with
the first one we're going to factor out
that too i get x squared minus 49 and
now they are both perfect squares
because the square root of x squared is
X minus the square root of 49 which is
seven and then X plus 7 and you can
always double check that you factored it
correctly by foiling this out if you
would get 2 times x squared minus 7x
plus 7x minus 49 those cancel and then
if you distribute that to get 2x squared
minus ninety eight which matches our
original equation so we have a couple
more examples to do
so this time you can see that we are not
going to be able to factor that nine out
but that's okay because if you look at
it nine is a perfect square X to the
fourth is a perfect square and four is a
perfect square so we're going to factor
it just like we would any other
difference of square equation we're
going to take the square root of the
first one and remember when we take the
square root of a monomial we take the
square root of the coefficient times the
square root of the variable so this
becomes 3x squared because remember if
we square x squared we multiply our
exponents and we'd get X to the fourth
so we take the we take this which is the
square root of this first term minus the
square root of four which is two plus
two
only one more example then we're going
to do and again if you look at this next
term 16 is a perfect square + y squared
is a perfect square so we can factor it
like normal take the square root of x
squared which is X 0 this is supposed to
be of subtraction sign I'm sorry because
if it's a if they're if there's a plus
sign in the middle it's not difference
of squares and you can't factor it
correctly so I'm going to take the
square root of the first term X minus
the square root of the second term is
for Y and then x + 4 y and if you wanted
to foil that back out you get x squared
plus 4x y minus 4 XY plus 16y squared
those cancel we get x squared plus 16y
squared so that's all we're going to do
with difference of squares make sure you
come back and watch our next lesson
where we're going to deal with perfect
square with factoring perfect square
