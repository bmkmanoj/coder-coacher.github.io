33rd chemistry soro and in this lesson
we're going to be talking about
decomposition reactions now in the last
tutorial we just talked about regular
composition reactions and that was
basically taking two or more things and
combining them into one so this is of
course just the opposite what we're
doing is we're starting with one thing
and we break it up into two or more
elements molecules things whatever you
want to call them so let's go ahead and
take a look at a simple decomposition
reaction involving let's say we have two
molecules of water so to h2o what we can
do is we can break this up into two h2
molecules and also some sweet sweet
oxygen just like that so if we go ahead
and balance this I'll go ahead and it's
always good to balance your reactions
make sure you didn't mess up a K I'm
going to make sure I didn't mess up
right now and one molecule of water we
have two hydrogen's and since we have
two of them we have four hydrogens so I
just heard H equals four in the last
tutorial I did this and that may be kind
of confusing because you think four
hydrogen's are butting together so I
guess I'll go ahead and write it like
this from now on and also in a molecule
of water we have one oxygen so if we
have two molecules of water we have two
oxygens now that's what we started with
and we need to make sure we ended up
with the same amount stuff that we
started with so if we go ahead and look
at this in h2 two oxygens I mean excuse
me two hydrogen's so we have four
hydrogen's since we have two of them and
also this one's simple we have two
oxygens just like that simple enough so
now let's go ahead and look at another
example before I give you guys your
first assignment actually I think I gave
you guys an assignment before but let's
go ahead and take things up a notch and
take a look at something called calcium
carbonate now the formula
oh that is a quite embarrassing the
formula for calcium carbonate is caco3
and I know I
I don't know never mind out just
rambling but anyways what you do is you
take this calcium carbonate and split it
up and you end up with see a oxygen plus
carbon dioxide which is co2 now let's go
ahead and balance this bad boy and again
remember this is a decomposition
reaction you start with one thing and
you break it up into two or more things
just like that so that's basically what
I'm telling you guys had do so let's go
ahead and balance this one more time and
you guys are going to want to pay
attention because you guys have some
homework to do coming up and you're
going to need to balance some reactions
so we have one calcium we have one
carbon and we have three oxygens now
let's go ahead and just cancel all this
out calcium we have one so let's go
ahead and cancel that out for a carbon
we have one here's one and for oxygen we
need to find three here's two and here's
another one three and as long as you
cancel it everything's out everything is
out and nothing is left over then we're
good to go
so here is your homework assignment for
the evening what you're going to do is
you're going to find out how many
molecules of oxygen are left in my
potassium chlorate it sounds fun so
we're going to go ahead and okay that's
getting annoying we're going to go ahead
and start with two molecules of
potassium chlorate now that's 2 K
chlorine and oh three so this is the
formula for potassium chlorate and we
have two molecules of it so we're going
to end up with two K CL and also some
number of o2 so your job for the evening
is to tell me how many molecules of o2
so basically you have to fill in the
coefficient on this so whenever you
break apart potassium chlorate you have
to potassium and chlorines bonded
together and you have some amount of o2
so that's your job to tell me how many
molecules of o2
is in this reaction so the first person
to figure out this answer um well you
don't really win anything but I'll tell
you what I will let you donate $10 to my
website to the winner whoever can come
up with this answer first but anyways
thank you guys for watching
in the next tutorial we're going to be
talking about single displacement
reactions and then we're going to be
talking about double displacement
reactions and is going to be a blast let
me tell you so I notice thank you guys
for watching don't forget to subscribe
and uh first person answer wins</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
