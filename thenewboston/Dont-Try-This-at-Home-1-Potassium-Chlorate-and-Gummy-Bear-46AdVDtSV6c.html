Roberts and welcome to the very first
episode of don't try this at home
today we're going to be looking at a
chemical reaction between potassium
chlorate and a gummy bear not bad now
the very first thing you need is
potassium chlorate you can actually get
this right off of amazon.com probably a
lot of different websites sell it but I
got mine off of amazon.com they sell it
by the pound it's not that expensive and
you also need a gummy bear it doesn't
matter what color gummy bear you get so
go to the store and get a pack and if
you can't find gummy bears you can
actually use gummy worms it's going to
work the exact same and for safety gear
I highly recommend using splash goggles
because you don't want to get any of
this stuff in your eye especially the
potassium chlorate same thing with your
hand so I recommend using gloves I just
have you know the kind of gloves that
doctors use right here and for the
equipment the first thing that you need
is a high-quality glass test tube now
make sure the test tube is wide enough
that your gummy bear is going to be able
to fit in right there now I say glass
because this reaction is actually going
to be generating a lot of heat so if you
use a plastic test tube it may melt so
of course we need a test tube clamp in a
stand so we can you know attach
everything and aside from that we need
some kind of heat source I'm going to be
using an open flame right here and also
some kind of scoop in we're going to be
scooping the potassium chlorate
into the test tube because like I said
you don't want to be touching it with
your hands so that's all the equipment
we need so let's go ahead and set this
baby up so the first thing we need to do
is set up the test tube now we actually
don't want the test tube exactly
perfectly up-and-down we actually want
to hit a slight angle almost a 45-degree
angle just like that so whenever you're
putting your clamp on just make sure
that you set it up like that so go ahead
and slide your test tube clamp on your
stand and make sure your test tube is
nice and snug in make sure that the
clamp is somewhere near the top of the
test tube because all the good stuff is
going to be happening down here and if
you can see in the camera you see how
it's at a slight angle almost not
exactly a 45-degree angle but we don't
want exactly up in
so put it in an angle like that now
another thing that I want to do is I'm
going to be putting the space directly
over the heat source I only want to
separate them by an inch or so so go
ahead and slide it down until it's about
an inch over the heat source and that
will give you guys a nice open flame to
heat up those chemicals so now make sure
everything is nice and snug and go ahead
and put your safety gear on because
we're about to start working with some
chemicals now once you have your gloves
and goggles on you can actually start to
add the potassium chlorate to the test
tube now the exact amount of potassium
chlorate that you use is dependent on
how big your gummy bear is you want
relatively the same mass I'm just going
to go ahead and eyeball it so let me
just go ahead and add probably going to
spill some of this yep one I don't know
maybe three scoops it's looking like and
make sure you clean up if you spill any
like I just did alright so let me see
that alright so that looks pretty good
that's actually probably more than I
needed but hey better have more than
less right so now go ahead and close
this up and make sure to clean up any
spills that you may have because you
definitely don't want those around an
open flame so clean up and you're ready
to move on now what we want to do is we
actually want to start heating up the
potassium chlorate so it turns to a
liquid and at room temperature potassium
chlorate is a solid and we actually need
some energy to get this chemical
reaction started so go ahead and turn up
your flame and you're going to know when
it's ready because this powder is
actually going to turn to a liquid as
you're going to see in a little bit so
just leave that there it actually
doesn't take too long
once your potassium quarry has changed
to a liquid go ahead and turn off that
heat source and you're ready to move on
to the last stage of your experiment
actually I'm going to go ahead and turn
off some lights here so it looks a
little bit cooler now what you want to
do is go ahead and grab your gummy bear
drop it in
mmm-hmm smells good all right guys now
let me go ahead and explain exactly what
happened what you saw was actually not
one but two chemical reactions take
place now both of these were something
called decomposition reactions now
whenever you say decomposition what you
mean is basically a separation or
breakdown of chemicals now the first
chemical reaction that took place was
the decomposition of potassium chlorate
now your potassium chlorate which was
again your white powder it decomposed
into potassium chloride and oxygen now
after this your gummy bear which is
mostly sugar it reacted with the oxygen
the o2 molecules and it created carbon
dioxide and water now it was actually
the second chemical reaction the
breakdown of the gummy bear itself that
produced all the heat in all the light
so that's why we call it an exothermic
reaction in chemistry whenever we say
exothermic it pretty much means a
chemical reaction that releases energy
in this case we saw it released a lot of
light and a lot of heat which was of
course a form of energy so again that's
why we call it exothermic so anyways I
hope you guys enjoyed your very first
episode of don't try this at home if you
guys have any other suggestions of
basically other chemistry experiments or
science experiments that you want me to
try go ahead and you know let me know in
the comment section below so anyways
thank you guys for watching don't forget
to follow me on Twitter Google+ Facebook
oh and one more thing don't try this at
