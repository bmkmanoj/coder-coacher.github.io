plate on game development tutorial and
PI game and this is where I'm going to
be building a simple it's not a game but
it's a basics to a game and you're going
to need it in order to learn all the
basics that you're going to be using in
later tutorials so before I begin I want
to show you guys that have to image
images ones a JPEG image right here
called BG and this is pretty much just
the background I'm going to use right
here just a little gradient and other
ones a little ball as you can see right
here so whenever I use those images now
you'll know what I'm talking about and
that's the first thing we're going to
use so open up a new Python script or
program whatever you call it and let's
create variables for those images and
since they're in the same directory I
don't need to use any um a little
backslash a or anything and just put
their names so I'm going to put
background image file don't name a
background because we're going to be
using background later on so I'm going
to name mine Biff and just put this to
the image wherever your background is so
I named my BG in please again make sure
it's a jpg and I'll tell you why later
in my my ball for the mouse cursor I
named a mouse image file or MIF and set
this equal to the wherever your Mouse's
so my mouse is going to be the ball so I
named mine bought PNG and anytime you
want to work with trim transparency in
PI game make it a ping anytime you want
to work with a lot of colors make it a
jpg so make sure your background is jpg
and your mouse is a ping so now that we
got those we can move on to the basics
of what we're probably going to need to
do every tutorial the first thing that
we're going to need to do is import PI
game and system um you'll see why later
and another thing we're going to do is
in our front PI game locals
locals we want to import all I'll note
Astrix is let's see I have a bunch of
stickers on my keyboard from After
Effects tutorial so it covers up all the
symbols so that's why every time I type
a symbol have to look on my laptop so
next what we are going to need to do is
initialize all the PI game modules so py
game in it and that's pretty much all
the housekeeping stuff we need we're
going to need to do this every tutorial
this just imports everything we're going
to use that's built in and this just
pretty much gets it ready for us we
don't really need to learn that we just
need to just copy it for my tutorials
now here's the meat of our program
here's what you need learn let me
tighten this up a bit the first thing
that we're going to need to do is build
a screen or a window where we can play
our game so let's go ahead and make a
variable set it equal to screen and how
you do this is go ahead and type my game
dot display dot set mode set underscore
mode and this lets you create a window
the first parameter it takes and it's
the only one necessary is to create on
the size of your window and set it equal
to whatever you created your background
- 640 by 360 now it takes a couple other
parameters the firt the second one is
something called a flag I think don't
worry about that and the third one is
the bits and this is how many colors you
can use just put since I'm using 32-bit
system just put 32 or whatever your
system is the next thing after that is
we want to take that image that was our
background image and we want to convert
it to something that Python can use
since it can't just uses straight from
your computer so go ahead and type
background we're going to source in the
background variable type I game image
dot load and then in your parameters in
load type vif or whatever you named it
up here and this is going to go get that
image from your computer and what we're
going to want to do is convert it and
what this does is convert it to
something Python or
game can use and we want to do this
exact same thing with the mouse cursor
so I'm going to my name my mouse
underscore see I didn't like to name it
Mouse because Python already has
something called Mouse so that's why I
named it mouse underscore see for mouse
cursor so again
tie game image load and in your
parameters type myth or whatever you
named your file path up here and what
you need to do this is convert
underscore alpha a opha there we go
and with empty parameters and why do we
do convert for this one and convert
alpha for this one well convert alpha if
you don't know from like web design or
anything alpha means transparency and
since there's some transparency to our
cursor remember there's a ball but you
could see through the size of it that's
why we need to do convert alpha so
pretty much on basics anytime you're
working with a ping with transparency
use convert alpha now what we need to do
is build the main loop for our game and
what the main loop is is a loop that
keeps going and going so in order to do
a main loop that keeps it's pretty much
like a never-ending loop you either need
to type while true or while one these
two things make sure that your loop
never ends and the first thing we're
going to do in our loop that never ends
is give our system a way to shut down so
before I even build anything we want to
make sure when that user clicks that
Xbox or closed your program shuts down
so here's how you do this and again you
just need to copy this for now you'll
learn later for events in PI game dot
event
we're we going over events later that's
why get empty parameters if event we're
probably going be going over events in a
couple tutorials but for now just follow
me
if event type equals quit tie game quit
and sis exit and this is why we needed
to import sis at the beginning for
system exit but anyways moving on aside
from this and make sure you're right
under your 4c notice my invention what
we need to do is blitt the background to
the screen and what blip means is pretty
much copy the background right on your
screen again we'll be going over this
later but here's how to do this but okay
background make sure I spelled it right
and your next parameter is zero zero and
what this does is pretty much take that
background that you created and copy on
your window so that background is always
on the window of your screen lit pretty
much just means copy um two things to
another so now that we got our
background actually this tutorial is
getting long but now that we got our
background we can begin to build the
mouse and since this tutorial is getting
kind of line I'm going to put that in
the next story I'll sorta have to rush
so I thank you guys for watching and
make sure to check out my next tutorial
and oh by the way make sure to subscribe
see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
