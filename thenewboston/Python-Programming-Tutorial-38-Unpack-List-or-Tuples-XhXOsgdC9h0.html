hot pocket now I'm gonna show you guys
how to unpack very bowls you know that
doesn't really rhyme but as I was saying
in this video what I want to do is I
want to show you guys how to take a list
and unpack it in two separate variables
all in one line a nice little shortcut
that's definitely going to come in handy
a lot so first let's go ahead and make a
simple list so say that we have I don't
know a store or maybe we're just buying
a bunch of stuff online and we want to
keep track of the information of these
items so the first element we want to
keep track of is when we bought it or
when we sold it doesn't really matter
just make any list with like three
elements in it just an example now for
the second one I'll put the name of the
item say we bought some bread gloves and
the third one is how much did we spend
on 851 now again this is that it doesn't
really matter just make anything with
three elements in it and also if you
guys don't know what bread gloves are
Google them and look in Google Images
probably the best invention ever so we
already know that anytime you want to
access any of these elements in the list
what we can do is just type the name of
the list and the position so since it
starts with zero this will print out
they if we just run this so this prints
out the day we can also put in one item
too now if we ever want to actually use
these later on sometimes putting item
zero that can be kind of confusing
because you know it's really the date
the day always comes first it's like
we're making a program where the day
always comes first so we would store
that in the day and then we store the
other one in a named item one yada-yada
and then third one okay this is already
taken up a crap line of code and you
know I don't want to clutter up my
program so would it be cool if there is
a way that we could set each list
element to a variable all in one line
well you guys are in luck because there
is indeed a way to do that so say that
we have this list right here and we want
to set each of these elements
equal to a new variable name well all we
have to do is this put all of your
variable names and separate them with a
comma so date item price now what this
is going to do is it's called unpacking
a list in two variables so it's going to
set the first one equal to date the
second one equal to item actually let's
change that the name and the third one
equal to price so now later on we can
just do something like print name check
this out it prints out the name of it it
saves you like oh well it depends on how
big your list is about a crap line of
code now the only other thing I want to
point out is this whenever you unpack a
list in two separate variables you have
one rule that you have to follow make
sure that the number of variables equals
the number of items in your list so if
you have a bunch of lists and they have
different amounts or their different
lengths you can't really do this because
it would be consistent and I don't know
maybe you forgot to jot down the name of
one thing it's going to throw an error
at yeah so there actually is a way that
you can get around this and I was going
to show you in the next video but I
might as well show you right now so
whenever you have a list in there all
the exact same size then you can use
that method and it's going to work
perfectly it's going to make your code
real nice and clean but what if you have
lists that you want to unpack in
variables that are different sizes well
we can't use that method but we can use
a new one using this new symbol called
the star and that's above the a on your
keyboard so when would we want to use
this well actually saw a cool example in
this book called uh I think it was
called Python cookbook so if you guys
ever want to check out a cool book with
like I know it has a like bunch of cool
little scripts check that out I think I
bought it on Amazon so anyways whoever
wrote that book thank you for this next
bit of code so what you can do is
something like this say that you're a
teacher and you gave your students a
bunch of
quizzes now what you just had to do is
you want to drop the first and the last
quiz great grade and average the rest of
the scores together so maybe one class
you teach has ten quizzes maybe the
other class you teach has five quizzes
so you have this program you want to
make but the lists are going to be
different links well what you can do is
start making a function and we'll just
name this function drop arm first and
last because we're going to drop the
first and last grades and we're going to
average pretty much all the middle ones
together to give their student the final
grade so what we're going to do is we're
going to pass in grades in grades is
going to be the list but instead of just
unpacking it into a set number of
variables what we can do is this the
first item in the list is going to be
stored in the variable first the middle
elements in the lists are going to be
star middle and the last one is going to
be stored and last now what this
expression right here says is take the
first item store it in first
take all of the items in the middle now
it doesn't matter if the list is 10
elements long then it's going to store
the eight ones in the middle if the list
is only three items long then it's going
to only store one grade in the middle
this little star expression right here
is variable I probably shouldn't use the
word variable but um I don't know you
guys know what I'm talking about
so that's exactly what it's going to do
so the middle is the entire list
excluding the first and the last
so now all we have to do is calculate
the average and you already know how to
calculate average we just do real quick
it's the sum of all of the items in the
middle over the length and this is
pretty much going to count how many
items are in that list so now we can
just do something like print average and
check it out we'll call this function
twice so you can see what I'm talking
about so of course we need to pass it in
some kind of list now for the first one
I'll just give this student some test
grade 65 didn't too
- good on the first one 76 98 like 54
tanked on that one and the last one you
got a twenty one you must have known
that they were going to drop it so of
course what this is going to do whenever
we throw it in it's going to store 65
and first 21 and last and we're pretty
much just going to toss those out
because it's going to store all these in
middle and the average of 76 98 and 54
is 76 mm interesting
now of course like I said it doesn't
matter how many items we have 50 for
$65.99 88-78 if you run this it's going
to do the same thing so that ladies and
gentlemen is not only how we unpack a
list into variables but also how we can
use the star expression to give our
program a little more flexibility so
thank you guys for watching um well
that's all I got to say nothing more my
bed I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
