tutorial and of course in the last story
we made all the styling for these nice
pretty buttons on that menu so now if we
ever want them to show up we got to make
some HTML so that's what we're going to
be doing so the first thing we need to
do is just make a div for that class
bottom menu enter not man you yeah I'm
from Kentucky and just put bottom menu
right there and then you make your list
then alright so sorry everyone from
Kentucky alright so of course we made
our main t'v in just remember this div
is the area that your menu or the bottom
bar is going to go so I already said
that it was the unordered list and we
saw that whenever we're styling it now
each of the buttons is not only a link
but it's also a list item so for the
link I'll just put a href and we're just
going to set it equal to a pound sign
right there that means I don't know what
links going in there yet but it's going
to be a link so if you want to put like
Google or Bucky's room or whatever
website you want probably Bucky's room
because it's the best website ever you
can but inside each of these links
you're going to want a list item now
simple enough now inside each of these
items what you can have is text but what
I want to do is I want to stick an image
in there now the image of course is that
little icon and also I'll setting this
up and I really don't know how I want to
do for my website I know I want the
middle one to be the home then a stream
and then the user's profile but I really
didn't know what else to put what other
common buttons they would want know
maybe like the videos the tutorial
section but for right now that's why I
have the same button on each one just
because it's like a placeholder until I
decided what's going to go there so the
image source again if you're using your
own images that's fine if you want to
use mine that you are downloaded from
the website then they are images /
stream
- icon and it was a ping so that's the
stream one now for any other button all
we have to do is just copy and paste
this remember this is your main list and
this is an individual button so that's
the stream one two three four five so
again we have the stream and then I
think I have person next and then the
middle one is the home and then I just
have stream in person again so we're
going to be changing these two later on
whenever I decide and if any of you guys
have any suggestions please let me know
but that's all we have to do so now we
save this and refresh it and check it
out and it looks like there to lift
because I forgot to center align the
text now the reason that we need text
align Center is if we don't have this
then the images won't appear in the
middle so even though it says text align
it aligns anything that's in there so
we'll check this out
mom watch these whenever I refresh it
you see that they now are in the middle
of each button and that's where I want
them before so the only other thing that
we need to do is we need to highlight
wherever we're at we need to add a
selected attribute to one of these
buttons and let's just go ahead and add
it to the home by default now remember
whenever we add a selected class to a
list item what it does is it makes the
button highlighted by changing the
opacity to one and adding a nice red
border on the bottom and actually it's
not adding a border it's changing the
black border to that nice bright red so
all we have to do for this is where you
at home icon right there so class equals
I named it selected and of course
whenever we're actually designing our
website we're going to do this through
PHP or JavaScript or whatever language
it's built in but now refresh it and
check it out
so this one's a little bit easier to see
because by default these buttons have an
opacity of 50% pretty cool and that
means that not only the background but
the image itself is also 50 so the
highlighted button not only has a nice
bright red background but it is opacity
1 which means it's solid black and the
icon lights up to bright white pretty
freakin cool
we now have an awesome looking menu bar
at the bottom so in the upcoming
tutorials now that we understand how to
make that sweet menu bar I'm going to be
showing you guys how to make these icons
and how to make sure the images for each
one and also the text displays properly
it's going to be pretty freaking cool
and again like I said if you guys want
any of the code from this or if you just
want to copy it and use it in your own
website and it's all on my forum for
free pretty freaking sweet thank you
guys for watching I'm going to go eat
some hot pockets and I will see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
