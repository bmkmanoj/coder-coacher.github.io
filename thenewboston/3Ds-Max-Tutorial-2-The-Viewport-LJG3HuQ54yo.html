second 3ds max tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm going to show you guys how
to work with the viewport and how to
view your objects effectively so I know
I didn't teach you guys how to create
objects or anything but we're going to
need one for this tutorial so in the
next tutorial I'm going to show you guys
how to create objects but since we need
a quick one for this tutorial we'll just
follow along go ahead and click T pop
right here and make sure you have your
select object and then once you have
teapot selected just go ahead and click
the middle of your perspective viewport
and just drag from the inside out and
the more you drag the bigger object gets
so just go ahead and make a medium-sized
one and bam we have a teapot
so that's your one quick tutorial on how
to create an object and that's all you
get for now if you want more you have to
watch later this tutorial isn't about
creating objects about viewport so let's
get to viewports so as I said in the
last tutorial each viewport 1 2 3 4 is
for viewing a different angle of the D
of this teapot in this case for example
this one is the top view front view left
view and perspective view which is
pretty much your custom view and you
have this little thing in this called a
view cube in the upper right hand corner
now a view cube is what you're probably
going to be using a lot to get different
angles when working with your object so
for example you can see that this view
cube has a little thing that says front
left and top so if you go ahead and
click front you go ahead and you get the
front view you can go ahead and click
one of these corners also to get
different views and aside from just
clicking it to move it to a new position
you can also um hold your mouse down on
the view cube and don't just click it
hold your mouse button down and drag it
just like this and when you drag it it
rotates to a custom view and if you just
want to rotate it and you don't want to
go up or down or anything
you can go ahead and click this little
circle right here and when you scroll
your mouse up and down or left and right
it doesn't really matter then it changes
views and it only rotates it so what I
usually do most of the time is just um
click and drag the entire cube so that
way I have total control over it but
aside from this you also have a house in
your top left corner and this is your
home view so go ahead and click this
house right here right next to your
viewport and this always brings you back
to home so if you're working with a
weird view like something modeling it
down here you can go ahead and click the
house and it will bring you back to
default so this is called your home
state in it is pretty much your default
view and anytime you want a new default
view like you want to be working in this
angle lot you can go ahead and
right-click your view cube and you can
set current current view as home and now
this view will be home and any time you
don't want to get this uncheck it but
right now I just want to keep mine as
home so BAM there we go so that's pretty
much your basics of the view cube if you
need to customize it even further you
can go to views your views menu at top
view cube and you can go to what is it
configure so this lets you configure the
view cube arm like things like the size
of it opacity snaps closest view but I
just like to keep the default since I'm
teaching people in these tutorials so
well that's all you get so if you want
to customize even further again views
view cube configure but another thing
aside from the view cube if you want a
different way to view your objects you
can also have something called a
steering wheel now in order to get to
the steering wheel you can either go to
view steering wheel and toggle steering
wheels and then that brings up this
thing which is a steering wheel
I'm going to close out of this real
quick the easier way to get to this is
to hold down the shift key if you're
working with PC and press
w and this also brings up the steering
wheel you just don't have to go through
the menus first again that shift and
press W so what this allows you to do is
use these different buttons which is
like zoom and there we go is messing up
last time so just click zoom and drag
your mouse up or down to zoom in you can
also do things like orbit so you can
orbit around this point or you can go
ahead and click pan or let's see what's
another one but up and down that's a
good one to just like move the camera up
or down but I usually don't like to do
any of this since I just use on the
viewport mostly and what I'm about to
tell you next time but if you do like
using the steering wheel and you will
want to use it go ahead and click views
um what do I go to the configure
viewport configurations and then you can
go ahead and click steering wheels and
this will give you a more control if you
want to customize your steering wheel
any further and now to probably the best
method of all for viewing your objects
and that's the plain old middle mouse
scroll button now you need a mouse
button with a middle scroll button on it
to use it of course so just go ahead and
if you move your scroll button like this
it zooms your object in and out so BAM
how easy is that you don't have to click
anything you just have to move your
finger a little bit so anytime you want
a pan which is pretty much like viewing
your object like a piece of paper and
moving it around just press the scroll
button press that middle button and go
ahead and move it around like that so
now we know how to pan by clicking and
dragging and zoom so what else can we do
with the scroll button well there's one
other thing we can do in that's rotate
and if you press the alt tab on your
keyboard and I know you finally got to
bring out your left hand if you hold
down all on your keyboard and click
interact just like you were panning
can rotate it so just with mouse button
this is probably the easiest and laziest
way and that's why I use it you could
zoom it by rolling it you can pan it by
clicking and dragging and if you all and
try to click and drag it rotates it so
how easy and awesome is that so that is
your real quick tutorial on how do you
get different views using the viewport
and steering wheel and most effectively
your mouse button
that's probably one I'm going to be
doing the most often but sometimes you
know I like to use this viewport just
toggle on and off but anyways that's
your real quick tutorial on how to get
different views thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and
definitely don't forget to check out my
next tutorial so thank you and I'll see
you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
