another PI game tutorial video in this
video what we're talking about is we're
going to be building on the last video
where the question is what if we have
two objects and they just raise each
other how do we call that an impact and
handle that like an impact so in our
case well how can we handle code where
part of the snake crosses over part of
the Apple and we want to say that was
the snake ate the Apple in that case
well to start first of all - just to
make this easier on us visually and
while we're playing to actually mimic
this event occuring let's make the block
size 20 so keep in mind the block size
is the thickness of our snake so each
block of the snake or segment of our
snake is 20 pixels by 20 pixels so let's
go ahead and save and run that really
quick just to kind of get an idea so you
can see that our snake is slightly
larger now and there's our Apple and so
we could do something like this where a
well that triggered trying to show you
guys somehow we got a game over I'm not
really sure how that was a game over
okay well here's an example where
there's slight crossover and we're not
actually triggering an event there um
I'm try and get it get another one our
snake is moving way too fast I don't
understand how you good I guess I'm
hitting back there we go there's another
good example
okay so we're definitely that should be
very clear on the video that we're
crossing over here but we're not
actually getting a neck you know and you
ate the apple and so we know that most
of our handling is pretty good but we're
not it's not it's not perfect yet so how
can we remedy this and basically for any
size of block or snake so for example if
the snake was 50 and I'm gonna go ahead
and slow down the frames per second this
because that this is a huge snake now so
our snake is green don't forget so
there's our snake and basically our
snake can go over the entire Apple right
and we're not it's not saying you ate
that Apple so what we want to do is have
code that no matter what if there's any
crossover at all
all that there's been an you know the
Apple has been eaten so let's rebrand
per second put block size to 20 and now
will migrate ourselves down to where
we're going to be spending quite a bit
of time and that is right here so
basically we're going to be rewriting
this block and let me make sure that
okay so since we're going to rewrite
this block and this was the previous
version of that block well I'm gonna go
ahead and head and have us do is we're
going to get rid of this version so like
I was saying in the previous video I
like to leave sometimes a block of code
that I've replaced just in case I find
out later on I shouldn't replaced it or
maybe I want to revisit that idea so
anyway that's well I like to leave them
there but after a few iterations it's
like okay let's get rid of it you can
always save you know examples of your
code and you really should anyways in
like files so you can always go back and
see what your old code looked like so
I'm going to delete that and we're
basically I think we'll just delete this
little commented out so commenting this
out this is our old crossover code now
we're ready to create some new new
crossover codes so the question is first
we want to know very similarly did the
exes cross but this time it's a little
different it's not just is the ex within
the boundaries of the Apple it's is X
plus the size within any of the
boundaries and that y plus the side so
these if statements will be pretty darn
long we could separate them but I kind
of like the idea of using ORS so you'll
have to bear with me because we're going
to be like going off of the screen with
these or statements even if I make my
font small it will go off the screen so
just try to follow along I'll try to
type these slow so you guys can follow
along because I know I type kind of fast
so sometimes people complain that I type
too quick so anyway this we're going to
code the logic for crossover so the
first question we ask is if lead
X is a greater than so keep in mind lead
ax is the top left so lead X are the top
left is greater than R and Apple X so if
that's greater than R and Apple X um but
that's not enough
right because that you know if the sniff
the apples here and I'm trying to think
so over here would look good for you so
if the apples here and your snake is
here it is greater than the R and Apple
X so that's that's great but it also
needs to be and less than the other edge
of your apples so it needs to be like
within these these two areas right so if
lead X is greater than R and Apple X and
lead X is less than R and Apple X and
how do we find out what the other side
of that Apple X is well we just do plus
apple thickness right so how thick is
that Apple R Apple is 30 pixels thick so
if we scroll up here friendly way up
here did I roll over it yeah so here's
Apple thickness and that is a capital A
that I use a capital at no I did not so
my variable Apple thickness has a
capital a capital T so let me fix that
down here
capital a okay so if basically the X is
between those two x's okay so um so
that's fine right that would be
basically the same ish original code
that we had written if though that lead
X was in between those but what other
thing can be in between those
what if again let's see if that the
Apple here and then your snake is here
that's the crossover we're talking about
the snakes coming down here but a lot of
this thing's over here well the lead X
isn't crossing over and in fact I think
for my next demonstration I'll use paint
again I'm sure that's better than my
fists um so in fact let me bring up
paint real quick because this is the
this is the problem that we're having I
know a lot of people really like my
paint jobs
so our Apple let me do solid fill so
here's our sin solid fill jerk there we
go uh-huh and then here's our snake so
the scenario that we just coded is
basically what is your deal oh because I
made the background the scenario that we
just coded is as if our snake is doing
this right so if lead X is between those
two marks right so if it was like that
but what if your snake is like this
right lead X is not between those two
boundaries therefore there it would be
saying there's no crossover so we have
to ask if that's the case or if this
side is the case so so in the next video
that's what we'll be talking about so
we'll just be adding an or statement it
has to be an or I mean you could you
know if and then if you could stack the
ifs but I don't really like to that it's
not actually what we're asking so it's
not double ifs it's either it's like if
this or this happens so we definitely
wanna use it more but anyway that's what
we'll do in the next video so stay tuned
for that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
