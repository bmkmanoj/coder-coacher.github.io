WX Python tutorial and in this tutorial
I'm going to teach you guys how to add a
status bar and also a menu to your
frames or windows so status bar is that
little thing at the bottom you see and
it tells you like when you're hovering
over a link in Internet Explorer shows
you what the link is and a menu is this
thing up here that says file edit format
and all these things drop down so let's
go ahead and the first thing I want to
show you guys how to do is create a
status bar so let's go ahead and write
something called status you can name it
whatever you want
um what's on the left hand side of the
equal sign doesn't make a difference but
what's on the right hand side you need
to set it equal to self dot create CR
eate status bar and make sure that it
has empty parameters and that's going to
create your status bar right there so
aside from that creating a status bar I
want to teach you guys how to create a
menu so look at that you already created
a status bar halfway down this tutorial
creating a menu is a little bit more
difficult what you need to do first is
create a bar to hold your menu so this
whole entire bar is called a menu bar so
let's go ahead and make something called
menu bar and set it equal to W X dot
menu ma nu bar and make sure that those
are capitals where I capital the next
thing you need to do is make menus this
file thing is menu and this edit thing
is a menu this one this one and I'm
going to going to make two so let's go
ahead and put first stands for our first
menu equals W X menu with empty
parameters and also might as well name a
second let's confuse you equals W X menu
not menu menu I did that twice that was
weird so now we have a menu bar and now
we have two menus but those menus aren't
really actually going to show up just
yet
what we need to do first is append or
add items to this menu so I'm only going
to be adding items to the first menu
since so let's go ahead and create this
we have a blank menu right here so
pretty much right here so the items on
this one our new window open or recent
files open module so let's go ahead and
create one item for new window and one
for open so what we would do is take our
first menu so just right first put
period and press append a ppen d and
what this means is add and whenever you
write a parameter here it adds an item
to your first menu so let's go ahead and
the parameter is this takes is the first
one is WX dot new ID with empty
parameters and after that what you want
it to show is the title so for example
if this one said new window let's go
ahead and write new window so the first
parameter you tell to make a new item
the second one you name it and the third
parameter is what you want on the status
bar and this is why we created a status
bar this is a new window then let's go
ahead and create another one let's go
ahead and just copy this save with some
time work smarter not harder
copy paste um first append new ID
oh it says open with three dots so let's
go ahead and write open da and write
this will open a new window it doesn't
matter if I spouter on so all we did is
created a menu bar two menus and in the
first menu we added two things new
window and open now I'm not going to add
anything to second menu
it would just be showing you guys
pointless stuff but let me go ahead and
show you guys how to add these menus to
the menu bar so we have one menu called
first with two items on it and another
menu called second with no items on it
but they aren't attached to the menu bar
yet so what we need to do is write menu
bar or whatever you named your object up
here and you need to put period append
again whenever your pending make sure
you put a period and then you write what
you want to append first in again I mean
not again what you want to name it so
again unlike the list items you have to
name what you want to name your entire
item since this one is file and the next
one is edit so let's go ahead and write
file and now this entire menu will be
named file and let's go ahead and do
this with a second one menu bar dot
append and let's go ahead and do the
second and the second one is called edit
so file edit that's the name and in the
file is going to be new window and open
so now um after we do all that we did we
need to do one thing and this is just
pretty much housekeeping but we need to
do self set menu bar set menu there we
go bar and we need to write menu bar in
there or whatever you name this up here
and what this does is set your menu bar
on the screen so let's go ahead and save
this hopefully I don't have any errors
and if it runs we get this right here
let me show you guys there we go
we have a menu and here's the status bar
down here we have our title of our
window that was in the last tutorial
again we made two menus one call file
one called edit and as you see when I
hover over new window it says this is a
new window in the status bar and when I
hover over open it says this will open a
new window and status bar so again we
have to let's see if I can get this all
in the same one there good enough what
we did was create a menu bar and what a
menu bar holds these menus file and edit
we made menu objects first and second
which will be file and edit
in the first one which was the file one
we added on the elements new window and
open and we didn't add anything to the
second see we didn't append anything the
second and when we appended these menus
to our menu bar we named the first one
file right here and the second one edit
and then we just stuck the menu bar on
it just like that so that is your basics
on how to create a menu bar with
different list options in it and um
that's all for this tutorial I'm running
out of time but thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe to my
channel and I will see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
