an overall color and you throw that on
there and combine it with some other
things like curves and some other
effects that I'm going to show you and
you can have some cool-looking results
and when you show like a client of
before and after picture like this
they're like oh man that's awesome so
use a tritone a lot to your advantage so
let's check out what happens when we
mess with highlights so let me turn this
back on and I'll mess with the
highlights and I can make the highlights
darker if I wanted to no they're all
like grayed out and junky looking so
that's not really what we want so
bringing this down
check out the H here in the middle and
then these lights as I scrub around on
the highlights you can see they're
dulling out and now they're brighter or
I can make them like a different kind of
color if I really wanted to so I'm gonna
keep them at this because I darken the
scene by adding this darker kind of blue
so let's check into the shadows here and
the shadows will be like the stuff here
in the background these tires will be
darker it doesn't nationally it doesn't
mean like the actual shadow that being
cast it just means dark errs darker
areas
and when you mess with that it kind of
messes with the whole entire thing in
this shot so messing with around with
the shadows isn't gonna help you too
much in this shot well in other shots it
may so keep that in mind so that's a
that's tritone now let's come up to a
new one we can come to effect color
correction and then we'll come down here
to hue and saturation and we can also
desaturate and saturate the video
footage here by moving this master
saturation we can go all the way to
black and white so this is how you make
black and white footage just moving all
the way to the left of the saturation
and then we can like add a bunch more
saturation if we wanted to this is what
happens we add way too much it looks
like crap but just uh if you're adding
little saturation just don't go too
crazy with it we've got the lightness
here and that just basically brightens
things up or darkens things based on the
hue and saturation values now we've got
this master hue here where we can change
the different colors of what's going on
sometimes it works well but most of the
time it's just like blast out color so
let me change this around and you can
see how things work with that
now if we have something that's one
point color and we want to basically
make a different color we can click on
this colorize button and mess with the
hue down here to bring up new colors and
so it pretty much color rises the entire
thing and we got our saturation here to
make it even DUP brighter or darker
depending on what you want and same
thing with the lightness it'll make a
brighter or darker so this will like
colorize anything I can show you that
real quick on like just a regular layer
so layer new solid and I'll just make it
something like that we're gonna add an
effect or color correction there it is
hue/saturation and if we colorize this
we can just change the color of our
solid
so that's how you can change colors
easily if you want to and then you can
also key frame that to change colors
also so I don't need this anymore I'm
done showing you that part so I'll turn
that off
now we've got another one that we can
use let me click on my layer effect
color correction and this one's called
levels the levels uses a histogram here
to increase or decrease the black and
white values on the on the actual
footage here so if I take anything from
the slider here and this histogram here
worked kind of the same on the histogram
here you've got your black here on the
left and if I move that in it's gonna
make everything darker and then we've
got our lights over here our highlights
and if I move that in its going to make
everything brighter then in the middle
we've got our Grace and that'll affect
how great how the Gray's are affected
and how bright and dark they are the
same with this slider here so this is
the output here on the bottom so this is
the output white and output black so if
you look down here on the in the effects
panel where it says I'll put black and
I'll put white when I move this it's
going to affect the output white and
when I move this one it's going to
affect the output black or you can just
manually type them in when I move the
stuff in the histogram it's going to
affect the input black input white and
in the middle this is actually the gamma
well I always called it grace gamma and
Gray's so pretty much the same thing
going on there so use those to affect
the different like the lightness and the
darkness of everything that's going on
so we can also come into the channels
and take out like red if we wanted to or
make things move even more red so this
way takes out the red so we have no red
anymore
but this is kind of like using curves
but it's also just it's kind of like
another interface for using curves so
you can use curves and levels kind of
interchangeably and they pretty much
produce out the same kind of effects so
let me check up here and see if there's
any more effects that I want to show you
color correction tint we can use tint
here and we can affect the amount here
the the white values which are the
brighter things we can change those to a
different type of color so let's go back
into the blues now we can add a tint
onto this no the blacks we can make them
a like gray or if we want and then you
want to this is just like to blend with
original and then you can just blend it
in to give the an overall tint looking
feel so those are the main these are the
main color correction tools that I like
using and I'll go over some of the other
color correction tools I don't know them
as well but pretty much they'll these
are your five tools that are the best
for using color correction with in After
Effects cs6 at least now there's other
third-party plugins that you can use but
I'm not going to go over them until
maybe like way later on I'm just going
to try to teach you how to do everything
in After Effects without plugins so
thanks for watching this one we've gone
over a few ways to use color correction
and pretty much that's it so thanks for
watching and thumbs up and subscribe if
you liked everything so have a good one
everybody see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
