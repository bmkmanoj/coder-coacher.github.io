illustrators ca6 tutorial what is going
on today we're gonna start learning how
to do actually start making stuff with
an illustrator now in the past couple
tutorials we basically learned about the
outside or basically learn about the
user interface and how to get around the
system but now we're going to start
learning how to make stuff so we're
gonna start out with learning how to
create rectangles and ellipses or
squares and circles so let's go ahead
and get started over here on your tool
panel on the Left you're gonna have a
tool it's probably going to be the
rectangle tool but it could be any of
these tools right here it's right above
the paintbrush tool so you always know
it's ready to prep the paintbrush
because the paintbrush tool never
changes all right if you click and hold
on the icon you bring up all these extra
tools rectangle rounded rectangle for
rounded edges ellipse tool that creates
circles and ovals the polygon tool can
make polygons with different sides if
you're not sure what a polygon is and I
have to look up Google on that one star
tool just make stars and then we got a
flare tool that makes flares so let's
start out with a rectangle tool all you
got to do is select that and your icon
will turn into like a crosshairs click
and drag and now you've got a rectangle
alright that's cool let's do some more
cool things I'm just gonna delete it you
can hit control Z if you want instead
it's up to you let's select the ellipse
tool I'll draw that out and now I've got
an oval now the cool thing I want to
show you guys is if you hold down shift
while you're doing any of those two
tools you're gonna create the perfect
circle or a perfect rectangle so there's
the perfect circle let's go to a
rectangle and now we got a perfect
square is a perfect rectangle SMN square
there we go
now you're probably wondering how do I
get my rectangle or square or circle or
whatever you made have this color in it
well that's cool it's down here and your
swatches are down here in your color so
this one on the top left is called a
fill and this one on the bottom left is
stroke fill is the inside color stroke
is the outs outline along the outside so
let's go ahead and select this there
selection tool there click on our fill
if you double click on it you're going
to get a color picker that comes up go
ahead and select any color you want and
then I'll change the color of the fill
if you click on the stroke down here and
double click on that we can change the
color of the stroke okay
and then there's other options up here
when you click on them you can increase
the stroke size to get a thicker line on
the edge but we'll go over all that
we'll go over that kind of stuff later
on I'm not going to get into all the
details about those alright
so was it thing okay other things to
talk about we have these drawing modes
down here that I want to show you if you
click on that we're gonna get draw
normal draw behind and then we're gonna
get draw inside which is grayed out
which we'll talk about later on so
drawing normal draws an object on top of
any other object this is a default mode
so let me make another tool here and
I'll just go ahead and change the color
now if you're using needs up here you're
gonna notice there's not really anything
for you to pick you can either click on
this library icon here and pick from
some of these different icons so let's
go ahead and pick ice cream it's going
to give you a bunch of different
swatches that you can pick from and
colors and then accidently went to the
fill I want it to go or to the stroke I
want it to go to the fill
man oh it's because I you got to have
the fill on top down here and then go
ahead and select the color whatever
color you want you can use this color
picker up here on the top the icon is
the little artist paint board there you
can use that alright go ahead and draw
and you can see now that it drew on top
alright let's go to another color
drawing mode draw behind let's select
that what do you think that's gonna do
I'm probably gonna draw it behind let's
see well I did it in a spot that I
couldn't drop behind it alright here we
go and there you go
now it's drawn behind so there's a
couple tips for you
now don't underestimate the power of
simple shapes a lot of times people are
using some simplistic designs and all
that kind of stuff
that's all in right now being simple and
not making things too complicated and
all that jazz so let's go over to I'm
gonna go over to this and just show you
a couple examples this whole background
right here all it is is just tons of
circles but it still looks really cool
as a background on this section here
instead of going all crazy they just put
a couple simple circles at the end of
these designs and they still look cool
to me so that's all it is we've got a
couple of triangles here they have just
been rounded that's all that has been
happened here and all these are just a
bunch of triangles connected together so
if you think about it this is just a
bunch of different basic shapes that can
make some cool things simplicity is a
pretty unpretty nice tool nowadays that
you should keep an eye on let's move
this here that's bugging me I want it to
stick out like that all right let me
check and see if there's anything else I
want to go over alright there is one
more thing that I want to go over I'm
gonna select this object here
this Square and I'm gonna go into my
moats and now draw inside is available
draw inside only is available when you
have something selected I'm gonna select
that I'm gonna change my color so we can
see better let me get off this and
change pick a new color that we can see
better alright that's good enough all
right I'm going to select it again it
draw inside which it was already on and
I'm gonna go to my one of my tools go to
my ellipse tool here I'm gonna draw you
know I only draw inside the the actual
object it's not outside of it at all so
that's what draw inside does I can do it
over here on this other circle I'll
select this circle my selection tool and
go to draw another circle inside and it
drew it completely inside of that circle
there so that's how draw inside works
now you can move these around easily
with the selection tool you just click
and you start dragging it around and it
will be out you'll be able to move these
around you can also use the arrow keys
on your keyboard to move things
incrementally like that and that's
pretty much it so if you want to go
ahead and mess with the different tools
that we got here that'd be be my guest
and practice makes perfect so just go
ahead and like practice making things I
mean there's my flare obviously it looks
awful with the colors but that's what
the flare does in case you were
wondering I'm sure your are like ah draw
flare but or you weren't who knows well
that's it for the tutorial so hopefully
guys can get started on making some
basic shapes make some cool-looking
things it'll be awesome thanks a lot for
watching have a good
when everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
