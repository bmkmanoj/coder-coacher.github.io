video we are going to talk about these
wiki's so whenever you make a repository
it comes with a wiki and if you don't
know what a wiki is it's basically an
area that provides more information
about your repository and you don't have
to have it but if you want you can go
ahead and make a bunch of pages in it
and there is no set rules for what
you're supposed to put in a wiki I've
seen a bunch of different projects
include a bunch of different things some
people put like documentation in there
some people actually have like a bio of
all of their developers some people just
have you know instructions on how to use
whatever project they're you know
developing so I'll show you guys mind
right here so in mine the home page is
basically just a cool little banner and
then I'm gonna write right here like a
brief overview of what this is and then
I have you know some pictures of all the
main developers and also for this one of
course this is an open source social
network that anyone in the world can you
know help improve and fix bugs on so I'm
gonna go ahead and make a detailed guide
on how to set it up for each operating
system Windows Linux and Mac OS 10
whatever you want to call it so I
already started doing that so you can
see that I broke it up into you know
installing it editing your host file
setting up the database yadda yadda
yadda so if you just want to put a bunch
of pictures of memes in here you can so
it's really up to you but first let's
figure out how to do that so that was
the one for the new Boston actual one
I'm working on and this is just a Doc's
project so I'm gonna click wiki and this
one doesn't have any pages yet so I'm
gonna go ahead and create the first page
just by clicking that and the first page
that you always create should be the
home page so don't change your title for
your first one and what can I say
welcome to the dogs repo wiki
this is the best wiki ever alright
looking good mate and I actually want to
make this stand out so I'll give it a
heading two and of course I can preview
it wow that is a good-looking wiki I'll
say more to come soon all right so you
probably don't even need to toriel for
this I'm just gonna go ahead and hit
save and look at this so now whenever
someone is like alright this project is
looking pretty sweet want some more
information about it gonna go ahead and
check out this wiki boom look at this
now if you want to add new pages I'm not
really going to talk you through this
it's pretty easy you can just click new
page give it a title like um dot I'll
say I don't know random page tube and
I'll say like dankmemes coming soon so
go ahead and save this and whenever you
have multiple pages you have a little
default navigation on the right-hand
side which you can cycle or navigate
between them now one useful thing that I
do want to mention is you can actually
add your own custom sidebar so instead
of just making a bunch of pages and
grouping them together by default you
can actually break it up into sections
like I did right here so in order to do
that what I did is whenever you add a
custom sidebar you need to keep this
title the same so underscore sidebar and
that just lets github know that hey this
whatever I write in here this content I
want you to plop it right on that
sidebar so I'll show you guys what I
have for this basically to get these
bold headings
I just either use these two atracsys or
I can just put Boulder right there now
for each of my links I actually use a
bullet point so this boat point list
right here what I did is I add a link
now the text that displaced of the user
you put in square brackets and the
actual URL you put in those parentheses
so that's the format for
github markup and it just helps you make
a little bit cleaner sidebar so actually
if I let me just copy this one so now I
can go ahead and save this and check it
out
so this would be something that I would
want in whenever you have a sidebar this
section right here of your pages gets
collapsed so check it out and you can
also do this for a footer but it's the
same thing so I didn't need to talk you
guys through that so yeah wikis really
really easy to understand there isn't
any limit on how many pages you can have
and there isn't any restrictions on what
type of content you want and it's
actually probably going to be a little
bit different for every single project
what you want in your wiki a lot of the
smaller ones they don't even have them
but pretty easy to understand so think
guys for watching I'll see you guys next
