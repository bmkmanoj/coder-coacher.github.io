five so check this out since we
inherited this class state based game
and of course that's the class we needed
to inherit in order to build up state
based game it is giving us an error
message and it's like dude you inherited
my class but inside my class I actually
have an abstract method that you need to
implement in this class so if you see it
says okay this class must implement the
method in it states list so let's go
ahead and do that right now so under our
constructor now let me just scroll down
so you guys can see it's public void in
it aw crap I was hoping that would pop
up states list now that's the method in
remember the parameter that they
required was a game container object so
game container and we'll name this GC
and it also needs to throw throws slick
exception which is we'll go into that
later on you guys probably already know
what an exception is so let me go ahead
and clarify things first before we start
coding we needed to include this method
right here because it was one of the
rules that they said if you inherit from
my class you need to have this method or
else your programs not going to work so
why would they make us have this method
what exactly does it do well let's go
ahead and look at game container first
and let me explain you guys what game
container is a game container is pretty
much the thing that's responsible for
the main game loop the frame rate um it
manages the input system it manages a
lot of behind-the-scenes stuff so that's
what object we're going to be working
with and that's really what this method
does in its States list is of course you
give it a list of states because you
know your game before it can start
building your game it needs to know what
kind of screens are you going to have in
it and it pretty much starts off
building it so that's what we need to do
we need to give a background
what kind of game we're going to make
and that's pretty much what this method
is so the first thing that we need to do
is we need to pretty much initialize the
list of states making up this game in
order to do that this dot get state you
know what I swear this is true whenever
those things pop up I can probably just
not even look at them and type it faster
but sometimes I spend like 20 seconds
just like ooh can I save like 5 seconds
if you don't know what I'm talking about
then don't even worry about but anyways
the first state is of course menu and we
want to initialize this so in it and how
do we do that takes two arguments the
first one is the game container which is
GC and argument 2 which says argument 1
is this which pretty much means this
object or this class so that's where
we're going to do for that state
basically we're saying ok we're telling
Java that our game is going to have two
states one is the menu state which is
you know the home page I guess kind of a
game and the second one is the play
screen so now with that being said we
now initialized two different states
successfully and if you still don't
understand what the game container is
this is one of those things game
development where it's kind of hard to
explain everything all up front so once
we start working more in-depth with it
in like 10 tutorials you're going to
know exactly what it does so it guys if
you don't know exactly what I'm doing
right now then just you know power
through it it's going to make sense
later on so basically like I said we
initialize two states or two screens
right now the next thing we need to do
is say ok our game is building right now
so it says ok I built the menu screen
and I built the place screen but
whenever the user first opens the game
do you want me to take them to the menu
or the play screen how am I supposed to
know I'm just a dump computer well we'll
say okay dump computer will tell you
that as well this dot enter state this
method is going to take a state
as let me just go ahead and copy this
it's going to take a state as a
parameter the ID of a state which is
menu and enter state is basically asking
you what screen do you first want me to
show the user well we want you to show
them the main menu so that's why we put
enter state menu so with that being said
now our init States list is complete
again we needed this method because well
that's just a slick 2d documentation how
they set up this environment and some
things that were required
anytime you initialize a state or build
a screen you need to initialize it like
this or here and in order to tell slick
2d which screen you want the users to
start out on you give it this line enter
state with the state ID as the parameter
so in the next tutorial we're going to
be doing is we're going to be working
with the main method right here and what
this method is going to do is you know
what I'm not going to spoil it but it's
going to be awesome so thank you guys
for watching and yep that's what you
have to look forward to next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
