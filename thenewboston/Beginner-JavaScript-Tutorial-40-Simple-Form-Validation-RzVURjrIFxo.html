welcome to your fortieth tutorial and in
this tutorial I'm going to show you guys
probably the most simple example I've
ever showed you and that is basic form
validation now what this program is
going to do is we're going to have a
really simple form it's probably going
to be one check box and whenever we
click the submit button it's going to
check whether or not that check box is
checked so you're saying all right this
is how you do validation with check
boxes but I want to do validation with
username and passwords well once you
understand the basics behind form
validation
you can apply this to every single
element so you don't have to learn a
bunch of different ways you have to
understand this one tutorial and then
you understand the basics of foreign
validation so like I said let's go ahead
and start out with a basic form and I'm
going to name mine arm buckey's form and
let's go ahead and end it right now
and like I said we can have a bunch of
different elements in here but for the
sake of this tutorial I'm just going to
add one check box so input type equals
check box and might as well give it a
name it will make it easier just name it
the box this is the Box tonton done and
now we need some kind of submit button
because whenever we're calling our
function later on and we needed some way
to submit the form that's basically a
lemn sign so input type equals button
and might as well give it a value of
something like press me that's the text
that's going to appear on the button and
now let's go ahead and use our on click
attribute and remember whatever code we
type in here like validator this is the
JavaScript function that's going to be
called whenever we click our bun so
let's go ahead and save this and run and
launch and Chrome what we got now so
whenever we click our button nothing
happens because we didn't type any
JavaScript yet but whenever we create
our validator function
we're going to create our Valerie
function to check whether or not this
checkbox is checked so right now it
doesn't do anything but we're going to
change that right now so I'm going to go
ahead and since this is just a function
I'm going to go ahead and add in the
head of my website why not I like that
all my functions there so again this is
named validator so that's what we need
to call our function function and
actually might as well just copy that to
ensure that we don't have any typos and
it's going to take no parameters and
check it out whenever we call our
function we need to check whether or not
our check box is checked or not and we
can do that with a basic if else
statement
so if and the condition we want to test
is is this check box check so first we
need access to that check box in order
to do that document dot the name of your
form which is Bucky's form and let me
just double click that make sure whoa
not Bucky's forum buckey's form there we
go
that's why I double click it make sure
they both float up so Bucky's form and
now we need to access the element the
check box and we gave it a name the box
so we can easily access it and the
property to see if it's checked or not
is checked now this is going to be true
if it's checked and false if it's not
checked so let me go ahead and launch in
Chrome see right now it would be true
since it's checked and right now it
would be false since it's not checked so
if it is checked
what bit of code do we want to run well
let's just go ahead and make an alert
box pop up on the screen that says you
know something stupid like
yep it's checked with explanation boy
and now if it's not checked it's going
to be false so under our else let's just
go ahead and alert on something even
dumber like you better check that Hoss
and I like that because they both start
with y and that's just right no it's not
checked explanation point so save this
in let me run this and then I'll talk
you guys through it one more time
launching Chrome so let's go ahead and
check it and press it and it says yes
it's checked cool enough now let's go
ahead and uncheck it press it again and
it says no it's not checked okay pretty
cool it's working perfectly so basically
here is what we did we went ahead and we
created a forum called Bucky's forum and
we added a checkbox to it and whenever
we click the button
we told JavaScript to call this
validator function well then we went
ahead and we made the validator function
and all this function did is it said all
right whenever you click this button I'm
going to check if the checkbox is
checked if it is I'm going to run this
bit of code if it's not I'm going to run
this bit of code so that's why whenever
you ran it and it was checked it says
yes it's checked and whenever it was
unchecked it said no it's not checked
pretty cool huh
so that is the basics of form validation
again we only have one other element
besides the button on this form but what
people typically do is they make a
function to validate all their data and
again like you see we validated one
piece of data right here but then you
might have another piece of code that
says validate another checkbox or
validate a text box or a password field
so with that being said this is how we
use a bunch of different excuse me this
is the basics of form validation and how
to create a function to validate all the
data in your form so that's all I have
for you guys in this story again pretty
clear and simple the basics of form
validation you pretty much make your
form
use a function to validate the data by
accessing each element in the form
simple enough so now that I covered that
I don't know what I'm covering in the
next tutorial but trust me is going to
be amazing so thank you guys for
watching don't forget to I don't know
don't forget to brush your teeth I'll
see in the next story</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
