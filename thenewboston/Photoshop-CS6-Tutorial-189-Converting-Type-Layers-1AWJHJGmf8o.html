Photoshop cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy blackford today
we're gonna learn how to create work
paths and shapes from type layers so
sometimes when you're working with a
text layer there's things that you
cannot do like adding paint commands or
some filters or other things like that
because the image are because it's not
an image it's actually a text layer now
one way that you can get a get around
this is to rasterize the type like I
went over in the previous tutorial but
when you rasterize it it converts it to
pixels and you can't edit this anymore
what if you want vector data and to use
paths well you can do that by converting
this into a work path and you'll still
have your type that you will be able to
edit and fix up if you if you need to
and change so let's go over that and you
can see how it's going to be beneficial
to do it this way so go ahead and open
up our start writing on some type and
we're gonna go ahead and select our type
layer make sure it's selected over here
so we're going to go to the menu here
and we're gonna go to create work path
and now I have a path here that has the
actual as you can see it there has the
actual data there the actual path is now
formed out of the letters which is
pretty cool one thing to note is that a
path cannot be created from any fonts
that are bitmap fonts because they don't
contain outline data so they have like
the pixilated those are the pixilated
fonts so you won't be able to create any
outline data for most so that's easy
enough and there's your path you can
work with that this path like any other
path it contains the vector
and you're still able to actually work
with the fonts that you have and I can
edit these or you can work with the text
that you have and I can go ahead and
edit it and make a new path if I really
needed to and if I screwed up and delete
the old path so that's pretty nice it's
a little bit sometimes it's nicer than
rasterizing the text if you don't want
to deal with pass or you don't need to
deal with pass and and edit everything
you can go ahead and rasterize and I
have to worry about a path or anything
like that so that's all I wanted to show
you and be sure to LIKE the video and
subscribe for more videos coming up soon
so have a good one everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
