custom row design or a custom list item
design we need to make a custom adapter
because remember adapter is essentially
responsible for taking code and
converting it to this list item right
here so the one we had by default is
right here simple list item and that
only works with text however we have
images and kind of weird layout right
now so that's why we need to create a
custom one so go to your package and
this is just going to be one file so
right click new Java class and I'm just
going to name a custom adapter it's okay
and actually I already have my imports
copied so I'm going to paste them right
in there so if you want to pause the
video and copy all those then go ahead
or if you just want to copy it from my
website you can do that too whatever
alright so the first thing I want to do
is get rid of public so we just have
class and I want to actually you need to
inherit from array adapter so this
essentially says ok what we're creating
here is an array adapter or an adapter
to take an array and convert it to our
own custom view and let me arrange this
alright so just like before right in
here what we need to say is what data
are we working with
well the array that we're going to enter
is just an array of strings so that's
why we put string right there so it's
giving us error because it says whenever
you make an array adapter or you're
trying to convert code to that view you
first need to use the constructor so hit
alt insert constructor array adapter
right like there as you see whenever we
have the constructor the error
disappears so we have two parameters
that got passed in context and int
resource now this n resource right here
is going to be that array itself now
instead of an integer it was actually a
string array so we're going to be
passing in a string array is our
resource and we'll just call it foods so
we can work with it so of course we need
to change this to foods now this context
whenever you see context it just means
information and for right now it's just
background information that whenever you
pass it along to the superclass it needs
so we don't really have to worry about
that it's behind the scenes
pretty cool however what we do need is
the superclass needs one more parameter
and in the middle put our dot layout and
whatever you named your file I named
mine custom row stick that right in
there so whenever you create an object
the custom adapter you're going to
accept a string and just treat it as
foods and for the layout for each
individual row or list item use custom
row so it's going to go over a custom
row it says okay so right now it has
this string and it's looking at this and
obviously as human beings we can say
okay well the text obviously goes in
there but this program isn't as smart as
us so that's what we have to do right
now so go back to custom adapter and
we're going to create one more method
and this is actually an override method
so hit alt insert in override methods
and it is code get you way yeah did I
just see it get view right there all
right so what this is and let me just
get rid of all of that so get view is
where we say hey for those strings that
we passed in this is where I want you to
put them this is how I want you to lay
it out so the first two rows are
actually just housekeeping if you go to
layout inflator I think I talked to you
guys about inflator before anytime you
see the word inflate
it's kind of I don't know why Android
name to inflate to be honest it just
means like prepare or get ready for
rendering
it's how Android deals with leng things
out on your activity but you can just
name it anything you want bookies
inflator that sounds pretty cool and
just set this equal to layout inflator
from get context and by the way context
I think I just said this but anytime you
see context it just means background
information boring stuff alright now the
important part is this view custom view
and this is essentially going to be
equal to one custom row so Mac view row
tomato tomahto but if you set this equal
to Bucky's inflator inflate our layout
custom row or whatever you named your
file right there parent and false and
that just has to deal with if you apply
anything to a parent but we aren't
worried about that so the next thing we
have to do is just get a reference to
everything three different things the
first thing we need is a reference to
these strings right here the second
thing we need is a reference to this
text element and the third thing is a
reference to this so to do that it's
pretty simple the first thing I'm going
to do is get single food item and that's
just something in my array and in order
to do that just put get item position
because these they say these this can't
even talk today of course is the
position of each item in your list and
we saw that in the last tutorial will
actually like three tutorials ago
whatever so now we just want to get a
reference to that text element that we
created last time of course that's a
text view
and our custom view which is a reference
to this file
remember on here what we can do is you
can just call fine view by ID r dot a
dot Bucky's text and do the same thing
with image so that was actually an image
view Bucky's image and set this equal
actually I don't think I gave that image
an ID all right so well I did now sucka
so this is Bucky's image and set this
equal to image view custom view coastal
view by view by ID and that's art ID dot
Bucky's image where you add there you
are there you are art so now we have a
reference to everything that we need now
pretty self-explanatory we're going to
take Bucky's text which is that text
element on the activity and we're just
going to set the text of it to whatever
food item it's referencing next thing we
want to do is take that Bucky's image
and in order to change the image you
actually call set image I'm not imagery
source right there now of course our dot
drawable chunky
alright so again what this is going to
do is it's going to change the text
dynamically to each one of these items
however since I didn't feel like loading
it a bunch of different images or
sticking those in an array um I'm just
calling the same one over and over again
so just going to show my face over and
over and over again but of course later
on whenever you make an actual app you
would obviously want to change it unless
you made a pin you just wanted to see my
face a bunch of times which I don't
blame me because I'm beautiful
but the last thing we have to do here is
just return custom view so of course
this
which we just created the whole point of
these tutorials is create a custom view
so we have to return it so if he's
saying hey use that now the last line of
code that we have to do is this right
now our adapter is still using this
basic boring adapter and obviously we
just made this sweet custom one so we
can use this cool row so let's change
this right here now the first thing you
do is well we can keep the same name why
the heck not but instead of arrayadapter
actually even just delete all that all
right so of course instead of array
adapter which is that boring built-in
one let's go ahead and set this equal to
custom adapter thank you very much
now of course this for the constructor
remember it's just the context which is
background information and the second
thing is passing that foods array so of
course foods and boom there you go so I
mean that's that ladies and gentlemen so
let me go ahead and pause it and run it
and hopefully we don't got any bugs and
check it out we now got custom rows and
tunic and meatball potato click in it
and it says potato meatball this is the
best app ever alright so there you go
obviously this is the coolest app ever
because it looks like all of your
contacts are me and these are all my
nicknames so that ladies and gentlemen
is how you create not only apps with let
me get this out of this trying to
explain this here Android studio but
that is how you create apps with list
views using generic layouts and also
custom layouts right there so thank you
guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I will smell y'all later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
