tutorial and how to build a computer and
in this tutorial I'm going to be going
over a very important part of your
computer and that is the motherboard now
if you don't know what the motherboard
is it's pretty much the main circuit
board where all of your parts fit into
since they wanted to make beter work you
only have to plug in your parts to one
thing this is the one thing they have to
make sure that your parts fit into and
they are compatible with and remember
last time we picked out our CPU in for
that we need to make sure it was the
right socket and also the right type of
CPU so again you may have a socket that
your CPU can fit into but again if you
have a cell around CPU in this only
supports Pentium CPUs then it won't work
so you have to make sure you have the
right socket like it fits into and after
it fits into you have to make sure it
has a right type and there are a lot of
other buying considerations when picking
a motherboard one of the main things
people look for is this little thing
right here it's called the frontside bus
and what it is its main job is to
connect the CPU to the rain and send
information back and forth so therefore
you want a fastest frontside bus as you
can um the speed is measuring megahertz
and the faster your frontside bus is the
faster your computer is going to be and
also the more expensive your motherboard
is going to be but it's worth it it's
one of the main things you have to look
for again the speed of the frontside bus
and another thing that people look for
when buying a motherboard is the brand
name now I don't want to go ahead
tell you guys what brandon's are good
and what's bad because i want to sound
like i'm advertising anything but make
sure you get a good brand name and i
don't get bottom of line cheapo
motherboard brand in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
