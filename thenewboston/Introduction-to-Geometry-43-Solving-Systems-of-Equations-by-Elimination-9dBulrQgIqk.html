ways to solve systems of equations so
the first way is by elimination so given
two equations add a multiple of one to
eliminate a variable so you're gonna
take the smaller equation or not the
smaller equation but see how X in this
equation is positive and this 2x is
negative if I add a positive and a
negative together they're gonna cancel
each other out so we want to take the X
that has the smaller coefficient which
is this one because this only has a
coefficient of one we want to multiply
it by something that'll allow it to
cancel with this two it negative 2x
so you want to multiply this whole
equation by two so we're gonna multiply
everything by two so we get two y equals
2x plus four and we don't do anything
with this one so now what we're gonna do
is we're gonna write this equation right
underneath it and we're gonna add these
two equations together so 2y plus y
gives you 3y 2x plus a negative 2x gives
you zero X and four plus negative one
gives you positive three so now we have
3y is equal to three if you divide by
three you get Y is equal to one so now
we have to take this Y and plug it into
either one of these equations and we're
gonna do it into both of them just so
you see that you'll get the exact same
answer
so Y
Y is equal to X plus 2 since we know Y
is equal to 1 we're gonna plug it in for
y you get X plus 2 if you subtract the 2
over you get x equals negative 1 and if
you plug it into this equation you get 1
is equal to negative 2x minus 1 if you
add the 1 over you get 2 is equal to
negative 2x divided by negative 2x you
get X is equal to negative 1 so either
way you're gonna get X is equal to
negative 1 and Y is equal to 1 and we
always write this final solution as an
ordered pair okay so so now we're gonna
move on to the last way to solve system
of equation so if you're given two
equations you're going to put the
coefficients into a matrix to solve so
the coefficients are these numbers right
here in front of the X's and on both of
these wise there's an understood 1 as a
coefficient so we're going to put these
into a matrices where we're gonna put
this coefficient right here so negative
1 then we're gonna put this coefficient
right here and then we're gonna put this
one and then the same one right here
over a matrix of to this first
coefficient
this coefficient again and then this one
and this one so negative 1 1 and then
you're gonna get when you multiply
matrices you multiply this way so you're
gonna get negative 1 times 1 minus 1
times 2 over you multiply across when
you sell the matrices 2 times 1 minus
negative 1 times 1 for your X matrices
so negative 1 times 1 is negative 1
minus 1 times 2 is 2 over 2 times 1 is 2
and then negative 1 times 1 is negative
1 so it's going to be plus positive 1 on
the bottom so if you add negative 1
negative 2 you get negative 3 over 3 so
we get negative 1 for X and then we're
just gonna plug this X into this
equation so 2 times negative 1 plus y
equals negative 1 negative 2 plus y
equals negative 1 add the 2 over you get
Y is equal to 1 or you could put it in
another matrices for y you would do the
same thing except you would start here
and then do this one so I'm gonna show
you how to do the y coordinate in a
matrices just so you know what to do
okay for why we have we're gonna start
with this first coefficient here so to
then this constant right here negative
one over this first coefficient here
negative one and this constant here
divided by the same first coefficient
this coefficient and then these two
coefficients negative 1 and 1 once again
you cross multiply so you get 2 times 2
minus negative 1 times negative 1 over 2
times 1 minus negative 1 times 1 so here
you get 4 minus negative 1 times
negative 1 gives you positive 1 so minus
positive 1 over 2 negative 1 times 1
gives you negative 1 and when we minus
is negative we actually add a positive
so 2 plus 1 so then we get 3 over 3 and
as you can see we get one just like we
did when we plugged it in so either way
you can do it I just wanted you to know
how to do it both ways so that's all
that's all we have for today and this is
our last lesson on solving systems of
equations in the next video we're going
to start talking about circles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
