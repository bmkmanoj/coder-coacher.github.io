you guys how to do is how to prepare and
install your battery now a lot of
batteries that you buy whether it's for
your car or boat you can just go ahead
pick them up at Walmart throw them in
the car and your car is going to be
start be able to start up it's going to
be good to go but a lot of the batteries
for power sports like go-karts dune
buggies ATVs and motorcycles they come
in a kit and you need to prepare them
before that you can use them so what you
need to do whenever you get a kit like
that is first open it up and you're
going to see a couple things first of
all a piece of tubing like this a bottle
of solution that looks a lot like water
and also your battery now if you just go
ahead and plug this battery in and try
to start your doom buggy it's not going
to work what you need to do is actually
add the solution to your battery this is
actually an electrolyte looks like water
but this is a solution chemical solution
that makes your battery work so if you
take a look on the top of the battery
each one of these things are called
cells now you need to fill these up one
by one in order to access them just go
ahead and take a pair of pliers and pull
out the plug there we go now after that
and make sure you are only doing one by
one don't take out all the plugs at once
so go ahead and take your tubing and
your tubing is going to fit perfectly
into your cell now what you need to do
is this usually comes closed off just go
ahead and take a pair of scissors or
players or something cut a little bit of
the tip off and now plug this into this
end and when it's full we can just go
ahead and squeeze this and solution is
going to drain from the battery - or
excuse me the solution to the battery or
when it's empty or almost empty like
mine is there's only a little bit left
you need to dump it upside down now my
battery is of course I'm just doing this
for demonstration my battery is already
full and I know that it's full because
I'm just go ahead and take this off I
know that's full because the solution I
don't know if you guys can see on
youtube but in real life it's going to
be easy to see it's between the lower
level and upper level so that's where
you want all
your electrolytes be so if you
accidentally add too much then it's
going to overflow and this little
overflow thing right here by anyways
once you're done just go ahead and plug
everything back up and your battery is
now going to be built with electrolyte
solution so now that your battery is
filled with electrolyte it's not exactly
ready to go yet
the only other thing you have to do
before this baby is ready to be
installed is you need to go ahead and
charge it so go ahead and grab a car
charger or you know a battery charger I
guess and the first thing you want to do
is identify which end of the battery is
positive in which n is negative now the
industry standard is red is positive and
black is negative but sometimes people
miss the colors up or whenever they
switch around
I don't know battery terminals if you
were messing with that so just go ahead
and uh well I'll just say for industry
standard red goes to your negative I
mean excuse me red goes to your positive
and you always want to connect the red
to the positive first now go ahead and
connect the black to your negative and
now you can go ahead turn on your
charger wait about five or six hours and
then this battery is going to be charged
alright now that your battery is charged
you can go ahead and install it on your
go-kart and before I do that I want to
mention that it's probably not a good
idea to set the battery on the floor
which is I'm guessing probably concrete
or cement because the older batteries
whenever you set them on concrete or
cement it usually drained or ruin the
battery but with the new ones it's
usually alright but just to be safe you
probably don't want to put it on so
again well you usually slide it into
place first and I'll just go ahead and
do that so just like whenever you're
charging your battery if your battery is
a negative grounded which most of them
are just go ahead and assume that it is
if it uh if you're not sure go ahead and
what you want to do is you want to
connect the positive terminal first so
that would be your red wire which is
this one go ahead and plug it into the
positive end in your battery and these
batteries are paying
because it is a smallest freaking area
and I can never get them in I can't even
get a wrench on it that's how small this
thing is so go ahead and see this one
takes a screwdriver and I don't know in
my minutes you go find it real quick so
now I found my screwdriver now we just
got to tighten up this terminal and you
actually have to make sure that you have
a good connection because if you don't
have a good connection and this is it
nice and tight then your go-kart isn't
going to start in you're like what the
heck everything is hooked up the
electrical is fine but it isn't starting
so whenever it is it started one of the
things you want to troubleshoot first is
the connection between the wire in the
battery so now let's go ahead and do the
negative and the ordinary that you
probably want to put these on our bolt
battery cable battery or battery
terminal and then you're not
so just remember bolt cable battery none
and of course this is probably going to
be a pain to to screw in the last one
screwdriver there we go there we go
there we go the negative and positive
are both tightly connected now all you
have to do is slide your battery covers
over the terminal positive and negative
place this baby into its bracket into
its home where it belongs and your
battery is now hooked up and good to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
