started pouring in the middle of the
night and kind of caused my father to go
out which wouldn't really be a problem
except everything's really really wet
now and I kind of lost my Flint I have
no idea where it is so I don't know what
I'm going to do I mean I'm gonna try to
eat some food today it looks like I'm
going to be leaving soon regardless of
what happens because without a fire I
definitely can't stay out here but I did
manage to use the tab of the soda can to
make a fish hook before started running
last night Justin by the fire and that's
what looks like not bad actually I've
not if it's going to work but I need to
find some bait somewhere like a worm
preferably actually but anything will do
so I'm going to start looking around I
guess try to fish don't know what I'm
going to do if I catch one but i will
eat it rock all right now i'm going to
try and take of this part and make some
sort of fishing line if I can oh look at
that there we go one layer that comes
right out X that's kind of cool and
stuff comes right apart looks like so
nice long pieces and we'll see what
happens here well this doesn't seem to
be working actually so I mean I can just
like ank that and a break so even if I
catch a fish if I get a fish to bite at
all I'm not gonna be able to bring it in
so i think i'm going to try and use the
whole rope with a different piece
obviously see if that works cuz it'll be
a lot sturdier that's where that my only
option well it couldn't find any worms
so was gonna use the Booker just kidding
but I decided to use this here slug that
I found hello and he will probably catch
my fish to be honest with you that's
about it
well I tied a rock to the rope so that I
could keep the hook in one spot kind of
hard to tell where the something biting
or anything that just keeps keep
something like yanking it with the
current so
huh
Oh
apparently lost my hook and my mate
Rock no hook but not still so I don't
know what happened to it but I'm screwed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
