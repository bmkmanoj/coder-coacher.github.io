night started pouring in the middle of
the night and kind of caused my fire to
go out which wouldn't really be a
problem except everything's really
really wet now and I kind of lost my
flint I have no idea where it is so I
don't know what I'm gonna do I mean I'm
gonna try to get some food today but it
looks like I'm gonna be leaving soon
regardless of what happens because
without a fire I definitely can't stay
out here but I did manage to use the tab
of the soda can to make a fish hook
before started raining last night just
sitting by the fire and that's what
looks like not bad actually
I've not if it's going to work but I
need to find some bait somewhere like a
worm preferably actually but anything
will do so I'm going to start looking
around I guess try to fish
I don't know what I'm going to do if I
catch one but I will eat it rock all
right all right now I'm going to try and
take this part and make some sort of
fishing line if I can look at one layer
that comes right out X that's kind of
cool and the stuff comes right apart
looks like so nice long pieces and we'll
see what happens here well this doesn't
seem to be working actually so I mean I
can just like yank that and a break so
even if I catch a fish if I get a fish
to bite at all I'm not gonna be able to
bring it in so I think I'm gonna just
try and use the whole rope with a
different piece obviously see if that
works cuz it'll be a lot sturdier that's
really my only option
well it couldn't find any worms so was
gonna use a booger just kidding but I
decided to use this here slug that I
found hello and he will probably catch
my fish to be honest with you that's
about it
well I tied a rock to the rope so that I
could keep the hook in one spot kind of
hard to tell where the something biting
or anything that just keeps you sound
like yanking and with the current so
huh
Oh
apparently lost my hook and my fate
Rock no hook but not still so I don't
know what happened to it but I'm screwed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
