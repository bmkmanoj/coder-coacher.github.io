all going to back with another video
created for the new Boston now in this
exception handling video we're going to
look at throwing more than one or
catching rather sorry more than one
exception that might be thrown so we're
throwing more than one exception and
we're catching more than one exception
we're going to give these exceptions our
own name so I'm going to use an example
of connecting to a MySQL database you
probably already know that to connect to
a MySQL database use MySQL connect you
then specify the server name the host
the host name sorry
yet the server name the username and
then the password and then we're also
going to incorporate this and select
database function MySQL select database
in which we just specify the database so
the first thing I'm going to do is
create some of our variables that we're
going to be using within these functions
just to keep the code clean and easily
modifiable so the MySQL server in my
case is localhost the MySQL user I'm
going to say host Ashley
Spezza so host is localhost the user is
root and the password in my case is
unspecified I don't actually have a
password linked to this root account so
now I can specify the database so MySQL
DB and that is equal to a underscore
database this database does exist within
a table so when I use the when I test
out these exception handling handlers
I'm going to change route to Alex so we
don't connect properly to our server and
then for database um we're just going to
append a one on the end just so that
gives us an error about our database as
well so how do we go about redefining or
renaming these exceptions now we do this
by creating an extension of a class that
already exists and the class is
exception
so what we need to do is we need to
create a new class we need to say class
and give it a class name so for the
database the database arm exception I'm
going to call it database exception with
just capital D in the capital e and this
is going to extend to ease the extends
keyword exception and then we just put
two records that we don't need to
specify anything in in here at all so
what we're doing is we're taking
exception and we're extending this into
our own class called database exception
so we're basically taking everything
from exception and using that in our own
class called database exception and I'm
going to copy and paste this code down
if I will write it out again so I'm
going to say class server exception and
that's also going to extend exception
and then we just do two and curly
brackets there so I'll put this one at
the top because we're going to be
connecting our database first then we're
going to be our server first then we're
going to select our database so let's
set up our try and catch block but this
time we can add another catch on the end
so we've got two catches in our try and
couch so what do we put inside each of
these well we just say exception no we
don't we say catch server extension and
we'll call this X and then we exception
and then we say catch database exception
II X as well and in here we can echo out
error messages specific to each
exception thrown so what we can now do
with a server exception and data
exception database exception is we can
throw these inside our block so the
first thing to do is set up an if
statement we're going to say if we can't
connect and we're going to silence this
so we're not going to give any errors
out from
my SQL by default so MySQL connect and
we put in our MySQL host our MySQL user
and our my ask you our password if it
doesn't connect or if we're not
connecting remember silencing this we
are going to throw new server exception
and then we're going to specify am an
error message so I'm going to say could
not connect to server now I can say else
if and we can say not and we get them a
silence in this MySQL select dB
and again we're selecting we're
connecting to my SQL DB which we've
already specified up here and if that
returns true so if if it's not if we
can't connect then this will return true
need to throw a new data base exception
okay so remember we've got we're
catching our server extension and
database exception and for that we're
going to specify the message and in fact
we could probably yeah we'll say it
could
connect to database or could not select
database okay so now what we've done is
we've created - or an if else if
statement and we have said if we can't
connect to MySQL so we can't connect to
our server using our credentials up here
and here then we want to throw a new
server exception which we've already
predefined by extending our exception
class to this that we've named ourselves
and we've done exactly the same with
database exception we've extended this
class and we're now dealing with a named
class called database exception with
that we've called ourself so we're doing
exactly the same thing we're saying if
we can't connect that and throw a
database exception now we can set up
each catch from what we want to do for
each catch so if we can't connect to our
server for now we're just going to print
out us an error message obviously you
could do whatever you want it to in here
but I'm just going to demonstrate this
with an error so I'm going to append on
the e^x variable that we've created from
this class and from that we're going to
specify the function get message which
will get the message that we specified
when we threw the exception now what we
can do is do the exactly the same for
our database exception we can say error
and then e^x get message so this means
we're a now we've now thrown two
different exceptions and we have two
different actions for each exception
thrown so you can now see how this can
can actually be useful in everyday
applications so let's first of all
connect to our database we'll say else
okay connected so let's come into our
page and refresh now the credit n choose
R fine so we've been connected now let's
play around with changing them so let's
change a root to Alex and what they
should do is we should throw a new
server exception and we should have the
error message could not connect to
server'
so let's refresh error could not connect
to server so that's successful we've
successfully thrown this error
okay so let's change that back to root
and now let's say a database once we've
appended a one on this database doesn't
exist
so now let's refresh and you can see
what we've got an error saying could not
select database so what we've done in
this tutorial is we've extended and the
exception class to two class server
around so we're using parts of this
exception class for ourself and by doing
this what we've done by defining them
here what we've done is we've been able
to throw two different exceptions by
naming the classes ourselves we've
created a custom name for our exception
so we've duplicated this exception class
essentially that's what we've done we've
connected to our database which you
should know how to do and you should now
know this works so if we don't connect
with throw a new exception otherwise if
we don't connect to our database we
throw a new exception as well otherwise
we say that we're connected successfully
and we've got our catch blocks down here
which give out an error just as an
example but otherwise you could choose
to take an action depending on which
exception has been thrown so take this
play around with it see what you can do
with it and see how you can apply it to
your own applications</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
