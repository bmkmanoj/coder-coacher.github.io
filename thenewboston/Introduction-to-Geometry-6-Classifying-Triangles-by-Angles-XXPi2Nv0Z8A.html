classifying triangles by angles and
there's four types of triangles
first there's the acute triangle and
like the name suggests it's a triangle
with three acute angles and remember an
acute angle is just an angle who is
greater than zero degrees and less than
ninety degrees okay next we have the
obtuse triangle and it has one obtuse
angle and for this one that is right
here and an obtuse angle is just an
angle who is greater than 90 degrees but
less than 180 degrees our fourth our
third type of triangle is a right
triangle and it has one right angle
right here now a right angle is an angle
whose measure is equal to 90 degrees and
there's two ways you're gonna notice
either they're gonna tell you that it's
a right angle or there's gonna be a
little square right here to indicate
that it's a right angle you can't just
think it looks like a right angle and
say it's a right angle you have to be
told that it is a right angle now our
fourth kind of triangle is an
equilateral triangle and like a
equilateral triangle whose sides are
congruent all their angles are also
congruent
so this symbol just means congruent and
when we are congruent the angles have
equal measure so we can mark this by do
making we can mark them as congruent by
doing this these little tick marks
indicate that it's these angles are
congruent okay so now we're going to do
an example we have triangle ABC and
triangle BCD and because the triangles
are already marked we know that these
three angles are congruent so since the
measure of angle BCA is equal to 60
degrees an angle BCA angle C a B and
angle ABC are all congruent we know that
the measure of angle C a B is also 60
degrees and the measure of angle ABC is
60 degrees as well so this is 60 and
this is 60 so that makes triangle ABC
and equilateral
and acute triangle because all three
angles are equal and all three angles
are less than 90 degrees so we want to
find out what kind of triangle triangle
B DC is this triangle right here well if
you look at these two angles right here
you'll notice that they're supplementary
angles so we can add 60 plus we're gonna
call this angle angle X plus X and we're
going to set that equal to 180 to find
out how big x equals so if we subtract
60 we find x equals 120 degrees and
since 120 is greater than 90 but less
than 180 we know that this is an obtuse
angle so that makes triangle BDC and
obtuse triangle be sure to watch the
next video where we're going to talk
about the interior angles of triangles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
