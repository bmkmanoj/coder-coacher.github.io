with a video tutorial for the new Boston
in the last quick video we took a look
at loading three different iframes and
we used the load the load event handler
to actually wait until each one had been
loaded and we looked at the example with
images as well now in the last tutorial
we had a slight problem where we wanted
to make sure all the page contents has
contents had been loaded so all of the
dom elements have been loaded and then
we wanted to perform a particular
operation or an action and this action
was just to alert something else so
we're working with very basic feedback
now what happens if I go ahead and have
three different iframes on a page I'm
going to go ahead and just define these
now or other elements I mean we're
talking about a mix of elements it could
be an iframe a image even form element
it depends on how you know long you know
the page content is but we're going to
go ahead and have three different
iframes here so we go ahead and make
three of these and obviously the sources
are going to be different we're going to
have evade code at UK and then we're
going to go out ahead and have PHP
academy' dorg
so we've now got these three different
iframes on the page now what I want to
do is show an alert dialog when the
content of these three iframes have been
loaded so once each and every one has
been loaded
I want to then say page has been loaded
or window has been loaded and that's
giving you a clue as to how we're going
to do this because we're going to use
window as our selector and then we're
going to say load so window dot load
inside of this we define a function as
we usually would
but this time this is going to wait for
the entire contents of the page with
regards to the elements themselves to
load we're not talking about as soon as
the dawn has loaded and you know it's
ready to go
so once each element and its contents
for example well let's just take an
example when we load a page we have we
have the Dom elements that have been
initialized however they're not
necessarily loaded the contents of them
have not necessarily loaded and this is
particularly you know useful for images
because images sometimes take a while to
load like for example if you want to
have the user apply a particular or
allow them to see a particular thing
after an image had been loaded this
would be useful so it depends I mean
it's all very general and very you know
condensed and quick but sometimes when
you're working in detail you need to
know this okay so after window has
loaded we want to go ahead and alert out
loaded so what this will do is it will
check that each contents of these
iframes have been loaded and then it
will say the message loaded so let's go
ahead over to our browser and take a
look at this I'm going to go ahead and
refresh the page now you can see that
all the pages are loading and now we
have this dialog so you notice that each
one of these iframes took the time to
load before they actually were available
and appeared so we have all of the
iframe contents loaded now however
beforehand in the last tutorial we saw
that we couldn't really assign the load
to each one individually because that
then took each one and loaded
you know each high frame was loaded and
then we alerted three times so in the
last tutorial we did iframe by generally
selecting all iframes and then when we
went ahead and refresh the page we got a
message for each one that had loaded as
you can see
so that's the window dot load usually
with jQuery you're not going to go ahead
you're not really going to need to use
this and document ready and the function
inside of that is enough to actually is
enough to actually load the page and
then start to perform actions so it
depends entirely but feel free to go
ahead to the jQuery documentation or
Google search this and there's lots of
different information on each you know
reasoning behind doing each one however
we've looked at some you know classic
you know raw examples of the differences
between this and loading using this and
also loading using window</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
