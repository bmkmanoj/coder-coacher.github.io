Effects tutorial and in this tutorial
I'm going to show you guys how to use
Adobe's built-in presets now in the last
tutorial I showed you guys how to make
your own presets and apply it to like
any composition you want but I don't
know if you knew this or not but adobe
also has probably hundreds of built-in
presets and aside from these bill and
presets you can also download different
presets from the internet so let me show
you how to do that go ahead and get any
clip you want and then go ahead and make
sure you highlight the layer that you
want to apply the preset to after this
you want to go up to animation and
browse presets and what this is going to
do is take you to all the well preset um
custom made how do I say it Adobe's
built in there we go built-in presets so
here is a well they're pretty much
self-explanatory right now here's some
built-in backgrounds that Dobby has
Hilson here are some built-in behaviors
which is just like effects kinda and
again you got some custom transitions
custom text effects so I'm going to be
showing you in a little bit but for now
a simple thing we can do is go ahead and
put image creative and this pretty much
just saw it like color rises and let me
go ahead and pick on the right here
colorize infrared that should show up
pretty good so go ahead and double click
that and as you can see um this is a
built-in preset that has a bunch of
different custom values on it and you're
not just stuck with those values if you
go ahead in your effects you now have
all of these things right here that you
can manipulate just like you want so if
you say all right i want this preset but
i wish it you know I wish I that the
color was a little different you can
just go ahead and change it and bam look
at that so that's one way you can work
with the custom built-in presets again
that's animation browse presets so not
only can you apply these built-in
presets to videos but you can all
to do with text and that's one of the
main things i use the presets for so
let's go ahead and delete this and let's
type some text on screen but um this is
some text and soon enough it will look
like the matrix make sure you type every
word wrong or else it won't work and now
I'm just kidding by the way now let's go
ahead and put that in the middle of the
screen move our current time indicator
to the beginning and now i'm going to
show you guys how to apply presets to
text and this is going to give you some
sweet um well animations so instead of
using the animator like before i'm going
to show you guys just highlight this
text layer right here go up to animation
browse presets and in your text folder
right here if you aren't in your text
folder just move back until you get in
your text folder and go ahead and click
this and then go ahead and um these are
all the things you can do with text
probably the one you're going to be
using most often is an may end this is
how you animate text in I don't know if
you could have guessed that or not but
my two favorite ones are espresso I
which you can see the preview right over
here and also raining characters in and
this reminds me of like a matrix kind of
thing so um as you can see the previews
over here but if you double click it
it's going to apply to whatever layer
you have selected so now if you go ahead
and press e you see that the effects are
already applied to that so go ahead and
play this pressing spacebar and as you
can see my text now reigns down and all
I had to do is cook couple buttons so
this is a lot easier than using the
animator um just go ahead and click
button instead of trying to animate all
that yourself and again if you want this
to move faster or slower all of the
properties are right in your little
drop-down panels right here so uh
there we go i shouldn'ta mess with that
my animation stopped but again let me
zoom in on this but again anytime you
want to use those text presets on these
can give you some real cool intros and
stuff so don't forget about that and
that's that for that tutorial so again
you can apply custom presets to both
compositions and also text so thank you
