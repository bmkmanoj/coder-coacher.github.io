fourth c-sharp tutorial that I'm making
for the New Boston and in this tutorial
I'm gonna be showing you how to do
different things with this concept right
here so basically if it's different
variations of this method and in the
previous tutorial we wrote this access
all method which will basically just go
through every control on the form and so
if it's text equal to Adam and when you
double click on your button or just work
on your button this type of call just
access all method and pass through all
the controls on the phone and on your
form here just said or a few buttons one
of them being in a group box a couple
checkboxes and a label so once you have
all that just go ahead and double click
on your first button right here so
instead of changing all the text to Adam
let's just go ahead and disable all the
controls so where's my second single
property for every control equal to
false so ill just disable it so now let
me click this button it should just
disable all the controls on the form
right here yep but let's say we wanted
to only disable the buttons so in order
to check to see if the control the
botton or not we can just say yeah C and
then B is Q or to check at the bottom so
if the control is a button then you want
to just disable that control so now let
me click this button and should just
disable only the buttons on the wall you
have all the other controllers so but if
you wanted to change a property of a
control that is only part of that
control such as if you wanted to check
both of these checkboxes you can't do
like C dot check that's not a property
for control so like checked yeah no it's
not there so what we're gonna have to do
is first go and check to see if it's
checkbox and if it's a checkbox we're
gonna have to create a new checkbox
going to state checkbox and all the
states
each other equally but as a checkbox so
this will basically this cast see at the
checkbox so it will convert this control
into a checkbox and then we can you be
checked properly but it's only in the
checkbox class it's not in the control
class now we can do CH checked and just
set that equal to true so now this it
should check all of the controls on the
form so it should be it should be able
to check mark on this box for both of
these people yep perfect another thing
you can do is have it loop through and
create event handling so if you wanted
to make it so that no matter what button
you clicked it would always go to the
same method so that you click button one
and you click button to both of those
you get a message box saying the same
thing well instead of just double
clicking on this button double clicking
on this button and then creating two
methods that do the exact same thing
well you can do this we were just going
to check to see if the control of the
button alright so basically we're going
to check to see if it's a button and if
it is a button we're gonna cast C as a
new button and then we're just gonna
create a new click event right here or
create a new click event handler and
we're gonna say we're gonna do this so
that no matter what button click on the
form that will always go to this method
right here because it basically goes
through every control and it's a control
of the new button it will add this click
event to that button and then it will
always go to this method so I'm just
gonna have a message box display saying
you click the button so now if we were
to click this button it will go here
click this button it will go here and if
we click this button it will go to this
so now let me be bug and after we click
this button now no matter what button we
click hey we should get you click the
button but the button you put the button
and you click the button but if we click
on any of these controls are here we
don't get that because it only did it
for the button because of this if
statement right here so that's pretty
much it for this tutorial so see you
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
