we could probably move this around so it
removes it and essentially the problem
that we have is that every time the
mouse is moved every pixel that's moved
what we were doing is let's let me just
bring this back here get rid of that one
is we're removing the title attribute
and then again we're grabbing the title
attribute so this is a sort of a bit of
a problem so what we want to do is we
want to go ahead and make sure that
we're removing this but then we're sort
of like reinstating it so we're we sort
of displaying it again so we could go
ahead and do this title there so
essentially then what we're doing is
we're hiding it but then we're showing
our div and then we're putting it back
again so hopefully this works I'm sure
it will no no in a housing that's a
shame so let's go ahead and see what we
can do and the problem we face as well
as we can't move this up here or it will
take all it will take you know sort of
like all the a tags you know in its
place so let me just have a think about
how we could probably do this okay so
yeah I think what we could actually do
is we could use the mouse in the mouse
in event handler to grab the title and
then hide the attribute as well so let's
go ahead and just maybe append this onto
the end of here so we'll say mouse in
and then a function
and let's go ahead and go ahead and get
rid of this title so we'll say this dot
attribute title it's nothing so let's
see if this helps it hasn't so mouse
mouse over I think maybe no not at all
okay so that's how I think about this I
guess this is extremely annoying but in
terms of learning I guess it could be
quite good let's just say maybe focus
we're setting the attribute title to
nothing but yeah I tell you what okay so
okay so solution and this is going to
work so just before this I'm going to go
ahead and use the the mouse in event
handler and then I'm going to create a
function from this and just pull this
down a bit okay so now what we're going
to do is we're going to put the get the
title when we mouse in and then when we
were meet at Horry yeah also when we
mouse in we want to go ahead and remove
the attribute so this dot attribute
title is nothing and that way when the
mouse comes in we're gaining this
variable and storing it but then
removing the title attribute and then on
Mouse out we want to go ahead and
restore this so you want to say this dot
attribute title title which being the
variable we've already created so
fingers crossed this works and nothing's
worked there so we might have some kind
of error in our code let's just have a
look so this dot mouse in
I think it maybe focus will use instead
let's go ahead and refresh nope so there
must be an error here somewhere that
probably someone's pointed out already
let's just take a look so this dot focus
function okay let's just go ahead and
alert something out here just to check
that this is okay so just save working
and will refresh yeah and we don't get
an alert over which tells me that
there's something wrong with this code
and that is I don't know because I can't
find this problem so oh no sorry it's
focused in oh dear okay right so yeah I
don't know it still isn't works
let's check no that's extremely annoying
let's go ahead I know something again
so I want to say a lot working and
refresh and nothing's working
so this dot focus in which would be an a
tag focus in function we've got our
function block there that lines up VAR
title is equal to this to attribute
title and then this don't attribute
title it's nothing so we've already
grabbed this variable ball beforehand
then onmousemove
after we focused in we grab these and we
place the title in that was all working
so it must be some sort of small logical
error I think in my part let's just try
it without the VAR know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
