Roberts and welcome to your very first
chemistry lab tutorial now in this video
series what I wanted to do is I want to
talk to you guys about some cool
equipment and supplies that you guys may
be using and also I want to talk to you
guys about some awesome with chemicals
and you know just some cool procedures
and skills that you guys may use in your
lab but before we get to any awesome
labs like making explosives or anything
I want to talk to you guys about
lab safety and I know that this is going
to be incredibly boring probably but
it's also probably the most important
tutorial so you know before we make
anything cool like explosives we want to
make sure that we don't blow up or you
know get injured or anything like that
so the first thing I want to do is kind
of talk to you guys about how you would
prepare for you know chemical
experiments so the first maybe the most
important piece of equipment is splash
goggles these of course are to protect
your eyes and they're a little bit
different than safety glasses that you
may use I don't know on a construction
site or something because these fit
tight to your face and they ensure that
no chemicals are going to get in your
eyes so again they're called splash
goggles and again I probably don't need
to explain why getting chemicals in your
eyes is a bad idea
but definitely get some of those another
thing that I always wear is gloves now I
use rubber latex gloves because they fit
tight to your hands and they can you
know allow me to handle everything nice
and easily so make sure you get a tight
fitting glove that's also chemical proof
I recommend rubber latex gloves but
actually a lot of people are allergic to
latex so you might have to get something
else but that's what I'm using and the
last you know kind of common sense thing
is make sure that you wear long sleeves
in your chemistry lab and this is just
protect against chemicals touching your
skin and something a little bit better
than long sleeves is actually a long
sleeve lab coat and the reason that this
may be a little bit better is because
typically whenever people make lab coats
they make them out of chemical resistant
material so you know a long sleeve shirt
is better than nothing but it may absorb
some of the
the chemicals so I highly recommend a
long-sleeve lab coat
now a few more supplies that I recommend
is first of all a fire extinguisher
because I think it's pretty obvious why
we're going to need one of these
especially if you guys are going to be
following my tutorials you definitely
want to get a fire extinguisher
and two more things are baking soda
because baking soda is a base and if we
have any acid spills we can use some
baking soda to neutralize it clean it up
and the opposite of that is vinegar it's
nice and cheap and it's also very
helpful whenever we spill a base vinegar
is acidic so we can use this to you know
help neutralize it clean it up so again
make sure you go to the store and get
some vinegar baking soda and also
probably the most important thing a fire
extinguisher because hopefully we're
gonna need this alright so now we know
if you spill an acid or a base then
you're gonna want to use baking soda or
vinegar to help neutralize and clean up
your mess
however you're going to be working with
a lot of chemicals that you really don't
know if they're acidic or basic or what
they are whatsoever so before you work
with any chemical you want to check
something called the MSDS and it's
basically a sheet that it basically
gives you all the hazards of chemicals
so before you know start working on the
chemicals start mixing it with a random
crab it gives you all the hazards in it
better helps you prepare for your lab
now another thing is that in general if
you have no idea what to do whenever you
spill a chemical these are pretty much
the general guidelines if you ever get a
chemical in your eye you're gonna want
to flush your eyes with cold water for
several minutes and pretty much the same
thing for your skin if you you know
accidentally get some chemical on your
skin what you want to do is even if it
doesn't start to hurt or you know burn
immediately go ahead to the bathroom or
to the sink or hopefully you know you
have a some kind of cold water running
and I rinse it under cold water for
several minutes so that's basically you
know general chemical safety guidelines
so now let me go ahead and finish up and
give you guys some really common sense
tips now for some common sense safety
tips first of all never use chipped or
cracked glass
these test tubes right here in test
tubes in general usually chip or crack a
lot usually right around the rim so
never use that because they can of
course cut your fingers and actually
chips or cracks and glass is one of the
main causes for injury in a chemistry
lab another thing you want to do is you
never want to touch hot glass in you
know I say this but I kind of sound like
I'm talking to a kid whenever I say this
but people touch hot glass all the time
I don't know why if you even think that
the glass might be hot go ahead and use
tongs or anything other than your hand
to touch it and another thing I don't
really have anything to point to
whenever I'm talking about this but
don't breathe the fumes from any
experiment unless you know exactly what
gases they produce if you're just you
know experimenting and you see fumes
coming from it you really want to wear a
respirator or a fume hood well you don't
want to wear a fume hood get a fume hood
but basically don't breathe the fumes
that's you know just something I wanted
to say and the last thing I want to talk
about is always have a cell phone nearby
in case you know crap gets really out of
hand you want to be able to call someone
so always have a cell phone so you can
communicate with the outside world so
anyways that's basically it um you know
there are if you ever watch like a lab
safety video in school they're gonna
tell you to wear like a full body suit
whenever you're working with like sugar
or anything but basically just use
common sense and you know that's
basically they just use common sense and
don't do anything stupid and you should
be fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
