tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial we're gonna
continue working on our project with the
reading and writing classes so in the
previous tutorial we finished making the
base i/o class so in this tutorial we're
going to be starting our reader class so
now that we have this all done you can
just go ahead and click this minus
button right here so that we don't have
to look at it alright so now we're just
going to want to create our reader class
and we're gonna want to make our reader
class public sorry public class and I'm
just gonna call it readers since that's
what it's going to be doing and like I
said in the previous tutorial we're
gonna want to make our reader and writer
class and hear it from space i/o class
so we're just gonna put a colon and then
base i/o so we're now inheriting from
this base i/o class and everything
inside of this base i/o class is now
inside of this class as well and now
we're gonna want our two curly braces
alright and inside its class we're gonna
want to create a binary reader and we're
going to be using the binary reader to
actually do the reading but we're just
going to want to be changing some things
around when it reads alright and to
create a new binary reader we're just
going to want to create a new using
statement up here or using system dot IO
so we actually have access to that
binary the reader class so we're going
to say right here binary reader and I'm
just gonna call it BR well we're not
going to want to set equal to something
because we're gonna actually have to
pass the path to the file that we're
going to be reading through the binary
reader and we're gonna want to do that
in the constructor and the next thing
that we're gonna want to do right here
before we move on to creating the
constructors is creating a property
that's going to basically hold the
position of the binary reader so we're
just gonna type right here public since
we want to make this property public and
it's going to be a long so we're going
to say a long and if you don't know what
a long is its 64-bit signed integer and
we went over that a while back actually
and then one's going to call this
property positions position and we're
just gonna have it return the current
position of the binary reader so get it
er got face streamed position and then
when we set or change the position we're
gonna want to change the position of
this binary reader so it's gonna stay
right here set and then we're going to
say binary readers on position equals
the value that the user sets this
position property to so we're going to
put value right there all right and then
we just don't want to give basically a
description of what this position is so
we're going to want to say summary right
there and we're just going to say
position to read them back all right and
now we can actually create our
constructors and I'm just going to -
this don't really like looking at it but
anyways now we can create our
constructors so instead of having to
type out like public reader and whatever
I'm just going to type ctor and then hit
tab twice I'll just create a constructor
for us and we're gonna actually want to
have the user pass through the path to
the file that we want them to read
so we're gonna say string and this is
going to be the first up two
constructors and inside of here we're
just gonna want to set VR equal to a new
binary reader and we're just going to
want to save file with dot open read and
then that file that the user passes
through right here so just gonna say
path alright and the next thing that
we're gonna want to do actually is set
that byte order property or that byte
order value down here to big endian
since we default we want it to be big
endian so we're gonna say byte order
equals byte order dot big and and we
actually just want to make sure that's
accessing the byte order inside of this
class right here so we're just going to
say this dot by order so that we know
it's accessing the one inside of this
class and not the one inside of this
base class all right and now we're just
going to want to create one more
constructor and in this other
constructor the user will be able to
pass through the up byte order that they
want to use so it's going to type again
ctor tab twice and then we're going
state VR equals a new binary reader and
we're gonna want to have them pass
through a string here and we're also
gonna want to have them pass through a
pike order so in the same byte order and
I'm just going to call this B over byte
order all right and then we're gonna
want to say file dot open read that
filed and pass through and then we're
just gonna want to set the byte order to
the byte order that the user passes
through right here so let's say this
byte order to access the byte order
inside of this class equals Bo which is
the byte order that the user passes
through this constructor right here and
the last thing that we're gonna want to
do is basically just give a description
of or a quick summary of this
constructor right here so we're just
going to want to say create a reader to
read a file and for the path right here
we're just gonna want to stay the path
to aisle 2 and then we're just gonna
want to do the same thing for this down
here so it's going to paste this and
then we're actually going to want to
create basically a summary or a
description of what this byte order is
so this is the oh oh now we're gonna say
the order of height 2
all right and you guys can probably come
up with a better description than that
but whatever is just a tutorial so
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
