mood right now because about two days
ago got to tell you guys a little story
before I started teaching at the Sorrell
two days ago I was walking around and I
bumped until one of my friends and she
was with this other girl that I never
even met before but she was not my
friend the other I mean my friends
pretty too but the girl she was with was
oh my god
incredibly hot she was like way out of
my league so later that night um I sent
her a friend request because I don't
know I'm an idiot and I was like an why
the heck not
and just like two minutes ago got a chat
on my phone she just accepted my friend
request so I don't even know what to say
to her because I'm nervous and like I
said she is like like a nine and I am
I'm not like a like disgusting but I
don't know just saying she's out of my
league so if anyone has any suggestions
what I should say - were thinking about
just messaging by Kay but that's stupid
so give me something good and later on
I'll send that message and we'll see how
it goes
keep you guys up to date but for now
let's get back to programming and the
first thing I want to talk to you guys
about is how to convert a lowercase
letter to an uppercase one so you know
I'm probably going to be giddy I'll
tutorial because it's girly except my
friggin friend requests but you should
see er alright so see if I cannot
concentrate so let's make a couple
characters first one's going to be a
lowercase the second one char B set this
equal to char a and I'll just copy this
because I'm lazy char a char B and we'll
set this one equal equal to uppercase
which is F and we'll set this last one
equal to we want to set it yeah we just
set equal to like a number or something
so now we have three characters one is
lower case one is upper case and one is
a number you can use a simple tube if
you want like a dollar sign on
parenthesis whatever so basically what I
want to teach you guys is how to take a
lower case letter and convert it into an
upper
case letter so of course we're going to
print out a character on the screen and
just print out each of these under
newline and the function for this is to
upper to upper looks like a cool little
word but whenever we pass it in a
character such as a of course what this
is going to print out is an uppercase a
so before I think this is one of the
first functions where we actually
modified the variable I mean in the past
functions what we did is we were just
testing it we didn't actually change the
value we just tested it was it
alphabetic was a digit so on and so
forth what this is actually going to
change this lowercase a and print out an
uppercase a so now you're wondering okay
well what's going to happen if I pass it
in a number that's not lowercase such as
capital F or something that isn't even a
letter like seven well the rules for
this function are this whenever you pass
it in a character of s lowercase it's
going to turn it in the uppercase
whenever you pass it in anything else
it's pretty much going to give you back
the same thing that you pass it in since
it has nothing to do with it so again
it's going to turn a and the capital a
is going to turn capital F into nothing
leave the same same thing with numbers
simple enough so the reason that you
might want to use this is I don't know
maybe you're making a program and you
let people enter their first and last
name well if they enter their name of
this Bucky Roberts what you would want
to do is take that first character in
uppercase it and also it's pretty cool
because you can use that same function
and run it on that first character no
matter what if it's uppercase hey run
anyways it stays uppercase pretty
freaking sweet definitely useful on this
is one function of course I don't you
see but I use on my website a social
network very handy so now we're going to
take a break from characters and I want
to talk to you guys about a couple
string functions
so of course that is why I included this
little file right here string.h this
header file comes with a bunch of cool
built-in string functions and with
strings you can do things like replace
them with each other
combine them tech amount of one another
and I'll show you guys what I'm talking
about right now so go ahead and make a
string and make it like a hundred
characters long because we need to make
sure it has a bunch of space in there
for what we're about to do to it and I'm
just going to put something stupid in
here like hey right now so right now we
have this string called ham and it's
actually a character array but right now
it's just equal to hey pretty freakin
stupid so let's see if we can spite this
splice this up a little bit so the first
function I'm going to be teaching you
guys about is string cat now
unfortunately that doesn't mean strangle
my cat outside it means string
concatenate which pretty much means in
everyday language TAC on one string to
the end of another string so this takes
a couple pieces of information or
parameters the first one is what is the
original string well in this case it's
just ham it's just this string right
here now the second parameter that it
takes is what do you want to tack on to
it what other string do you want to add
to the end of this and we'll just add
the string Bucky
so if we printed this out right now
which I guess we can do now to print out
a string remember it's percent us and
we'll just bump it on newline and we'll
print out ham so basically what this did
is it took the original string which was
hey not hey like a horse just like hey
what up beautiful girl that I just met
and it added another string in this case
Bucky
now the cool thing about this is this
string is now part of ham so we
to make sure whenever creating this
original string ham that is long enough
to hold whatever strings are going to
tack onto it so originally this was one
two three four five bytes long remember
all the characters plus the null
Terminator that zero special character
at the end so this one one two three
four five six seven we need to make sure
that we never pass 100 because this can
only um hold 100 characters so if we
keep tacking on strings too then this
Beck hey Bucky arm you what else can we
say you smell so if we add something
like that again
um just reiterating one more time make
sure that all or excuse me make sure
that your original string is long enough
to hold anything you add on to the end
of it because if you go past it you're
going to have a real bad time so another
thing I want to point out is actually
I'll teach you guys about one last
function for this tutorial and this is
called STR cpy string copy and what this
does is it essentially replaces one
string with another string so the first
one is what's your original string well
it's ham and right now ham is equal to
hey Bucky you smell but say we wanted to
get rid of that completely because guys
I don't smell I promised you we wanted
to replace it with Bucky is awesome well
what this is going to do is is pretty
much going to take this string and it's
going to overwrite everything in this
string right here so now Bucky you smell
is no longer more and now ham is equal
to let me fix that it's annoying me
Bucky is awesome pretty freakin sweet so
I know that these functions look kind of
similar but string cat means tack
something onto the end of the string and
shrink copy means replace one string
with another simple stuff and we're
be using this a lot in the future so for
now thank you guys for watching and guys
give me something good to say to where I
can't have this up she is freaking hot
so well I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
