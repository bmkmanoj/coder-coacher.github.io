tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
show you how to use the binary reader
class so all you're going to need for
this tutorial is two buttons and open
and only button and also in your native
text box so once you have those on your
form just double click on the read
button and as you can see right here
this code it just uh creates a new open
file dialog and will check to see if the
Open File dialog or if the user actually
opens the file if they do it will enable
this read button right here and then it
will set this string pad equal to the
path of the file with the user opens
alright so once you have that typed out
make sure that you have the using system
dot IO up here because the binary reader
is in system dot IO namespace and need
to be referencing it so once you have
that already just going to type out
binary reader and you can name your
binary reader anything you would like
I'm just going to call it PR or binary
reader and then study equal to a new
binary reader and it calls for a stream
right here so we're going to have to
file dot open and read and then we're
just going to type the path the path to
the file that the path to the file that
we opened in the Open File dialog so
once you have your binary reader typed
out here we can use the binary reader to
read something and the first method in
the binary reader that are going to
looking at is the read characters
alright so basically what the read
character method will do is will read a
character on from your file and since we
haven't specified a position in our file
to have it be reading from it's just
going to start at 0 so it'll just read
this first character right here it'll
read this C so we're going to have it
read this character into the textbox
so that we can view this character and
make sure that it's reading properly and
since this method returns a character
then keep the dot to string method so
that it will convert it into a string
and then we're just going to want to
dispose or binary so that we don't get
that we don't get an error saying like
file already but in the process so once
you have that all typed out let's go
ahead and debug and as you can see right
there the read button is disabled and
until you open a file it'll be disabled
so now we open the file you can now read
the file and we should just be reading
this C character a year yep and say we
want to read this a character right here
well we're just going to tell the binary
reader to read at this offset one zero
so we're going to go up here I'm going
to say BR dot based stream dot position
equals the position that you want to
read from and don't get mixed up here
this is in hexadecimal not decimal so
this isn't ten this is one zero in
hexadecimal we're going up to 0 X 1 0
because this will represent that it's
hexadecimal
so now we should have it need um a let
me put this button because it will first
it will navigate to this position
and then it will read this a carrot or
read one character so now when we agree
machines to a yep and you want to read
multiple characters like say we want to
read Adam right here or Adam then we can
do the characters nothing and this will
return a character array so instead of
setting is doing a dot to string here
we're going to use a for each statement
to go through each of the row for each
of the characters in this character
array
and then we're going to print out each
of the characters in this character
array into our text box oh and we need
to specify how many characters you want
to read so say we wanted to read like
four or Adam so we're going to put four
in here and it will read four characters
so we'll put four characters into an
array and then it will loop through it
each time therefore each character in
the array it will look through it and
then print it into the text box so now
when we debug here and open this text
file we should get Adam in this text box
yep and the last thing I'm going to show
you is how to read numbers so say you
want to read just this zero one right
here and will read as I'm 16 so we'll
start with you so we're going to go
ahead and do er read in 16 or short and
then we're going to have it meet it into
a text box and then we're going to do
the to string method you can go to a
string and then we're going to put X in
here so it will be in hexadecimal and
since the position of this is 1 II was
going to put one right here and this is
a 16-bit integer meaning that it's 2
bytes so we're going to start one bite I
had up here so read these two bytes and
we should get 1s text box well at least
that's what you think you thank you that
you give one in this text box or 0 0 0 1
well actually we're going to get 1 0 0
and that's because the binary reader
default you reads in little-endian byte
order meaning that it reads from the
right to the left so we're read 0 1 and
then at read 0 0 so it got 1 0 0
and this is called again little-endian
byte order well we want it to read in
big endian by order meaning it reads
from a lot to the right and there's no
easy way for it to do that so in the
next tutorial I'm going to show you how
to reverse it so that it will read in
the correct order or it will read it to
you in the correct order so that's it
for this tutorial
in the next tutorial like I said we're
gonna I'm going to show you how to read
it in the correct order so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
