later our war has finally finished
fermenting and basically what we're left
with is some warm flat beer I can go
ahead and call it beer because it does
have alcohol in it but this isn't really
anything that you would want to drink
right now because like I said it's very
flat any carbon dioxide that was created
has escaped already so what we want to
do now is through the bottling process
is actually when your beer becomes
carbonated and I'm going to talk about
that more in detail later on but first
let me go over all the supplies that we
need for bottling first we need your
sanitizer
of course don't need to explain that and
some obvious things of course beer
bottles now a five gallon batch beer
makes about 50 to 55 cases of beer and
actually depends on you know how much
you lost during you know different
processes but basically give about two
cases or 50 bottles of beer and aside
from beer bottles of course you need
beer caps sure these things right here
and also the beer capper which is this
which is basically we're going to put
the caps on the bottles and this is what
crimps it now if you bought a kit then
you probably have some type of a beer
capper in your kit already now you also
could use a bottling tree now this is
actually really handy and all this is is
basically whenever we're done sanitizing
our bottles I mean go ahead and set them
on there like that it makes things a
whole lot easier now another thing
you're going to need is priming sugar
now I'll talk about why we need sugar
later on but basically if you bought a
kit it's going to come with some priming
sugar if you bought all the ingredients
from scratch then what you can do is you
can actually use plain one table sugar
it's going to work fine and you also
need 16 ounces of water so if you have a
water bottle
works perfectly this is 16.9 ounces of
clothes on table now aside from that of
course we need our beer that's obvious
and you can also use a siphon now some
people actually don't have one of these
siphons because they didn't get a kit
and they actually siphon it by mouth
like you're stealing gas from a car or
something by never did that but
basically it's really handy if you get
one of these siphons that you don't have
to suck on because of course your mouth
can contaminate it especially if you
know it's been in some dirty places so
aside from that need our bottling bucket
now make sure that we have the spicket
or spigot however you say it
and also the tube now whenever we
sanitize everything it's very important
to make sure we sanitize these as well
and the last thing that we need is this
this is a bottle filler and you see if I
can get my camera to focus on all right
so basically what's going to happen is
we're going to hook this end up to the
tube for our bucket and whenever we
press down on the bottle a valve right
here is going to open and it's going to
allow beer to flow in the bottles then
when we release it it closes and the
cool thing about this is if you can do
it right it puts the perfect amount of
beer in your bottle so again get a
bottle filler and then once you have all
those supplies you're good to go we're
ready to start bottling the beer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
