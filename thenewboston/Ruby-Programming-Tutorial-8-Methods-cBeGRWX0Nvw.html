tutorial and in this lesson I want to
talk to you guys about something called
methods now you know how I said that
objects have attributes while objects
can also have something called methods
now methods are the things that objects
do ok let's go ahead and talk about this
for a little bit you know how I said
everything in life is an object I'm an
object my car's an object well aside
from just having attributes like blue
green old smelly objects can also do
things for example like I said I'm an
object I can talk I can eat chicken
nuggets
I can make tutorials these are things
that I do so these would be my methods
now computers can also do things now
they can't eat chicken nuggets and make
tutorials like me but they can do some
things like print text on the screen
play sounds make graphics so those are
the methods that computers can do and
those are the methods that we're going
to be learning how to create so let's go
ahead and create a simple method that
prints text on a screen now just like
attributes all methods or I want to back
up because that isn't entirely true but
the methods that we're going to create
in this tutorial these methods have to
go inside a class so I'm just going to
go ahead and make a class called Buckey
and I'm going to make a method now in
order to make a method the very first
thing we need to do is give it a name
now whenever we give a method a name
technically in rubyprogram it's called
defining a method so we're a de F and
I'll just go ahead and name it talk
because I'm just going to go ahead and
print some text out on the screen
something I would say so you can name it
whatever you want but I'm going to name
my method talk
so pretty much we need to give the
method a title now in the next line we
need to give it instructions what do we
want this method to do well all I want
this method to do is print something on
the screen so I'm going to go ahead and
write puts and write something stupid
like hi my
is lucky explanation point and go ahead
and hit enter so that's all this method
is going to do we defined a method it's
name is talk and its job is to print
something out on the screen that says hi
my name is Bucky now in order to end
your method go ahead and right end now
how does this know that we want to end
the method in not the class well it
knows that we want to end the method
because that's the most recent thing
we're working with so whenever we hit
and first it knows automatically that we
want to end our method now let's go
ahead and write end again and hit enter
and it automatically knows that whenever
we hit it this time it means end the
class so think of this method is being
embedded inside this class so these
three lines in the middle other are the
method in this class Bucky and end at
the end and at the end it's kind of a
weird way to say it but that's the class
and of course we get nil which basically
means okay you don't have any errors
you're good to go so now with that being
said we have a method created in the
class Bucky we have something called
talked so how do we use our method well
just like attributes anytime you want to
use anything in your class you need to
have an object so I'm going to go ahead
and make an object called Bo 2 stands
for Bucky object it also stands for body
odor but in this case I'm just going to
say Bo equals Bucky object equals Bucky
nu so Bo is an object from the Bucky
class and of course it's a new object
this is the first time we're creating it
go ahead and hit enter so now we have Bo
bucket object stored at this location in
memory the location not really important
so you know how in order to access an
attribute you go ahead and write the
object and then we use the dot separator
or a period and then we go ahead and
write the name of the attribute well
this is the exact same thing with
methods in order to use this method go
ahead and write your object name which
is Bo
period and then the method name now go
ahead and press ENTER and now your
method is going to run whatever
instructions you have in that method
that's what is going to
happen so basically all this method does
is print out on the screen hi my name is
Bucky so whenever we call our method
which is talk and press Enter it prints
out on the screen hi my name is Bucky so
just remember this objects have
attributes and they also have methods
attributes are like characteristics of
the object and methods are jobs that the
object can do so basically just remember
that objects attributes and methods if
you remember that you'll be good to go
so this was a very basic method that we
created all it did was print something
out on the screen but these methods are
going to get more complex and there's
more to methods than just creating a
simple line and you'll see there's a
whole nother world that I didn't show
you guys yet but for now thank you guys
for watching don't forget subscribe and
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
