your 14th seed tutorial in this tutorial
I'm going to be teaching you guys about
an array now what an array is it's
pretty much a way that you can store
multiple items of the same type in your
computer or in other words this might be
a little easier to understand you can
store multiple values in a single
variable so um you might not be able to
grasp a concept yet but I promise you by
the end of this tutorial you'll be an
array expert so the first thing that you
need to do again just like a normal
variable is define it so go ahead and
type whatever value you're going to be
returning or going to be storing it I'm
going to be just working with numbers so
I'm going to go ahead and write int for
injured next you're going to need to
name your array give it any name you
want I'm going to name mine Bucky now
the next thing you do is a little
different than uh finding a single
variable you need square brackets and
inside the square brackets you have to
type whatever number you're going to
want to reserved in your memory now
since I'm going to be storing five
different values in this array I'm going
to go ahead and write the number five
and what that does is tell your compiler
in your computer alright we're going to
have five numbers so go ahead go into my
memory and reserve five spaces for this
array so it's going to go okay done the
next thing that we're going to want to
do is assign variables or assign values
to the elements in this array now
although we have five different elements
we just built in Bucky we don't start
with the number one and go to five your
computer since it loves zeros and ones
it's going to start with the value 0 and
go 0 1 2 3 4 so 0 2 4 are the elements
you're going to be able to work with not
1 2 5 so your maximum is always 1 less
than whatever you define and I'll show
you guys what this means later but to
store different values in each of the
elements what we need to do is do just
that so this is how you do that go ahead
and write the name of your array and
this is just for assigning values then
since zero is our first element we need
to assign a value to this so go ahead
Bucky zero equals and we'll just put 16
and we do this for the entire list of
our array so Bucky one equals a 21 now
let's just go ahead and make a simple
print statement to make sure that this
is working all right / f % D might as
well put a new line for formatting and
go ahead and instead of your variable go
ahead and pull whatever element in their
rate is so Bucky zero now let's go ahead
and compile and run this and we should
get the number 16 come on come on no
whammy no whammy right there 16 but what
happens if we um try to print out an
element that hasn't been assigned a
value yet such as 3 well I'm not even
sure myself so let's go ahead and test
it out got feeding my curiosity you know
ooh that's interesting that might be a
location memory I don't know but we
don't want to do that so what you want
to do is before you go ahead and do it
all that you want to go through your
array and make your entire list and
assign values to each of those numbers
now
you can either do that Bucky zero Bucky
one way to Bucky three Bucky four and
that will give you your five but there's
a much easier way to do this and I'm
going to show you guys that right now
instead of doing one number by one
number what you can do is define the
values right when you're defining your
array so put Bucky five equals and then
in your curly braces all you have to do
is type in five values so let's type in
21 13 4 30
five fifty six and seven and what this
is going to do is assign the element
number zero one two three four five in
this is also called the position number
because it's what position in the array
it is so Bucky zero is going to equal
twenty one Bucky one is going to equal
13 Bucky to four thirty five 356 four
seven and remember even though this is
five that just means there's five
elements it doesn't mean you need five
or your position number doesn't go to
five so again when you define an array
and have this is how many um spaces in
memory is going to take up but remember
your position number starts at zero so
it's always 1 less than that now let's
say we want to print out a Bucky three
so again let's print that out and it's
going to go well here's Bucky zero
here's Bucky one two three so we're
going to get the number 56 so let's go
ahead and see that right there come on
come on no whammy no whammy right there
56 and this is how you can store
multiple values in a single variable and
go ahead and experiment with this and um
another thing I want to teach you guys
one last time is if you're making a list
and you want to find out how many
elements you have but you don't exactly
know how many you're have maybe you have
the user input a certain number of
things and you don't know how many it's
going to be you can leave this number a
blank in when defining your array and
what this will do is tell your computer
are right I don't know how many numbers
were going to have but I do know we're
going to have an array so just reserve a
bunch of space and then let's make a
couple more numbers here and then what
your computer does is automatically
that number and it pretty much just does
everything automatically for you that's
all you need to know for right now so
let's go ahead and print on a number
like a seven so we'll go 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
should get the number 32 so let's go
ahead and do that
come on 32 32 BAM right there
so again in conclusion that is your
intro to array and I know it might seem
still kind of confusing but I promise in
the next couple tutorials we're going to
be building some simple programs and I'm
showing you and I'll show you why in
array is actually useful and not just
have to have fun with so again thank you
guys for watching hopefully understood a
little bit about arrays but I'll promise
I'll be clearing this up for you in the
next couple tutorials so again thank you
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
