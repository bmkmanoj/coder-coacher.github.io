between pure substance and mixtures
let's go ahead and talk about pure
substances some more so as you can see
from this amazing graph that someone
made a pure substance can be broken up
into two different things
elements and compounds so what the heck
is the difference between an element in
a compound well let's go ahead and take
a look at this slide basically
everything in the world and I know I
didn't talk to you guys about atoms yet
but everything in the world is made up
of these tiny little things called atoms
and for now just imagine these things as
like tiny little balls and okay go ahead
and leave your jokes in the comments
below everything is made up of tiny
little balls called atoms now anytime
you have a material that is made up of
only one type of these balls it's called
an element so these balls a bunch of
different types of balls exist some
might be blue some might be orange some
might be big so it might be little
whenever you have a material that's made
up of only one type of these balls or
atoms it's called an element whenever
you have something that's made up of
different types of balls or different
atoms it's called a compound make sense
so let me go ahead and not explain you
guys an example that I want to talk to
you guys about a material that you guys
are probably all familiar with gold gold
is a basic pure element if you took a
chunk of gold and you cut it up and cut
it up and cut it up and looked at it
under a microscope cut it up cut it up
cut it up some more until you can only
see what they were made out of atoms
you'd see that every single atom and a
piece of gold is the exact same it's the
exact same gold atom
however water is not the same if you cut
up water water water and you had a
microscope powerful enough to see the
atoms you would see that hey this isn't
just one water atom it's made up of
different kinds of atoms or balls some
of them are hydrogen some of them are
oxygen and I'm sure you guys heard h2o
that means it takes two hydrogen atoms
and one oxygen atom
to make water so some things like gold
pure substances are made up of all the
same atoms however other things and this
is again called compounds are made up of
two or more different types of atoms so
if we go ahead and take a look at our
graph now basically we can have a pure
substance in the two different types of
pure substances are elements which is
made up of all the same atom and
compounds which are made up of different
types of atoms and I know that it kind
of seems like compounds should go ahead
and fit in this mixtures category but it
doesn't and whenever we learn about
atoms you'll see why basically because
hey I'm just teaching the stuff I didn't
make it up if I made it up maybe I throw
it in mixtures who know but anyways
that's the way it is and if you're
taking the test to make sure to say that
elements and compounds are both pure
substances or else you're going to get F
on it so anyways thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and next
time we're going to be talking about
these different types of mixtures it's
going to be awesome so thank you don't
forget subscribe and I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
