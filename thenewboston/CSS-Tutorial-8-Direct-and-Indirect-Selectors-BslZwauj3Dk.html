tutorial last time we talked about
direct child selectors and this time
we're going to be talking about direct
adjacent selectors now what's rep
adjacent selectors do is allow you to
apply a certain rule or declaration to
any element when it appears side by side
it shares the same parent now it's
easier to see so let me go ahead and
show you the syntax for this say we
wanted to apply red text to any heading
to when it appeared side by side and
share the same parent as a paragraph so
here's what we would do type in P for
paragraph add a plus sign on type
heading 2 and type any declaration your
want i'm going to use text color red
then end your declaration now what this
does right here is apply red text to any
heading to when and only when appears
directly side by side with a paragraph
and it has the same parent let's go
ahead and show you what this looks like
with XHTML the parent tag I'm going to
be using is the div tag and of course we
have our paragraph and let's say let's
just type this is text in our paragraph
now let's end our paragraph right there
and right under it apply your second
heading and type this is heading to now
let's close our heading to and of course
close our div tag now as you can see
heading to is appearing directly next to
our first paragraph and it's sharing the
same parent the div tag so let's go
ahead and save that and see what it
looks like as you can see the heading to
now has read text this is the effect of
a direct adjacent selector allows you to
apply a CSS rule to a element when it
appears next to the adjacent selector
now let's say that we have another
heading in between them heading 3 this
is 3 now you can see that they're not
adjacent to another and they have a
element in between them so let's go
ahead and save that and see what it
looks like now as you see so they are
not directly adjacent know CSS rules are
applied no red text anywhere
so now that we learn how to apply direct
adjacent selectors let me show you guys
how to apply an indirect adjacent
selector as you can see the syntax you
use for this is called a tilde which is
above the tab key on the left hand side
of your keyboard if you hold down the
shift key now as you can see I put one
between the P in the heading to and what
this allows you to do is apply the rule
to your selector when it is indirectly
related to this element so anytime h2
and the paragraph share the same parent
and in this case the div tag it's going
to apply red text to the heading so
let's go ahead and save this and see
what it looks like as you can see even
though the heading number two is not
directly touching the paragraph we were
able to use an indirect selector to
affect the text now this very useful
when you want to apply this to select or
relating to another but they're not
touching each other directly remember
when they are touching each other
directly use a direct adjacent selector
which is the plus sign and when they
have the same parent but they're not
touching each other directly use the
till day now in the next section we're
going to be talking about attribute
selectors selectors sorry and if you
miss anything I went over today you can
go to my website the New Boston com I'll
have a step-by-step instruction thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
