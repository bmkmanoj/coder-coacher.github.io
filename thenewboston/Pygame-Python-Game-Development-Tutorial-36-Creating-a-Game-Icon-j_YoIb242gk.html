36th PI game tutorial from Python
programming net for bugging a new Boston
where we left off we've got our apple
gutter awesome looking snake and now I
want to upgrade our icon and by icon I
mean the wool image in your window so
what's something close out of this and
this is our image that we're talking
about now it just so happens that the PI
game logo is a snake so the logo is a
snake here although it's really blurry
at least on Windows um just what happens
in snake but I want to show you guys how
you can update it anyways so that's what
we're going to do here so cute quit okay
now to update that we're going to go
right where we set our caption to the
window which was right here like right
at the top of our script basically so
pygame got displayed on set caption
right underneath that is we're going to
add the update to work on icon so to
update the icon what we just need to do
is first of all we want to specify what
the icon is going to be so we're going
to say icon equals PI game dot image dot
load and then this is where you put in
the image that you want to load since we
are my image anyways and hopefully yours
is in the exact same directory as a
script
there's no path or anything like that to
it so I'm just going to Apple to dot PNG
again depending on what system you're
running and all of that you may need to
give a full absolute path to any of the
images any of the images that we
referenced but on Windows you probably
won't have to so that's the icon now we
want to use that icon in our window so
to do that we go pygame diet display dot
set underscore icon and then we just say
what the icon is and in our case it's
just icon now a quick aside the icon the
best size for an icon is going to be 32
by 32 so you can even have something
is a different size that is not 32 by 32
but you're going to find that it goes to
stretch it kind of - 32 by 32 and
sometimes it is a very bad job
stretching it so with our Apple our
Apple is 30 by 30 so we're probably
going to get away with it but if you
have an image that's like 10 by 10
you're probably not going to get away
with it it's not going to look very good
same thing if you have like a 100 by 100
image it might not look the greatest so
anyway we'll save and run that and we'll
see what we got so as you can see we've
got our Apple now as the logo or icon so
it worked out pretty well just to use
the exact same Apple we could also use
the snake and maybe the snake would be a
good example because the snake is only
20 by 20 so um for example we could take
snake head to that PNG copy that and
just paste it into the icon
save and run that and yeah you can see
hats I call almost like I got ripped or
something it's just it's not ideal so I
just thought I'd show you guys that real
quick but I like the idea of making it
the Apple anyway so we'll just make it
Apple to PNG make sure we did everything
again yeah okay so that's that now
there's one other thing I want to do in
this video and that is fix the apples a
location on the screen it will never be
fully off the screen but it could be a
whole 20 pixels off the screen so that's
kind of a problem and this problem arose
as soon as we change the size of the
Apple from 10 by 10 just a box to 30 by
30 that's that's basically when we we
screwed up but um and then we I just
happen to not see it happen until really
recently that the Apple was off the
screen
so anyway scrolling down here we're
looking for R and Apple X&amp;amp;Y I think
let's see right so in the definition of
Randolph Alex and Rand Apple Y you can
see this is our code and it's anything
between zero the display width - block
size well again that was okay when the
block size was identical and actually
now it's a 20 by 20 right so look yeah
so it'll be 20 by 20 so now it's
actually only capable of being
ten pixels off the screen still not
ideal so instead of block size what we
want it to be as Apple thickness which
is down here so we're actually going to
need to pull that pull this definition
of Apple thickness up so I'm going to
cut that and we're gonna write on up and
actually we'll put apple thickness at
the top here so like right actually
Apple thing this isn't even going to
change so let's put apple thickness
right by block size so we'll paste apple
thickness up there now we go and let me
do a ctrl F and I'm going to type in R
and apple like that and we'll find all
of them so I think we've got a couple of
these actually so I'm going to paste
paste so it's display with - apple
thickness display height - apple
thickness and then we'll do another
search for the random apples just make
sure yeah so we got some more down here
so we actually we got it disappearing
three times so really we should probably
make a function for these and they
that's what we'll do I think probably in
the next videos we're going to make a
function that will handle these because
this is pretty sloppy to have this as
many times so again though um just to
fix what's here at the moment block size
needs to be replaced with apple
thickness apple thickness apple
thickness and apple thickness there and
now that should be it yes fancy the end
of our script so we can save and run
that and just make sure that we're not
getting errors and stuff so to play
there's our apple looks like it's doing
what we expect oh crap
I hit both keys wires he's very bad at
this game um so anyway yeah it looks
like our apples am acting as it should
now and now hopefully it won't be even a
little bit off the screen so that's good
so now in the next video I was going to
do score probably but I noticed that
we're kind of like hard-coded this
function that basically runs three
different times in our script so we
definitely want to fix that as well
because for exactly the reasons I've
just shown
anytime we want to make a modification
we're having to edit in quite a few
places which is obviously not ideal so
with that that's what we're going to do
in the next videos we'll have this
actually as a function and that'll
hopefully make it a little bit better so
hopefully guys enjoyed as always thanks
