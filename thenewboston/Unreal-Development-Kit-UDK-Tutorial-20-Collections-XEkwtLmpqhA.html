decades or Oh and in this tutorial
actually in these upcoming tutorials I'm
gonna be teaching you guys how to create
your own custom materials because check
out these materials right here we have a
limited amount of materials that we can
work with and they probably aren't the
best materials of choice whenever you're
creating your level so therefore we need
to learn how to create our own custom
materials but before I do that we need
to get a little more familiar with this
thing called the content browser so go
ahead and open up your content browser
and clear everything out by hitting all
assets X and clear and once you have
everything cleared out you're ready to
learn what I need to teach you and
that's this section over here I kind of
browsed over it whenever I was talking
to you guys about the interface or I
don't even know what story I was talking
about but now I want to tell you guys a
little bit more about this section right
here and the differences between
collections and packages because
whenever we're creating our own
materials we're gonna be storing them in
packages instead of storing our
materials in collections actually we can
do both but there's a difference and
that's what I'm gonna be teaching you
guys so first of all let me tell you
guys what a collection is a collection
is pretty much like your favorite folder
on Windows or maybe unlike your internet
or whatever
it's basically your favorites so shared
collections is whenever you're working
with a team these are the things you
want to share like your favorite
materials or maybe the particles that
you use in your game now my collections
those are your personal collections so
buckey's that's the stuff that I you say
if I was working alone on the level this
is the stuff that I would commonly use
so let me go ahead and show you guys how
to create one right here go ahead and
enter a name I'm gonna put like Lucky's
and go ahead and click okay and now like
I said a collection is pretty much like
a favorites folder so now you can see if
we double click this we get nothing in
our folder by default because we didn't
add anything yet
so say I was working on game and I
wanted to have materials and make sure
you go up to all assets go to materials
and then go down to building materials
right here and I say alright I want this
material right here that I'm gonna be
using a lot so I want to add this to my
collection in order to add this to my
collection right here just go ahead and
hit this little button right here and
what this does is added one asset -
Bucky's fav so now if we go ahead and
open click Bucky's fav we get that
material right in there pretty cool huh
so now let's go ahead to all assets
again and say if I wanted to add
multiple ones just hold this hold ctrl
and ctrl and ctrl and if I hit this plus
button it adds all of those four to my
favs so now I have all five materials in
my favs so that's the basics of what my
collections is like I said it's
basically just a favorites folder so in
order to remove any of these from my
collection just go ahead and right-click
and hit remove or you can just go ahead
and select them all by holding the ctrl
and right click in and hit remove from
collection so now I have nothing in my
collection and if I wanted to delete my
entire collection just go ahead and hit
remove selected collection and it
verifies that you want to delete it and
I do want to delete it so now what we're
gonna be doing is actually let me think
for a second okay in the next tutorial
I'm gonna be telling you guys how to
make your own individual packages and
how they differ from collections and I'm
also going to be teaching you guys how
to open the material editor and
eventually we're going to be creating
our own materials like these right here
so it's gonna be definitely awesome you
definitely want to check it out so thank
you guys for watching and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
