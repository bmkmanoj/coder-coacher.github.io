tutorial and Dreamweaver last time we
learned how to create a basic layout for
a basic website and this time I'm gonna
be talking about how to format text now
at the bottom you can see we have some
basic formatting options such as the
font style the size of the font color
and also you can bold and italicize your
text so to do this select the text you
want to edit I'm gonna select my heading
and if you want to change your font
style just click get down here to font
and select whatever you want to change
it to and if you have a font that you
don't see on the list you can click edit
font list and you can see all of your
available fonts and if you want one just
select it and add it to the list
then press ok so I'm going to change my
heading to this Pristina font and as you
can see my heading has now changed font
styles I'm also going to click this text
color option and change the color to
blue if I click out of it you can now
see that my font heading is now Pristina
and blue you can also format entire
paragraphs like this say I wanted to
change the size of this paragraph to
make it larger I'd highlight the entire
paragraph go down the size and click
large
as you can see the entire text is now
larger and let's say I wanted to change
the font to century gothic I'll just
click that and now our font has been
formatted to larger and century gothic
now one thing you want to add sometimes
to the bottom of your website is a
copyright symbol and since you just
can't type it in you're going to need to
insert a special symbol from our text
pane and to do that here's what you do
under your insert panels at the top and
if you can't see this just go to Windows
and make sure your insert panel is
checked under your insert panel click
the text tab now at the very right hand
side you'll see a drop down list if you
click it you can see all the special
characters you can add if you click
other characters you can see all of the
characters or if you click it and drop
down they give you a quick selection of
some commonly used ones so I'm going to
go ahead and click the copyright one and
as you can see it inserted a copyright
symbol at the bottom of our website so
I'm going to just go ahead and type
copyright the
new boston.com and this is how you can
add a copyright to the bottom of your
webpage now that we know how to insert
special characters let me talk to you
about something called line breaks and
non-breaking spaces anytime you want to
make a new paragraph let's say we wanted
to split this into two paragraphs and we
press the Enter you can see that there's
a space above and below this paragraph
now this is useful when creating new
paragraphs but sometimes you don't want
this extra space in between and you just
want to continue on to the next line
well to do this you need to insert
something called a line break and to do
this hold down the shift key and then
press Enter as you can see now the text
rather than having a space in the new
paragraph it just continues on to the
very next line this is a very useful
when you're trying to format paragraphs
in this kind of way the next thing I
want to talk to you guys about is called
a non-breaking space now let's say you
wanted to add some spaces between the
first and heading words as you can see
when I press spacebar adds one space but
if I keep tapping spacebar then it
doesn't add any more spaces
this is to better organize the code but
sometimes you actually want to actually
add some more spaces so if you actually
want to add some more spaces and not
just one if you press the spacebar it
doesn't do a whole lot so here's what
you need to do hold down the ctrl +
Shift key on your keyboard and then when
you press space you're allowed to add
more spaces to your website and this is
how you make a non-breaking space now
let's say you want to add a date and
time to your website to do this is very
easy
some people add it at the bottom of
their website the show on their web page
was last updated just go up to insert
and go down to date you now have a list
of dates you can add to your website so
pick the format you want and if you're
thinking all right I can just type that
in I'll probably be a lot quicker well
here's a secret inserting dates on your
website this box right here
automatically update unsaved check that
and click OK now what this does is every
time you save your file it automatically
updates the date for you so you never
have to change it again and that's when
people say last updated this is the
feature that they use
and one of the last things I want to
talk to you guys about is the spell
check feature on Dreamweaver so let's
just type a wrong word here Apple and
we'll type it correct right there to use
spell check highlight any of the text
that you want to check then go up to the
text in your main menu and click check
spelling as you can see it found that
the word Apple that we typed your own
was not found in the dictionary so it
gives us such many suggestions click the
one that we want and click change if you
don't want it then you can click ignore
and it says do you want to continue your
checking the rest of the document in
this case that we don't so we'll click
no now any time you want to undo a
previous action you can click hold down
the ctrl key and press Z to undo as you
can see it undoes what we just did and
changes it back to Apple spelled around
and any time you want to redo it hold
down the ctrl key and press Y these are
some hot keys that are very useful now
that we learn how to format basic text
add some line breaks in non-breaking
spaces add an automatically updating
date and time and also undo and redo and
spellcheck we're ready to begin
formatting our paragraphs in we'll do
that in the next section but if you
missed anything we went over today I'm
gonna have it all on my site the new
boston.com so you can check it out first
