illustrator c6 video today we're gonna
learn how to create some more shapes
we're gonna learn about creating
polygons and stars we're gonna do some
line segments and if we don't go past
the time then we'll learn how to create
some other things as well so let's start
out over here on the left this is the
polygon tool and if you click and hold
you can see that there's a polygon tool
and a star tool so if you click on the
polygon tool you click and drag it's
gonna create a polygon for you and now
if you don't know what a polygon is it's
just basically a shape that has more
than four sides so five or more is a
polygon four sides is a square and three
is a triangle and then anything less
than that is just a line so two is a
line and one point is just a dot I guess
so let's go on and I'll show you a
couple more things that we can do if you
click and then you hold shift it's gonna
create a proportional shape for you and
you can see as I'm moving around it's
not spinning or anything because I have
shift held down right now if I click and
not hold shift you can see I can spin
this around and do whatever I want there
and that's how the shape goes another
tip that you can use if you want a
specific number of sides or anything
like that just click but don't drag on
the object here or on the artboard here
and then this little dialog box will
come up you can select the radius that
you want which is going to be how big it
is so if I do like a radius of like 25
and then you can choose the amount of
size that you want so I'll go ahead and
choose 5 which is a Pentagon I click and
it's going to make a Pentagon here with
a radius of 25 and the radius is going
to start out from the center and it's
going to come out to these points here
so I'll just go ahead and do another one
real quick let's make this radius a
hundred and 25 and where you click is
where the word
the shape is going to be made so I click
OK and now you can see I've got a seven
sided polygon here not too sure I can't
remember what a seven sided polygon is
called but that's what we've got and
that's how you work with these polygons
so it's gonna delete a few of these and
I'll show you the Stars the Stars are a
little bit different if you click and
hold and you come here to the star tool
and click and drag you get a star and
this is gonna be the default shape this
this star has five sides and you can
also hold down shift to get it to be
proportional and straight and everything
like that for your star now go ahead and
click and then we get some new things
with our star now the stars in
Illustrator are defined by two different
radiuses and then you got the number of
points here I can increase this to like
twelve points and then our two radiuses
I'll explain here one the top one here
is from the distance to the from them I
mean from the center to the outermost
points so if I start here it's going to
come out to these points and then you
got the second radius here which is
towards the innermost points so the
innermost points here like where my
mouse is circling around so these points
so you can change your star up it so if
we want to have like some kind of like
an oblong star so let me get rid of all
this stuff let's try like something like
25 then we got 12 points and I'll hit OK
and you can see now we've got a
cool-looking sunburst kind of thing that
I've made here and you can just mess
around with these bring this make it
like proportionate or something like
that 50 and 50 and then we'll lower the
amount of points to something like 6 and
that is what the happens when you start
going proportionate with your stars it
turned into a polygon so that's the
coolest thing that I want to show you
now if you want to just make make it a
little bit better let's go do something
like 150 and then 50 to make it more
like a real star and there you go
so what I usually do when I'm doing
these I go my innermost points are set
at something like 50 and then I do three
times the amount to get the outermost
points to get some what kind of a cool
shape for my star that looks like
something that might be real so that's
uh what I wanted to show you about
making the Stars and the polygons and
you just you can remember over here on
the left if you click and hold that's
where these are the polygon tool and the
star tool and the main thing to remember
is that you just click on the artboard
if you want to manually enter in or need
to change the number of points that the
or sides that these stars are polygons
have so thanks a lot for watching the
video you guys and stay tuned and we're
learn how to create some segmented lines
all this stuff is a little basic but
when you're working in a big project
you'll it uses a bunch of different
basic methods to create an overall big
project so thanks a lot for watching
once again and I look forward to seeing
you guys in the next one have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
