tutorial for the new boss in again my
name is Travis
welcome back what we're going to do in
this tutorial is basically finish up our
Splash activity for the most part and
kind of use this thread so you guys get
kind of familiar with the layout that we
have set up here again a thread looks
for the run method and then we're going
to try to do something if it can't do
that or it messes up we're going to
catch the exception and then we have
this one last math method that we can
use for whatever we want so let's get
our activity going again we want our
activity basically to pause for five
seconds and we can use a method from the
thread class again called sleep now
allow us to just pause our thread and
not do anything for however long we want
for the most part and the method is
pretty easy just sleep like this and
what what goes within its parameters is
basically how many milliseconds we want
it to sleep so we're going to say 5,000
milliseconds which is equal to five
seconds
well conversion lesson for you guys get
added bonus with this Android series so
there you go so now our application is
going to sleep for five seconds and what
this catch exceptions if it can't get to
interrupt or if there's an interrupted
exception of some sort we're going to
catch that so we define that interrupted
exception variable arms I'm sorry that's
the type of exception we're looking for
and we named that II so within here we
can do the standard for the most part
catch and that's just print stacktrace
can you guys don't really need to know
what that does it basically just kind of
throws it around it does it doesn't
really matter that's for debugging
hopefully your application will run
perfectly we won't have to worry about
the exceptions but basically all I just
want you guys realize is we name this
variable so we can use that variable
within the case for the most part
probably doesn't make sense sorry so
basically now our application sleeps for
five seconds and how are how are we
going to start our new activity is what
the question is and where are we going
to do that well we could do that right
below the here
so it's going to sleep for five seconds
then I'll go to the next line of code
and we could start our activity here but
just to use the framework of this thread
for the most part we are going to do it
within our finally bracket so after it
gets done trying all everything within
these brackets and going to go to this
finally bracket the start activity is
pretty simple there's a few ways you can
do it but the method is called start
activity I believe that's from the
activity class and yeah it's from the
activity class we can use that because
again we're extending the activity class
there's a few ways we can start an
activity but probably the simplest way
for you guys to start out is if we hover
over here it shows that it takes an
intent within its parameters and that's
what I should say there's a few ways to
set up an intent now we don't have an
intent yet but we're going to define one
real quickly and real simply same way we
make any other type of variable we
define the type which is going to be
intent and and basically then we give
this intent to name so we're going to
say open starting-point basically that's
going to be the intent name again you
guys can label that whatever we need to
import intent so we can use its suite
methods we're going to set this equal to
new intent
and then we put up parentheses and we
hit in quotations what we want our
intent action name to be and you guys
might remember what the action name is
but I'll go over it again basically our
action name is the new comm dot the new
Boston
Travis dot starting point and then we
have to finish off this statement with a
semicolon as always and now what we're
going to do is within the start activity
that's where we're going to set up our
intent that we just created called open
starting point there we go now it's
going to open or start the activity
called starting point our based off the
intent called starting point and this
intent is going to create a new intent
based off of this action name and this
action name has to match up with
manifest so just remember what I typed
out here calm down the new Boston Travis
that starting point we set that up in a
few tutorials ago but I'm just going to
really Erised you guys with that with
the Android manifest and open that up
and here's the action name so this is
what we're setting our intent equal to
is this action name so when we start an
activity it's going to look at the
intent and the intent is basically the
intent of this starting name or action
name so it's going to look through the
manifest find this reference and then
it's going to be like oh that's of the
starting-point class that's the class
I'm going to start so that's kind of how
it works so again this reference has to
be exactly the same as the reference we
created in our splash activity right
here for intent otherwise you guys will
get in there it's always good to kind of
check your program and make sure it
works every so often so you guys save
yourself some time with the errors so
I'm just going to do that real quick
make sure activity works runs for 5
seconds on the splash and then opens our
starting point class there you go voila
thanks again for watching guys I hope
you guys enjoyed the tutorial learn
something new and I'll catch you guys in
the next one
get away have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
