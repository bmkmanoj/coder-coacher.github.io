want to make a video real quick to talk
to you guys about a couple of things and
I think you guys are gonna like this
video because I got some pretty cool
stuff I want to talk to you guys about
but anyways let me start off by saying
this and if you guys have been following
me for a long time then you probably
heard me say this before but I want to
say it again and that is I enjoy making
tutorials and I know it may sound a
little weird but trust me I do if I
could do it 24/7 I would trust me but I
can't I have two jobs I work 70 hours a
week and you know I got stuff to pay for
so I do need to work I have you know a
car loan student loans I got to pay back
I got pay rent for this place so if I
could work making tutorials 24/7 a day I
would because I enjoy it and I know that
sounds kind of nerdy but trust me guys I
love teaching such a large amount of
people this information and trust me I
have the best community in the best
subscribers anyone could ever ask for
just the messages I get day in and day
out saying Bucky thank you you helped me
got a better job or you helped me get
you know through one of my courses in
high school or you helped me pass my
java course in college and all of these
messages in all of you guys just make me
feel so appreciated and it's a feeling
that I can't even begin to explain I'm
so grateful for it and you guys are the
reason for the success of the new Boston
and I will never forget that and I can't
even begin to imagine it's like some of
the most popular youtubers have like a
million subscribers and I'm like well
this is like entertainment everyone in
the world wants to be entertained so I
can kind of see that but I almost have a
hundred and fifty thousand subscribers
and I'm like that many people want to
learn programming I had no idea so I
can't even believe you know the success
of the new Boston and it's all because
of you guys so let me say this whenever
you guys send me messages through my
website in you know my forum or YouTube
you guys probably think I don't read
them because I'm not
really you know I really don't have the
time to respond to everyone but trust me
I read them all and I listened to what
you guys are saying and I try to deliver
the content that you guys want the most
but like I said I just don't have time
but I'm working my butt off to deliver
this content for you guys in by far by
far the most asked for and most
requested toriel's of all time were
Android development Android application
development and I knew that I didn't
have time to do a series on this
completely and like I wanted to so what
I did is I know you guys wanted this
series so I scoured YouTube looking for
Android application development
tutorials or anything like it
even if it was crappy then I would want
to talk to them and see if someone could
get these tutorials develop for me and
you know most of the tutorials on
YouTube would look like someone tried to
you know record him with a potato or
something they're just our terrible
quality but anyways I was looking
through YouTube and I found this channel
called my burning back and this guy
named Travis was making these Android
application development tutorials
exactly what I was looking for exactly
what you guys were requesting so I
started watching a few of these
tutorials you know I was like well
alright
these may be kind of good they might not
be and I started watching these
tutorials and they were crystal clear
the quality was absolutely amazing and
aside from them they were incredibly
informative like you wouldn't believe
and they were actually entertaining and
funny and he just had this awesome
personality to make you want to watch
these tutorials you know even if you
didn't care about Android just to listen
to him he was super fun super energetic
super awesome to listen to and anyways
he was giving all these tutorials away
for free he wasn't trying to sell you
any product and I was like this is
amazing I need to talk to this guy I
need this tutorials because this guy is
exactly what I'm looking for so anyways
I messaged him on his website and on his
forum and on his YouTube channel and I
pretty much was like going crazy wanting
to talk to this guy and he finally
responded and he
one of the most nicest and most genuine
people I've ever met trust me he is just
as nice and as awesome as his tutorial
so anyways I asked them I told him about
the new boss and I was like listen if
you could make these Android tutorials
for me that would be awesome so he
agreed a couple months ago to make these
tutorials and I was just super excited
so again that was a couple months ago
and for the past few months he has been
working his butt off and I know this for
a fact he has been working like crazy to
try to get you guys up to speed and try
to develop these tutorials for you guys
and today I opened my p.o box and from
Travis four am I bring back I got this
little baby right here two hundred some
of the best most amazing Android app
development tutorials exactly what you
guys asked for there you go so again
these tutorials cover everything again I
didn't have time to watch them because
there's two hundred soils but I popped
them in I looked at few of them and they
cover everything from if you don't even
know how to install Java everything from
installing Java all the way to you know
how to put your app on the market and
everything in between it's going to take
you for the most newb beginner you don't
even know what Android is to being a pro
professional Android app developer and
I'm just super excited as you guys can
probably tell so anyways Travis thank
you so much you have no idea how much
this means to me and I want to tell you
guys this if you go to his YouTube
channel again that's youtube.com slash
my bring back he also has a website
called my bring back com it has

everything that you guys would want
everything that I would want to teach
but I don't have the time
trust me go check out his tutorials go
check out his youtube channel and
subscribe please please please it means
so much to me he is one of the coolest
guys I've ever met and like I said he
has been working his butt off for a guy

tutorials and they're gonna be uploaded
probably in the next two or three days
so anyways I talked to him and he's
gonna be uploading a lot more tutorials

definitely one you want to check out and
aside from that I forgot I almost forgot
to even mention this but he's also

is one of the best tablets er is I kind
of want the stab of myself hopefully I

right now so you definitely want to go
check that out again it's the featured
video on his homepage youtube.com slash
my burnback so please everyone go and
subscribe to his channel and leave him
some comments saying thank you and check
out his website as well because he has
done an amazing thing for the new boston
so with that out of the way I just
wanted you to know first of all tell you
guys that the best tutorials ever are
going to be uploaded soon on the New
Boston com and aside from that let me
say this a few years ago it was only
about you know two or three years ago
where big software companies kind of
dominated the software industry you know
unless you're like a Microsoft or you
know Blizzard game developer you weren't
gonna get your software and Walmart you
know you could write the best piece of
software ever but you know it's not like
Best Buy is gonna come to you and ask to
sell your software so it was super hard
to start developing software but
nowadays with smartphones and tablets
the game is changing I'm telling you
guys the playing field is being even out
like crazy you guys would not believe
this so now with these new mediums
through smartphones and tablets it's a
whole entirely new world you don't need
to be a huge company you don't need to
have a master's degree all you need is
the drive in the ambition to learn the
stuff in I'm reading stories every
single day about you know these kids or
these people you know who never even
went to college they are just learning
the this technology learning how to
develop apps and they're you know making
suffer that's incredibly popular in
they're having an enormous amount of
success and I love
reading the stuff day in and day out
because it's just like me and you
people like meaning you who you know sit
in my basement or my room and I just
want to learn I don't you know maybe you
don't have the money to go to college
maybe you don't have the time maybe you
have a family or something but you want
to learn and trust me guys it's a whole
new world than it was you know five
years ago so basically like I said
anyone who has the ambition now anyone
who has the drive and willingness to sit
through and take the time to you know
like watch these videos and learn the
technology the opportunity for your
success has never been greater I am
Telling You guys it's a whole different
game than it was five years ago like I
said it doesn't matter how old you are
it doesn't matter your GPA in high
school it doesn't matter what grades you
got it doesn't matter you know how many
degrees you have mounted on your wall
anyone can become a successful software
developer nowadays thanks to this whole
new medium so that's my little spiel on
that in I don't know it's like it kind
of seems like the entire world is
getting worse you know with the economy
and everything but for the group of us
little software developers
it's definitely turning in our favor and
I'm super excited about it I love it but
anyways now that I you know gave my
little rant about software and you know
the computer industry I want to say one
last time Travis in my burning back
thank you so much for contributing these
videos thank you from not only the new
Boston community but for what you're
doing for free education for the entire
world so for everyone else please like I
said go to his channel youtube.com slash

say thank you because he has worked like
crazy and Travis thank you from the
bottom of my heart and for everyone else
