dessert all right guys
enough singing let's go ahead and learn
how to fit widgets in our layout now I
know just by like looking at the title
of this video bag fitting wit we just
sent our layout don't we like learning
that already well it's kind of hard to
explain so I'm just going to show you
guys a demonstration and then you're
gonna make oh that's pretty cool
hopefully you guys will say that so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to make
three let's just go ahead and make some
labels some very basic labels right on
your screen so of course I'm not going
to make any frames just cuz this is
going to be like a really simple example
so I'm just going to put them directly
in the ROO aka
the main window is going to be the
parent so for the first one I'll just
name it one so again right now we just
have text on the screen it says 1 and
also I don't know if I told you guys
this but you can also change your
background color in the foreground color
by foreground color I just mean the font
color for labels as well so the
background setting of course is BG which
is red and the text color is F G stands
for foreground so this first label
cannot I don't know if we just have
black on there black on red might be
kind of hard to see so we have a label
called 1 it has a red background and it
has a white um font so let me just go
ahead and pack this in the screen right
now so one pack just place it in there
we're actually just going to be um
packing all these things um actually
pack them differently to show you guys a
couple new techniques but anyways let's
make another label right here and name
it - of course the font for this is
going to be 2 and I'll make all of these
different colors so this one is going to
be green and I think black on green will
be pretty easy
now for the second label what I wanted
to do is this I want to pack it in there
of course but what I also want to do is
I'm going to add a new parameter and
that's fill is
equal to X now what this means right
here is right now we have a label now by
default it's just going to be the size
of however big it needs to be so this
label right here is going to be you know
I want to say like about 60 pixels wide
depending on how big the text is now if
we put fill X this means that we're
pretty much want to fill it as long as
the X value of the parent is so if we
stretch the window or make it grow left
and right this label right here it's
going to stay the same size it's not
going to grow this one however is going
to grow in the x-direction and basically
fill this widget is wide as the parent
is so that's what this parameter means
right here so let's make one more widget
and I'll show you guys in the
y-direction and then once you see this
program run everything is going to be
crystal clear so widget three of course
change it to three and I'll put a I'll
give it a blue background and I'll make
this text white as well so now when I
place it on the screen I'm going to pack
it in and I'll actually throw this on
the left hand side so side equals left
we already saw what that does in last
oriole and the fill let's set this equal
to Y so again this is going to be on top
and it's not going to grow or shrink in
any direction this is going to be in the
middle and once I run this it's going to
grow left and right and this is going to
be on the left and it's going to fill Y
so check it out so look what happens
whenever I move my window so one since
it doesn't have any fill the one widget
or the one label is always the same
width and height it only fits whatever
text is inside it's only bigs it needs
to be two however since we put fill X it
says okay what is the size of your
parent in other words the main window
however big that is I'm going to fill
this widget
that direction so it's as because it's
possibly can be now three check that out
now however much you want to grow your
window the root window it's going to
fill it or fit it in that direction so
that my friends is how you can not only
place widgets exactly where you want but
how you can make them dynamic or grow
depending on the size of the parent you
place it in so I also want to mention
one more thing if you guys want access
to any of this source code or maybe um
you try typing it but you got an error
and you can't exactly understand where
I'm going to be putting all of the
source code from all of my tutorials in
my forum so if you just go to my forum
it's going to say something like a
kinter tutorial number three source code
boom copy it paste that check it out
also if you have any questions or if you
just want advice on something
and ask me on my forum and I'll answer
it for you there but anyways thanks for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
