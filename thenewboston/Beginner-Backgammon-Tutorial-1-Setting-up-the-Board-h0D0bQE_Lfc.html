your very first backgammon tutorial now
I know a lot of you guys know me already
and know me for my computer programming
tutorials but what you didn't know is
that I love playing backgammon I've been
playing in my whole entire life I'm
addicted to it absolutely love it so
since I love backgammon the other day I
was bored so I went on YouTube and I
look for Beckham tutorials in backgammon
videos in every single back-ended video
I saw was absolutely horrible all the
tutorials were horrendous so I felt as
the tutorial may lurk on YouTube it was
kind of my obligation to teach you guys
how to play back I mean since I mean
these tutorials were some of the worst
tutorials I have ever seen they
explained it so terribly so it's my job
now to teach you guys how to play
backgammon and make a decent beginners
tutorial so in this next video that's
what I'm about to do so for all of you
who are hoping for computer program
tutorials check out my other videos this
is for backgammon so let's go ahead and
get started now here is the basics of
the game I'm going to assume you this is
the first time you're ever seeing a
backgammon board the basics of the game
is this it's played between two people
in these tutorials I'm going to be white
and you're going to be brown or it kind
of looks like black on the camera to me
right now so each player gets 15
checkers each you have 15 checkers and I
have 15 checkers the goal of the game is
to get all of your checkers off the
board before the other person can get
all of their checkers off the board now
the board is set up like this you have
24 narrow triangles and these are called
points now what I went ahead and did is
I wrote the numbers of your points on
the board but typically when you buy a
backgammon board or if you're playing in
a tournament or something these points
aren't going to be written on the board
I just went ahead and since we're first
learning and I say like 9 point you can
see that this has a nine right there so
it'll just help you follow on
but like I said whenever you buy a
backgammon board don't expect to see the
points so anyways the board consists of
24 triangles called points now yours go
in let's say let's say this is clockwise
order from smallest 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
11 12 and then hops over here it goes
13 through 18 and 19 through 24
so we separate these in six points each
in these are called quadrants one
quadrant two quadrant three quadrant
four project one through six your one
through six is called your home board
your 7 through 12 is called your outer
board my 1 through 6 is called my home
board my 7 through 12 is called my outer
board so whenever I'm saying alright
move a checker into your home board I'm
talking about somewhere your 1 to 6
right here I just wanted to give you
guys the definitions and you know all
the technical words before you know I
started saying something you guys don't
know what I mean so anyways that's all
the terms right now let's go ahead and
just start setting up the board now oh
one more thing this piece in the middle
this is called the bar now typically you
don't want your checkers to end up on
the bar but whenever I refer to the bar
this is what I'm talking about so
anyways like I said let's go ahead and
set up the game right now in order to
set up the game you need to put all of
your 15 checkers on the board now you
just don't put them randomly around like
that you need to set them up in some
special way so here's how you do it go
ahead and take five of your checkers and
put them on your six point just like
that go ahead and take three of your
checkers and put them on your eighth
point
simple enough go ahead and take five of
your checkers and put them on your 13
point just like that and go ahead and
take your last two checkers and put them
on your 24 point and by the way since
your twenty-four point
here in your one point is here you're
going to be moving from highest to
lowest so this is your direction of play
you're going to be taking your checkers
and moving them around here down here
and finally off the board here so you
know you can't move checkers this way
it's invalid so anyways you go from high
to low now for your opponent to set up
their checkers here's what I do I make
an exact mirror image of your checker so
wherever you have five checkers across
from that I'm going to put five checkers
so you have five checkers on your six
I'm going to have five checkers across
from you so since you have two checkers
right here I'm going to go ahead and put
two checkers right here you have three
right here I'm going to go ahead the
three right here and you have five right
here so I'm going to go ahead and put my
five right there now you say all right
we know it's set up right because my
checkers are a perfect mirror image from
your checkers never saying all right
this is a little weird because my
checkers are on your 19-point
and it should be my six point well check
this out whenever i'm playing i'm going
to be playing in this direction right
here remember I'm white
so this point your one is actually my 24
point this may be kind of hard but flip
your computer monitor upside down and
you can see what's going on so one two
three four five six
this is actually my six point and one
two three four five six this is your six
point two so while you're playing in
this direction I'm going to be playing
in this direction in our checkers since
we're playing in opposite directions are
going to come into conflict with each
other and that's where the game gets
interesting so anyways I just want to
tell you guys that this is a basic start
up so if you're playing along pause the
video right now and set your board up
like this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
