video I'm going to show you guys how to
use inheritance in es6 very easy now I'm
guessing that like 95% you guys already
know what inheritance is but for those
few who may not be familiar with it it's
actually really easy to understand so
I'll give you guys like the real quick
30 second overview so say that I was
making a computer game and I wanted to
make a bunch of enemies so I made a
ninja enemy and this ninja can move left
move right and he could attack so I made
three methods in that class now later on
I decided to make like a I don't know an
astronaut and me or a wizard
I guess the astronaut is not really a
great enemy so this wizard and me he can
move left and right and attack so I made
the same methods in there and then later
on let's say I made the astronaut and he
also can move left and right into that
so basically I had all these classes
with duplicate code it was the exact
same code they could all move left and
right in attack now my number-one rule
of software design is never repeat
yourself if you find yourself repeating
yourself then you're probably doing
something wrong
so I thought wouldn't be cool if we
could take all these shared functions
all of this shared functionality stick
it in one base class and then we can
just include it whenever we needed it
well that's what inheritance is
basically making one base class that has
functions that you share and then you
can just include those functions rather
than typing them over and over and over
again so let's say that in this example
who's texting me right now right in the
middle of my video anyways let's say
that in this little demo right here I
was making a game and this game had a
bunch of different types of people maybe
like Sims or I don't know a computer
game whatever so I had programmers and
it had construction workers and nurses
basically a bunch of different
professions now all of these people or
all of these professions had some common
attributes they all had a name they all
had a age and they all had a weight no
matter what profession you are you all
have these same
so instead of just typing this code in
every single class what I'm going to do
is I'm going to actually make this a
base class or the parent class and I can
make other classes that inherit from it
so I'll say class programmer and again I
don't want to have to type all of this
code again so what I can do anytime I
want to include all the stuff in here is
I can just use the keyword extend now
the class you right after this is saying
re go ahead and grab all the code in
person and bring it into this class
that's all of those so now even though
we don't have anything visually to see
in programmer there actually is all of
this code right here and just to kind of
clear things up you see that this person
has a name and age and a weight instead
of just display way I'm actually going
to make display name and display age so
I'll say display name and I might as
well type it I was going to copy it but
let's copy this part so all I want to do
is I want functions to pretty much
output their name and age all right so
even though we can't see it whenever we
make a new object from the programmer
class we can use display name display
age and display weight since we pretty
much took everything from person class
and brought it in using this extends or
inheritance pretty sweet huh now there
are a couple little things that we need
to watch out for
so this parent class or the class to
inherit from it's technically called the
superclass so some people say that this
is the parent and this is the child but
you can also refer to the parent is the
superclass so whenever we set up the
constructor in the child class here I'll
show you guys how to do this
so it's basically similar to the one
before but instead what we wanted to do
is this inside the constructor what
we're going to do is we're actually
going to call the parents constructor so
how do we do that we actually use the
keyword super now the parents
constructor since a programmer is a type
of person essentially we need to create
a person's though it takes a name and
age and a weight so we can just pass
those in right like this now
additionally to just setting the name
the age and weight of a person this
programmer has an extra attribute and
that's language so I'm just going to say
that a programmer also has their
favorite language which can be like
JavaScript or Python or C++ or whatever
so just like before what we can do is
this so check that out
so actually what I am going to do is
kind of start showing you guys a little
demo here so of course Sally is just a
regular person she's not a programmer at
all so we know that we can display her
name her weight and her age so let me
just go ahead and run this and verify
that all right sally has a name in age
and a weight looking good now if I make
another variable called Bucky another
object gets us more technically called
and instead of just being a person he's
actually a programmer then what do I
need to pass in well I need to pass in a
name and age in a weight and also his
favorite language so his name is Bucky
Roberts and what's the next parameter
age 87 weight 987 pounds and his
favorite language
javascript now check this out
display age and I'll just do display
name and actually let me separate this
with a little line so you guys can see
what's going on so of course we know
that Sally stuff prints out fine but
Bucky's information also prints out fine
now if you look inside this programmer
class which Bucky is indeed a programmer
we don't even have the methods display
name and display age
so how come Bucky was able to use those
well that's because whenever we
inherited from person class it pretty
much got all of the methods inside here
and this isn't technically how it works
put but essentially behind the scenes it
pretty much cut them and pasted them
right in there or copy and pasted them I
guess it's slightly more technical and
another thing that you can do is you can
actually give a programmer custom
functions as well so I'll say display
language now say console.log print out
their favorite language so whenever I
run Bucky display language of course it
prints out JavaScript now again only
programmers have access to display
language not a person a person only has
access to these three and a programmer
has access to those three plus whatever
it's in or excuse me whatever is in its
own class so that is the basics of
inheritance again before es6 it was
super complicated but thank God for es6
makes things really easy thing guys for
watching and yeah I'll see you guys next
