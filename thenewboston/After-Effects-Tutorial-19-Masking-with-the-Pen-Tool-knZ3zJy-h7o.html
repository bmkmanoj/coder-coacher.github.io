After Effects tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm going to be teaching you
guys how to make a mask using pen tool
now the advantages of the pen tool is
unlike the other masking shapes this
allows you to create a customizable
shape and probably you're going to be
using this more than any other masking
tool so let's get right down to it
select the pen tool you need to go up to
the top of your screen on your tools
panel and go ahead and click this thing
called ironically the pen tool or if
you're too lazy to go all the way up to
your screen with your mouse you can just
press the G and it will select it for
you now once you do this you are able to
draw with the pen tool but before you
start drawing I need you to go over to
this thing called roto Azir and make
sure that this checkbox is off make sure
that there is no checkbox in your screen
and I'll show you what this does later
but for right now just make sure it's
off now if you never use the pencil
before in any Adobe applications it's a
pretty simple though you just pretty
much just need to start clicking around
and your clicks countless frames or
points where you can edit so again to
start out just make your very first
click on screen now any time you want to
make a straight line with a pen tool go
ahead and just click another point on
the screen and that's how you make a
straight line with a pen tool but
anytime you have an object where you
want to make curves around here's what
you need to do you need to click on the
screen and you need to drag your mouse
until it creates a curved shape so again
a click and a drag creates a curved
shape but just plain click without
dragging creates a straight line so
that's how you make straight lines and
curved shapes and this is an awesome
feature with a pen tool so anytime
you're done making the path you want and
you want to finish your shape you need
to go to your very first frame that you
made
or point whatever you want to call it
and as you can see my pen tool turns
from a pen tool that looks like the head
of a pen to the very same thing but now
it has a little circle around it
whenever it has a circle around it this
means all right we want to close your
path and finish making your mask so as
you can see when I click this I now have
a completed mask now a lot of the times
when you make a mass it's not going to
be perfect so I'm going to show you guys
a bunch of simple things how to edit
your mask and a couple shortcuts as well
to edit your mask you're most likely
want to go up here to the selection tool
or you can just go ahead and press V now
as you can see I told you guys how to
make straight lines and points with
curves anytime you want to convert a
curved point to a straight point or a
straight point to a curved point take a
look at my cursor as I hold down ctrl +
alt on my keyboard my cursor moves from
like a filled-in
V to a Flying V and this is only when
I'm hovering over points when I click
that find V as you can see it's going to
convert any curved points to a rounded
point and likewise if I go to a straight
point it's going to I think I'm set
curved in around last time what I meant
was straight and curved as you can see
now we have two straight points if I
hold down ctrl + alt on my keyboard
it'll convert those straightened points
to a rounded point so that is how you
create straight points two rounded
points and that's a little shortcut
again that's ctrl + alt on your keyboard
another thing that you can do is add and
take away these little points that you
can edit with now the easiest way to do
this is hold down G on your keyboard and
as you can see my cursor now moves from
a little arrow to a little pen with a
plus on it
anytime you're hovering over your path
that doesn't have a keyframe on it your
pen is going to have a pen with a plus
sign on it this means add a point to
your path now if we click you're going
to be able to add a point that you can
drag edit with and anything like that
but what if you already have a point and
you want to get rid of it
when you click G as when you hover it
over your pet that didn't have a point
it will add when you hover over a part
of your mess that already has a point on
it it's going to have a little um your
pen is going to have a little minus sign
next to it and this means take away that
point we don't want it anymore so let's
take away this one just by clicking on
it
and as you can see we don't have that
point in our mask anymore so again when
you're holding down G when you hover
over your mask that doesn't have a point
you can add it by clicking it and when
you hover over your masked at has a
point already you can get rid of it by
hovering over it and deleting it you can
also go up here to your pen tool and add
vertex and delete vertex and convert
vertex these are the three other things
that I talked about this is just how to
do it without the shortcut but I suggest
that you don't do this and you actually
learn the shortcuts because there will
be a lot faster so those are the basics
to editing with a pencil and making
custom masks so again get familiar with
that and then the next tutorial as
promised I'm going to be showing you
guys what this little thing does the
road of zr4 her every save and we will
also be probably animating our custom
masks so thank you guys for watching and
I will see you next time make sure to
