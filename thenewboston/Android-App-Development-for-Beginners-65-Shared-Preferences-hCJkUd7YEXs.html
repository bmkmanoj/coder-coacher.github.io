this tutorial what I'm going to do is
I'm going to show you guys how to use
shared preferences and what shared
preferences are is pretty much the
easiest way to store user data or pretty
much to save any small type of data on
your application and another thing that
people use it a lot for is if you have
any app that's like customizable or you
just want to save some settings like I
don't know maybe you allow the user to
like change the background color of
their app or maybe um there's like a
setting to bump up the font size to make
it easier to read any of those settings
can really easily be saved using these
things called
shared preferences so just to
demonstrate what I'm going to do is I'm
going to make a really simple form and
you can just make any um thing that the
user can type in have a button called
save but just so this example actually
resembles an app in real life I'm going
to have one text field right here and
another one right under it so we'll say
that this is like a login screen so the
first text view will just say um use
your name and this one will be like I
don't know password so I'm just going to
write them in plain text so you guys can
see so obviously you know I'm not the
most secure tutorial in the world but
you know this is just a demo so these
are just text field little indicators to
UM the user what you want them to do
just give myself a little bit more space
get rid of that too alright so now let's
get some of these plain text I'm just uh
stick it right there let me change this
to like I was 250 DP look too big
180 DP holy jumbo Lise 180 TP let's go
200 ladies and gentlemen we are going to
200 DP all right
actually let me just put that right
there and another one right here so
again what's going to happen in this
demo is the user is going to type in
some information right here and we'll
have a button called save and then we
can go shut off our phone arm go to the
gym we can go look at other apps come
back here and all of that information is
going to be saved
pretty stinkin cool so the first thing I
should probably do is give these an ID
so the ID of where they type their
username I'll just write user name input
and for this one where they type their
password I'll just write password input
so now I'm going to add two buttons to
here real quick and the first one is
going to be just add some text on it
called what can I put like save info let
me add another button alright so
whenever they click on this button what
it's going to do is it's going to take
whatever they typed in here and it's
going to save it to that shared
preferences file now whenever they click
of this button I'll just write display
actually out a new mint display info
something like that
and let me add on clicks to here real
quick alright so this one was what just
really like save info and for button to
whenever we click this it'll call method
code display data all right so again
whenever we click this it's going to
display this info just to arm show you
guys that it is indeed being saved so it
would probably be a good idea to have
some place to display it how about right
there stick it right in the middle
alright so this one we just need an ID
so we can say we're printing it out and
the idea of this I'll just say like
Bucky's text so one more time what we're
going to do to demonstrate what shared
preferences are is you can actually have
any type of that you can have like
checkmarks arm you can get a true and
false value from like any of these
widgets right here but I'm just going to
save some string data through username
and password so they're going to type it
in hit save info and we're going to like
close out of the app do whatever come
back hit display info and it's going to
show you guys that it indeed was saved
for them so now what I want to do is get
rid of this stuff because we don't need
it and I'm also going to get rid of that
because it's bugging me all right so the
first thing we need to do is just get a
reference to all of our widgets and that
is edit text which were those inputs and
I named mine user name input and I'm
going to the other one password input
and that text view right here was what
was that Bucky's text text view Bucky's
text all right so now that we started
creating them let's actually set a
reference to them a user name input
equals edit text by r dr dot ID dot user
name inputs
all right so this one was password input
and of course that's our to ID dot
password input and last but not least we
have Bucky's text and that was just that
little textview and this is just going
to be fine by IDR that ID dot buggies
text to Jen to Denton all right so
that's all the boring crap that's what
we already knew how to do so now let me
get myself a little bit more space and
all right so we have two methods that we
need to create the very first method is
going to be called whenever we click
this button and we gave it the on click
of save info so whenever they click this
it's going to take whatever they typed
in and save it to the shared preferences
