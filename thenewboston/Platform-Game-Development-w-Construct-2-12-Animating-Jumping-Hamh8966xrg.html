and in this video we're gonna be
animating the player whenever he jumps
well we're gonna be doing it a little
bit differently than before we're gonna
be using something called sub events and
if you understand
computer programming then this concept
is actually going to be really simple to
you but if not I'll try to explain it
the best I can so what you want to do is
we need to first test if the player is
actually jumping so of course we're
gonna test for the player box and under
here we have a bunch of platform
behaviors and we first test is the
player jumping well after this we need
to check a couple things we need a first
check was he moving or was he standing
still so we always want to test if he's
jumping but then we need to test
something after that so in order to test
one thing after another we add something
called a sub event so if we let me guy
who's a decent like this so you guys can
see okay so have this event selected and
then once it is selected press S on your
keyboard what this is gonna do is it's
gonna add a sub event of this event
basically saying okay you test if the
player is jumping they are now what do
you want to test for so basically a test
after a test so the first thing we need
to check for is was he running so of
course player box just like before
platform is moving so this is basically
saying was he jumping and if he was was
he moving while he was jumping so on
this one we need to add that jump from
run animation so of course the animation
goes on player and we need to set the
animation to jump from run done now
aside from this we also want to say okay
was he not moving or was he staying
still whenever he jumped so this one is
jumped while he was moving and now if
you highlight this in hit s again it's
gonna add another jump event and here's
another thing that is kind of confusing
but let me just do it now I'll tell you
guys what's going on
so we're basically gonna test is moving
like before but once we have this one
highlighted then press I on your
keyboard or what you can do is you can
press I or right click and press invert
and what this is pretty much saying is X
platform was moving or basically let me
read this like how the computer program
was going to read it and this is gonna
make sense okay
did the guy jump if he did then do this
animation if he didn't or excuse me if
he was moving while he was jumping do
this action if he was not moving while
he was jumping do this action so
whenever you see the X or invert just in
your mind who read not so the player is
not moving while he's jumping well of
course in that case we just want to add
the animation jump from stand so did he
jump if yes jump from run or excuse me
is he moving jump from run is he not
moving jump from Stan hopefully you guys
understand that and the reason I said if
you're a computer programmer because
there's a thing called it fell stamens
tomato model not important but anyways
once we play this now we see that we get
to let me go down to my crown floor
right here we get two different
animations first it checks is he jumping
if so just to jump from stand and also
is he running in jumping then we're
gonna do jump from run so you still see
that we got a little issue right here
with the animations they look kind of
weird and we're gonna be fixing those in
the next tutorials so um basically what
I'm talking about is he remains animated
after you jump you see what's going on
so that's a little bug and I'm gonna
show you guys how to fix that in the
next
but hopefully you understand this and if
not just watch tutorial again or do it
um follow along with me and it's it'll
make sense so thank you guys for
watching and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
