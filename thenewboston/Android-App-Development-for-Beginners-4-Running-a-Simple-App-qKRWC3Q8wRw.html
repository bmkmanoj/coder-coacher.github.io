finished setting up and preparing your
project you're going to have something
that looks like this and if you have an
error right now then I know what error
that you're getting so I'm going to show
you guys how to fix that in just a
second but for now I just want to warn
you guys even though it looks kind of
overwhelming
trust me this is set up perfectly for
making apps in about 7 tutorials or
something once we cover the entire
interface this is going to feel just
like home and all this stuff that feels
overwhelming right now is actually gonna
you're probably going to find it very
useful but for now I'm going to mention
a couple of things that are going to
make your life a whole lot easier the
first thing is if you ever want to
access that SDK manager from here then
what you do is you go up to this little
thing it kind of looks like a little I
think his name's Andy to Android looks
like he's sitting in this bucket with a
down arrow but this is the Android SDK
manager so click that and again you
don't have to close out of your entire
project to open up the SDK manager
anymore and I actually want to show you
guys one more package that um I forgot
to tell you guys that install later on I
mean earlier so if you open up the SDK
manager and you scroll all the way down
then make sure that you have this
package installed right here it's the
Intel x86 emulator accelerator and again
I installed it already but it takes like
2 seconds to install well what this is
is basically whenever we develop these
sample apps what we're going to do is
we're going to run those on pretty much
emulators or they're pretty much like
little virtual phones that we can use
for testing and those are kind of slow
so that package just helps speed up the
entire process and um makes it run a
little bit smoother and faster so if you
guys want to know what that was
there you go if you didn't it well you
know sorry for wasting your time but
that's how you get to the Android SDK
manager from here now another thing that
I want to do is mention this a lot of
you guys probably have an error that
popped up that says ok I can't find the
Android SDK or IDE
where the java jdk is you got to help me
out because android studio won't run on
how its configured right now so if
android studio has a problem finding
either of those things then go to file
and go to project structure and then
from here it says ok the Android SDK
location is where and actually if this
if you see like I think if you get an
error it shows like some red text or
something but in order to navigate to it
if it's not set up correctly just click
these little three little dots on the
right hand side and then you can say
okay you obviously aren't looking in the
right place this is where I downloaded
my Android SDK and the same thing with a
Java development kit or the JDK make
sure that the directory ends with the
JDK in your version number and make sure
that the Android SDK ends with SDK so
again if you arm downloaded it to a
different directory than I did in the
example then you're going to have these
errors so that is where you fix them
depending on wherever you downloaded it
so mine is correct so I'm just going to
close out of that and I probably should
mention this as well all right so just
so every um user is looking at the same
thing I'm going to change the app theme
right here because this typically
changes from user to user so make sure
I'll show you guys if you click on app
theme right here then the theme is
pretty much to overall look and feel of
your app so switch yours to material
light you click OK and as you can see
your interface changes a little bit
again this is just so everyone arm is
looking at the same thing and you're not
watching this tutorial and are like ok
my looks different than yours and that's
weird
now the last thing I want to mention
before we actually run this is this
right now whenever I'm teaching these
tutorials you see that we have minimal
screen size and that's just because I
wanted to make the window small enough
where people with smaller monitors
and see the videos clearly well the
problem with this is the screen whenever
we're developing this app it looks kind
of small so in order to get rid of this
foam body then what I'm going to do is
I'm going to click the settings and you
see it says include device frame I'm
going to uncheck that
so again if you ever like developing and
looking at the phone itself maybe it
gives you a better idea of what the
application is going to look like then
do that however just to make sure that
these tutorials are a little bit more
clear I'm going to get rid of that and
then we're going to see the interface a
little more clearly so once we're ready
to run our app and test everything out
this is what I want you to do go up to
tools and select Android AVD manager now
if you don't want to go through all
those steps you can also click this
little button right here this is just a
shortcut to the AVD manager and the AVD
manager stands for Android virtual
device manager so this let me make this
a little bit more clear alright so this
is where you manage all of your virtual
devices and again a virtual device is
just a little simulator a little testing
phone that you can make so you don't
have to take an actual Android phone and
plug in your computer
whenever you're developing apps and you
want to test them out so by default
whenever you download and install
Android studio it comes with one virtual
device this is the nexus 5 so that's
what simulator phone comes built with it
but of course if you ever want to make a
new one you just create virtual device
by clicking that button down there you
can actually create um you know little
simulator TVs and whatnot but I'll tell
you guys through how to create a virtual
device I don't know maybe you want to
create a same virtual device um as the
phone that you actually own but for now
you can just use this one right here now
the reason that I'm not going to use
this one in the reason that I built
another one called Bucky's phone is
something that you don't have to worry
about it's actually because whenever I'm
recording these tutorials and I'm
running this little simulator it takes
up a lot of space and it doesn't
show that great on my like whenever I'm
making tutorials so that's why I made
Bucky's phone it's pretty much the same
thing except um I made it a lot smaller
so it shows up better in my tutorials
anyways what you want to do is you want
to click this little green button rate
by Nexus 5 I'm going to click mine
called Bucky's phone and this is going
to launch as you can see right here the
virtual device which is pretty much just
a simulator of a phone now the first
time you run this it's going to take a
long time to boot up because what it
pretty much represents is you you're
buying a brand new phone so it has to
start it up for the very first time and
the reason that this takes so long is if
you think about it what it's actually
doing is its building an entirely new
operating system or an entirely new
device within your computer so it has to
build a new phone with a new operating
system that can run new apps so that's
why the entire build process in you know
to get it up and running takes a little
bit longer than you may like so once
your virtual device is up and running
and yours may look a little different
than mine because I did run mine before
but to you it may simulate opening a
brand new phone so it's going to be like
welcome to Android you're going to have
to press ok whatever but anyways you
just click OK a bunch of times and then
you're going to get to this screen right
here so this is the unlock screen and of
course if you are used to I phone or
something the unlocking process is a
little bit different than it is an
Android so just click and drag up and
that's going to unlock your phone and as
you can see it's just like a normal
phone you can even browse the internet
from here but what we are worried about
is running our application so let's hop
over back to Android studio and I'm just
going to close out of this but what you
want to do is you want to go up to this
little button right here and whenever
you hover over it it says run app so
click that little green triangle and
what this is going to do is it's going
to build your app for you and it's
actually going to give us
one more option I believe yep right here
so it says okay we're building your app
where do you want to test it out so
since we already have this emulator
running right there make sure that your
radio button is checked choose the
running device and of course you're
probably only going to have one running
so you can just click okay so what this
is going to do is it's going to build it
and it's going to launch it in our
little simulator phone so it takes a
little bit of time but don't worry
um that's normal but eventually as you
can see what happens is it finally
launches and that's actually pretty cool
that you don't have to actually go click
on app and open it or anything it just
launches right for you pretty sweet so
we see that our application says my
application hello world probably the
coolest app ever invented we probably
put this on Google Play right now and
make at least like 10 million dollars
but of course what we want to do is
actually jazz this up a little bit more
before we put this bad boy for sale so
that is the process of how to build a
very simple app and test everything out
again my guess is that since every one
system is set up a little bit
differently if things don't run
completely smoothly for you or if you
get any bugs or errors please go to my
forum post your questions and there are
a lot of people willing and actually
wanting to answer your questions for you
because whenever they answer someone's
questions on the forum they actually get
these things called points so um you are
encouraged to ask questions because they
probably want questions to help you out
with but anyways if you have any
problems that's what you do thank you
guys for watching in the next tutorial
when teaching you guys something else
that is definitely awesome so I'll see
you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
