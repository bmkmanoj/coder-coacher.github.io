about a potentiometer is that they have
three leads unlike a fixed resistor
which only has two leads or prongs on
the bottom of it and this is because the
first and the third lead may be a it's
better if i zoom in the first and the
third lead you can see they're number
one and three when you hook up your
wires to that that's going to give you a
fixed resistance or the max resistance
of your potentiometer when you hook your
wires up to the first and second lead
the one number one and the one in the
middle that's going to allow you to vary
the resistance of it so I got my
multimeter here and I'm going to hook it
up I'm going to hook my positive to lead
three and my negative to lead one and
like I told you this is going to give
you your max resistance whenever you do
this again nothing's hooked up to the
middle it's going to give you a fixed
value whatever the max for your
potentiometer is so this one is a 50,000
on potentiometer so as you can see it's
forty eight point three thousand ohms
but we didn't get this to make it a
fixed resistor we want to make it very
so that's what I'm going to show you so
take your red lead and move it to the
middle and as you can see it's now in
the middle and not the end so how you
adjust a potentiometer is when you turn
this dial all the way to the left which
I'm about to do now
it doesn't resist any and should give
zero ohms as you start turning it slowly
and slowly it should resist more and
more so this is almost a thousand that's
about a three thousand let me turn it
half way
that's about 23,000 let me turn it about
3/4 of the way that's about 37 almost
rounded up 37,000 and let me turn it all
the way and that's right near our max
50,000 ohms
does so that is how you use a
potentiometer to vary the resistance in
your circuit again these are a little
more expensive but they're very useful
when you want to vary the resistance in
our circuit
so that's your intro to potentiometers
get one now and play with it again these
are called trimmer potentiometers these
small ones that fit into bread boards so
I hope you guys learned something make
sure to subscribe and I'll see you next
