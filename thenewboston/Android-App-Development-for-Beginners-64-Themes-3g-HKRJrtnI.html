what I did is I showed you guys how to
use styles now a style was pretty much a
reusable design that you could apply to
individual widgets Oh a sec SpaghettiOs
anyways so in this is horror I'm going
to show you guys how to use a theme now
a theme is pretty much a style that you
can apply to either an entire activity
or your entire application so if you
just want to apply overall style to
again this entire activity or every
single activity in your entire app I'll
show you guys how to do that really
easily but the first thing I want to do
is this just so we're pretty much
starting from scratching it'll confuse
you guys let's go ahead and delete all
of these styles so pretty much we're
back to bare-bones
just select that and might as well just
go ahead and delete everything in this
ocean XML all right so now we're pretty
much back to basics we can go ahead and
start learning how to use themes so the
first thing we need to do is actually
create a theme now I know that this is
named ocean dot XML but say that we were
making I don't know maybe we're making
an app for some like environmental
company and they wanted every single
background on every single activity to
be green so let's go ahead and do that
now the first thing that we need is a
color resource so color and the name of
this is I'll just name it like buckey's
BG color good enough now a cool green I
like is zero zero nine nine zero zero so
now we have a color that we can use in
our theme by the way I typically like to
name things like background color or
text color because if you're ever make
an app and if you just name this
something like green and then your boss
is like you know what let's change the
background to red well then it's going
to say green everywhere and it's kind of
silly so instead if you have something
like Bucky's BG color you can change
this to any one you want and it'll make
it's so I don't know if that makes sense
but it's better not to like name your
colors green or blue or yellow or
anything like that so another thing is
this in order to make that overall theme
it's really similar to a style so you
make a style you give it a name like
Bucky's theme and then what I'm going to
do is I'm actually going to inherit from
Android and I'll just choose like theme
light now the reason I want to do this
is because remember this gives us a
bunch of default styling that's already
on our device and the reason that I want
to do that is because right now we're
only changing the background color and I
don't feel like styling every single
widget individually so that's why I'm
going to say okay we're just going to
grab all this crap by default just use
that theme and we're just going to
override whatever we need to so it makes
it really easy especially whenever I'm
trying to teach it so of course any time
we want to change a style we just use
the item name and access the background
color of your activity it's actually
Android window background so now from
here we just throw in the color and that
is at color buckey's BG color so again
any activity or any app that has Bucky's
theme is going to have a green
background so now let's go ahead now
that we created a theme let's learn how
to apply it so in order to apply an
overall theme what you need to do is you
need to hop up to Android manifest now
if you look in your manifest this is
where pretty much your entire app is
managed and by default it already has a
theme right here now if we just change
Bucky's theme instead of the default app
theme then what this is going to do is
just going to apply that green
background to every single activity
every single screen in your app if we
only wanted to apply that green
background to an individual activity
then
we would stick it in here within your
activity so that's the difference
whenever you apply a property in here it
just changes one screen whenever you
apply it right here it's going to change
every single activity or every single
screen within your app now let me just
fix this because it's annoying me ctrl
alt L enter all right now if you hop
back over to Activity main hmm
I really thought that would change
because okay let me make sure we created
the same everything looks good in the
manifest the up it says that this
project is indeed using Bucky's theme so
what the heck well the reason that it
isn't displaying is your little preview
because whenever you're just using this
a little design tool what you can do is
you can actually select your themes just
to see how it looks on different devices
but in order to see how would really
look on a device and what you do is go
to app to me and go to manifest themes
and again we only have Bucky's theme
right there but if you select okay then
this is of course what's actually going
to look like of course you can choose
other ones to say I want to Road how
will it look if I used holo light and I
don't know wonder how look if I use
material dark so you know this is just
for testing out but what your apps
really going to look like is whatever
the manifest is telling it to look like
so there you go and check it out so
again to recap one more time anytime we
want to use a theme just go ahead and
create your theme in an XML file specify
where you want to use that theme in your
manifest and make sure in your little
design tool that you actually are saying
okay use the manifest theme instead of
anything else that I want to test though
so there you go um there's the real
basics of it thanks for watching &amp;amp; well
I'm probably going to go eat some
macaroni and cheese or something so I'll
see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
