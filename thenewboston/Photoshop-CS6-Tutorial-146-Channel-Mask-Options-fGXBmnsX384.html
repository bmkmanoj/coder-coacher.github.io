Photoshop cs6 tutorial today we're gonna
learn how to modify the channel mask
options so the channel masks come with
default options that basically control
how the master looks in channels so like
when you make your channel here it's
gonna have like this red background and
it's gonna start off with having the
selection be what's in the white and
having what's in the black being the red
color and all that stuff but Photoshop
gives you the ability to change the
default options and like for example you
could change the color of this red to
like a blue if you want say you're
working on an image that is red and you
need to change the color so it works a
little better or you could change the
the function of the channel max to like
from like a selection to spot color or
other things like that so knowing that
you're able to change the as I change
these options helps you work better in
Photoshop and gives you more control
over your final results so let's go
ahead and do that
take one of your channel messes you that
you've created already and go ahead and
double click on it let's uh there we go
double click on the thumbnail there let
me go back and turn it on so we can see
what's going on so in your channel
options you have the ability to rename
your mask so I'm going to name this moon
mask so the color here that you have it
indicates either your masked areas your
selected areas or the spot color and you
can see that when you change to spot
color it changes the solidity basically
the same thing is opacity so I'm just
gonna keep it on masked areas right now
I'm just gonna change the color here so
let's change it to this blue here I'll
hit OK
and then I'll just say okay real quick
and you can see that the background has
been changed to blue now this blue seems
to be pretty dang opaque here and not
transparent enough so maybe I want to
make the opacity put it down lower so we
can see the background a little bit
better so those are a couple options if
I change this to selected areas you can
see that now the blue is over top of the
white area and this has been inversed or
inverted I mean if we change this to
spot color and you can see that the blue
is now the spot color and it's where the
where the selection was so when you send
this off to get printed you can have
this spot color Channel so knowing that
you have these options helps you out a
lot when you are working on your project
you can also double click on one of
these pre-existing channels and nothing
will happen that's like you can't change
these ones here because these channels
are needed to keep the color intact so
you can double click on your other
channels here and you can see that when
I change this to a spot Channel now it
has spot channel options and I'll have
to just go back in my history here to my
channel options and now we have our
regular channel options it's a spot
channel so if you change it to a spot
color be aware that it's going to change
it to a spot Channel and it's going to
affect your channel in a different way
so hopefully that came out clear but
that's all I wanted to show you about
modifying your Channel mask options and
I hopefully guys learn something new and
you can use all this to your advantage
and speed up the process when you're
working with the channel masks so thanks
