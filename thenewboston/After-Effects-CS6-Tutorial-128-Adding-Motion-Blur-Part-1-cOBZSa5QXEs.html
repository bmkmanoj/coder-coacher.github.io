Effects cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackbird and today
I want to go over motion blur with you
I've been using it in a couple of my
tutorials in text so I might as well go
over how to use it properly and
everything that you need to know to make
it turn out correct so motion blur is
when like an object moves and you can't
see all of it because it's moving so
fast it's blurred out and After Effects
does this easily and pretty nicely and
there's a couple settings you can change
to fix it up if you want to and
everything like that you can also create
some different looking effects with it
so that's pretty cool
so all I have right now is just a
picture and all I did was animate it
from left to right and if and if I bring
up the position these are my key frames
here and fairly simple and easy so I'm
just gonna actually move it off the
screen a little more yeah there we go
and if I Ram preview this and it goes
across the screen here it doesn't have
any any kind of motion blur to it so
every frame is just like this and and it
doesn't really look too real so if you
want to make it like appealing to the
eye you may want to add motion blur and
motion blur adds a little bit more time
to your render but it's worth it usually
and makes things look nice so the way to
start adding motion blur is to have a an
animation that goes decently fast so
let's start by making sure you have your
keyframes reasonably close to each other
and mine are under one second right now
so this is like starting at zero and
this is almost a half a second so we've
got that going on and the next thing we
need to do is come to this button right
here where my mouse is with the three
faded and it enables the motion blur
and you can't add motion blur unless you
have this button enabled and what what
this does or what this is here for is if
you have a bunch of stuff with motion
blur on your screen it could take time
to render the screen so you can quickly
turn that off to see what you're doing
but realize that you have your motion
blur on so I after that you need to come
to this and enable it per layer so this
enables it for the comp and this enables
it per layer now I click on that and you
can see now we have a motion blur do a
little ram preview for you and we can
see now that it has a blur when it's
going across it looks a little more
realistic so here we go
motion blur no motion blur so that's
what it looks like there so you can
either just do it like that and keep the
regular settings that After Effects has
or we can change the settings and
there's only four settings so it's not
that complicated so I'll show you right
now there within the composition
settings so come up to composition go to
composition settings and come over here
to I'll bring it over here to your
Advanced tab now motion blur there's a
whole section right here so we've got a
shutter angle face
samples per frame and a depth of sample
limit this is these two at the top are
going to affect what your shutter like
the length and how it looks and stuff
like that and the bottom ones are going
to affect the quality of your motion
blur so the shutter angle is pretty much
the length of the blur and it could go
from 0 to 720 degrees so if I bring this
to like 30 degrees just check out the
motion blur picture at the top and make
sure you have your preview checked if
you want to see how this happens in real
time now the motion blur is a lot less
now I'll bring this up to 720 which is
the max
and the motion blur is a lot longer I'll
bring this back to 180 and this is the
default settings are 180 and negative 94
now so what we got next to it is the
shutter phase and that it gives the it
should be negative one half of the
shutter angle to give you a more of a
realistic look the shutter phase shows
like the blur either after the current
time indicator or before it so if I
bring this into the positives watch
where the blur goes compared to where
the picture is let me scrub now it's way
ahead that's because I put it into the
positives so the picture you can tell
where it used to be by these orange I
mean
purple man I must be colorblind are
these purple dots here these squares
that's where it used to be now if you're
at negative 1/2 it's gonna be right in
the middle and if I start going even
more negative it's probably it's gonna
be to the left there we go and the
shutter phase goes to 360 on both sides
so I can bring this to 360 on positive
360 or negative 360 so if I bring the
shutter angle let's just try like
experimenting with it and see what
happens I'll bring the shutter angle up
to 520 now I'm gonna have to bust out my
calculator because I can't think of what
this is so 528 divided by 2 negative 2
sixties what this should be at to make
it look nice
there we go so that's how you mess with
the shutter angle and shutter face now
you can if you want to create some
different kind of like time effects you
can change the shutter phase and all
that stuff I'm just gonna put it back to
where it was</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
