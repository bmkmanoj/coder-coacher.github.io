welcome to another app review and this
app is for mli a in the stands for my
life is average and this is kind of
similar to FML or f my life in the sense
that you just get like quick little
stories of people telling how their life
is average but they're really actually
incredibly funny so there's a lite
version of this and I got the paid
version which is only 99 cents and the
paid version I think gives you the best
of and it gives you your favorites maybe
and yeah I think those are two extra
ones but they are definitely worth it
for 99 cents um these updates every day
and they make sure to update them every
day so you know it's real funny so if
you go to the best of you get the best
of today this week this month in this
year and I'm going to go ahead and click
this year which is pretty much the best
of the best in here just as a couple um
today I realized the word bed actually
looks like a bed very interesting a
fortnight ago I finally saw my ribs Cuba
I waited two weeks to post this so that
I could use the word fortnight very nice
very nice i think i'm going to do that
myself and another one one last one
today i had to choose between a
strawberry flavored dum dum and a
mystery flavored dum dum i decided to be
adventurous to choose a mystery flavor
it was a strawberry flavored my life is
average that's what they say at the end
of everything so you know these update
every day in what I do is I click the
most recent ones and read them all
before I go to bed because you know I
have nothing else to do like homework or
anything like that or life or any
friends or you know anything like that
so for 99 cents I would definitely
recommend this is a neat little app and
you can pretty much read it forever it
will put you in a good mood realizing
that these people's life is average so
if you have a choice between light and
99 cents I usually recommend the lip
boom oh I think I've kennel cough but
anyways I usually recommend the light
but this one I recommend the paid
version it's much better for only a buck
more so again you get recent the best of
shuffle and your favorites if you want
favorite any so that's pretty much it
definitely check it out and like I said
nine out of ten definitely recommend
getting its awesome puts me in a good
mood before I go tonight every night so
