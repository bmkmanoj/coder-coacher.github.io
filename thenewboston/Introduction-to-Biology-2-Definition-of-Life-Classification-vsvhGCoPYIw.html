a great st. Patrick's Day I know I did
but my name is Sarah and in this video
I'm going to be covering life diversity
of life and the classification system
since biology is the study of life you
may ask yourself what exactly is life
well scientists haven't been able to
agree upon a standard definition of life
because for every definition that is put
out there there's always going to be an
exception however they have been able to
agree on some common characteristics
that all forms of life share these
characteristics include organization
life is highly organized homeostasis
which is the maintenance of a constant
internal environment such as temperature
water concentrations things like that
adaptation which is the ability of an
organism to survive in their environment
reproduction and heredity you have to be
able to pass your genes on to future
cells too in order to ensure the
survival of your species growth and
development energy acquisition and
release response to stimuli and
interaction with your environment
although life is similar in some ways
there are millions of different types of
living organisms and in order to
identify and study these organisms
scientists have organized them into
groups this is called classification
also known as the study of taxonomy the
first person to do a large-scale
classification of organisms goes by the
name of Carl Linnaeus he made up this
system in 1753 and he started off by
organizing things by structure and
Anatomy and things like that and there
are seven categories kingdoms being the
broadest and species being the most
specific category
the basic univ unit of classification is
species and species are groups of
similar organisms or individuals that
can mate and produce fertile offspring
some examples of species would be red
wolves or humans are their own species
or African elephants or houseflies
they're in very rare instances species
like closely related species can mate
but the offspring they produce are
infertile therefore their offspring are
not considered a separate species Carl
Linnaeus also introduced the binomial
nomenclature system which is a way of
naming organisms or species he used the
genus which is a group of one or more
related species and the actual species
itself ie humans are called Homo sapiens
Homo being the genius genus and sapien
being these species and the language
used is Latin which is a universal
language all scientists use Latin to
name organisms it just makes things
easier so scientists in Germany were to
say Homo Sapien scientists in Japan
would know what they were talking about
the largest and most inclusive category
of classification are Kingdom's
and in modern biology there are six
kingdoms we have the archaea bacteria
and you bacteria which were previously
grouped into one Kingdom called manera
we have Protista fungi Plantae and
Animalia the characteristics of
different kingdoms we start off with
manera which are classified as single
cell or small colony or a small colony
of cells all of which are prokaryotic
and prokaryotic means that they lack and
organize nucleus and other
membrane-bound organelles and they also
have a circular chromosome
and as I mentioned Venera is now broken
up into two separate kingdoms we have
the archaea bacteria these are bacteria
that live in very extreme environments
environments with very low oxygens such
as swamps or marshes extreme temperature
hot springs places that normal bacteria
could not survive or places of high salt
concentrations like the ocean you
bacteria are just your everyday bacteria
they live in your body on your skin
rotten food in your dog's nose pretty
much everywhere there are even you
bacteria that are found in some extreme
environments so the main difference
between archaea bacteria and you
bacteria is their biochemistry and the
fact that they have an independent
evolutionary history we now move on to
Protista these are unicellular or
multicellular organisms that do not have
specialized tissues these are eukaryotic
which means they have membrane bound
organelles which are cellular structures
and Protista this is a very very diverse
diverse group of organisms an example of
a protist would be plankton from Sponge
Bob Squarepants if any of you watched
that show it was one of my favorites
when I was younger I still watch it and
I'm almost 23 so anyways our next
Kingdom is fungi these are non motile
which means they can't move and plant
like they can't make their own food so
they have to absorb nutrients from their
environment their cell walls are made of
a molecule called chitin examples of
fungi include mushrooms mold and yeast
without yeast we wouldn't have beer we
wouldn't have bread the world would not
be a happy place the next Kingdom is
plant a these organisms can make their
own food by what is called
photosynthesis they are also eukaryotic
and their cell walls are composed of a
molecule called cellulose
and the final kingdom is Animalia all
members of this kingdom are
multicellular and eukaryotic they can't
make their own food they are however
capable of mobility for example if we
want food we drive to the grocery store
and we get it if a plant wants food it's
it's just got to sit there and wait
until something comes in the soil and
the last thing I'm gonna cover in this
video are levels of organization all
organisms have all matter have atoms
these atoms come together to form what
are called molecules I'll explain this a
little bit in a look ah in a lot more
detail whenever I cover basic chemistry
and probably my next video video after
the next sometime in the near future but
anyways molecules come together to form
what are called organelles organelles
are a subunit of a cell and they're
involved in a specific function within
the cell organelles come together to
form what is called a cell and the cell
is the fundamental unit of life must
have metabolic chemicals and heredity
information and not all cells have
organelles only eukaryotic cells do
anyways cells come together to form
tissues and tissues are groups of cells
doing a specific function tissues come
together to form organs organs come
together to form an organ system and
organ systems grouped together to form
an organism in multicellular organisms
single cellular organisms are just one
cell but that is all I have for this
video I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
