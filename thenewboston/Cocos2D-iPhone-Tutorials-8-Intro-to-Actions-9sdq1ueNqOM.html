your eight cocos2d tutorial and in this
tutorial we're going to be covering
actions now we talked a very little bit
about actions before but I promised that
we would be going in depth about actions
later on and well now is that time so
probably for the next couple tutorials
we're going to be covering actions from
the very basics to the very advanced
steps so in case you forgot from a
couple tutorials ago when we were
messing around with sprites actions are
how you move sprites around your screen
so I mean it seems simple but there's a
lot of different types of actions in a
lot of different ways you can use them
so definitely you want to stay tuned for
this so before we can even you know
start writing code I'm gonna use the
tools that I tell you guys so far to
make you know kind of template and
that's we're going to be doing in this
tutorial and from this template what we
can do is we can I can teach you actions
a lot easier once all we have to do is
press one button and see the action and
it may seem kind of confusing but i'll
show you guys later on so let's go ahead
and make a new cocos2d project and we'll
name this action susan teammate with a Z
because I hate things that are named as
e but you know actually I tend to name
stuff with Z a lot of times because if i
write actions with the S at the end that
month I mean cocos2d might have a class
called actions with s at the end but
they definitely don't have actions with
the Z at the end so now there's a nice
little tip for you not tit tip yeah
perverts so anyways go to your class and
go hello world seen em and we're only
going to be working in this file for
probably the next couple tzuri'el so go
ahead and you're in it and delete
everything inside your if statement and
the first thing that we want to do is we
wanna well before we even do that let's
go ahead and import a couple things I
imported this button right here in this
is going to be the button that we press
it's going to be part of a menu
and I'm also going to import let's say
i'll use this chick and this is going to
be the sprite that moves around the
screen oh and I definitely imported them
into my classes and instead my resources
so to move them just do that all right
now that we got that taken care of let's
give us some space to work with and now
that we have some space and we are in
the right file hopefully in our if
statement what do we want to do first
create that menu so CC menu item and
make this um image and just name it item
one like last time it's pretty much
going to be a clone of the last tutorial
so CC menu item image looks good item
from normal image and which is named
chick ping and let me scroll over just
tidbit and the selected image is of
course same thing actually I want this
one to be button button not paying in
the selected image is also button ping
what's good and two more parameters that
we have to watch for arm target itself
since that method is going to be in this
one in selector
at selector and just go ahead and name
this do this and it won't take any
parameters this time I just want to show
you guys in the last oriole that it
could so now what we need to do is at
assisi menu and just name this might as
well just name it menu and set this
equal to CC menu and menu with items
item one and of course the null
terminator for constructor and self
probably need those so come on so I'm
saying come on like it's not my fault
but it clearly is menu just like that so
with that being said all we have to do
is implement our yep I think all you
have to do is implement our do this re
void do this that looks good for now and
let's go ahead and build it around this
and see if anything fudges up and
compile so after this what we're going
to be doing is creating that chick
sprite and building a basic action but I
just want to make sure I didn't F up
anything right now and good so we have a
basic spray on the screen or actually
that's button so let's go ahead and now
that we have that button and then one
over repress it this is the method
that's going to be called so let's go
ahead and create a sprite so under
import what you want to do is create
that spray with CC sprite and just name
this chick and we're saying why am i
creating it here instead of in our if if
you create it here then it's a local
object and it's only going to be able to
be accessed from inside this in it and
not inside this so as long as we create
it outside both of these methods we can
access it from any method in the file so
that's why you need to create your
declaration right under the import so
now that we created that we can go ahead
and create the actual chick itself and
in it because as soon as our program
opens we want this trick to be created
so chick equals C
the sprite and sprite with file and this
is where we use chicken and now what we
want to do is just give it a starting
position chick position equal CCP looks
good and just put it like somewhere near
the bottom left like 50 50 and go ahead
and now I need to just add it to our
lair self add child and just add chick
so now let me go ahead and build and run
this and make sure that we have the
chick and the button on the screen and
when I press my button nothing should
happen because we didn't put any code
see I'm pressing it and the chicks not
moving at all so now we finally get to
cover what I want to talk about in this
tutorial and that is actions so there
are a bunch of different type of actions
that you can use on this chick so again
whenever I click the button this code
I'm about to type is the code that's
going to be called so what I want to do
is put an action on this chick chick
that almost sounds sexual but it's not
run action and is your parameter this is
where you write what action you want to
do now for the next couple of tutorials
I'm going to be teaching you the
different types of actions but for now I
just want to show you probably the most
basic one cc move by and this is a built
in action that moves your image your
chick image by a specific coordinates so
the first parameter it takes is action
with duration and go ahead and put like
point three because you know we don't
want to take too long so it moves the
specific coordinates in point three
seconds in position equals CCP and just
go ahead and move it by like um 40 x 20
so what this is going to do is move it
40 pixels to the right and 20 pixels up
every time we press this button and how
long is actually going to take point
three seconds so hopefully when this
runs and I pray
spun this chick moves 40 pixels to the
right and 20 pixels up so yep press it
again press it again press it again
press it again press it again so now you
see the basics of actions and how they
can make sprites move around the screen
and of course I went real quick over one
of these basic actions and this is
called CC move by but in the next couple
tutorials I'm going to be teaching you
about the different types of actions and
when they would be useful and when to
use them and you know um there's a lot
more to actions than just different
types of actions and how they move so
I'm definitely stay tuned for that story
but for now thank you guys for watching
don't forget to check out my forum and I
don't forget to subscribe so yeah thank
you and I'll see ya next door</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
