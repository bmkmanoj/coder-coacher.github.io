never have any idea what to say to begin
in these videos it's like so what's up
guys how's it going
dudes like I don't know what to say it
feels weird if I just like start
teaching without having any instruction
so you should I just ramble on like I'm
doing right now for about 25 seconds and
then I'm like okay welcome to a new
video going to show you guys how to
format numbers let's go ahead and hop
right into it
so I have this example fantasy hockey
game open again because I don't know
it's only one I made real quick with
basically different kinds of numbers
that we have to format so right now it
looks pretty good but it doesn't look
exactly how I wanted because first of
all remember that I said that this is a
game where we have $50,000 and we have
to buy players the players were going to
think that that are going to do the best
that night so this salary column this is
actually a dollar amount so this is nine
thousand dollars but that's how that's
not how nine thousand looks in real life
it has a dollar sign and all that stuff
so the first thing I want to do before
I'm making it before I make this a style
sheet look good it's actually want to
change this to average a VG and that's
just because the column name whenever
I'm looking at the spreadsheet and the
column name is a lot longer than the
data I think it looks weird so change it
to average and double click that and
actually go ahead and expand it a little
bit and it looks a little bit better
already so now we can go ahead and take
care of this column right here which is
a dollar amount so what we can do is a
couple things we can go ahead and in
each cell just manually put a dollar
sign comma arm period 0 0 that's going
to take awhile so instead if we select
this entire column and click this little
sign up here again make sure you're in
the Home tab and under number these are
your formatting options for formatting
numbers so just click the dollar and
what it's going to do is
going to convert this entire column to
dollar or decimal in other words
currency on formatting just going to add
dollar sign boom we're good to go now
another thing that you can do is if you
don't want to UM format an entire column
you can actually just select a range of
numbers like this so if you select a
range and let's say we want to make
we'll say that you see how like four
point one one four has three decimals
and like zero has no decimals some have
one so I'm up to some have three let's
go ahead and make sure that they all
have the same amount of decimal places
so this little button right here and
right here are for decreasing and
increasing the amount of decimal places
so go ahead and just tweak those and say
I don't know I think two looks pretty
good right there so I actually want to
do this for all of the data right here
so I'm going to select all that I'm
going to tweak it until this entire
column all has two decimal places so
right now it looks good I mean this is
in currency format this is all
consistent it's a lot more pleasing to
look at for the eyes now another thing I
want to point out is this a couple of
shortcuts real quick if you're too lazy
to just tweak everything with the mouse
what you can do is holding down control
shift in the little tilde on your
keyboard check that out what this does
is it unform at any text that you have
formatted so it pretty much returns it
to the default styling before you added
any formatting at all now the tilde is
to the left of the 1 and above the tab
under the Escape key it's like in the
top left of your keyboard if you don't
know what that symbol is I think it's
called a total I think tilde a thing I'm
calling it right now another thing that
you can do another shortcut is if you
hold ctrl and shift and hold the dollar
sign or hit the dollar sign above before
that's going to change it to a currency
real quick so again if you're more of a
shortcut person instead of like a mouse
person then there you go
ctrl shift and dollar was that however I
want it back to two decimal places now
there's actually a shortcut for that if
you hold ctrl shift and hit the
explanation mark I say explanation
exclamation I think that's what's got I
don't know what these stupid things are
called it's above the one on your
keyboard so that takes whatever numbers
you have selected in the format's it to
two decimal places
pretty sweet it's actually one that I
use a lot more often than then I'll
probably think so the last thing I want
to mention is this so we know these
shortcuts in there a couple more if you
want to look them up I don't want to
waste the whole video just talking to
you guys about shortcuts but up here of
course we have dollar sign if we want to
format it to a percent we can do that if
we want to change the decimal places we
can do that and we have limited options
right here but we have a whole slew of
other options as well see we're not just
eliminated these buttons some of these
menus in the ribbon or options they have
an additional on pop out menu if you
click this little symbol right here so
click that and as you can see you have
just entered the matrix of formatting
cells this gives you complete control
pretty much formats it any way you could
possibly dream up so alignment font
what kind of font you want the border
fill what kind of styling a formatting
we were just stopping talking about so
again if you ever think that okay I want
to format the cells a particular way and
I'm not really finding exactly what I'm
looking for in the ribbon remember to
look for this little pop-out right here
and there you go if you can't find your
choices that you're looking for in there
then well you can't they're all there
okay then they probably don't even exist
so for this tutorial that's all I have
for you guys thank you for watching in
the next tutorial we're going to be
covering well
bunch of cool stuff I'll explain to the
hand obviously so anyways thanks for
watching I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
