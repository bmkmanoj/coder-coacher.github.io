twelve-year-old girl is like hey Bucky
uh you know I did this as that I can go
ahead and like this and it'll only it
won't looked at the entire webpage it'll
just you know update that little section
right there
so another thing on that it does is I'll
show you guys some other examples later
but that's basically what Ajax is it's
it allows you to communicate with your
server while the user is still on the
webpage without interrupting their
experience and another couple cool
examples is say you wanted to you know
go to Google and look for a webpage say
you want to type in the new this is a
jet this is excuse me little Ajax that
you see right here all this information
of the new it isn't stored on your
computer what this is doing is is
actually communicating with a server and
as you type in your query it's going to
the server it's getting new information
guessing about what you're going to type
in and whenever it has those guesses it
displays them on your webpage so every
time you type in something your webpage
isn't you know refreshing it's actually
just updating this little smart small
portion right under your imp up box and
the last thing I want to show you guys
is way back when what you needed to do
whenever you submitted a form or signup
for a web page is you basically needed
to submit all your information you know
your ID and this is just a Bay right
here your ID your password your you know
security question and answer
and you submitted it and then it went
ahead to the server and it was like oh
dude sorry someone already had that ID
well then you need to type everything in
again and that was real pain in the bug
so say that you know what's a common
name Ashley or something say that you
want to use the name Ashley and then you
know we're filling in you know your
password right there well actually at
the same time as you were filling in the
rest of the form what was happening
behind the scenes is that eBay was using
Ajax to take this name and send it to
the server check whether or not it was
taken and then give you the answer
so before you even submit that data eBay
is already telling you dude that name is
available and you're a guy so why would
you even want to use the name Ashley so
that is a couple things that Ajax allows
you to do now for this tutorial series I
just want to mention them you're going
to need to know a couple programming
languages and first of all PHP and
JavaScript are you know basically Ajax
is JavaScript and XML so you need to
know those but I'm also going to be
making websites as examples so you need
HTML and I'm also you going to be using
PHP so if you don't know all of those
HTML PHP JavaScript and XML then you can
probably get by because I'm going to be
explaining everything briefly as we go
along so don't worry but if you arm what
I would recommend doing anyways is
actually going in if you don't know one
of those then just go ahead and go to my
website watch your videos and you'll be
good to go
so hopefully you understand basically
why people started using Ajax and why
it's useful and why it solves a lot of
the problems that you use on webpages
nowaday so now what I'm going to do is
I'm going to shut up and I'm going to
start making some awesome examples and
in the next couple tutorials I'm going
to show you guys how to set up and build
a very simple program or web page using
Ajax so thank you guys for watching and
we can subscribe in I'll see you guys in
the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
