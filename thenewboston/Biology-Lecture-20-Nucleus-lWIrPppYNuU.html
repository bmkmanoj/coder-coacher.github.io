tutorial and in this tutorial I want to
talk to you guys about the nucleus of
the cell now the nucleus of the cell is
basically the brain of a cell
and by the end of this tutorial you're
going to understand what I mean by the
brain of the cell but under a microscope
if you were to you know this of course
is the cell membrane right here I know
it looks like a potato but if you were
to look at a cell under a microscope the
nucleus would look like a big dark spot
in the smack dab middle of the cell so
here is the nucleus right here we go
ahead and label the cytoplasm and
another cool thing is that all of the
DNA inside your cell is actually located
inside the nucleus now it isn't just
like tangled up in a big ball and
floating around I'll go ahead and get my
color so this light blue thing is
actually called the nuclear membrane or
some people call it the nuclear envelope
so your nucleus is basically protected
by this thing called a nuclear envelope
basically the same way that your cell is
protected by a cell membrane
both have a lot of similarities they
both have pores that allow things to
pass through your nuclear envelope allow
things like proteins and other things
pass through but its main job is to
protect the DNA inside the nucleus now
there are other things aside from DNA
inside there and we'll talk about that
later on whenever we figure out exactly
how proteins are made in the cell but
just remember right now that inside the
nucleus is DNA and surrounding that DNA
is a nuclear envelope and the nuclear
envelope is similar to the cell membrane
because it protects the nucleus and
allows certain things to pass through
now the reason that people called the
nucleus of your cell the brain or
control center
these are terms that you're going to be
hearing a lot is because the DNA inside
the nucleus
obviously as we already know contains
instructions on how to build proteins in
proteins do a lot of different things
throughout your body and another thing
is what the cell does this cell right
here what it does depends on the action
of the proteins that it creates so
that's why people say that the nucleus
is indeed the brain or control center of
the cell because it's very important now
a lot of people were debating you know
what is the nucleus really the brain of
the cell is it really that important
because yeah it has DNA and stuff but
how important is it well let me go ahead
and dry guys a little experiment and
hopefully you guys will understand just
how important the nucleus is so if you
transplanted the nucleus from one cell
into the cytoplasm of another cell go
ahead and get a new color actually let
me go ahead and get yellow so if you
were to take the nucleus will say from
cell a and plop it over into the
cytoplasm of cell B what would happen is
the cell cell B will call this one cell
a over here it would start behaving
according to the instruction from the
new nucleus nucleus a so no matter what
that cell did before it would start
behaving according to whatever nucleus a
told it to so that's why people
definitely agree then after this
experiment that you know what indeed the
nucleus is the true brain or true
control center of the cell
so again we'll talk more about you know
translating nuclei and all that good
stuff later on when we learn exactly how
proteins are made but for now just
remember all this stuff right here
basically what we need to remember is
the nucleus is basically the brain of
the cell it's going to look like a big
dark spot in the middle of the cytoplasm
and aside from DNA there are a couple
more things that are stored in the
nucleus but just remember that DNA is
stored in the nucleus of the DNA and you
so and of course we have to remember the
nuclear envelope protects the nucleus
and it allows certain things to pass
through and in the next tutorial we're
going to be talking about ribosomes and
we're going to learn about a couple
things that are allowed to go in and out
of the nucleus but for now thanks guys
for watching don't get subscribe and
I'll see you guys in the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
