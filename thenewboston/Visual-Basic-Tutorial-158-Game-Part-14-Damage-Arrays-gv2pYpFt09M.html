attacks at index of current enemy dot
attack num now attack num may not show
up for you that is perfectly fine
because what you need to do is come over
here into enemy VB and create public
attack num as integer you don't need to
do it in any of your other enemy classes
other classes because they all inherit
enemy and when they inherit everything
from enemy they are going to hear it
inherit the attack num so it can be used
for all types of enemies and it needs to
like I said it needs to be public as
integer in your enemy so then we will go
ahead and add close that in brackets and
then we will say for and then we're
going to do the damage so we'll do
current enemy dot and we're gonna get
attack damage at index of current enemy
dot attack num now you may notice that
we don't actually have a current enemy
dot attack damage so what we need to do
is we need to come into each one of
these classes and make that so we'll go
ahead and do public read only zombie
attack damage now you may notice that
we'll have a conflict because of this we
can't we would have to find out what
type of enemy it is and then do it
according to that so what we can do is
come over to enemy and we can do public
read only attack damage
as string and since each enemy has three
attacks we're going to put a three right
here so it'll have three places at
indexes of 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 now for each one of
the classes let's go ahead and make a
constructor so sub new and we'll go
ahead and do int health equals start
health so let's see here
so we'll come into each of our enemy
classes and we will just go ahead and
add the items to the attack damage
alright so we'll just type attack damage
at index of zero it's gonna be equal to
and we'll come over here to attack and
for the first one let's just do set it
equal to ten so so we'll set that equal
to ten and then attack damage one it's
going to be equal to five and then
attack damage - it's going to be equal
to let's see - now you see here that it
won't let you set values outside of a a
sub or a constructor so we can just just
go ahead and copy this and we will just
type sub new so we have a constructor
and if we put this inside the
constructor it's going to go ahead and
set those values for us now don't worry
about the constructor inside of our
enemy class because that code will still
run - it'll set the in Health equal to
the start health and then it will do all
of this right here
so what we're going to need to do is do
that for each one of the classes so I'll
pause and then come back once that's
done okay so you can see that I've done
that for each one of these classes done
it for Dragon villain and zombie and
I've changed the values accordingly now
you can go ahead and use indirection
right here if you would like but I'm
gonna leave that the same for this
tutorial so come back into for Mondavi B
so we've got current enemy attacks
attack now
and you can see now that our attack
damage in our tech Nam works and then
we'll add damage so go ahead put this
code in if you have it if you have any
questions leave them in the comments and
they stay tuned for the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
