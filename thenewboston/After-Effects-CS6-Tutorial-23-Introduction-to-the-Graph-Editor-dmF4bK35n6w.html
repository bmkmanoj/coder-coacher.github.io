buddy Blackford and it is hot as hell in
my room right now no we're going to
learn more about After Effects cs6 from
the new boston's channel and this time
I'm going to teach you about the graph
editor and in this tutorial I'm going to
explain the graph editor and explain the
buttons I wanted to let you guys know
that I checked my computer earlier
because it was going slow which you
can't tell on the tutorials but I was
experiencing some performance issues so
I opened it up and notice that it was
super dusty and dust was caked on so I
wanted to just do a quick shout-out to
everybody to check your computer and
make sure you dust it out it'll like
it'll expand the lifetime you want to
expand it it'll it'll keep the lifetime
up higher than it would be if it was all
dusty so just check it out and dust it
out on a regular basis let's get to the
tutorial now so the graph editor is this
button right here I added a rotation to
my tunic and so it does a little flip
there and you can notice that it's not
perfect at the end it slides so that's
what we can use the graph editor to fix
but the graph editor button is right
here it is used to animate properties
manually so you can animate rotation
position among a lot of things you can
edit that edit them in the graph editor
as long as they're animated the hotkey
for the graph editor is shift at 3
so let's shift f3 although I feel like
it's easier to just click on it so that
you don't have to take your hand off the
mouse I don't really don't like using
two-handed shortcuts some some of you if
you have bigger hands than I do maybe Oh
to reach that so let's get on with the
graph editor here to zoom in and out of
your graph editor you can use this
slider down here it was really fast you
can also use this slider up here both do
kind of the same thing this slider seems
like to be a little bit more fine-tuning
there and you can move around from left
to right with with this slider down here
on the graph you show animated
properties is going to be unselected at
first so I'll unselect that so you guys
can start off in the same position I am
on the graph x-axis equals time so going
from left to right is time and it's
going by frames as you can see up here
the the frames up and down is the y-axis
and that is your values
you can hover over the motion path here
to see which type of a property you have
selected and which layer you have
selected so I've got tuna selected it's
rotation and then the value right now is
164 point 32 degrees so if I go to this
spot right here
that's 164 point 32 degrees around
around that around that spot you can
hover over top of a keyframe to see the
time that the keyframe is at and among
this and the same things like the
rotation and the degrees and everything
like that the values you can if you zoom
in far enough your your line here it
will go off the screen you can hold
spacebar to drag
as you can see while I'm dragging the
the graph was automatically adjusting to
the high e watch if you watch these
degrees right here it automatically
adjusts to the height of your line so
you can see now that the degrees are
changing there that was the autosave
that popped up it's gonna do that from
time to time so there you go with that
and I can go over the buttons with you
so I'm gonna zoom back out and the
buttons down here this right here is the
choose which properties are shown in the
graph editor button that's the technical
name for it so if I uncheck show
selected properties
nothing will be shown because we can't
show anything so we have what selected
position so position is going to show up
now if I show animated properties that's
gonna show both of them because I have
both position and rotation animated the
next menu that's over is the graph
options and the graph types so I can get
into these later on I would always have
the auto select graph type on and show
graph tooltips on for now this next icon
that looks like a set of buckyballs
and not what you guys may be thinking
get your mind out of the gutter I mean
I'm talking about these here these are
fun to play with on your desk at work
let me tell you what if we all sent a
bunch of these to Bucky
hmm that would be cruel so do not
advocate that the next button over it
that looks like a magnet here oh I got
to tell you what the buckyballs one does
so this is the transfer show transform
box around the selected points so I can
select these right here and then click
on this one and now it makes a transform
box and I can move it around there you
go
get control Z to get back to where I was
I'm gonna uncheck the transform box
there and now we can get to the magnet
tool this is the toggling the snap on
and off so if I want to move this Keeney
keyframe here by clicking it oh I have
too many selected unselect and then
click on the keyframe and then I can
drag it and if I hold shift it'll snap</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
