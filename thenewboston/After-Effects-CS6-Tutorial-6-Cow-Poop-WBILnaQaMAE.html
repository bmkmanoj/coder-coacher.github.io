of X cs6 tutorial from the new Boston my
name is buddy Blackbird today we're
going to be talking about the
composition panel and I'll explain to
you what the different buttons on it do
the composition panel is right here in
the middle it's one of your main viewers
and you'll be using it all the time so
it's good to know what all the buttons
do so before I started tutorial I wanted
to share with you something that
happened to me this morning I helped out
at a farm in the mornings and we got to
wake up at 4:30 in the morning to feed
cows so when I was I was all up but like
barely awake like a walking zombie or
whatever and I just walked in through
checking stuff out and one of the cows I
walked behind just decided to have a
bowel movement and it was like a
waterfall or something that was gross
and I had a hoodie on and I was right
behind him not paying attention and I
went straight into my hoodie pocket and
like came out the side of the other side
of the pocket and was disgusting as hell
and almost made me barf needs us to say
I don't own that hoodie anymore it went
straight into the trash and luckily it
warmed up I didn't have to like I wasn't
cold anymore it's a little cold up here
sometimes right now it's pouring pouring
rain
so this fog thought I'd share that with
you my little misfortune of bad luck
today hopefully the rest of the day goes
better I took a nice nap after that
though it was pretty good so let's get
back to the composition panel we'll
start up here on the little drop-down
menu here let's see we drop it down you
can create a new count viewer see that
just makes a new one and it
automatically comes locked let's reset
this I don't want that copier to be
there anymore workspace reset
you all right and you can switch between
your different cop viewers here they
just go through the comps that you
already have in your project panel you
can lock the viewer that it doesn't mean
you can't move it around all that means
is that when you open up a new one it's
going to open it up in a new new window
so I could have just clicked X last time
to get rid of it instead of resetting my
workspace but and if you unlock it you
can just go back and forth between
different compositions instead open it
up a new window so down here is the of
always preview this View button and at
some point we'll get to use these
buttons more often and then you'll use
them throughout there's a couple that
you always use this is the basically the
view the size of your view so if we go
to fit it'll put it to whatever view
your cop is our composition screen is
depending on how big your screen is and
how big you have the comp set so if I
drag this all the way down let's put it
at like six point two five whatever and
then I hit fit
it'll just fit it right to it bring this
back up
it's going to fit and just automatically
sizes that when you have it on there
this this button here brings up your
grids and stuff so you get to title in
action safe if you don't know what that
is the title safe for television is here
and any words that you put down like
anything like if you're making scrolling
text for credits or something like that
you must keep them inside these this is
the action safe where any video footage
that it's good this is where it's going
to end and this is the invisible area on
the end here you can also bring up a
grid oh and then other kind of grids -
you got your rulers you can it's kind of
like the Photoshop rulers and stuff and
most of the time you'll just keep keep
all those off now the next one here is
the toggle mask and shape path
visibility we have here the current time
down here in your timeline so if I move
this it's going to change let's go back
to where we were and then the next one
is the take the snapshot button so say
your client wants you to see what you
have done you can take a snapshot and or
if you want to try different effects and
your client wants to see them real quick
to see how it looks like if you're color
correcting then you can take a snapshot
real quick this is the show snapshot
button the next one is the show Channel
and color management button as you can
see here so you can check out your alpha
this has no alpha I'll explain what an
alpha is a later date this is your
resolution cut in half and or to a third
or something sometimes if you have a lot
of effects going on it bogs down your
computer so you can cut the resolution
in half
and you'll be able to render more and
your computer won't go so slow when when
you're trying to scrub through the
timeline and everything this is uh
called the region of interest button so
click on it and it lets you draw like a
square and then only that sectional
render so maybe you're just trying to
change the color of this sign here and
you keep on messing with it but you
don't want to waste time rendering all
the other stuff you just want to see
what the sign looks like every time use
the region of interest button click on
it again to take it off this is the
toggle transparency and what that does
it won't work if you have all footage
around if the whole thing is covered it
won't work so let me take off the the
visibility of this footage real quick
and I can click on the toggle visibility
and then you can see what is going to be
transparent what or what nothing is
there so let's put this back on this is
the Camera 3 camera views so you can
control your camera's when you're in a
3d view I don't have anything 3d on
right now and so at some point we'll use
that because After Effects uses tons of
3d space the next one is select layouts
and you can change how you look at
different things so like maybe one view
can be from the left one one view can be
from the right and then that way you can
see different different sides at the
same time useful for working in 3d space
this button here is the toggle pixel
aspect ratio correction
the next button here is the fast
previews menu so it brings up a small
menu here also good for training stuff
this is the bring timeline forward
button this here is the comp flowchart
button and these two buttons here for
exposure so this one resets and this one
adjusts exposure and then you have your
options panel up here which is on all
the this is on there's an options panel
on every single one of these but they're
all pretty much the same so no need to
go over it again and that's pretty much
it for the composition panel we'll hope
to see in the next tutorial well we can
discuss the timeline panel down here so
keep on watching have a good day
