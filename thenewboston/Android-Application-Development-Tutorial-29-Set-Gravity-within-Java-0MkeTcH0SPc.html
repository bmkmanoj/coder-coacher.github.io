Android tutorial for the new Boston
again we're going to have some text fun
in this tutorial against Travis so
hopefully you guys know my name by now
and what we're going to do is basically
set up or kind of determine how to set
the gravity within within Java so before
we do that I just wanted to open up our
text XML real quickly and make sure you
guys have this text field at the bottom
which was our TV results or basically
our display and Java is what we called
it but again the gravity we set Center
in XML so it's in the center of the
screen but also for what we're going to
do in this tutorial this is the most
important part you want have to lay out
with as fill parent so if you guys
follow along you shouldn't have to
change that or anything but just just
make sure activity works for the most
part make sure it says fill parent and
the gravity is currently set to center
so now we're going to go into our java
text play Java here and we're going to
set up our we're going to determine how
to set up the gravity within XML or with
in Java so we created this textview
called display and that's the textview
we were just talking about in the xml
now we're going to use it within this
method so we're going to say display to
play display and we can say use some
methods on it and it's pretty easy we're
going to say set gravity makes sense
right because that's what we're doing
and what we're going to define the
basically within the parameters is we're
going to refer something to something
from within the gravity class so again
this is the class called gravity we're
going to hit dot and then we have some
choices here so as for this is a our
check string equals left so we're going
to set the gravity to left so again it's
just gravity dot left and then we just
hit our semicolon and finishes again
we're getting this error because we need
to add a final to our display object
when we when we started it
so we're just going to do that again
it's just right there final and then
basically we're going to do the same
thing for the center and right and it's
going to be the code gravity center and
gravity dot right all uppercase for the
center left and right so there we go we
basically have our application set up
but you know we're still going to do
some other methods so we're just going
to copy and paste this if else and set
up the brackets for our next tutorial
for the most part hit enter and we're
going to actually we're just going to
use one and we're going to say blue so I
just want to show you the example of how
to change the text color so if it if
again they say blue we're going to set
that up in the next tutorial if you guys
don't really care about the color you
can skip the next tutorial if you want I
won't be offended but I mean either way
I'm still going to cry at night I'll go
to bed so alright let's check out our
application make sure it works
bah-bah-bah
again that I hope that's pretty pretty
easy concept that's just the textview
and then we're setting the gravity
within Java so click our text play and
then let's test it out we're going to
say left and I'll turn the toggle off so
you can see the text goes to the left
pretty sweet but again it's case
sensitive so if we did did right like
that it's not going to work so again
thanks guys for watching I'll catch you
guys in the next tutorial where we're
gonna learn about colors for the most
part alright see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
