second twenty second JavaScript tutorial
and this story I'm gonna be going over
some very basic math objects and basic
math functions that you guys are going
to be using in your future programming
now this is gonna be a real quick
tutorial because the rest of the
tutorials from here on now are going to
be pretty advanced so this is probably
going to be one of your last basic
tutorials and again in this tutorial
we're gonna be using another object and
we're gonna be working with the
document.write object to be using the
math function with some built-in
functions such as around and random so
let's get started and the first thing
that we want to type is document and
this tells JavaScript that we're gonna
be working on the web page itself
javascript calls that the document and
we're gonna want to write something on
it so just put right we use alert before
but since we're gonna be and we could
put alert right here
well actually this will make it a lot
easier just do this so never mind the
last couple things I said but uh as you
can see in your object which this is a
browser object because it's part of the
browser you're going to want to add two
empty parameters now inside those
parameters since we're using a math
function type in the word math
now the next thing you type after this
is gonna be different all math functions
begin with the word math and then you
type the period and then you type what
math function do you want to perform now
these aren't functions you just make up
javascript has built-in functions which
you can find probably on JavaScript
website or something but I'm just going
to give you guys a couple examples the
first one called the round function
rounds a number now if we're saying all
right what number does it around exactly
well that's what you have to give it now
as you see we have parameters and we put
math round in here now aside from these
we're going to add two different
parameters and put in any number we want
let's put in a 3.14159 which is the
beginning of pi now as you can see if we
save this and go and refresh it in our
browser on
munch and Firefox
eighty-four 1/5 m as now around it two
three now what the javascript math round
function does is round it to any whole
number with 0.5 if you remember round up
to four but if we were wondering all
right but what if we have a negative
number well let's see let's say we have
negative five point eight nine now if we
save this and refresh this and our
browser as you can see it still rounds
to the nearest whole number
now as you remember a whole number can
be either negative or positive so make
sure you remember that when using math
around now another real basic one and
one of my favorite functions I use all
the time
it's called math.random and what this
does is generate a random number for you
now as you can see this parameter right
here is going to be totally empty since
why would you want to give it a number
if it's just going to generate around
one so let's save this and refresh this
and as you can see JavaScript gives you
a random number now if you think this is
a pretty worthless then think again
because anytime you're building like a
game or something and you said you want
something to happen half the time
just uh this is something you do along
with some other code that says alright
pick a random number 100 if it's below
50 do this if it's above 50 do this and
that's how people get things to happen
half the time randomly like if you're
making an online slot machine or
something
so again the math round function in the
math random function are two very basic
built in math functions that use the
math object so study these and just to
get your basics if you want to learn
more math functions they should be on a
million different websites but I'm not
gonna go over them all just wanted to
show you guys the basics of how
JavaScript math works so I hope you
enjoyed watching and as I said the next
tutorials we're gonna be getting into
some more advanced JavaScript so make
sure you subscribe if you like my videos
