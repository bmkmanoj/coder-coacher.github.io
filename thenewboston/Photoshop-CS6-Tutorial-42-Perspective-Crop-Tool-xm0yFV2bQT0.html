buddy Blackford here with another
Photoshop cs6 tutorial and today we're
gonna learn how to use the perspective
crop tool and this is a new tool within
cs6 so we're gonna you might be learning
this for the first time so what you do
with the perspective crop tool is you
create a crop selection and then you can
adjust the perspective to make it look
like you're looking at the cropped image
in a different way now there are some
pitfalls to this where your image may
become a little distorted and things
like that so it's good to use in you got
to know how to use it so it doesn't
distort everything don't make huge
adjustments and everything like that but
we'll get into that later
so the crop perspective tool is best to
use on images that already have
perspective to them as you can see this
bike the back of the bike is closer to
us and the front of this bike is farther
away now I want to use this image to
maybe make the bike look like it's the
same size are like going like the same
way across so that everything is the
same exact closest note to us so like
bringing this bike tire forward and
pushing this one back so what we're
gonna do is create a selection right now
and then this selection turns into a
grid you can adjust any sign of the grid
you want and it'll move that way so what
I'm gonna try to do here is bring this
part forward I mean bring this part down
I don't need to bring it forward at all
I want to keep it straight so let's
bring that down and maybe bring this
side a little up on this side a little
down and what this is gonna do is gonna
give me a new perspective on the bike
bring this up a little
so we're gonna get this looking this
type of perspective on the blank now up
here at the top I'm gonna hit clear
that'll clear out all the information
you have in here you can leave it as it
is and not type in anything and press
enter or hit this check mark up here and
you'll get a cropped image with a
perspective on it so that's why I'm
going to do a hit enter and we've got
this image and it didn't work too well
looks like I didn't go too much I didn't
do it too well so here's what we got
notice that the image isn't like
distorted or anything however well it is
distorted but it wasn't too like really
distorted I'll show you an example of
some of another kind so I'm gonna have
to do this again and I'll just try to do
it I'll just do these real quick this
time and not try to get into too much
detail so pull this up pull this down
try to keep the back tire in there so if
I you click on front image it's gonna
use the size of the biggest image that's
in the front so it's got our different
inches here of what our image actually
is and then the resolution with the
images and now if I hit enter or press
that checkmark button we're gonna get a
image that is the same resolution and
now the bike looks like it's a little
more straight on instead of instead of
more tilted away from us now it's not
gonna be perfect because you can see
like the black handlebars and the bike
seat are like facing away still so we
got some visual cues here that can leak
like later I believe that's little
facing away but overall it's more
towards us in perspective so that's how
you use that tool now I just wanted to
show you how this doesn't work very well
on flat images that have no perspective
so let's go to this one now this is
pretty much a straight
shot of this of this lifeguard tower so
let me make a selection on it with the
perspective tool and maybe we want to
look at it like like we're looking at it
from below so let's bring it in like
this
so this will make it wider at the bottom
and smaller at the top so if I hit this
button here to select it now it distorts
the image and it's not really what we
wanted to see so I need to go back do it
again bring these closer in it's not
gonna be perfect I just want to save
some time bring these out a little and
then we'll tip front image and do it
again with the image being the right
size and you can still see how it
distorts it and doesn't give us the
perspective that we really want so it
doesn't work too well on these kind of
images are straight on it works on well
on images that are it have more of a
perspective so that's how you use the
crop tool you can toggle the grid on and
off on this by clicking on the show grid
button so if those grid marks get in
your way and you don't really need to
use them at all it helps me see the
perspective when I have the grid on
because then you can see the way that
the grid lines move so if you got it
like this otherwise it kind of just
looks like Square to me but then you can
still see some perspective and
everything like that also I just wanted
to let you know that you can rotate the
image the crop image here so just drag
outside the area I mean just just like
you're rotating with the free transform
whenever it turns into a double arrow
that's bent that means you can rotate
so that's it for using the perspective
crap tool it gives you a crop and then
adds the perspective that you created
using the transform tools on the crop
selection area so that's it and thanks
for watching I'll see you guys in the
next tutorial it's gonna be awesome see
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
