tutorial for the New Boston and we're
going to do this tutorials basically
finish up our application and we're
going to briefly talk through everything
and we're also learn about permissions
in this in this tutorial it's quite a
few things but it's going to be pretty
simple and I did check it on my phone
basically the emulator is messed up in
the last tutorial I don't know if it
can't use the the camera application or
what but it does work on my phone
anyways so what we're going to do now is
basically get the image or this bitmap
that we collected from the data that was
received after our camera application
finished we're just going to set that
picture to the actual phones background
even when they're using our application
you know the wallpaper of the actual
phone so it's going to be pretty simple
now that we have this bitmap setup we're
going to use a bitmap to set the
application or the wallpaper of the
actual phone so how we can do that is
we're going to say get application and
I'm sorry this is within our if our
other button was pressed our set
wallpaper button was pressed that's
where we're setting this up within that
switching case in our on click method so
we're going to say get application
context and that's going to be method
that gets the context of our phone and
we can use some methods on that there's
one called set wallpaper pretty
self-explanatory of what that does so
we're just going to scroll down I was
just seeing if there's some other ones I
could show you guys set wallpaper as you
can say see it takes a bitmap and we're
just going to put our bitmap in there
called BMP and finish your statement and
it's going to give us an error because
again this is something kind of sketchy
it might not always work so we're going
to have to surround a try and catch with
it so just click that and it's going to
put it within a try bracket and catch
the exception input-output exception
that's what that stands for and that's
just going to print it to the debugger
or throw it around so there we go we
pretty much finish this application and
the only other thing we need to do is
because we are setting the wallpaper
we're going to have to add
permission and I briefly talked about
this in the past but we do that within
the androidmanifest so again we open up
the manifest and there's this
permissions tab right here so we're
going to add a permission to our
application and we're just going to say
uses permission and we can scroll
through some of the permissions that we
can use and now there's a permission
within this called Android permission
set wallpaper I believe it is something
like that but yes set wallpaper and
you're probably wondering maybe you
aren't but I just want to talk about it
you're like okay so we can use the
camera we can send emails and we don't
permit need permission for that but we
need permission to set the wallpaper
well basically the reason we don't need
permissions for those two other things
that we've done such as a wallpaper I'm
sorry such as sending an email and what
else what did I just say man it is
getting too late it's like 4:00 in the
morning right now basically those other
two things setting an email and using
the camera we can use those because we
aren't actually defining those
activities those are kind of standard
activities and to use those activities
when they created them basically the
email activity that's where they set up
those permissions so we're just using a
different activity for the most part or
a different application all together
same with the same with the camera so if
we set up our own custom camera we'd
probably have to use a permission for
that but the only permission we need to
set up for application is to set the
wallpaper so we're going to add that and
hit just enter whatever and then when we
go into the manifest you see they add
that right here right outside our
application bracket so if you guys feel
like typing it out you can type it there
or again just right below our
application right here that's where I
generally set mine up but when you do it
through the easy tab right here sets it
up above it not a big deal so our
application works I'm going to run it on
my phone and show you guys some of the
errors that this application
as and then we're going to fix those
errors in the next couple tutorials so
alright what's up guys so here's our
camera application that we just set up
and basically I don't know if you can
see alright so we're going to try and
take a picture and it opens up her
camera activity as you can see here I'm
just going to take it take a quick pic
and then it's going to say is that okay
or is that ok are you guys done we're
gonna say done and there oh dang well
there's one of the errors I don't want
to show you guys basically when we tilt
our camera that picture goes away but
just show you guys that this act
activity where this application actually
works and take a picture like this and
then it done and as you can see there is
our image view right here and it has
that picture I just took and then we can
say set wall wallpaper and we're going
to add like a little display so it gives
the person using the application a
little bit of security that did set the
wallpaper but just I want to show you
guys the error that if it tilts it goes
back to our default image up there so
that's something we have to get rid of
and then also another thing that we can
do that's a problem oops as you can see
once it has that default bitmap right
there and we hit set wallpaper it's
going to force close our application but
as you can see I'm outside of our
application now I'm in my actual home
page and it has that picture set as the
background I don't know if you can tell
that looks pretty blurry and everything
but that's fine so our application for
the most part works we're going to fix
some of those areas in the next
tutorials so I'll catch you guys in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
