move is dictated by however whatever
numbers on these dice so for example if
you say you roll a 1 you can take hey
now get over here you can take a checker
and move it one space remember you
always move in the same direction from
high to low so if you roll over on
something else a six you can take this
checker and move it one two three four
five six spaces so again like I said um
the number on the dice dictates how many
spaces you can move so here is how we
start the game as you can see since
you're Brown you have two Brown dice go
ahead and put one in your shaker since
I'm white I have two white dice I'm
going to go ahead and put one in my
shaker now pretend that this is your
hand and this is my hand both players
are going to roll at the same time now
since I have a two and you have a one on
if you can see that but I rolled a tune
you rolled one since I was higher that
means I go first now if we tied and we
both rolled let's see where is it to if
we both rolled a two then what we do is
we just put them in a shaker again and
we're going to keep rolling it until one
of us got higher but since I got a two
that time and you got one if I could
find it there we go here's what I'm
going to do to start out I'm going to
move one of my checkers to spots in one
of them one spot so let's go ahead and
let me think of a good play I'm going to
go ahead and move this one to one two
and I'm going to go ahead and move this
one one remember I'm going to be moving
all my checkers like this and you're
going to be moving them all like this so
now my turn is over I'm going to pick up
my dice put it back in my dice cup now
you pick up your dice and put it in your
dice cup in since I'm done it's your
turn so now put your dice in your dice
cup and roll on the right side of the
board now check this here some little
rules
Rome first of all your dice have to come
from a dice shaker you can't throw them
from your pan or anything like that
another thing is both dice have to come
out if you roll and only one dice comes
out of the shaker it's invalid you have
to roll again and the last thing they
have to be I'm right hand side of your
board
they can't go off the board or anything
like this and the last roll I want to
tell you they can't be cocked on like
any chip or they can't be cocked up
against the side of the board or they
can't land on any chips like that they
both have to land on the felt if any of
these rolls are broken um you're gonna
have to roll again and again these are
the strict back Emeril's it's like gum
you know not only comments courtesy but
if you're playing in a tournament you
try to get away with a roll like this
then they probably beat the crap out of
you so anyways make sure you're using
proper rolling technique so let's go
ahead and click you're dicing your dice
shaker and let's see what you get
you got a three and a two so here's what
this means you can move one checker
three and one checker - or you can
combine one checker and move a total of
five spaces so let's go ahead and take a
look at some options go ahead and move
this checker one two three in this one
one two you could do that for example or
what you can do is move this checker
five spaces so one two three and your
two would be one two so check that out
those are your different options so I'm
going to go ahead and leave you with
that second option right there moving
one checker five spaces now the only
thing I want to point out before I let
you guys go for this tutorial is one
thing that you can't do one thing that
you can't do is you can't land on a
space where I have two or more checkers
so for example you can't take this
checker right here and move one two
three
one two my checkers are already there so
you can't land on my space so I set up
kind of a block for you right here so if
you you know if you were thinking about
landing on space like this
or landing on space like this it's
invalid you can't do that so let's go
ahead and play one two three one two
right now and now your turn is over so
go ahead pick up your dice and put your
dice in your roller right there and
until you put your dice in your roller
you can take back any move but as soon
as you put your dice in your roller
that's like saying that's my end of my
turn
I passed so now let's go ahead and we'll
give me one more roll before I let you
guys go so now again since you just went
it's my turn I got a four and A three so
here's one we're going to do let's go
ahead and move this one one two three
four just like that and I'm going to
move this one one two three just like
that now I'm done with my turn
go ahead grab my dice up put it in my
shaker and now it would be your turn so
now we learn the basics of backgammon
how to set up the board with the bar the
points the checkers mean all the terms
and in the next tutorial what I'm going
to be teaching you is about hitting
which is pretty much means how to make
your opponent really mad how to bear off
and basically how to win the game so
there are a lot of other little rules
and once I teach you guys all the basic
rules then I can begin talking about
strategy and some neat little tricks
that you can do to give you the
competitive advantage so thank you guys
for watching and I'll see you next
