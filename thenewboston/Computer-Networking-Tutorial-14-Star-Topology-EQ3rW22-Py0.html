number fourteen and in this tutorial I'm
going to be showing you guys probably
the most common or I don't want to say
the most common but it's probably the
topology that you guys are most familiar
with because I'm guessing that if you
guys you know are just learning
networking for the first time and you
don't have any weird Network setup this
is probably the one you have at your
house this is called a star topology so
let me go ahead and draw an example of
this say that in your house I don't know
maybe you have a PC maybe a desktop PC
and we'll say you have you know an iMac
or just a regular Mac over here and
let's just draw another PC I've dentally
pcs look like plain old boxes and you
know your mom has a laptop because she
didn't want a PC it's too big and it's
too clunky shut up mom you can oh sorry
that's up that's a little you know
personal problem coming out there and
you also have a server not you know a
waiter or anything like that just a
regular server and in the middle this is
how it gets the name star topology so
what is a star topology well basically
it's many different nodes or main
different devices connected to a central
device now the central device is usually
something like a switch or a router if
you know Time Warner and came and set up
a router and then you took an Ethernet
and connected all of your devices to it
like everyone's PC everyone's laptop
will say that this laptop is actually
you know has a Wi-Fi card in it and also
the max usually have a Wi-Fi card built
in but basically all of these different
nodes are connected to a central device
right here and as you can see if you
kind of squint your eyes and look this
kind of has a star shape because it has
one central device we'll just say it's a
router in this example and it looks like
a star because it has a bunch of
different nodes shooting out from it now
why would you want a star why does you
know Time Warner setup in the system
well first of all it's really
easy for them they only have to manage
one device they don't have to manage
your entire network which provides you
with internet access of course this
would be shown out to the Internet right
there that's evidently the symbol for
the Internet and another thing is that
the cost is really low so cost is
definitely a plus and why is the cost
really low well it's really easy to
manage routers since you know everyone
is having the internet right now they're
made in bulk they aren't really
expensive and anytime you want to get
you know an Ethernet cable or a new
computer that's your cost it's no cost
to Time Warner and if you decide to set
up your own network like this it's very
cheap just to buy one single router
instead of a bunch of different you know
random equipment now another benefit of
this is it's very easy to expand if you
know um we'll say you only have one PC
at first and then you know your
girlfriend moves in with you and she has
a laptop and then you know your brother
just got you know fired from his job and
he moves in and he has another PC on
your router you have a lot of different
ports so you have you know very easy
expansion whenever you want to grow this
network if you want to stick another PC
on here BAM look at that just did it in
like ten seconds so those are the
benefits of you know a star network or
start topology rather than a bus or you
know maybe a ring topology can be kind
of confusing or expensive and the last
thing that I want to point out which I
should have mentioned earlier is that
another reason that people like this so
much is because whenever one node I
don't know goes down maybe you have a
break in the Ethernet cable right here
because your dog ate it or maybe your PC
got a virus so this is kind of you know
messing up the system the rest of the
network still works it doesn't affect
the router it doesn't affect your server
or anyone else's PC and that's why not
only is it easy to fix but it's also
easy to identify and unlike before where
this was a crucial part of the network
this can go down you can even sell it or
remove it completely and the rest of
your network right here is going to work
just fine
now saying that brings me to my next
point which is the downside of this
because I just you know kind of talked
on the benefits of this but there
actually is a downside to this and if
you look since everything is connected
to this one central device your entire
network is dependent on this preppy mega
arrow
on this router right here so that means
unlike before with you know our ring
topology our double ring whenever this
router goes down every single computer
is no longer able to access the Internet
so that's one negative part about this
that every node is dependent on one
single central device and if this gets
broke your router well then you're
screwed your entire network goes down
and another small thing I want to
mention is that this usually has more
cable than a bus or a ring but that's
just you know a subtle downside the main
downside is your entire network is
dependent on one device and if that goes
down your entire network is going to go
down so this is the most common for the
reasons I listed but you have to watch
out and pay very close attention to your
central device and other than that um
overall I would probably highly
recommend this for a home network
because just it's so easy to set up you
can expand it so easy and you know it's
just simple especially to teach so with
that being said thank you guys for
watching and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
