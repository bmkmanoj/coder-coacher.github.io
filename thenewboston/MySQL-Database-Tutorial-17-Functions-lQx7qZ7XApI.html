17 and in this lesson what we're going
to do is I'm going to talk more about
functions because in the last tutorial
what we did is we took a look at the cat
function which basically took a list of
items and put them all together but now
I want to talk a little bit more about
functions and the different type of
functions so basically what a function
is is it's a name that does something
for example concat does something to a
list of items AKA string it together but
other functions have different names so
let's go ahead and take a look at some
simple examples first so I'm going to go
ahead and select the name of a customer
and I'm going to also select another
custom column what I'm going to do is
I'm going to use a function called upper
now again like I said after every
function they always have parenthesis
and in between the parentheses is when
you put the extra information now this
information differs from functional
function for example upper just takes
the name of a column on concat takes a
list it really depends on the function
what you have to put inside those
parentheses but what this function is
going to do is it basically takes to
this column and it changes it all to
uppercase letters so just go ahead and
run this query and then you'll see what
I'm talking about from customers so
again the job of concat was the tie
things together the job of upper is just
the upper case everything and each
different function has a different job
so that is how you can think of
functions just jobs so as you can see
here is the original name just standard
format and whenever you apply the upper
function to the column name it changes
everything to upper so using functions
is actually really simple just go ahead
and write the function name and then put
whatever information you need to write
in between the parentheses now another
cool thing is we already saw concat and
upper those are called string functions
basically they're functions that you can
apply to characters or texts but you can
also use a numeric functions for example
get the absolute value of numbers get
the square root of numbers
let me go ahead and show you guys an
example select cost and I'll also make
my second column to find the square root
of cost so square root is the name of
the function and cost and by the way I'm
not going to show you all the functions
because once you learn how to you know
use functions in a very basic fashion
then it gets kind of you know repetitive
so instead of showing you all the
functions I'm just going to show you the
basics and if you want a list then go on
the MySQL website or probably a bunch of
different websites have the list of
functions but anyways in the first
column it's going to be the original
cost of the item and in the second
column I'm just going to get the square
root of that cost from items now to be
honest I would have no idea when you
would ever want the square root of
something how much something cost
because you never go into a grocery
store see boxes cereal that's like five
dollars spike hmm I need you to know the
square root of this you know but this is
just an example so basically as you can
see the first column is the cost 14 - or
excuse me 150 - 15 bucks and the second
column is the square root of that number
so the square root of 149.99
is 1224 so on and so forth so that is
how you can use very simple basic
functions both character functions and
numeric functions however since I have
time I might as well show you guys this
there is another type of function and
that's called an aggregate function you
see what these functions did is they
basically changed the data in some way
so you ended up with an entire column of
information so the original column was
this and then your new column was the
exact same length for exists in this
example each one was like 30 rows long
well what an aggregate function does is
it takes an entire column of information
and it gives you one answer for example
let me go ahead and I would say I want
the average of this column so what it
would do is it would add up all of these
numbers and give you the average and of
course the average isn't 30 columns long
it's only one answer so say we want
to add all of the items together the
price of all the items and figure out
the average cost of all of the items on
my website in order to do that just go
ahead and select average is an aggregate
function so this is only going to give
you one number as a result not a whole
list the average cost of all the items
so let me go ahead and run this and
check it out instead of giving you a
huge list of numbers it just adds up all
of the prices of all the items on your
website and the average cost of all of
them is 463 dollars there you go but
what if you wanted to figure out
something like how many bids are on all
of the items well what we could do is we
could hop over two items and say okay
bids 3 plus 32 is 35 + 566 is oh I've
got to go ahead and get my graphing
calculator or what we could do is we
could just use an aggregate function so
in order to do this the aggregate
function for this is sum what sum does
is it takes a column of bids and that
adds up pretty much adds them all up
figures out the sum of all of the bids
so let me just finish this query from
items and check it out there were ten
thousand nine hundred and thirty nine
bids made on all of the items on my
website pretty sweet huh so in the next
tutorial what I'm going to do is I'm
going to talk to you guys about the
different aggregate functions and also
show you guys some other cool examples
and how to run several aggregate
functions at once so there's a lot more
to cover with functions and aggregate
functions so sorry but you aren't done
yet so thank you guys for watching don't
forget to subscribe and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
