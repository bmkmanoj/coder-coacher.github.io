Android tutorial and you know I've
realized that you guys have matured
quite a bit in the Android world over
the past 15 tutorials I think it's about
time to tell you guys about the
lifecycle of the activity class and such
an idiot
all right what we're going to do is talk
about the lifecycle the activity class
like I said because what happens now is
we had our application run but still our
splash screen is there if we hit the
back button it's going to go back to our
splash activity and we don't want that
because you know want a splash activity
to basically kill itself after it's been
been been displayed for the most part
because it's taking up some memory or it
potentially could take up some memory so
we're going to free up some of that
memory for the most part and that brings
us to the lifecycle of an activity now I
looked up the Android developer page
this is great resource for you guys to
use just search activity and it will go
to the life cycle of activity that's
where you guys can find this I'm just
going to talk through kind of the life
cycle and which methods are important
for the most part so here's what happens
an activity starts our splash screen for
example starts then it calls this
oncreate method that's where we set up
our thread and we set up our layout or
set content view set up some of all of
those type of variables and then it also
calls on start method after after it
calls on create method then it calls on
resume method then our activity actually
starts running that's when the user can
touch the buttons that we have set up
and interact with our activity C it has
to call all three of those methods
before activity actually starts now if
our activity's running and we get a text
message or for example for our splash
activity starts a new activity the
splash activity is going to go through
and on pause and basically go through
when it's not no longer visible it's
going to go through call an on stop
method
or yeah so basically uh basically the
most important one is the on pause but
if our activity gets shut down it's
going to call the on pause on top and on
destroy so for example if you guys are
creating a game and the person gets a
text message right in the middle of the
game you might want to have you know a
method or some setting up some variables
or some methods that will save the data
within on pause method because it will
call that on pause method before
anything else happens so that's kind of
kind of the way that you want to think
about it is you can set up some last
minute or save points or something
within this on create method or on I'm
sorry on within this on pause method and
then once our activity gets started back
up its going to go through this on
resume method again before it starts
running so the only method that from our
activity class that we are familiar with
this is on create method but we're going
to kind of use some of these other
methods as well but what I want to show
you guys are sorry I can kind of ahead
of myself here but I want to show you
guys is that we're going to use this on
create method but the only other two
methods are really important for the
most part is this on pause method and
this on resume method because even if
our activity gets destroyed it's going
to go through this on pause method
before it goes through these methods as
well so we might as well set up
everything within this on pause method
and we won't have to worry about these
and also the on resume method we can set
up some of our resume methods or
variables that we need to set up before
actively activity starts again so those
are going to be the three basic methods
that we're going to use for activities
in the future but as for our Splash
activity we're going to get into that
right now so open up your splash
activity and hit enter right here so we
only have one bracket left this is for a
whole class this one is for our starting
method and again we're just going to
right click go down to source override
implement methods and again through the
activity tab we can find the method
called on pause
so this is where we're going to kind of
make our splash activity kill itself so
to say because we're just evil like that
so the way we can do that is hit finish
it's just a simple method and it's
basically going to finish the splash
activity get rid of it and it's going to
be gone forever for the most part until
our user starts up or activity or
application again so pretty simple but
what again is happening is we when this
splash activity starts because it's the
launcher item it's going to go through
this oncreate method that's going to run
and then basically what happens is when
we call this start activity right here
the splash activity is going to call
this on pause method because it's going
behind the starting-point activity
that's being created so it's going to
call this on pause method real quick and
that's where we're just going to finish
our class so we're going to say hey
destroy yourself finish yourself and
hopefully that made sense and you guys
kind of get the structure of how the
life cycle works for the most part and
and kind of what these methods mean
because I haven't really explained what
oncreate method is for the most part so
hopefully you guys like that tutorial
and have a little bit better
understanding of the activity class and
how that works so thanks again for
watching and hope you have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
