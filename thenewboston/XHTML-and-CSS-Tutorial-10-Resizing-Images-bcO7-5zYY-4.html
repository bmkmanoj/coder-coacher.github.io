tenth XHTML tutorial and in this
tutorial what I'm going to be talking
about is how to resize an image because
sometimes you just have images on your
website that are just either they're
probably way too big or maybe they're
way too long with wise so sometimes we
need to learn how to resize an image so
they fit better on our website so what I
did before this tutorial is I went ahead
and I took a huge image of this video
game right here Madden what year is it
Madden ten and I threw in my directory
so I you know I didn't want to show you
guys me doing that because it would just
waste time but this image is way larger
than we need for our website so we need
to figure out a way to resize it and put
it on our website so first and foremost
what we want to do is actually get on
our website before we start shrinking
stuff so let's go ahead and we know how
to do that image let's go ahead and put
our ending tag right now and for the
source the name is Madan one dot jpg so
let's go ahead and save this and see how
it looks oh mama this is like the
biggest image ever no one's ever going
to be to be able to tell what that is
it's like a billboard size image right
there so we want to shrink it so it's
like only 150 pixels tall so in order to
shrink that image here's what we need to
do not only does the image parameter
excuse me the image tag take an
attribute called source but also takes
another attribute called height and we
can set this equal to a ever number of
pixels we want I want my image to be 150
pixels tall so for height set it equal
to 150 now go ahead and save this save
this what the heck save this and refresh
your screen gotta get all my s is in
order and refresh it and see what we get
yeah that's a whole lot better than a
big mumbo jumbo billboard poster we had
on there earlier so now we have a
beautiful small 150 pixel tall Madan 10
the image so you know if you're making a
site like eBay or something that might
come in handy
so before I just let you guys go I want
to talk to you guys about a couple
things you know this is going to be
useful information later on whenever you
resize an image this way it doesn't you
know make your you might be thinking
this all right I'll make all my images
smaller in that way my webpage will load
faster because the file size will be
smaller it doesn't work like that what
your browser is doing is it's loading
that huge big image you know downloading
however many bits that is and then it's
shrinking it so you're not loading a
small image you're loading the huge
image and you're just making it look
smaller so in that sense your web page
is not going to speed up at all it has
to download that huge image no matter
what so it would be better if you wanted
your web page to load faster if you went
ahead into a program like Photoshop or
something and actually took this image
and shrunk it so the image size was
smaller itself and then you just posted
that on your website so in that way
that's what you should do you shouldn't
always you know take huge images and
just post them and resize them down like
I showed you right here what you should
do the preferred way is going to a VIP
sees me an image editing program and
make it a smaller file and then put it
on your website so that's a lot easier
way it saves your browser's excuse me
your browser from doing any extra work
server saying all right Bucky why the
heck would you even teach me that if
that's the preferred way to do so well
that ways helpful when you know you're
going to be making an image like maybe
you're making a website with a logo it's
useful when you add images to the
website but what if you had a website
like amazon.com or eBay or even Facebook
where you loud users the upload images
of any size and you shrunk them down to
what you want it would be well I think I
just answered my own question this is
only useful whenever you're going to
have a website like eBay where you can
say
right upload any size image you want and
I'm going to shrink them so they all fit
nice and neat that is when you would
want to use something like that but
trust me making websites like eBay and
Amazon are a couple tutorials away from
now so anyways that is the basics of
resizing image when you should do it and
when you shouldn't do it and why it
doesn't save you any loading time to do
it this way say anyways thank you guys
for watching and the next story we'll
probably be talking a little more about
images maybe finishing them up so
anyways practice adding some images your
website and let me know how it goes so
thank you guys for watching I'll see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
