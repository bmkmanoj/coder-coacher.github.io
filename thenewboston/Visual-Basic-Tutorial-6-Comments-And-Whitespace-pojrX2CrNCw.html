online gamer here for the new Boston and
in this tutorial we're going to be
taking a look at comments now comments
are very useful in your programs and
it's good practice to use them a lot
when you're making bigger programs so
that other people that you may be
working with on your project can read
your code and understand it or so that
you can also read your code and
understand let's say you go back and
then you forget well what was this doing
what is this connected to oh look at the
comments right here tell me what this
does so let's go ahead and create a new
project we're going to select a console
application just going to call this
comment click OK and it will load our
project now let's go ahead and create
that HelloWorld program that we made in
the last tutorial BB is throwing a fit
right now ok there we go let's go ahead
and do console dot write line hello
world and then we'll do console dot read
line okay so now let's add some comments
to this so anybody reading this will
know what's going on so to do this you
start by adding a quotation not double
quotes just single quotes and then
anything you type on that line is going
to be part of the comment so we'll just
say this line writes the text hello
world to the console now down here below
this will type this line pauses the
program and lets the user read the text
now if we go ahead and run this you can
see that the comments don't affect our
code in any way now when you compile
your program comments are always ignored
by the compiler
so is white space so this white space
right here we can add as much white
space as we want and it's still going to
run the same
you can also add multi-line comments and
it won't affect your program at all so
test and if we go ahead and run this
it's going to say hello world you can
also add comments to lines of code that
don't have comments in themselves such
as this console dot write line statement
right here I can add a comment after
that that says hello world is a literal
string and it won't affect the program
at all and if we go up here and run this
it's going to come out fine Visual Basic
also has a built-in toolbar option up
here let me get rid of this real quick
that lets you comment out lines of code
so let's say we want to comment this out
we can just come up here and click
comment out the selected lines or we can
do ctrl K and then ctrl C and it will
effectively comment out these lines and
so now if we go ahead and run the
program you can see that the program
runs fine all it does is lets us read
the line and it doesn't actually print
out hello world and now to uncomment
them you just highlight what you want to
uncomment come up here and click this it
will uncomment it comment it for you now
I can also do it right here and if we
run this you can see that it flashes
open real fast and then closes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
