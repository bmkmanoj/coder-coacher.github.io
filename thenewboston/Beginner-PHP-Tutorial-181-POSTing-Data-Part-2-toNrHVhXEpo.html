we're just using get element my D and
then we're putting value on the end so
let's just test if that works let's
refresh we'll type in test click Submit
and it's not working so let's go back
and see what we might be doing wrong
perhaps if we change the value of this
so I could say insert a text say insert
text value refresh that typing test
click Submit no nothing
okay let's try I'm far let's try and
refresh test so I've been note now I
think I can see the problem and we need
to change this to ID as opposed to name
because we're getting element by ID so
let's change this back to text just to
keep things simple and we can also
change that back to text there and we
can remove that we don't need to declare
it as a variable so let's try and
refresh and see if this works hopefully
it does then we can proceed with our
code no it hasn't so let's just go back
to how we were so ID insert text and
insert
text okay so let's come a refresh test
no okay well I can see the problem and a
guy I he document dot get element by ID
obviously so so yeah so now this is
fixed let's go and preview this in a
browser song on a type test in here
click on submit and nothing's working
dad this is annoying insert text to
change this back to name something that
might be the problem now
let's refresh test No so document dot
get element I did value insert text
think of that and let's change let's see
if that works
nope okay so maybe this to ID refresh W
or something okay so right I wish I was
better at JavaScript I'm really not so
um please forgive me for that okay so I
hope there's probably lots of you
screaming at the other screen at that
point telling me why I was doing wrong
so now we've tested our value we know
how to get our value eventually we've
got this element by ID insert text I'm
actually going to change this back to
text now because I'm going to keep
things simple for the purposes of the
tutorial so again whatever we type in
here we are just displayed to the screen
in the text box for now that's just for
testing purposes so let's get rid of
that after all that hard work let's get
rid of it
okay so now let's go into creating our
jar our sorry our Ajax itself so the
first thing we want to do is we want to
say let's come in here and say if window
dot and we basically need to specify for
different types of browsers which which
method we're going to use to create our
XML HTTP variable or rather what we're
going to set it to so we say if window
dot XML HTTP request and then we come
down and we do something if that's if
that's so true otherwise we do something
if that's false so what would we do if
it's true or we set a variable good ate
XML sorry XML HTTP equal to a new XML
HTTP
request so essentially what we're doing
is we're checking for this first inside
the window and then we're creating it if
it's true so that's just four different
browser support otherwise we want to say
XML HTTP equals new I'm going to create
a new active X object and parameter
that's that we put into here is
Microsoft XML HTTP now bear in mind
while I'm writing this code that
everything I'm writing is case-sensitive
so for example this XML HTTP request
object is in capitals for XML and then a
capital H small TTP a capital R and in
the rest of request is small so ensure
that for everything you write inside of
here it's a bear in mind it's case
sensitive so what if you ended up with
it not working just double check the
case next to what I've done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
