dorg and this is a video tutorial for
the new Boston now continuing from our
previous example we've looked at
withdrawing a specific amount from our
bank account class in our bank account
property so we've got our balance set to
10.5 now in this example we're going to
be depositing money into our account so
let's go ahead and set this back to 0
and let's go down and we'll slightly
modify this I'm going to put a break
here just so it looks a bit better and
if you haven't watched the previous
tutorials go back and watch them because
we do this by we're learning basically
object-oriented programming by examples
so the example is a bank account class
where we can assign a new bank account
to a variable and we can do things like
withdraw deposit money and things like
that so let's get rid of this withdraw
line let's start to create a new method
that's going to allow us to deposit
money in so public function deposit
and in here we can just call the amount
the variable amount once again now
there's no really there's no real limit
we need to check on this because you
know the the the the person's free to
deposit as many as much money as they
want into their bank account generally
so all we need to do here is say this
balance remember and then we need to say
equals this balance plus amount so we're
starting balance it out with zero so our
balance is zero with this deposit method
we're taking in an amount with an
argument here and we're adding it to our
Comment balance so let's go down and
check that this works so we're echoing
out but displaying our balance here and
we are updating our balance in here so
again we use Aleks and then we say
deposit and we can deposit in amount so
I'm going to deposit let's say a
thousand pound into my bank account so
I'm depositing a thousand and then I'm
displaying my balance so let's get rid
of this line first of all and see what
we with what we're left with so balance
zero so now let's come into our code and
uncomment this so now we're depositing a
thousand pound and our balance now
changes to a thousand so now what
happens if we want to deposit a thousand
pound and then we want to say withdraw
two hundred and something so you can say
withdraw
245 for example so you can already see
that this is such an easy way once
you've got your correct structure set up
to do specific things with your class so
we're modifying the property values so
let's come in and refresh you can see
it's changed to 755
so we've taken 245 off of the balance
okay so what we're going to be doing now
is we're going to be creating a new
instance of this bank account class but
in another variable name and this is
going to allow us to have individual
values for each each class that we
initiate if you like so let's go ahead
and get rid of this first of all and get
rid of this so we can write it out in a
moment so Alex equals new bank accounts
so what happens if I want to say Billy
equals new bank account well let's go
ahead to our page and refresh and test
our code you can see that no error has
appeared so what we're essentially
allowed to do is set two different
variables with using the same class so
we are using the same values but for two
different well we're using two different
value classes for two different users
and this allows us to have unique
property values for each each time we
initiate it so Alex will have his own
balance and Billy will have his own
balance so let's go ahead and test this
out so I'm going to say Alex deposit and
we're going to deposit say 100 pound
into our bank account now I'm going to
say Billy deposit and Billy might
deposit say I don't know 14 pound or 15
pound into his bank account now what we
need to establish is whether these two
values now change we've only declared
one balance up here but because we're
using two instances of this class the
values can be unique to each user so
hopefully that makes sense if not this
next stage will demonstrate it so let's
go ahead and refresh and see if
everything's okay yeah everything seems
ok so let's echo out Alex
display balance and remember this is a
method so we are using our round
parentheses at the end so let's echo out
Alex display balance ok so balance 100
so I've deposited a hundred-pound into
my bank account using this deposit
method and my balance is displayed as
100 so now what happens if we say Billy
and change this well you can see that
the balance is only 15 so you can see
that even though we've only got one
class called bank account we're able to
use it for different users so that's
just a echo out both so we you can see
this so now we're going to echo Billy
display balance so we've got two
different balances 100 pound and 15
pound this rep this corresponds to Alex
and Billy see so you can see that we
have two different values and two
different property values so balance is
different for both users even though
we've only got one class so you can
really start to see how this can be
useful in shortening the amount of code
that you're going to have to write when
you use object-oriented programming in
PHP so let's go ahead and just add a few
more things in here so I'm going to say
Alex deposit 100 Billy deposit 15 now
then here I'm going to say Alex withdraw
150 which is not going to let us and
then I'm going to say Billy withdraw and
I'm going to say and we'll just say 250
for example so let's go back to our page
refresh so we've got a not enough money
and come up for Alex but the balance for
Billy here has been changed I know this
looks a bit odd at the moment I haven't
structured it out with regards to output
very well but you can see how that this
value has changed for Billy but the
values not changed for Alex because
there's not enough money and we've been
given that error message through the
method up here when we don't have enough
money in our account so let's just go
ahead and change this to something like
98 and when we refresh you see that the
balance is change again we've got two
for Alex now extrude withdraw 98 pound
out 100 pound and 12.5 for Billy because
we've withdrawn to pound 50 from our
original balance of fifteen pound</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
