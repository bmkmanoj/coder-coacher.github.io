tutorial that I'm making fourth in
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to use threading a
little bit more so all you and me for
this tutorial is a button and you're
also going T on multi-line text box so
text box click this little arrow right
here and make this multi-line and now we
can just make it get multi-line text box
and also we're going to want to have
vertical scroll bars so we're going to
go over to the properties panel go down
to scroll bars and change that to
verticals so now I have a vertical
scroll bar and you're just pretty much
been one I have everything you had in
the last tutorial and you're going to
want to have this method called right
right here and basically it will loop
through this line of code 1000 times so
it will add atom plus I to string which
will increment by 1 each time so the
first time will be like 0 then 1 and 2
and so on and this / r / n string right
here well it will just add a new line so
instead of having atom 0 and add them
one and all those on the same line it'll
just make this be honest different line
each one to be on a different line so
that we can read it a lot easier so now
when we debug we should get on atom 1 or
atom 0 atom 1 all in a line right here
well you'd think that but we're going to
get an error here that says cross thread
operation not valid control textbox 1 is
accessed from another threat other than
threat was created on now you're
probably thinking yourself well we never
ever talked about or wrote code for text
box 1 anywhere besides right here inside
of this thread well it's actually
accessed in the other partial class of
form 1 and we haven't really talked
about that at all and that's called a
designer so every time you are like do
anything or add a control to the form it
records it in the designer or the other
partial class of form 1 in order to view
that we just go to the solution Explorer
and click on the designer and if you
just click on this little plus right
here you'll see that yeah it does
actually access
button1 so and there's nothing we can
really do about that so what we're going
to have to do is we're going to create a
new string up here
I'll let strings call it my string let's
study
equal to an empty string so now we're
just going to do my string plus equals
Adam and then we'll just have it do that
after the thread finishes so I'll do my
string right now we'll do textbox 1.2 x
equals my string and it should do it
after the thread finishes well actually
it didn't and that's because when a
thread is started it'll continue going
continue to do the code beneath it even
though it's still doing this so it can
do it at the same time so what we're
going to have to do since Microsoft is
stupid and decided that they're not
going to have an event in their thread
class or when the thread is finished
we're going to have to make a while
statement here saying while t dot is
alive and that basically just says that
well it's alive or well the thread is
continuing we just want it to do nothing
so let's continue to loop through
nothing until the threat is done and
then we can have textbox one text equal
to our string so we're just having to do
this code right here so with doing
something while this thread is working
so that then when the thread is finished
we can set textbox 1 equal to this
string right here
so now when we click this do button we
should get Adam zero Adam one Adam 2 and
so on
yep now we got all these in here so
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
on threading so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
