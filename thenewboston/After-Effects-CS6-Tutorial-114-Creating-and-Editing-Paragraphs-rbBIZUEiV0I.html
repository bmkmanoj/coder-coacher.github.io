to another After Effects cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackbird and today
I want to talk to you about making
paragraphs and then using the paragraph
panel in After Effects so another way
that you can create text is if you have
the text tool selected and you click any
drag and make a text box well this is
now called a paragraph so you can use
your paragraph panel here to do more
things and then if you just click and
make text by clicking so I'm going to
type in some lines here the text is way
too huge let's go to like 50 or
something like that
blah blah blah dirty Tramp I think
that's from like an Adam Sandler movie
this is movie quote I'm not really one
here's your text ooh
Boston is back where's Bucky now that's
what I see in the comments all the time
so right now we can see at a hundred
percent that we've got huge line spacing
and looks like everything's moved to the
left and all that stuff like that so
let's go to the to the character panel
here and we're going to adjust our line
spacing by coming to this section here
and we'll bring it up so it looks a
little better at least so there we go
with that now I can show you the
paragraph panel a little bit more so
we've got our line tools here we got
left center and right and I'll just show
you what those do real quick so if you I
just want to show you this if you click
on a line you can line up text you can
align it
by itself so just click probably like at
the end and I can online this one in the
center
I can unlined this one to the right I
can align this one in the center and I
can keep this one on the left so you can
do it by line or you can come and do it
all at once
and there's that now you've got your
justifies here so we've got our justify
left justify last centered last right
and all which obviously it looks
terrible but if you have a lot of text
and it's like a paragraph that just goes
past the line and just goes down then
you can use a justify all and it might
look better we have our indentations and
spacing between paragraphs here so this
section here is the indent left margin
below it is indent right margin so I'll
mess with those we're indenting that way
and then indent right we'll move move
everything to the right it'll create
like a line and nothing can go past it
put that back to zero the next two here
are add space before paragraphs
and add spaces after paragraphs so there
we go and then after is going to pretty
much do the same thing because I don't
have a bunch of lines of text there we
go unlike some lines there well into
spaces and stuff
it's all the same friggin waters so here
I'll show you this so here's a before
and you can see that this paragraph
stays together and then the other
paragraphs where I hit enter and made a
line break are different
put that back at zero and then here's
after and then the last one here is
indent first line so there you go there
so that's that's all for the paragraph
panel actually there's some more in the
options panel so I mean if I select
everything I come to the options panel
we've got roman hanging punctuation and
then we've got our leading here top to
top or bottom to bottom
single line and composer every line and
composer and reset paragraph the main
one to remember is a reset paragraph
it's just going to set it to the default
so if you mess everything up and it
looks like crap you can just go to reset
paragraph if you unclick from your text
so click off and then click on your text
layer here and you right click on the
text you get some more options here you
can click on edit text which will allow
you to go back and type in everything
like that now we've got convert to a
point text here when you convert to
point text I'm going to click on it now
you can no longer use the justifies here
and everything's going to be not in
paragraph mode anymore so these lines
that I had as paragraphs before they're
not like that anymore
everything is its own line it's the same
thing as if you just clicked and started
typing like that instead of dragging out
a text box so it converts it that way
let's see what else we got
click on the layer we can change it to
vertical and that's pretty much all
there is the ad text selector and anime
text are in both and I'll go over those
later but that's all I want to go over
this time for real about the paragraph
panel and the paragraph text so that I'm
going to end a tutorial now and thanks
for watching this one I'll I want to see
you guys in the next one where I'm going
to go over some more cool tech tips
see you guys later have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
