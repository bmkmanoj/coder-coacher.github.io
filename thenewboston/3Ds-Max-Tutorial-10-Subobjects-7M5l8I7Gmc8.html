studio max tutorial and in this tutorial
I'm going to be talking to you guys
about editable objects and sub objects
now we already created one type of
object and let's go ahead and let me
demonstrate that just like a basic
sphere or something and what these basic
geometric objects are called they're
called parametric objects and that's all
we've been creating so far so if you're
wondering why they're called this well
if you go in this modify panel how you
edit these objects is basically through
parameters like radius or segments
hemisphere slices but it doesn't really
give you a lot of control over each one
of the individual points like this one
up here we can't really grab one of
these points and stretch it out
not with parametric objects at least if
we want to do that and have precise
control over each one of these points
what we need to do is convert this
object to editable object and to do that
what you need to do is select your
object so go ahead and select it
right-click it and I just want to tell
you this I cannot show you guys how to
do this because when I right-click my
screen recorder will shut off for some
reason so I'm just going to tell you
guys how to do this in what you need to
do is select your object right click it
then when you right-click it there's
going to be a menu click convert to and
then click convert to editable mesh so
again right click convert to convert to
editable mesh and again I can't do it or
my screen recorder or shut off so I'll
pause this and I'll catch up with the in
second alright so i just right-clicked
it press converted and convert it to
editable mesh
sorry I had deposit sorry can't see but
hey that's what you get and as you can
see instead of your parameters under
your modify panel this all changes to
your editable parameter or not
parameters editable rollouts instead so
instead of parameters you have selection
soft selection and all these things well
the first thing I want to show you guys
is this sub object so under editable
mesh in your drop-down list you have all
these sub objects right here
and what sub-objects are are pretty much
the pieces that make up your object or
model and for example if you click
vertex you can see all the vertexes that
make up your model if you can see edges
you see all the edges that make it up so
let's go ahead and we're going to be
working with the vertexes of this since
it's most it's the most apparent one on
the sphere and before I do that I want
to go over something called normals so
go down here and click show normals and
probably need to get your object
selected and now when you click show
normals and select your object you see
all of these lines popping out of your
sphere what normals are is whenever
you're working in editing and editable
mode you can sometimes get twisted up
and you can't really tell what sides the
face and what sides the back
so what normals do is they show you what
side the faces so these normals are
lines that always point away from the
face so if you don't see a line you
don't see the face in these lines they
don't get rendered out so if you want to
work with them and then render it out
you won't see it in your final but I
usually work with them off unless I get
twisted up so that's your real quick
tutorial so now that we're working with
vertexes we can see all of the vertexes
of our element so we can edit each of
these vertexes just like we would any
other you know part of our element so
let's go ahead and click like select and
move tool or something and we can go
ahead and grab a vertex and move it up
just like that so again just like I said
instead of you know having parameters to
the whole thing we can work with these
individual points just like that and we
can you know anything that we could do
before we can do these individual points
and that brings me to my next click away
from that you can leave that point up if
you want so that brings me to my next
topic and that is what is called soft
selection you can see soft selection
over here and it's really useful when
you're working with individual points so
let me actually spin this around so we
can work with the other side what soft
selection does is allow you to work
surrounding points so instead of just
working with the vertex and getting at
pointing all the time it gives you a
more natural way of working with points
so let's go ahead and do soft selection
and I'll tell you guys what this means
the edge distance is pretty much the
range of what you're going to be working
with so go ahead and move that up to
actually we probably need to select
something first move that up to like two
three every like five or something and
what this does is it gives you five
vertexes away from the center vertex so
that's the area that's going to be
affected the fall-off we don't really
need to know the follow up is pretty
much the region spherical and the pinch
is pretty much you can see here let me
let me go ahead and apply transformation
real quick and as you can see instead of
just a huge whomp and Tom pinpoint we
get this nice more natural pull out with
a soft selection so we can go ahead and
move this selection around and now that
you see what soft selection is instead
of just working with a single vertex let
me see if I get a good angle right there
um now I can go ahead and explain the
rest of these parameters the pinch and I
guess it's easier just to look at this
load chart right here this chart is a
preview of what your soft selection is
going to do the pinch is pretty much the
pointyness of your soft selection so if
we increase the pinch it will increase
the point in us let's bring that back
down to zero and the bubble is the
roundness so if we increase the bubble
it increases the roundness so let's go
ahead and bring that back down to zero
and now let's work one with a high pinch
so I'm going to make a pointy mm
probably somewhere about seventy one
right there
and now let's go ahead and pull out one
with a pinch so go ahead and select a
vertex and pull out one and as you can
see this one is a lot more pinched
than the other one so that is pretty
much why soft selection is useful so
again instead of working with individual
points you can work with soft selection
and select a range of vertexes or points
and this gives you a more natural way of
working with objects again pinch is the
point in this bubble is around this and
I guess that's it for this tutorial so
thank you guys for watching hopefully
you learn a little bit about sub objects
and how you can use them to edit the
fine points of your objects so thank you
guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
