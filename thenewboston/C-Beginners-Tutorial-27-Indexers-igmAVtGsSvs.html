toriel and I'm making for London Boston
and in this tutorial I'm going to be
showing you how to use indexers so all
you're going to need for this tutorial
is a button and a class with some sort
of an array inside of it here I just
have a string array with three elements
atom Bob and Joe and you can have like
an integer array or hue or anything you
want but I'm just in use a string right
now the first step to creating your
indexer is deciding on an access
modifier I'm going to make it public and
then you're going to want to have the
type of it and since this is a string
array right here we're going to use
string but if you had like an integer
array then you'd use in so see what I
mean so I'm going to string right there
and then instead of giving them your
index or a name you're going to use the
key with this and then following that
you're gonna want to put two brackets
and now inside these brackets you're
going to want to have a parameter and
you have to have a parameter as you can
see right there it says indexes must
have at least one parameter so what
we're going to make it is the index that
we want to access inside of our array
right here so we're just gonna put int
index and that's usually what you're
going to want to put it but there are
some instances where you're going to
want to use something else and you can
use multiple parameters just like
anything else so just like if you want
to pass it a string parameter and then
we can do that all right so just like
the properties you're going to want to
use the keyword get and set and instead
of just having them have this must set
them to have curly braces you must um
tell the compiler what this in what
you're going to do this index and how
the user will read the information out
of this array right here so to do that
what we're going to do is we're just
going to have it return the index of the
array that we pass through you're
sorting my array and then we're going to
access the index we passed through as a
parameter so whenever the user tries to
read
from this index right here they'll
specify the index that they want to read
it from so if they put like zero in here
then it would return the zero element in
this array so to get Adam and then
that's how we would read it and to set
it I'm going to want to put on the index
of the array that was specified so we're
going to access that element going to my
array and then the student index and
then we'll set that equal to the value
that the user sets it equal to so this
is just the same concept as when we use
properties so this value is equal to
whatever the user tries to set on this
equal to and you can do more of this
like if you wanted to like check to see
if this was like violet or something you
want to check if like an empty string or
something like that
you can do that too but this is all
we're going to do for right now so now
let me go back to the form in order to
access this indexer you're first gonna
want to create a new instance of your
class the name of our class is my class
or to the type of my or my class see the
new class
all right now in order to access the
indexer you just don't want to type the
name of your class view the name of the
infants of your class and then I want to
put a bracket and then see right there
now we get the parameter that we put in
the indexer right there so now we can
just choose the index we want to access
I'm going to choose 0 because that my
name is Adam and I want to access the
element Adam and we're just going to
have it beat this view displayed in the
message box so ready message box show
and we'll just retrieve this element
click this button sugar to message box
this is Adam yeah if we were to change
this to 1 we should get a message box it
says Bob right here yep
and you can also like set change this so
if we wanted to be able to write this we
just accessed in a chain or choose the
index we want to access so we're going
to choose the first element and then
we're going to want to set that equal to
I don't know will study equal to um
Dylan help that's how you spell in Dylan
and yeah so now we should get Dylan in a
message box because that's what we set
the first element and go do it yep
and just like properties if you want to
make it read only you just delete this
set accessory right there and we won't
be able to set it equal to that says is
read-only so that's pretty much the
tutorial on indexers so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
