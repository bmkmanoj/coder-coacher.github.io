Android tutorial with me Travis for the
new Boston what we're going to do in
this tutorial is basically use some of
those IDs that we set up in XML and get
them into Java and set up some variables
pretty much the first thing I want you
guys realize is in XML basically all of
these things are considered as views
that's why we saw this text was called
text view button even is from the view
class basically all these things are
from the view class you can pretty much
think of it like that
and that all are pretty much considered
views now that'll make sense when we get
into Java so let's open up our starting
point Java class within our package
under a source folder and if you guys
have no programming background that's
pretty much fine we'll get into the job
as we go but the first thing I want you
guys to do is go right below this line
and like I said I'm not right now right
now I'm not going to explain too much
about what this is and how Java works
but basically what what it this is is
this is our class and the ending bracket
is right here and within our class we
have a method called oncreate so that's
all you guys need to know for right now
don't don't look into it too much for
the most part you see like the public
the class you're like whoa what's going
on
void ah but uh don't worry about it what
we're going to set up is just just
basically some variables so the first
variable we're going to set up is going
to be integer it's going to be our
counter item basically a number and
we're going to keep track of our total
so basically when you're programming
that is called an integer an integer is
a whole number like it 1 2 3 4 a
negative 1 such as that and to define it
to define your variable basically you
tell you give it a type what type you
want which would be an integer and then
you give it a name so what we're going
to do is type int which stands for
integer again as for a number and we're
going to call this integer counter
that's just the variable that's the name
that we're giving the variable we aren't
setting it equal to anything we're just
setting up our variables now we're going
to define a button as well because we
have
two buttons and ads button subtract
button so we're going to say button ad
and again I hope you guys noticed that I
put a semicolon after both of these
lines that's kind of standard in Java
after each line you want to put a
semicolon and we're getting an error for
a button so basically what I want you
guys to do is hover over the button and
you can see we need to import the button
which basically is a class from the
Android dot widget packet again under
this to point to there's a package
called Android a package called Android
dot widget so that's where the button is
located and so we can use some of the
methods we need to import it the import
comes up here right here Android that
widget dot button so now we can use the
methods from the button class so there
we go we set up a button variable again
doesn't mean anything we just set up
this variable called add which is a
button now we can set up another button
called subtract down here as well but
when you want to define more than one
button you can also just hit a comma
sub for subtract or for a second button
so now we have two button variables and
add button and add subtract button again
they don't mean anything and the last
thing we need to do is set up our
textview so we're going to say textview
and we're going to call this one display
again you guys can name these whatever
you want
this is just the names that I'm using
but we do have to use this type which is
a textview again we have to import it so
we can use some of the methods from the
textview class so we have our variable
set up and now we want to connect
connect them to the XML so what we're
going to do is go within this on create
bracket below the set content view and
again that will be this bracket right
here so that note that way we know we're
within our on create method and we're
going to set our counter equal to zero
starting out with so it's pretty simple
just counter equals zero and then
semicolon and now that set up our
variable counter to zero and again this
variable is an integer and our program
is going to know that now that we're
working with a number for the most part
now we also need to set up what our add
button is equal to and to do this it
might be kind of confusing jumping right
into setting up references right away
but don't make it confusing and we'll
get into this in more detail later but
just within parentheses put button
basically meaning that we're going to
use this as a button and we're going to
say find view by ID just like that
find view is capitalized by is
capitalized and ID as I is capitalized
so basically we're finding the view by
the ID and again all those things are
views the buttons of you text views of
view and we're going to find that view
by the ID of that view so we're going to
put within parentheses our dot ID dot
and then we have our IDs that we set up
in the XML and the last tutorial since
we're setting up our Add button in Java
we're going to say button add and then
we just have to hit a semicolon at the
end of this and we basically set up our
ID now to set up again or we basically
set up the connection between XML and
Java so it's pretty simple for the most
part we're also going to do sub equals
pretty much the same thing just for
repetition sake but fine view by ID and
we're going to use a different ID
because we need to reference the ID of
the sub button so that's going to be
button sub and then just a semicolon and
we also need to set up our textview so
we're going to say whoops display which
is again a textview type variable we're
going to set that equal to within
parenthesis textview and find view by ID
you guys will get pretty familiar with
the find view by ID method but as for
now I know I'm going fast and I'm not
really explaining too much but hopefully
you guys kind of pick up on something
again we'll go back over some of this
stuff so it's a lot clearer or a lot
more clear I should say but basically
now we set up what our variables are
equal to in XML so when the person
touches one of those buttons we know
that it was touched for the most part so
thanks again for watching guys I know we
went through this quickly and I didn't
really explain any of the Java or you
know even what these whites in
parentheses like this or what this
method is but hopefully you guys picked
up something and trust me you will
understand everything as you go
throughout the series have a good one
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
