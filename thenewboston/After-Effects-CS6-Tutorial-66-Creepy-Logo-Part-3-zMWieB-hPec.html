welcome to part three of the creepy
smokey logo tutorial so last tutorial we
learned how to make our smoke and this
tutorial we're gonna learn how to apply
the smoke to our text so the first thing
we're going to need to do is make sure
that the text is underneath the fractal
noise and we're going to right clicks on
the text and we're going to create masks
from text and it turns off the the text
and then it creates outlines here if I
can turn on this you can see it created
masks I'm going to pull this down below
the fractal noise here we're going to
click on the toggle switches and modes
button and we're going to set we're
going to change the Trackman here to
alpha Matt
so that didn't work obviously so I'm
gonna put that back on - no I'm gonna
put the outlines above the fractal and
then change the fractal to alpha Matt
and we're going to turn on a fractal
noise didn't realize that I turned the I
off by accident but there we go now as
you can see the smoke is flowing through
the back there now I like to have my
smoke cooler color there so click on
your fractal noise and go to effect
color correction hue/saturation and come
down to this box right here and check
colorize and then we can colorize this
so it looks cool I like this color it's
at 192 so I'll do a ram preview for you
quick and this Ram preview might take
second apparently so I'll pause it and
then come back when we're improve is on
so the render is complete let's see what
it looks like
and the smoke is going nicely across the
background and it actually looks like
it's smoky back there so I'm going to
stop the preview and you might want to
save it so that's what I'm gonna do and
we'll go back into our main cop here and
you can see that the title is on there
and so it's a looking cool so basically
this composition right here was is this
right here and that's our text so I want
to make the text pop off the background
a little more so I'm gonna create a
layer for it to like brighten up a
little bit but not be too overpowering
so let's create a new layer and it's
gonna be a solid and I'm just gonna say
call this behind make make sure it's the
comp size and we'll make it this blue
blue color
now I'm gonna create a mask something
like this this is gonna be like kind of
like a square that goes across the back
that should probably good it covers up
the text now set its opacity to 20% and
we're gonna feather out this mask a
little bit
actually a decent amount 106 now let's
adjust the mask so it looks a little
nicer and not so like off-center and
everything like that
so that seems pretty decent
the last thing I want to do with this
because it's kind of like blended in
with it I'm gonna set the blending mode
to add so twirl tone that stuff hit the
toggle switches and modes button down
here set our mode to add and now it
looks more like like kind of like a
light so it lit up our text a little and
we made it like a blue light not like
the beer the black blue light which I
kind of want right now but so the next
thing we'll do is we'll make the smoke
go up another like layer of smoke go
across the front so that it's more
creepy you need that so it looks really
nice so we'll do that in part four and
I'm gonna end this tutorial right now
see you guys in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
