Photoshop cs6 tutorial buddy Blackford
here and I'm gonna show you how to use
the content aware patch tool to be able
to take items from to like take an area
from a different part of the photo and
use that as your patch so what I'm
talking about
pretty much is if you take a look down
here on this taxi you can see that
there's some dents in this area down
here you can see a bunch of dents so
what we can do is since this like area
around here maybe we don't like what's
going on in this area so let me zoom in
a little bit so we can see and I'll put
this in the corner because I want to
take parts from this taxi and apply them
to this taxi because this one's a lot
cleaner and a nicer taxi so whatever
what I did was I selected this tool here
called the patch tool and it's within
the Spot Healing Brush tool menu here so
what you can do is you can just draw a
selection using your patch tool or you
can take a selection from your selection
tools here either/or and then come back
and select the patch tool and all I need
to do is click and drag the image over
to where you want it to be affected so
click and let go and then it'll do its
best to put a patch in the area where
you just were so if you're now looking
for it you can't really see that the
dents have been switched with a piece of
the panel in this car so if you're
getting pretty like bad results it may
be because you have your adaptation here
set to either medium strict they're very
strict and that's just gonna give you
like pretty much what's on this and just
put it over here so I'll show you that
real quick and
go back until we have those dents back
make sure that your pan tier is on
content-aware instead of normal so set
your adaptation to very loose or loose
to be able to blend in with the objects
nicely now you don't have to go and take
stuff from this other vehicle you could
just take it from maybe like right here
and then you don't have to go as far
it's up to you so I'm gonna go back
again by hitting undo so let's go to
very strict as our adaptation and I
wanted to use this part of the car right
here and I do it and I deselect and you
can see that there is like a little box
kind of shape that's showing we come to
my zoom tool and zoom in on it a few
times that doesn't look like it's really
blended in you can obviously see the
outside of the box and it's not blended
in very well now if we used loose or
very loose or even possibly medium it
would not have that box around there so
just keep that in mind when you're using
the patch tool let me zoom out of here
because we're really close at the zoom
here just drag out keep on going there
we go
cool so that's how you use the patch
tool good for picking out different
sections of the image that you want to
use to fill into the section that you
were trying to fix so thanks for
watching this one it was a very quick
tutorial only four minutes long so I
look forward to seeing you in the next
one
have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
