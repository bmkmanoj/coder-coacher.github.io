tutorial and in this is where I'm gonna
show ya the last way for now to get
input from a user and that's using a big
old box with like a list in it and it
doesn't sound that cool but it actually
is pretty useful so pay attention the
first thing we need to create like
before is our object I'm gonna name on
box like usual and we need to set this
one equal to WX single choice dialogue
single choice dialogue there we go
make sure you typed everything right
it's pretty important so the first
parameter it takes is parent like before
and then you asked a question like
what's your fav food and then of course
you add the title so let's go ahead
let's keep the elby's same title and
then this is where it gets kind of
tricky the fourth parameter it takes is
a list of options so add your square
brackets and start typing in your list
so tuna for your first oxygen since it's
foods um let me move this over let's see
what can be beef and let's see what can
the other option be sausage I guess and
so you can have as many of these options
as you want I'm just gonna have three
let me make sure I got my apostrophes
right in the same place alright so again
the first parameter is your parent
question title and the list of options
and however many items you make it will
automatically make that many in the list
so let me get this back to right there
there we go
so after this what we need to do is just
like before this box is going to create
whenever you pick one of these items
it's going to have two buns okay
and cancel now you only want to store
whatever they picked if they click okay
because or else why would you even have
a cancel button there so what we want to
do is just like before but a little bit
different if box
duh show modal and this means the button
is directly equal to WX period ID
underscore okay this means if the button
they clicked is the okay button that's
all this means then put your little :
what do you want to do answer box and
what this means is I want to take that
variable that's in box
let me type this out get strings I mean
my selection there we go g-string
selections photo right so this means if
they click that box variable then I
wanna I'm creating a variable called
answer and I want it to hold whatever
they typed in so again let me uh I say
getting long should really cut that out
I'm gonna show you guys how this works
what's your favorite food that was the
second parameter the question this title
was third parameter in your list was
tuna beef and sausage and again you have
two choices at the end you can click one
of these click sausage click OK
and this was from last order she really
get rid of that too but no time so again
one last time here's what's going on
here you created an object called box
and this was equal to pretty much in
here you just created that entire box
like I told you before next you said all
right if they click the ok button then I
want you to store their selection in a
variable called answer if they click
cancel then nothing happens we never get
that variable so that's usually what you
want and well I guess that's it for this
tutorial
and in the next tutorial we're done
getting input from user for now we're
gonna be going over something else
probably but for now that's it thank you
guys for watching hope you enjoyed and I
will see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
