another PI game tutorial video in this
video we're gonna be adding actions to
our buttons so we've already kind of
explained why we can't just call a
function on the click of a button
because if we write out the function it
will run the function onload and that's
a problem so we can't do that but what
we can do is we can kind of do a pseudo
way around this and we can just say
action like this and then we can use
text and we can say action equals play
for that and then we can say action
equals controls for this one and then we
can say action equals quit for that one
and now what we do is we can come up to
our button function which is here and
then we can start asking questions about
the action so here we start with action
equals none I think yeah so we wrote out
none and then we have this question here
if click in zero or if the left click is
is true basically for 1 then right now
we're just planning printing button
clicked but instead what we're gonna ask
is we're gonna say if clicked 0 equals 1
or is true right to 1 and and then we're
going to say action does not equal none
so exclamation we're equal means not
equal so if we've clicked within the
button and there's an action basically
what do we want to do well we're just
gonna say if action equals quit what do
we want to do well we're just gonna do a
PI game dot quit that's pretty simple
and then we would say if action equals
controls we're gonna say we want to run
a controls function we don't actually
have any controls there so I'm just
gonna say pass for now and actually
plugging back quit and then we also need
to quit
and then if action equals play what do
we want to do oh we don't play the game
so we're gonna say game game intro or
I'm sorry I'm not game intro what does
the main loop like yeah game loop there
we go game loop and that'll be good
enough for now so we go to run this uh
game loop not defined okay so at the
moment we're calling game intro to run
before the definition of game loop has a
chance to run so or be loaded into
memory so what we need to do is we need
to cut game intro from there scroll down
to the bottom and we call game intro
down here and now hopefully that will
solve that problem no game loop still is
not defined let me see
Mayans came there that's when we're done
there we go okay so for whatever reason
gameloop was right here
well paused so that we'll run through it
I'm not quite sure what game Luke was
just randomly in my script there I'm
tripping out let's try this again so
play controls quit okay so the quit
works now as a button and now check some
of the other ones real quick controls
shouldn't do anything it should just
pass and then play plays the game but
obviously we don't have a game yet so
now our buttons are working we've got
some actions for them hopefully no one
else have to hit random game loop there
that was weird but yeah so this should
work now and basically what we want to
do now and I think we'll just do it in
the next video is for action controls
we're gonna have it run a controls
framing basically kind of like our pods
did and kinda like your game intros its
own little thing the controls will be
its own little thing or it just displays
like what the controls are for a game so
that's we're going to be doing in the
next video hopefully you guys got up to
this point and as always thanks for
watching
stay tuned the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
