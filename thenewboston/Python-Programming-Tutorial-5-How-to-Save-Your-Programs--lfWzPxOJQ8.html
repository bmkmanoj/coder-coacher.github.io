fifth Python tutorial and in this thora
I'm going to be teaching you guys how to
actually make programs that you can
actually save and execute and treat them
like a regular program now the thing
that we were using right now itit'll is
just that interface and it's a pretty
cool for testing out things but the only
problem this is any time we build
program and we exit this it's lost then
we can never get it again so what would
be the point in creating Python if we
can never save our programs so now I'm
going to show you guys how to do
something where you can save your
programs and show them to people and
execute them any time you want
so instead of this little thing right
here what we need to do is if you're
running idle go to file new window in
this new window pops up right here and
this is the window that's going to allow
you to save and also execute your Python
scripts and programs so before we even
save it we actually need a program so
just go ahead and go red go ahead and
print something real quick print hey now
brown cow and let's go ahead and save
this
so go ahead file once you get a little
program Rin saved and go ahead and save
the somewhere you're going to remember
make a name for it and go ahead and give
it a name press period and the extension
you wan is p/y now this is very
important this is the most important
part of the toriel so pay attention the
only thing you can have when saving a
python file is name it and put dot py
this is going to save it as a python
file next once you got your p py
extension go ahead and press save now
you can execute it so go ahead and once
you got your file there's a couple
things that you can do uh to execute it
now another thing I want to tell you
guys before you execute your program you
have to save it somewhere so if you're
like re I'm not going to save I'm just
going to
it you can't you gotta save it before
you can run it so there are two
different ways once you save your file
you can run it go ahead and press run
and then you can go to head and run
module let's go ahead and do that right
now
and as you can see your little Idol pops
up and it runs it for you another thing
that you can do is just press f5 on your
keyboard and same thing not too exciting
but just a little tidbit of information
so again um well let me just move on to
the next thing um let's go ahead and add
a little bit more to our program and
instead of this let's go ahead and set a
variable and let's make it do something
useful like x equals raw underscore
input and I'm doing this because I want
to show you guys that it can actually be
used as a regular program so let's go
ahead and make it input um let's have
something like enter name semicolon in
on the next line go ahead and print out
hey and then it will print out put the
plus sign and then X and what this
program is going to do is have you enter
a name store an X and then it's going to
print hey and then your name using this
so copy that and I'm going to show you
guys how to do something right now
first thing I want to show you guys is
if you try to run this without saving it
so I'm going to go ahead and press run
run module and it's going to say and I
don't think so Bessie this must be saved
before you can even run it so go ahead
press ok to save and then it runs so
that's what happens if you try to run
your file without saving it so you're
going to go ahead and enter your name my
name Bucky
press ENTER hey Bucky and this is why
creating it in a separate file is useful
now we get to actually make a regular
program instead of just seeing all the
code before
and this is actually application that
can be useful to someone else besides
ourselves so that's one thing that you
can do with it another thing that you
can do this is let me go ahead and well
I won't exit here but as you can see
here's where I save my file right here
on my desktop so I can treat this is a
regular program right now just saying
like it's any other program like
Microsoft Word or anything like that so
the way you do this is just double click
it like a regular program and let me
double click that and bam look at that
we just had a regular program that we
created so let's go ahead and put enter
name
let me put Bucky and whoa what just
happened what it did was it executed but
it happened so fast
that we couldn't see it and I'll tell
you guys why because what this program
does is and this is gonna I'm not just
telling you that you hold on let me get
my thoughts together I'm not just
selling you guys this for fun your guys
actually going to need to know this what
this program is doing is it runs this
and then it runs this and once it gets
done running everything it's like all
right I did my job
see ya I'm leaving it did exactly what
we tell it to but not what we wanted it
to so what we're going to need to do now
and what we're probably going to do need
to do for the rest of these tutorials is
add another line of code and that's raw
underscore input now in your parameters
we got to give them a prompt press enter
and what this is going to do let's go
ahead and remember save it and what this
is going to do right here once I put
these around now I got to save it again
so much work so little time now what
this line of code is going to do is it's
going to allow us to actually see the
output uh turn screen and see what we
created instead of just running the code
and disappearing so again this creates
the program and this allows you to
actually
see what's going on so now once we click
our program and run it and what an
awesome program we built going to sell
this baby for millions it says enter
name Bucky enter now it actually shows
us what we do instead just running it
real quick and disappearing so now we
see our program we can press enter
exit wham bam perfect a little too easy
so again to sum up this again the
graphic interface is pretty cool but
whenever you want to save your programs
you have to make a file and you do that
by putting file new window and then this
brings up this and you can make and save
permanent programs that you can build
and come back to later and later on what
this did right here is pretty much
allowed you to enter a variable set it
to X this is just print statement and
this last line right here is I'm just
showing it to you guys because instead
of just having a program that runs and
disappears this line we're going to be
using it a lot from now on especially
since we have permanent programs now to
actually see what's going on instead
just run the program and disappearing
before we can even tell what's going on
so that is how you do that and that is
your quick tutorial on how to save and
run programs um if you have any
questions then just leave it in the
comment box and I'll try to answer
hopefully someone else can answer for
you if I don't get to it so again thank
you guys for watching follow everything
I did once you learn how to save and
execute programs from your text editor
what I just showed you you're ready to
move on to next tutorial so again thank
you guys for watching Yosh and I will
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
