PHP tutorial and in this lesson what
we're going to be doing is testing and
debugging our program now before you
want to start I want to mention this
whenever you download or excuse me
whenever you create a program like this
that does something like downloads a
bunch of files or data say the stock
data for the last five years we want our
final program to do whenever we first
test it we don't want to download all
that information for because for testing
purposes we only need maybe 10 rows or
maybe you know the last month or
something so we don't want to just hop
right into downloading 10 years of data
before we even know if the program works
so what I did is I changed the date to
December nineteenth 2011 that gives me
about two weeks so eventually whenever I
run this program I want to run it
through like 10 or 5 years of data but
just for testing purposes i just want to
mention that i changed the date and also
i noticed that i used the wrong ticker
for apple so I changed my tickers a
little bit i have yahoo for netflix
adobe and GE so you know those are just
some minor changes i made in some minor
tips that I wanted to give you so in
order to upload it to your server first
please make sure that you have this text
files um directory or folder now it's
going to be empty by default in in order
to create one just go ahead and right
click and hit create directory and that
is because remember in our last little
function on our main what we did is we
saved all of these text files in a
folder called text files so we need to
make sure that we have that folder so
our server knows where to store the
files so now I'm just go ahead and
refresh this make sure everything has
saved and now that it is I'm just going
to go ahead and highlight all that crap
and hit enter and it should be good to
go so everything was transferred
successfully and again look nothing is
in my text files right now but hopefully
that's about to change so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to go to Danielle
1986 org and I'm going to go ahead and
hit the stock downloader PHP now
whenever I do it's going to run this
script which basically you know creates
that CSV file dumps all the data into
our database so go ahead and hit it and
it's going to say waiting waiting and
now my page is done loading and we see
nothing at all sir see an oh crap Bucky
you messed up something let's go look at
the code see what you did wrong actually
this is good we don't have any echo
statements or any outputs to verify our
success we probably should have one
right after this but anyways if we don't
see any messages that means we don't
have any error messages that's another
thing i didn't suppress any of the error
messages so not seeing anything is a
good thing so we don't see anything so
how do we know if our program worked
well we have to go by and kind of check
each step by step so the first thing it
did was it created a URL for each
company and it download the CSV file and
it converted those files into a text
file so let's see what companies were
working with Yahoo Ford Netflix adobe in
GE so the first thing we want to make
sure is do these companies have text
files on our server so let's look at our
server text files and refreshes and oh
yeah Adobe Ford GE Netflix and yahoo
another thing I do is I look at the file
size if you messed up sometimes your
file size will be 0 and that means it
downloaded it and saved it as a text
file but you have no data so as of now
we have five text files and they all
have some data in them perfect now what
I want to do is remember after we have
those text files what we wanted to do
was pretty much take the information
from them and insert it into our
database so I'm going to hop over to my
cpanel hit PHP myadmin and i'm going to
go to my database which is youtube and
check it out if i look at each company
adobe for GE Netflix yahoo first of all
tables were created and we didn't do
that so our program successfully created
tables and it also if you look at the
rose and the size it has information in
them so let's go ahead and click on
netflix or something
and oh my that looks freaking beautiful
it looks like everything turned out to
be all right so remember we took all of
the data from let's see what it was
December nineteenth 2011 until the
current day so if we go ahead and look
at our final product the database it
took all the information from December
nineteenth and made it until the current
day and remember it was a New Year's Eve
in knee or so and then a weekend
tomorrow's Monday so you know they don't
trade stocks on the weekend or on
holiday so that's why we don't have 13
12 because on how can I say this the
last two days they haven't been trading
and today they the stock market has
opened yet so anyways aside from that it
looks like everything is working out
perfectly again with the amount change
this is the dollar amount the stock
change and the percent change remember I
times these by a hundred already so this
is a quarter of a percent on this went
down this day a little over two percent
this went up almost four percent which
is really good so you know if you see
small numbers like this I want to tell
you guys that this is indeed the
percentage even though it's a small
percent so there we go not too much
debugging to do not for a pro programmer
like myself thank you very much and in
the next tutorials what we're going to
be doing is now that we have the data in
the database we begin we can begin
writing our own custom formulas to go
through historically and see what
formulas work which we're good
indicators of determining when the sucks
going to go up and down so on and so
forth so it's going to be amazing I am
super excited for it and yeah that's it
thank you guys for watching don't forget
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
