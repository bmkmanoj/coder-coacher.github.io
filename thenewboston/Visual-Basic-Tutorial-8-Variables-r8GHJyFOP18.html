on live gamer here for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
talking about variables now variables
are one of the most important parts of
programming there's no possible way to
make a program without variables so
let's go ahead and get started and we'll
create a variable here now to create a
variable in Visual Basic you're going to
start off with the keyword dim now what
this tells the compiler is that you're
going to declare a variable so if you
read this right here from intellisense
it says that the dim statement declares
and allocates all right here declares
and allocates new storage space for one
or more variables so what we're going to
do is when the type dim and then after
this you can type whatever name you want
as long as it contains valid characters
now there's a list that you can find a
list of valid characters online or
invalid characters so we're just going
to start off by calling it my num now
you can name this whatever you feel like
and now after we tell the compiler what
the name of our variable is going to be
we're going to type as so this just says
specifies the data type in the
declaration statement so we're just
going to tell the compiler what kind of
data type is going to be and so we're
going to make ours an integer and so you
can see that a little green line comes
under that and it is a warning here and
it says unused local variable not mine
um so when you're making programs if you
never use a variable the error list is
going to tell you the warning so that
you can take that out and make your
program more efficient but we're going
to be using mine um so we're just going
to ignore that warning for right now so
now what we're going to do is we're
going to assign my num
so type my num equals 5 now if we do
console dot write line
my num and then we'll do console dot
read line if we go ahead and run this
it's going to say five right there now
what we can do is we can instead of
putting this in two lines we can go
ahead and set the value of our variable
in the declaration line so we can set it
equal to five there now the reason I
showed you the two line method before
that is because sometimes you're going
to be declaring a variable in one of
your subs and then later on in your subs
you're going to be assigning that to
another value now that would be a way
you wouldn't want to do that so for
example if I run this
let's go and run this it'll say five now
if I come down here I set my num equal
to something else such as seven if we go
ahead and run this it's going to print
out seven because even though we
initialize mind I'm at five after we do
that it's going to read it's going to
change the value of mynum to seven and
it's going to write the most recent
value of mynum now doesn't save the old
values it just updates it so it's going
to start at five which changes to seven
and it prints out the seven which is the
what it's currently equal to so let's go
ahead and work with a another time now
QB color I want tab or not caps lock tab
okay so let's go ahead and get rid of my
num in here and we'll declare a string
so dim my string as string and we're
going to set it equal to hello the new
Boston fans so now if we come down here
and we console dot write line we're just
going to put my string as the arguments
and you can see that it prints out hello
the new Boston fans
now if we want to do a character we can
just do dim my character as Kari or s
char and we'll set it equal to a or M a
and if we type out my character you can
see that it will print out a for s now
let's go ahead and do a double really
quick so if we do double then equal set
it equal to five point four we go ahead
and run this it will say five point four
for us now let's work with a balloon
real quick if we create a boolean
variable we'll set it equal to either
true or false so set it equal to true
and we'll print out my character over
here let's change this to my pool
now you can see here that it prints out
true now we can also set this to false
and if we run this it's going to print
out false now here's something that I
was going to teach you guys in a later
tutorial but I figured that you guys are
smart so I'll go ahead and teach it to
you in this tutorial now whenever you
create a variable let's just do let's
create an integer and we'll set it equal
to 5 what we want to do is in our Castle
dot write line we want to take my num
and we want to convert it to a string
now you may not notice any difference
any differences in this but I was taught
that whenever you it's good coding
practice to convert numbers to strings
when you're going to be printing them
out anywhere on the screen such as a
label or a text box or a console which
is what we are working in so to convert
it to a string you just do the variable
that you want dot to string with empty
parameters and this is going to convert
your integer to a string so now if we
run this you can see it prints out five
but instead of printing out a number
this is actually a string so that's
about all I wanted to cover in the
variables tutorial so I'm practicing
some variables make some of your own
print them out get used to what they are
and then once you've got that nailed
down move on to the next tutorial and
