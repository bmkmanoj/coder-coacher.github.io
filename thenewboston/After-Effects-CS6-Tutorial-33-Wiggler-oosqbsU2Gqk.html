adult after effects cs6 tutorial my name
is buddy Blackford and we are going to
talk about a tool called the wiggler the
wiggler basically randomizes values for
you and it's it's a quick way so you
don't have to keyframe everything and it
looks pretty random
so in window you want to go down to here
and go to wiggler and here we have the
wiggler box here so it's the same as let
me click click on position so we can
animate the position have your keyframe
selected and for spacial path here this
is for position and anything that moves
on the X or Y axis or the Z you can move
or you can apply spatial path to it so
moving around in space basically the
other one here is temporal and that's
time pretty much so something like
opacity will be used with temporal and
I'll show you that after I show you the
position so you got the noise type here
and this option doesn't really matter
all that much smooth gives you a nicer
Bezier handles in your graph editor and
jagged gives you broken handles in your
graph editor so pretty much your
preference their dimensions here we have
all independently which means it's going
to move on the x and y axis you can have
all the same or just move it on the X or
Y frequency is how many times it's going
to randomize your value magnitude is how
how like what's a good word I guess how
severe you can you your visit your
values will move like how far away from
the original
that it will move is a better term so I
have the position click on position and
I'll click on apply because I made just
a basic motion path going across apply
and you can see it added keyframes and
I'll give you a little preview here and
it pretty much did nothing and the
reason why is because I did not increase
the magnitude high enough so let's go to
10 and we'll we will delete now what's a
ctrl Z to go back now I'll apply it and
you can see now it has wiggled there you
go it Wiggles a little bit I'll make it
even more severe 100
so basically it's randomizing the
position for you and it's not only
limited to position you can use the this
on effects and other things like opacity
so the easiest one for me to show you
right now is opacity so I'll put them in
the middle
I'll scale them up so you guys can see a
little better and I'll set the opacity
to what do it at 75% a keyframe it let's
make it another one and add in our
keyframe and make sure I have those
selected it automatically selected
temporal graph because you have opacity
the frequency is I'm just going to keep
that at five per second and my magnitude
I'll do it at 25 apply and let's check
it out you can see that he's flickering
and going to different values there so
if I scroll scrubbing the timeline and
you look at the opacity you can see the
different values they're being changed
so it does it does add keyframes and it
does change your values in your
properties over here if you would like
to fine-tune this even more you can go
into your graph editor and see how you
since we use smooth it's going to have
the handles and the smooth Bezier
handles and now you can pretty much move
any of these that you want to make
different to make it to tweak it pretty
much so I'll make a wiggle with without
the smooth neck this time ctrl Z okay
there we go and now it's not wiggled and
I'll change the noise type to jagged and
we'll just apply and now if I check out
the graph editor here you can see it's
more of like a jagged e just play it you
can it doesn't really have a much of an
effect when you play it it's just
basically for the graph editor so it's
pretty much your preference
now that's probably yeah that's about it
for the the wiggler it's a really useful
tool and I use it for things like
flickering lights for if you're going to
take your video footage and turn it into
like an earthquake scene or if something
hits something really hard and you need
to wiggle it when it hits it so it
bounces away or whatever just those are
just a few examples so just to keep in
mind the wiggler when when you're
working on your animation and it's a
good way to just add random values
thanks for watching the tutorial and
I'll catch you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
