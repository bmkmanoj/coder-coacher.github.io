for this one
authorization code and this is actually
I believe the only grant type you can
have so that's another thing that uh I
don't even know why they require it kind
of stupid unless unless I'm wrong but I
think uh I don't know I just shut up now
just put that in there they work rut
require it
now this one is redirect URI and of
course that's where we want to be
redirected to and the last piece of
information that they require is your
secret code and that is why we got that
ladies and gentlemen so the parameter
for this is called code and we will give
them the code we just got from the user
and of course since that's the last
element in your array get rid of the
last comma right there and now after
this what we need to do is we pretty
much set up the configurations that says
ok this is the URL that we want to talk
to and this is the information that
Instagram is going to require whenever
we go to that URL about how do we
actually talk with Instagram well in
order to do that we need to set up a see
URL or a curl session now this is a
specific protocol that allows you to
transfer data from one website which is
Instagram to our website which is in
this case Bucky's room or whatever
project you're working on so I'm gonna
store all this in a variable car called
C URL or curl I'm just going to call it
curl and if you put curl underscore in
it what this does is it starts a curl
session pretty much said hey Instagram
we're gonna be getting some data from
you so of course the first thing you
need to give it is the URL or else it
won't know where to get data from and
the next couple lines we're just going
to be setting options for the data
transfer so in order to that you
she's done use a variable curl on her
score set opt which means curl set
options and the syntax for this is all
right
what's your arm curl object there it is
and what parameter you want to set and
what do you want to set it to so we want
to set curl opt underscore post for the
first one and this is going to be equal
to true now whenever we use this URL in
this girl session we pretty much use
post because that's what the Instagram
API tells us to use very uh kind of
basic explanation but it's the truth
so the first thing says all right we're
using post just like you told me to the
next thing is curl opt post fields and
for this we just use this access token
setting pretty much as saying all right
so whenever you use post give me the
fields or the settings and we just set
them all up here really easy simple
enough actually what I want to do is
this
allow me to explain a little bit easier
so we have two more settings that we
have to make before we can actually
start transferring data and the second
last one has returned transfer I have to
actually that looks right we return
transfer all right good enough and set
this equal to one now basically whenever
we set it equal to one it says okay
instead of just echoing everything out
or printing it and it everything out or
just returning the number one return all
of the results is a string so for
example if we ask for all of the users
like image paths or images or image
names even it gives us to us is a string
and that way we can work with it really
easy in PHP as you're going to see later
on now the second one is or excuse me
SSL underscore verify peer and we're
just going to set this equal to false
now typically whenever you have this on
our actual website you're going to want
to verify make sure everything is good
to go between your communication with
Instagram but just for this really
simple example since I'm not going to be
using in any commercial application just
a personal website I'm going to set this
equal to false and it's not going to
verify any certificates or anything and
some and I don't know it may be
vulnerable to like a man-in-the-middle
attack but you know no one's gonna be
listening to my traffic so basically
what we did right here is we said okay
we want to communicate with Instagram
and these are the settings that you
require us to do so because it you know
you just can't like call it on the phone
you need to communicate with it in a
very specific way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
