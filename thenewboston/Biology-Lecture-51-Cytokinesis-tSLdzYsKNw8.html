biology tutorial and in this lesson I
want to talk to you guys about
cytokinesis now cytokinesis is the
actual process of your cell splitting
into and forming two brand-new
individual daughter cells now this is
actually the last part of cell division
and the technical process of how this
occurs is a little bit different in
animal cells than plant cells so what I
want to do is I want to take guys
through each process let's go ahead and
get started by looking at animal cells
so basically in animal cells what's
going to happen is remember at the end
of mitosis we have it's pretty much one
adjoining cell but it has two nuclei
thinks to mitosis now the portion of the
cell where this is going to split it's
called the cleavage furrow the cleavage
furrow remember is the little
indentation in the cell where it's going
to split in half so basically what's
going to happen is let me pick a good
color to work with here and this already
looks pretty good
what's going to happen here is proteins
are going to come in and they're pretty
much going to act like a belt around the
cell what's going to happen is they're
going to squeeze the cell and eventually
split it in two so this is what we start
with right here and let me draw a little
arrow to indicate future what we end up
with is two individual
daughter cells so this you know process
of how cytokinesis occurs in animals
it's pretty self-explanatory the
important things we need to take away is
that the cleavage furrow
is the area where you know the
indentation is going to form things to
the proteins and what the proteins are
going to do is they're going to act like
a belt around the cell squeezing it and
splitting it into two brand-new
individual daughter cells
so pretty simple and whenever we think
of cytokinesis this is pretty much what
we picture in our head so remember that
I said that this is the process of how
cytokinesis occurs in animal cells
however plant cells are a little bit
different so let's go ahead and look at
plant cells right now and basically
whenever we have a plant cell that's
ready to undergo cytokinesis we of
course have the original cell with two
nuclei but the thing is we can't have
proteins that squeeze together the cell
like an animal so because of the cell
wall so here's the cell wall right here
and we already know that in plant cells
the cell wall is actually very
structured and rigid so if the proteins
were to come in and try to squeeze it
together it couldn't because it's so
rigid so what needs to happen instead is
actually let me draw a little arrow
again so I know it's a different you
know time has passed what's going to
happen and I guess I got to draw my two
little nuclei of course is that tiny
vesicles are going to come in and I'll
draw the vesicles in this reddish color
right here I might as well put a V in
them so you guys know what's going on
tiny vesicles are going to come in and
they're going to carry cell wall
material so this is the material that is
going to make up the cell wall right
here I'll label it cell wall so they're
pretty much like tiny Builders carrying
cell wall material and what they're
going to do is they're going to drop it
off in the middle of the cell where the
new cell wall is going to be so
eventually what's going to happen is
this new cell wall material is going to
fuse together and eventually creates the
new cell wall so at the end of
cytokinesis and plant cells we end up
with the new cell wall with two
brand-new daughter cells so again as you
can see the process of plant cells and
animal cells in cytokinesis is a little
bit different mostly because instead of
proteins that squeeze the original cell
together we now have vesicles that are
going to come in
and dump new cell wall material
splitting the original cell into two
daughter cells and the reason is that we
need the vesicles to dump the new cell
wall material into the new cell is
because the cell wall right here is so
rigid
we just can't squeeze it together like
animal cells so that is the process of
cytokinesis in animal cells and plant
cells a little bit different but the key
thing that we want to take away from
this is that after we have two new
daughter cells in either you know
animals or plants what's going to happen
is that these daughter cells
automatically wants to form they're
going to enter the g1 phase of
interphase now remember that was the
very first phase of the cell cycle so
basically these cells are going to start
oh excuse me I just swallowed like a
french fry or something pretty much
these cells are going to start and enter
the cell cycle all over again so so then
we take these new cells and do it all
over again so I know you know we just
completed a full circle but we aren't
done with the cell cycle yet because we
talked about mitosis and that's only one
of the ways that cells can divide but we
need to talk about meiosis now and that
is the cell division involving sperm and
egg cells in animals so that's where
we're going to be talking about in the
next video thank you guys for watching I
think as for understanding cytokinesis
and I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
