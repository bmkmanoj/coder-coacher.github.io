things must follow is that living things
transfer energy among themselves and
between themselves and the environment
so let me just go ahead and write
transfer energy beautiful handwriting
and the easiest example this is of
course again the Sun and a plant I know
I use this example quite often but it's
a lot more easy to explain rather than
people and let's go ahead and talk about
the transfer of energy between
themselves and the environment first
well we already know that that Sun has a
ton of energy and that plants use this
energy in a process called
photosynthesis to create food so
obviously the plant is transferring the
energy or energy is transferred from the
Sun which is right here to a plant now
of course if this plant was something
like um let's say it was corn or wheat
then typically what happens is human
beings come in and they would want to
get energy from the plant so that would
be another transfer of energy between
the environment and the organism so of
course energy from the plant is consumed
into the human and the human since this
is food it will talk about what chemical
reactions go on but they actually turn
this into an energy that the human can
use so of course that's what I'm talking
about whenever I mean transfer energy
between themselves in the environment
energy would be converted in this case
from the Sun to the plant to the human
and whenever I say the other part of the
role that living things transfer energy
among themselves I'm talking about the
chemical processes that go on inside a
human or a plant to turn that energy
into food or whenever humans eat plants
to turn the energy from food into energy
that the human can use to rebuild their
cells and create new cells and do a
bunch of processes that involve life but
we'll talk about more about that later
on talk about more about that talk more
about that later on that's what I'm
trying to say but right now just
remember rule number five in order for
something to be considered a
thing is that living things transfer
energy among themselves and between
themselves and the environment so now
let's go ahead and move on to number six
so number six is actually really easy
one of the easiest ones its that living
things grow and develop so grow and
develop
now I separated grow and develop because
there are actually two different things
so we already know that human beings you
yourself believe it or not we're a
single cell at one point in your life at
the beginning of your life you were one
cell and then again we're going to be
talking about you know reproduction and
how life is formed later on but you
pretty much a split in two and then that
split in two and you reproduced enough
times into you know this is distracting
me because I try to draw a bunch of
cells with DNA and it ended up looking
like a thing of grapes but anyways you
were one so and you turn into a bunch of
different cells so that's what I mean by
growing you grew and that's why you are
considered an organism but what I mean
by develop well do I mean growth well
the reason that I separated growth and
development is because development think
of it like specialization this part of a
cell group may have turned into your
eyes this may have turned into your
brain this may have turned into I don't
know maybe your skin cells so basically
as you grow your cell begin or your
cells begin to specialize into different
parts of your body necessary to become a
human being and growth like I said
that's why you were one cell at first
and you become trust me on this this is
the estimate that they say you are now
one hundred trillion cells and
development just think of a development
as specialization where different cells
become different things necessary for
that organisms survival so rule number
six all living things grow and develop
so rule number seven is actually an easy
one and that is Skinner
reproduce and basically what I mean is
all living things reproduce or go
through reproduction and come to think
of it I don't think it's a good idea to
draw a picture of reproduction on
YouTube especially human beings
reproducing but I'm sure that if you
want to you can go to plenty other
websites not YouTube but you can see
videos of human beings trying to
reproduce on other websites but for now
again it's pretty self-explanatory
what reproduction means is when living
organisms try to make or they make other
living organisms so that's what
reproduction means self-explanatory of
course you guys know so now that I want
your any pictures I'll just keep this on
the same slide the last rule for an
organism to be considered a living thing
is that it needs to evolve and organisms
go through a process of evolution now by
evolution I just mean that some traits
or characteristics take time to develop
and they aren't just there all at once
so whenever I talk about evolution I'm
going to go into more detail about this
but for right now it would be silly to
try to cram into a couple minute video
because there's so much that I have to
cover concerning evolution it's probably
going to take several videos but seven
and eight are pretty self-explanatory
all the living things must reproduce and
they go through a process or they have
traits that evolve over time so just the
recap one last time about the eight
different characteristics that all
organisms or living things share is one
living things are made up of cells in
the cells contain DNA rule number two
all living things must maintain order
inside their cells and bodies number
three
living things regulate their systems
number four living things respond to
signals in the environment number five
living things transfer energy among
themselves in between themselves in the
environment number what's the six living
things grow and develop seven of course
they reproduce and eight more about
evolution later but
now thank you guys for watching this
video and I'll see you guys in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
