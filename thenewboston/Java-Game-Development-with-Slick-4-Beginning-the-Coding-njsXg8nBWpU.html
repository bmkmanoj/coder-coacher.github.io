video and in this video we're finally
going to get to the stuff you guys have
all been waiting for
getting our fingers a little bit dirty
and coding this game so if you saw my
last video you know that the first thing
we need to do is import some craft
because you know all that crap that I
had you download and set up well I
didn't just do that because I was bored
we actually need that crap that we
downloaded so in order to get it in our
Java game we need to import it so import
orgie dot new don dot slick dots
asterisks and it's going to import
everything in that location because I'm
too lazy to type each one out
individually and we also need to import
something else as well
or geodon slick dot state dot asterisk
now what this is going to do is actually
well I won't explain you guys everything
that it's importing maybe I will later
on but for now just know that whenever
we import all this stuff it pretty much
includes all the methods that we need to
from the methods that we downloaded
basically so now after this since we're
making a state based game select 2d says
whenever you decide to make a class
using a state based game you need to
extends state based game now this class
right here is a class that's already
built into select 2d and it just says ok
whenever you you're making a game with
different screens with different states
this is the class that you need to
inherit from so we say ok you know if
that's the way you want to play this
let's do it we inherited it so now we
inherited all the important craft from
slick 2d what I want to do now is start
coding this my way so what I want to do
is I want to set up a couple variables
first a couple common variables that
we're going to need later on in our game
the first one is of course the name of
the game itself so of course we need
this because we use it on the title
window maybe will flash it say welcome
to hand blaster
you know just nice to have the name of
the game in the variable so static
final of course it's a string and I'm
just going to name mine game name and
set it equal to ham blesser with
exclamation point there we go
so after this what I'm going to be doing
is like I said this game is going to be
a very simple game at least this first
one that we make just for demonstration
purposes purposes it's going to have two
different screens a main menu screen
which is first the first time you start
the game is going to say welcome to hand
blaster would you like to play now or
exit so that's going to be one screen
and the other screen is of course you
playing the game so in order to tell
Java which state we're working with we
need to associate it with a number so
public static final int menu the main
menu which I said was the first screen
we have is going to be 0 you can give
any number you want actually but zeros
is of course you know the most logical
thing to do and the next one or the only
other screen we're going to have in this
demonstration is our playing screen
whenever the user is actually playing
the game it will reference this with one
so with those numbers what we can do is
we now associated each state with a
number so we can reference it later on
whenever we need to all right so we got
all that housekeeping stuff taken care
of know everything does so far now what
we need to do before we hop into the
main method because look at it it's like
oh my god please will somebody type
something into me not yet main method
because before we do that we have to
work with the constructor now remember
the constructor is the first method gets
called whenever an object from this
class is created so public game in order
to create a constructor make a method
with the exact same name this class is
game so our method is going to be called
game and what this method is going to do
is it's going to take the name of the
game hand blaster is a parameter so
string pass it in that variable game
name essentially what we're doing is
passing it in hand blaster and the
rationale behind this is because we want
to pass it in because
whenever we first create this game the
first thing we want to do is create a
window and put the title hand blaster at
the top of the window now in order to do
this you call super and pass in game
name which calls the constructor for the
superclass which is state based game and
again that's just another pre-built
functionality that they have this is how
you add a title to the top of the game
top of the window so now whenever we
play our game it's going to say hand
blaster on the top of the screen pretty
sweet
so after this selectivity says we need
to add each state to the game
individually just so our game knows that
there are pretty much two screens that
it's going to be working with so in
order to do that call this which is
basically this class add state oh look
it already has it for us and now
basically the state itself now remember
when I said that each state is going to
be a separate class well right now if
you can see at the top of your screen we
only have one class the game class but
later on we're going to be making
individual classes for the menu and the
play class so we're going to have a menu
class in a play class so right now it
takes pretty much those objects is this
parameter so we didn't create those
objects yet so don't let this confuse
guys but we will later on so the first
one is the menu class which is new menu
menu
and this second one well I guess I might
as well type it I'm not that lazy this
ad state and the state is new play play
so what we did in this store and the
reason we're getting all these errors is
because it says okay hold on menu cannot
be resolved and play cannot be resolved
which pretty much means that a menu in a
play class don't exist yet and that's
because we didn't create them yet and
that's because you know we just didn't
have time to create them yet but we will
later on so what we did so far is we
imported everything we need the two we
set up all of well just a couple
variables that we're going to need later
on and we also added a title to the top
of the window and said okay we're going
to be working with two different states
even though we didn't create the classes
yet get ready for them so hopefully you
guys understand what's going on in this
tutorial if you guys don't understand
anything like maybe you don't know what
a constructor is or how inheritance
works then go ahead and watch my
beginner arm Java tutorials on my
website link below and I don't even know
if I told you guys told you guys this in
this video I have a really bad memory
but uh all of this source code is going
to be available for free on my forum and
I'll put a link to that below as well so
guys thank you guys for watching um
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
