say thirty first draft tutorial and in
this tutorial I'm going to be talking to
you guys about something called enhanced
for statement now in the last couple of
tutorials I showed you guys how to use a
counter controlled for statement to add
up all the values in an array or just
sum them all together
well actually Java made a very easier
way to do this and they named it an
enhanced for statement so let me show
you guys how to do it first thing we
need is an array and I'm going to name
mine Bucky as usual I'm going to use my
array initializer and just set it to the
equal to like four five six seven
they're real good enough now let's go
ahead and we need another variable to
hold the sum of the um array and you can
name a sum or total total whatever you
want
and now let's get the good stuff the
Enhanced for statement now this is um
kind of like a for loop but it's
different in a couple ways
it's different instead of taking three
options it only takes two different
things that it needs in the parameters
or parentheses the first thing it needs
is the type of data and an identifier
now this is kind of like a counter
variable in your regular for loops but
it's kind of different this is of course
the kind of Daddy
it takes no surprise in the X what the X
is is it's going to store the values in
the array as if slooping through your
array so the first time it loops through
it's going to store three then four then
five and six and seven and you just need
a variable to hold all those values so
that's why this is called the type and
this is called the identifier next after
that the only other thing it takes is
the name of the array now if we're
saying alright why do I have to name
this right in case you have more than
one array in your program one name Bucky
one name tunafish one name dogwood it
knows what array you're talking about so
now that we have our for loop our
enhanced for loop or for statement with
our type identifier
name we can go ahead and do something
with it so let's just go ahead and take
that total and set it equal to X and
what's just going to do is it loops
through is add these numbers to total
each time it loops so the first time
it's going to add 3 to 0 then 43 then 5
to 7 and it's just going to keep adding
up till it gets the sum and eventually
total is going to hold the sum of all
those numbers so now that total poses
the sum holds the sum of all those
numbers let's go ahead and just print
out system out one print line there you
go
total now let's go ahead and just print
it out make sure we don't have any
errors and we get the value 25 so let me
show you guys what this did one more
time we went in we made an array called
Bucky using an array initializer we then
went and made another variable named
total instead of equal to 0 and this
would hold the sum of our array next we
made this special enhanced four
statement the first argument it takes is
the type and identify what variable you
want to store the array values in next
you need to say what array you were
working with what array you want to loop
through and now you just did anything
with those values and we just decided to
add them all to total to get the sum
lastly we just printed it out so that's
how you use enhance for statement and
remember this is a force theme and
that's specialized to loop through all
the elements in your array so you can do
something with them so that's that
forest soil thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe to my channel
and hopefully I'll see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
