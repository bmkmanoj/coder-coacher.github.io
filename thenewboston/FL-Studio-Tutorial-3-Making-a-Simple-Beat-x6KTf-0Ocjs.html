tutorial and as promised in this video
I'm going to teach you guys how to make
an incredibly very simple beat so let's
go over the main pieces or the main
parts of the interface where we actually
make the beat now the first part on the
left is the browser now the browser has
a lot of different crap in it but what
we're going to be focusing on is the
sounds that we need so pretty much of
course your beat is made up of a bunch
of different sounds or a song is made up
using a lot of different instruments you
can think of it as the different
instruments or different sounds are on
the browser and I'll show you guys a
couple cool ones whenever we get making
our beat now the second part I want to
go over is this right here this is
called the step sequencer and by the way
if you can't see either the browser or
the step sequencer you can check them
out click this button right here you see
where my mouse is on the top click it
and it'll either hide it or display it
and this little button right here is a
step sequencer and make sure you know
you can see in your little tip and the
browser is where as it's always open
right here it's like the little vertical
bars so if you can't see the browser or
step sequencer then go ahead and click
either this button or this button for
the browser but anyways the step
sequencer right here it basically allows
you to make patterns now whenever I say
a pattern a pattern is just a small
segment of the so it's pretty much a
small piece of the song so you may
choose to put each different instrument
on a pattern you may choose to you know
um maybe you want one pattern to go dunt
dunt dunt done in another pattern go
boom hmm so pretty much each pattern
think of it as a piece of the song so
now you're thinking alright we make a
bunch of patterns but where do we put
them all together
well you put them together in the
playlist and in order to view the
playlist click this button right here
the first button in the row of 5 so
basically this is what's going to happen
we're gonna pick a sound we'll say we
get a drum kick and this is the sound of
so that's what a kick sounds like and we
can choose all our sounds over in the
browser we're going to add it to the
pattern and let's say we either want one
kick or maybe we want them you know
every quarter note so so pretty much
once we have our sound we say how we
want it to play in the pattern and once
we have the pattern which is basically a
piece of the song we can go ahead and
add it and I know I didn't even tell you
guys how to add you know your patterns
to the playlist but that's where we're
going to do so now that you understand
the overview the sounds how we want them
to sound and how we want them to be
added to the song let's go ahead and
make a really simple beat so the first
thing I want to do is let's just go up
in our pattern right here and actually
you know what I'll go ahead and explain
it exactly like I just taught you guys
so let's go ahead and pick a sound first
so under packs and by the way you don't
have to pick the exact sound as me um go
ahead and find any sound but the one I
want is in packs and it's under vocals
which means people's voices and if you
click on them you can play through them
maybe that wasn't even the computer here
that's just me saying it I remember that
it's a smash hit alright well this song
is going to be a smash hit but what I
want is this one rock me baby alright so
this song I respect this clipper a
little here rock me baby
that's the sound clip that I want in my
song so what I want to do is once I find
it rock me baby I'm gonna take it and
I'm gonna drag it over to the step
sequencer right here and I'm just going
to drop it now as you notice this goes
on a new channel this is basically a new
sound and these things are called
channels so your kick channel clap
channel rock me baby channel so remember
this is just a small piece and each of
these little buttons I guess you can
call them these little blocks they
determine how often you want this to
play so this entire channel right here
is one
note so if you just add in by the way to
add one just left-click it and if you
want to delete it right-click it so
let's go ahead and left click this and
play this rock me baby rock me baby
that's a beat rock me baby rock me baby
and if you want to play it more often
then you can just add more rock right
right right right right right right
baby baby wow this is a beautiful song
already in anyways any time you want to
delete it you right-click it so let's
say that I only want it to play right
here so I'm gonna left click right there
so now this is our pattern rock me baby
rock me baby Wow
rock me baby okay sounding pretty good
but it's not exactly a hit smash yet so
let's go ahead and we'll add another
instrument so we got her voice right now
now let's add a kick and the kick
members like boom boom and let's go
ahead and add these oh by the way this
is probably helpful you can either add a
manually by clicking like this or what
you can do is if you right-click the
name you can just fill it in like every
four steps like that so you know if
you're too lazy to click every single
one you can just fill it in like that
but anyways this is our beat now rock me
baby rock me baby rock me baby what rock
me baby oh oh sick beat yo but anyways
now we got you know a little better beat
sounding but we still need something
else so let's go ahead and add a hat
sound and I actually want to add these
every two steps so I can do this by
left-clicking them and if you make a
mistake like I said just right-click it
or what I can do is I can right-click it
and put fill each two steps so now let's
go ahead and press play and check out
our beat rock me baby rock me baby rock
me baby oh oh
a rock me baby me baby alright
I've just uh I don't think I'm gonna
sing for the rest of this tutorial
because it's kind of embarrassing but
anyways now we have a very simple
pattern set up and by the way I know
there's a lot more buttons and stuff
that we have to go over but I just want
to teach you guys the really basics
right now so right now we have a very
simple awesome sounding pattern so how
do we add it to the song itself well in
order to do that just like adding these
individual hits what you can do is to
add it to the playlist left-click it
wherever you want it and if you ever run
and delete it right-click it so let me
go ahead and just get a real simple song
going I'll add one pattern I'll skip a
measure and then I'll play two more
patterns and by the way this is going to
loop over and over just like it did in
pattern however check out this problem
alright so we want to play the song
press play rock me baby rock me baby oh
wait a minute
our freaking pattern is still playing so
we want to play the song so what is this
do you yell into your keyboard play song
I literally just yelled it to my
keyboard know what you need to do since
your computer root in your keyboard
isn't voice activated as you see right
here this is like incredibly hard to
read but it says Pat song whenever the
light is red it means you're played in
your pattern which is this little piece
right here whenever you click song it
means you're playing the song and you
can see that you now have a little
cursor right here but anyways just make
sure that you click song and now it's
going to play your song so now click
play rock me baby rock me baby rock me
baby all right so you saw that it now is
playing the song and by the way a song
is going to be made up of several
different patterns so there you have it
that's how you make a very simple be a
very simple song so you know if you
thought that was the greatest song ever
then congratulation
you're done with the videos but you know
what if you want to make a beat that's a
little bit better than that one where it
just has rock me baby then you probably
want to check out my other tutorial so
in the next video I'm going to be going
over well probably in depth about this
that step sequencer and showing you guys
you know all the cool different stuff
that you can do with it and trust me
there's a lot to cover still but anyways
thank you guys for watching don't get
subscribed and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
