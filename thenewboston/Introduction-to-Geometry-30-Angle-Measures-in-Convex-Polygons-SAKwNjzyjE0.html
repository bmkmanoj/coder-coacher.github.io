measures in convex polygons so a convex
polygon has angles that all open inward
so to find the sum of the angles you're
going to pick a point or pick a vertex
we picked vertex a you're going to draw
all the possible diagonals from that
point so there's one right there and one
right there so you multiply the number
of triangles that you achieve by drawing
the diagonals by 180 so there's one two
three triangles and we're going to
multiply 3 by 180 because we know that
the sum of the interior angles of a
triangle is 180 and once you do that you
get 450 so each one of these angles
added together is going to give you 5 40
so we have this first polygon and it has
one two three four sides if I pick this
point I'm going to call this vertex a
and if I draw all the possible diagonals
in I only get two triangles so 2 times
180 equals 360 so each one of these
angles added together will give us 360
degrees so number of sides this has one
two three four five six sides and we're
going to pick this point D we are going
to draw
12 we're going to draw in three
diagonals which leaves us with one two
three four triangles so then we take
four x 180 which will give us a total of
seven twenty so we know that each one of
these angles once they're added together
is going to equal 720 now this protect
articular technique only works when you
have a convex polygon and you'll know if
you do or not because when you try and
draw the diagonals in they won't leave
you with triangles so now that we talked
about the angle measures in convex
polygons make sure you come back and
watch the next lesson where we're going
to talk about angle measurements and
regular polygons</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
