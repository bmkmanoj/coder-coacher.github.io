Effects cs6 tutorial my name is buddy
Blackford and I'm going to be teaching
you about markers today and no not the
kind of markers you've been sniffing in
the closet when nobody's looking yeah I
know and I'm thoroughly disappointed but
let's get on to the real markers which
are indicators that you can put in your
comp or you can put them in your layers
to tell you what is going on in that
part of the composition they're good for
helping you remember where something is
at a certain point of time obviously so
the way that you can indicate where
something is in a comp is move your time
indicator here to somewhere and you can
click on this little upside-down
Pentagon and click and drag to the left
and if you hold shift it'll snap to the
current time indicator and notice this
as one you can either leave it like that
or you can double click on it and it
brings up the composition markers you
can type in this comment panel here
spacegirl
and it opens up this leaves the marker
there with the name on it and this right
here you can see it kind of might get
annoying if your truths trying to do put
down markers that are close together so
I'm going to show you another way to do
it and that is by adding markers to the
lair so the way to get rid of this
marker real quick is right click on it
and delete this marker okay now if you
click on your footage down here and you
push the asterisks button on your keypad
on the numpad over here on your right
it'll bring up a marker at the position
that your current time indicator is at
and as you can see it put it on the
layer instead of up here on the comp so
if you double click on it again you can
edit the properties here now we got Earl
licking herself now this video footage
is from a it's a promo video for these
guys these DJ's they were trying to get
their name out so that's how you do that
there's another way that you can another
option that you can use so I'll just
move back over here and this looks like
a sign so hold down alt and then hit
your asteroid key and it'll bring up the
layer mark up marker panel that way you
don't have to double click on it
so signage under what this sign picture
even is I can't even tell maybe it's a
woman dancing
you can right-click on the markers here
to get another menu and it has the
settings which is the same thing when
you double click you can delete this
marker delete all markers and lock your
markers so that's another way to get to
your sections so I'm gonna click on the
Settings here and explain this a little
bit this shows the time here all right
what's your marker is that the duration
obviously your comment where you can put
that on there the chapter and weblinks
here are good for you can type in here
what the chapter might be and I'll just
type this as showing sign or actually I
saw the sign it opened up my eyes but
I'll stop singing now these are good for
if you're exporting the render out to
something like Adobe Encore DVD these
chapters and frame targets here are
useful in there I'm not going to go over
how it works because this is more for
After Effects and this chapter and
weblinks thing is more for Adobe Encore
the flash cue point down here is for
Adobe Flash and basically what it does
is it's the let's see how to explain
this the markers are embedded in the FLV
movies when you render and i think
that's the best explanation if it
doesn't make sense to you because you
don't use flash just keep it in the back
your mind and at some point you may want
to learn how to use flash for the web
and stuff like that so I'm just gonna
hit okay and that's that's pretty much
all there is for markers they're pretty
useful I use them all the time
especially when I'm dealing with
raw footage so that you can mark out
where you're gonna where you're gonna
cut and where the scenes cut so you can
do different color Corrections and
things like that well thanks for
listening to this After Effects tutorial
I hope you guys and girls found this
tutorial useful and can apply it to your
your next project that you're gonna be
working on and hopefully that project is
awesome and makes you a lot of money
well see you guys later I'm gonna go try
to find Carmen Sandiego</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
