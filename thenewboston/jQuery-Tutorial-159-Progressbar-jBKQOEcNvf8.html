with a video tutorial for the new Boston
in this tutorial we're gonna be taking a
look at the progress bar widget in
jQuery UI now the progress bar is
essentially a a bar that can contain a
specific value and it's filled to that
value so any really normal progress bar
you've seen we're essentially going to
stimulate this in the tutorial so the
first thing I've done is I'm included
obviously jQuery and jQuery UI as well
as this CSS file which is under the UI
eliteness theme there's more details on
how to install themes sorry on how to
install jQuery UI in the installing JQ
jQuery UI video I've created in this
series so essentially what we're doing
in this tutorial is we're going to be
creating a progress bar and then a
progress percentage underneath and
that's going to feed back the value that
the percentage bar will be currently at
and then when we get to the end of the
percentage ie a hundred percent we're
gonna stop the progress bar now
obviously with the progress bar in place
you can't actually create a process on
its own you would have to have some kind
of script that would feed back a value
of the percentage that it's currently at
for example a file upload or something
similar so you're going to have to
actually have something that gives you
the value before you implement it into
this progress bar now obviously because
we're just taking a look at the widget
itself we're not actually going to be
able to create a real percentage and
we're not gonna be able to generate a
real percentage from a particular place
so what we're gonna have to do is we're
gonna have to use the set interval
function and actually create this as an
effect rather than an actual function
however what you will do is you'll learn
how to implement the progress bar and
also display the feedback based on this
so we're gonna be creating a small
application that's going to be dealing
with this
so the first thing we're going to do is
we're going to create a button which is
going to activate this progress bar from
0 to 100 so let's go ahead and first of
all create a button that's going to have
a value of let's just say start or let's
just call it upload to make it more
practical more look more practical and
the input ID we're just gonna have
upload just so we can reference this in
UI J is our jQuery or our JavaScript
external file the next thing to do is
create a div that's going to handle the
actual progress bar itself so I'm just
going to call this PB and then
underneath that we want a div that's
going to relay the percentage of the bar
to us so I'm going to call this percent
okay so now that we've done that we can
go ahead and create an event handler to
handle a particular event which will be
the starting of this progress bar and
percentage when we click the upload
button
so inside UI j s we want to go ahead and
reference this upload R here so we are
creating a selector to select upload and
the event is on click or docked click so
after this we're going to create a
function and inside here is going to be
our function contents so now once we've
clicked this button we want to actually
activate the progress bar we're first of
all going to take a look at how this
works and how its implemented and then
we'll look at changing the value
dynamically so to do this we're going to
need to use a selector to select the
progress bar div that we created on our
page and we want to apply the progress
bar widget to this ok so now what that's
going to have done is it's going to
select it's going to have create created
a progress bar when we click upload
let's go ahead and click upload and you
can see that we've created this long
massive progress bar across the page now
I'm going to go ahead and set a few
settings inside star dot CSS which we
have implemented into this page and
that's just going to make everything
look a bit nicer so the first thing I'm
going to do is set the text size of the
body and I'm going to set that oh sorry
font size I'm going to set that to 12
pixels and I'm then going to change the
width of this progress bar div as well
so we referenced PB and we set the width
here and we'll give it a width of 400
pixels so now it looks like this it's
slightly smaller and it fits nicely just
under here okay so let's go ahead and
change a value of this progress bar to
see what it looks like when we actually
have its 1/2 full so we can supply an
option inside of the progress bar widget
to allow us to set the value so for now
I'm going to set the value to 50 now if
the value set to 50 when we click upload
this is going to go to halfway because
we've defined the value as 50 so now if
you logically think about it we could
set this value here to a vet to it as
slowly or an increasing value so
essentially what we could do is we could
replace this with another variable for
example Val</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
