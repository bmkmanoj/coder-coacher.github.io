that right and just think of packets
like packages of data small packages so
this ensures that package is or packets
are sent and received not only reliably
or reliably that's a little tongue
twister but also in the proper order
because you know you have packet one two
three you don't want to get too first or
else your data isn't going to be correct
so another thing that does is it also
may break down these packets into
smaller units because different
protocols remember whenever we talked
about protocols they want their packets
in a very specific format well some
protocols actually require smaller
packets than others so whenever that's
the case this transport layer is going
to break those down so basically it
ensures that your data is not only
delivered reliably but in the right
order and whenever a protocol requires a
smaller packet or smaller unit of data
then this is the layer right here that's
responsible for that now let me go ahead
and get a new color purple looks good
the next layer I want to talk about is
the network layer let me make sure one
two three four five all right I got two
more plenty of space now the network
layer is basically going to determine
the alright determine best route for
data now say that I wanted to you know
have a conversation with your computer
or I wanted to you know have a session
with your computer well there are
probably a million different ways for
data to be sent from my computer to your
computer so what this network layer is
going to do is it's going to determine
the best most reliable and fastest route
now how does it do this well it does
this because on your packets there is
not only the address of where it came
from which would be my IP address but
also the IP address of your computer
where it's going and it's a little more
complicated than that the IP address is
the only you know thing that we use but
basically there's address on the packet
where it came from which is my computer
and where it's going and we'll say
that's your computer so what it does is
it reach these address and it determines
the fastest possible route now of course
if you ever heard of routers you'd
probably have one in your home these are
involved in this layer right here so
remember that routers are involved in
the network layer and it determines the
best route for your data by reading the
address on of course the packet in
determining of course the fastest most
reliable route to the destination
computer all right so the next layer is
the data link layer actually don't like
the name of this but the data link layer
is the layer wow that's terrible end
that your NICs are on your network
interface cards now this layer is also
responsible for checking for errors so
checking all right Slusher errors
probably need to take a handwriting
class too so basically if there's air in
your data or you know maybe something
got you know haywire somewhere along the
line in these what it's going to do is
is basically going to back all right I
can't send that or we need to go ahead
and reformat the data or do something
again so basically what it's going to do
is again just think of your network
interface card is the main piece of
hardware on your data link layer well I
don't want to say that because there are
also switches and we'll talk about
switches and you know routers later on
in the difference between all those but
basically your network interface card
and switches are the two most famous
pieces are Hardware on this layer and
it's responsible for checking for errors
and if there's an error in your data you
know maybe there's just any kind of
error then it's going to go ahead and
send that data again and that is another
way that we ensure reliable transmission
of data between one computer and the
other computer so again if you say you
know I have a bad NIC or my Knicks
broken then you can bike you know what
that means your that there's a problem
with your data link layer learn that
crap on you know programming tutorials
on YouTube and the last one I want to
talk about is physical
now this is probably the easiest one to
explain and understand this is just
physical medium like cable or fiber
optics or basically any medium this is
also you know like radio waves and Wi-Fi
and stuff but it's easier to remember
physical if you just you know think of
cable like copper cable and fiber optic
cable right now basically any electric
signals that's probably a better way to
put it or the transmission of data is
part of your physical layer in
networking and also remember we talked
about topologies how different networks
are laid out this is also an aspect of
your physical layer in the OSI model so
that's basically a broad overview of the
OSI model again it starts with the one
closest to the user experience and it
goes all the way down to basically you
know tool the electric signals on are on
either through the air or on copper
cable so again the truth is you could
talk about the OSI model for about you
know three hours and you won't even come
close to covering everything but this is
probably the most basic overview that I
can explain for not only what the entire
model is but also the different pieces
of how data starts out and also how data
ends up going from one computer to
another basically a very simplistic
explanation of how two computers
communicate so in the next couple
tutorials what I'm going to do is I'm
going to give you guys first a basic
example of you know a communication or
conversation between two computers using
this model and then we're going to break
these layers up and talk about them each
in detail so thanks for watching don't
forget to subscribe and I'll see you
guys in the next video by the way before
I forget make sure to add me on Facebook
I got a Facebook now a lot of people
were yelling at me because I didn't have
a Facebook guess what guys
I got one now so boom roasted see there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
