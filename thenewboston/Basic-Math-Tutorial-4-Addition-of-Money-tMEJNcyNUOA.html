have quarters dimes nickels pennies and
half dollars so starting with a quarter
at one quarters 25 cents one quarter is
25 cents Fagin even write it down there
we go
25 cents two dimes is 10 cents each and
ten and ten one nickel is five cents
three pennies is three cents so you if
you want to add them all together we
have 25 those together real quick 25 and
3 5 and 5 is 10 plus 3 is 13 carry the 1
bring down the 3 2 &amp;amp; 2 inch 4 plus 1 is
5 so we have 53 cents another example we
have a half dollar which is 50 cents
I don't like the color there we go
50 cents three nickels five cents each 5
10 15 and 7 pennies so let's change
colors real quick so we add the 50 15 +
7 5 + 7 12 carry the 1 5 6 7 72 cents
so here we have two quarters 25 cents
each 5 + 5 is 10 carry the 1 bring down
zero two and two is four plus one is
five 50 Cent's five dimes that's five
ten cents one two three four five carry
down the zeros one two three four five
it's 50 cents and eighteen pennies so we
have 50 50 and 18 bring down the eight
five five is 10 plus 1 is 11 so we have
a dollar
eighteen
now we have nine dimes one dime is ten
cents so we do one two three four five
six seven eight nine
bring down the zeros and there's nine
ones one nickel is five cents and then
three cents so add all those together 95
+ 3 5 and 3 is 8 bring down the 9 98
cents your answer all right
alright five quarters twenty five cents
each one two three four five so we have
5 10 15 20 25 bring over the two five
two four six eight ten twelve we have a
dollar twenty-five right there nonsense
is just nine cents and one nickel is
five cents so add all those up we have
one twenty five nine and five we have
ten and nine is 19 3 bring down the
decimal point one you could put in those
placeholders if you'd like just to make
it easier so we have a dollar thirty
nine as their answer and one last
example we have 50 Cent's just 15 one
dime is ten seven senses seven cents and
four pennies is four cents add them all
together we have let's gross
50 10 7 &amp;amp; 4 7 8 9 10 11 carry the one
ring down the 1 5 6 7 so many one cents
and that's how you count money</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
