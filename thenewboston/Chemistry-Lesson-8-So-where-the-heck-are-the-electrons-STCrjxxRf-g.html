welcome to eighth chemistry tutorial so
now that we determined that the protons
and neutrons are hanging out inside the
nucleus of the atom we have to answer
the question where the heck are the
electrons so you might be thinking okay
they're probably in the nucleus too why
not
well actually the electrons are spinning
outside the atom or outside the nucleus
so what scientists or chemists rather
did is they needed to figure out the
exact path that the electrons took and
how far apart they were from the nucleus
and they needed to figure out all that
crap so in order to do that they came up
with a few models the first model they
came up with is called the Bohr model be
Ohr and that is because this dude named
Niels Bohr he discovered that he was
pretty much the first one to discover
that the electrons do kind of spin
outside the nucleus and they're all
stuck together into one main thing
however we have a better model that we
also use today called the quantum
mechanical model this was named after
someone named Jonathan quantum
mechanical model I'm just kidding that
wasn't his last name a bunch of people
came up with this in the difference
between these models is Niels Bohr his
model is really simple and easy to
understand and that applies to really
simple atoms
however the quantum mechanical model
this is like the version 2.0 it's more
accurate and better but it's really
complicated and there's kind of a lot of
math involved so for this tutorial I'm
going to go over the Bohr model which
remember this is the easier one it
applies to very simple elements so the
Bohr model pretty much says three main
things first the electron spin or he
says orbit a lot around the nucleus
pretty much if you think of planets
orbiting around the Sun the exact same
idea also
they only orbit at specific distances
and he called these distances energy
lever levels or energy shells
so pretty much he's saying okay an
electron can be in these areas but they
can't be in between and the last thing
he said is electrons use each
it's something called the ground state
or the shell or level closest to the
nucleus however what you can do is that
electron kind of absorb some energy and
jump back up to an excited state and
maybe this will be a better picture so
this little purple globe thing is the
nucleus all of the protons and neutrons
are hanging out right here and these
around here
are the energy levels or shells or
orbits or areas whatever the heck you
want to call them but he says that the
electrons are spinning around here or
orbiting around the nucleus just like
this in this one closest to it is called
the ground state so he said that just
like planets around the Sun they're
spinning around this nucleus just like
this all the time they never quit and
they only spin at these fixed distances
either this one right here or this one
right here but an electron can't be in
between it can't just be like this or it
can't be way out here it has to be on
this one or on this one not in between
now this first one the one closest to
the nucleus this orbit is called the
ground state however whenever electron
absorbs energy it can jump to another
excited state now I only show two in
here but there are an infinite number
that you can have potentially or
theoretically I guess so pretty much
electrons usually hang out here at the
ground state however they can absorb
energy and jump up to an excited state
and then they have a lot of energy and
they're really excited like a little kid
who drink like a teen energy drinks they
also said that each of these different
levels can hold a different number of
electrons for example this first level
right here can hold two electrons the
second level can hold eight electrons
and it goes so on and so forth in
whenever we're talking about the quantum
mechanical model you'll figure out how
many different levels can hold how many
different electrons so with that being
said the problem with this model is that
it works really good for simple elements
for example hide
jujin that there's only one proton and
one electron maybe one Neutron really
simple stuff like that but whenever you
get to other really complex elements
with a bunch of electrons and protons in
it it doesn't really work so well in
this model doesn't prove true all of the
time so a better more accurate and also
unfortunately more complicated model was
formed named the quantum mechanical
model and that's where we're going to be
studying in the next tutorial and that
is what most chemists use today however
for the sake of simplicity just to get
your feet a little wet I decided to talk
to you guys about the Bohr model because
again it's still useful when you're
talking about really simple atoms so
anyways thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe and I will see
you guys next time
remember quantum mechanical model it's
going to be awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
