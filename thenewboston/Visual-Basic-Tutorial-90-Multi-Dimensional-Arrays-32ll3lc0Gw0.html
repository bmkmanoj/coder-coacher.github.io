slash on live gamer for the new boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
talking about multi-dimensional arrays
now the best way for me to explain this
is think of a graph and on that graph
you have points so let's say you have
the point 3 5 well when you make a
multi-dimensional array is pretty much a
graph so when you reference point 3 5
you can hold an item there and you can
also hold an item at 3 6 over 3 7 and
it's just a big 2d graph of different
items that you want to store so let's go
ahead and make a little demo project and
work some with the multi-dimensional
arrays so go ahead and select new
project and we will select windows forms
application and we will set the name -
let's just do we'll do 2d arrays and
we'll go ahead and click OK and wait for
that to load
okay so we'll go ahead and shrink our
form a little bit here and we're going
to add a button and two text boxes so
let's go over here to our tool box we'll
select button and where's the text box
right here
and we'll add another text box okay so
we'll just go ahead and shrink this down
a little bit okay so let's go ahead and
set the text property for button 1 to
get array element it will make it bigger
so it'll all show up and we will set the
name to button get element and one set
the text box one to text first dimension
and the next one to text third dimension
I mean second dimension okay
so we'll go ahead and double click on
get a write element and we will zoom in
here now let's come up here and create
an array now this isn't going to be any
type of array this is going to be a
multi-dimensional array now the way we
do this is we can type their word
keyword private then we will type the
name of our array so we'll just type
multi array and now inside of our
parentheses we're going to specify how
many dimensions it has now we can do
this by just typing - and comma - and
now we have to specify a type so we'll
just do string okay so what this means
is that the array is going to pet is
going to be too long and too down so
picture a grid and picture it three
across and three down so square of three
across and three down because this
starts with zero so it goes 0 1 2 across
0 1 2 and 0 1 2 so our
the bottom right hand corner corner of
that would be - - in the top would be
zero zero so let's go ahead and this
might be a little confusing to you let's
go ahead and assign some values for this
so we will type multi array and we will
assign 0 0 and we will set that equal to
hello
or else - position 0 0 and we will do
that for some of the other spots in the
array so we'll do 0 1 and then we will
set the text to position 0 1 and we'll
do that one more time
and let's just copy this
okay so now what we want to do is we
want to show
whichever one they've picked in a
message box so they will type the let's
say this is the X length because we're
looking at a grid so this right here
would be X and then this right here
would be Y and if you have a three
dimensional array you could use the Z
the Z line but we aren't doing that in
this tutorial so this is the x position
and this is the y position and unlike a
normal grid which starts in the in the
middle let's say you have like a cross
in visual basic it's just like a big
square so in visual basic it starts from
let's say the top right hand corner so
it would start up here and it will go
like let's say three across and then two
down instead of starting in the middle
so let's go ahead and get what the user
has typed in so we'll type message box
dot show and let's come up here and
store what they typed in a couple
variables first so dim x position as
integer and we will set that equal to C
type so we're going to convert what they
got will type text first dimension dot
text and then we will convert that to an
integer type so then we'll declare Y
position as integer and we will convert
the text second dimension dot text to an
integer okay so now we're going to go
ahead and show the position so we'll
type message box show multi array and
then we will type X position and y
position so what this is going to do is
it's going to get the string at whatever
they tapped in for X and whatever they
typed in for Y now currently we only
have three possible
so let's go ahead and run that and see
what happens so we will do 0 and 1 and
get a right element we get position 0 1
and we can do 0 2 and we get position 0
2 so go ahead make some
multi-dimensional arrays and you can
fill in each of the items in the array
so if I were to fill in the next part of
the array I will do something like 1 0
and then 1 1 and then 1 2 and then 2 0 2
1 2 2
so go ahead you can make that and set
the values for it and make a little
program that lets you type in the x
position position and the y position so
that you can get whatever is stored at
that and then once you've practiced a
little bit with multi-dimensional arrays
go ahead and move on to the next
tutorial and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
