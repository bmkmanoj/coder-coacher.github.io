androids tutorial for the new boss in
and what we're gonna do in this tutorial
we're basically going to set up
something to do within this method
called on sensor change but before we do
that let's set up some variables that
we're going to use and they're gonna be
float types so we're gonna say float X
float Y and float sensor X and sensor Y
and then we're also going to set up a
bitmap because again we're gonna draw
that ball to the screen so we're gonna
say bitmap ball and then within our on
create method here we're gonna set up
our ball reference real quickly again
just bitmap factory dot decode resources
a resource and then get resources and
also which whichever ID that we want so
we're gonna say our drawable dots green
ball and we have a bitmap set up we also
might want to set up all of our float
values so we're gonna say x equals y
equals sensor x equals sensor y and
basically what's gonna happen now
actually those not set equal to anything
is we're gonna set that equal to zero
and now anytime our sensor changes it's
gonna call this on sensor change method
so what we can do is we can set up our
you know or float values for a sensor
every time that our sensor is called
so what we can do is say sensor X and I
believe this was our zero something like
that I just changed it to e because it's
a little bit easier to work with
just sensor event is being passed in so
we get an event and we can refer to that
event and get the value so that's what
we're gonna do it we're gonna say e dot
values and it returns a float and let's
just scroll over here to the description
and if we refer to the value 0 that's
going to give us the pretty much the X
x-axis the direction of the x axis and
the y is going to give us the direction
of the y axis and I'm sorry the 1 is
going to give us the direction of the y
axis and the 2 is going to give us the
direction of the z axis so for our
sensor X what we want to do is we just
want to say the values of 1 or I'm sorry
of 0 and that will return basically the
information from our sensor event for
the X direction or the x axis and then
again we're just going to say sensor y
is equal to e dot values and now we're
looking for the Y direction which is 1
and we don't really care about the z
direction for our example and also
another thing that we can do is we can
even delay this even longer because even
though we set it equal to be a normal
delayed sensor we can even delayed a
little bit longer by just adding a
thread sleep method to like 1,000 or not
1,000 like 1616 is about 60 frames per
second and then we're just gonna add a
try and a catch around this this sleep
method here so that will kind of save us
some processing speed so it's not
checking every time our sensor even
slightly moves but you know it's good
enough for example 60 times per second
to update basically our x and y values
of our sensor that's pretty good so
there we go guys that's pretty much it
for this tutorial just kind of learned
about any time a sensor changes that's
going to call this method we're gonna
redefine this sensor X and sensor Y so
I'll get you guys in the next tutorial
have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
