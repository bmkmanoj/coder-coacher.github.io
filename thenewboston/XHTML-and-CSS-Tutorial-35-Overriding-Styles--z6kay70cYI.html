to your 35th CSS tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm going to talk to you guys
about overriding styles so for example
let's go ahead and take a look at this
website that we built before every style
on every single page is the same but
what if you come across a situation
where you have all your webpage is the
same but there's one webpage that you
might want to do a little something
different maybe you want all the
paragraphs bigger or maybe you want all
the headers to be a different color well
you don't have to you know throw fit
because there's a simple way that you
can override the styles on an external
stylesheet using the old style tags that
we learned before and this is where the
term cascading comes into the effect
when we're talking about cascading style
sheets or yeah that's what they're
called so anyways in order to override a
style let's go ahead and take a look at
our main Styles first we have our
headings blue our paragraphs red and our
links orange so say for example on this
page instead of our headings being blue
we want our headings to be green well in
order to change all our headings to
green all we would need to do is this
you know those style tags that I told
you guys take out before well go ahead
and throw those in again style and of
course remember type equals text CSS and
go ahead and put the ending style tag in
there too and now go ahead and write
your CSS rule so for example if we
wanted to change header ones go ahead
and change this to color green and now
check this out even though we have an
external style sheet saying that our
headers are supposed to be blue we went
ahead and we overrode that by throwing
in this internal style tags in our web
page right here and now when we go ahead
and refresh your website instead of
having blue headers we now have green
headers so the point I'm trying to say
is this
in general this is like an outline of
rules we have to follow but anytime that
we want to change a specific rule on our
webpage we can just go ahead and throw
those style tags in and these Styles
will apply to only this webpage and not
the entire website so for example on
this webpage we change the headers the
green but for the rest of the webpage
they're going to be blue still and that
brings me to another point the concept
of cascading is this you're going to get
all your rules right here just like you
imported them just like you type them in
directly there and then later on it's
going to see our rate actually I want my
headers to be green and since this was
the most recent rule that's why they're
green so for example if you went ahead
and copy this and paste it right here
you'd have two header rules the top one
would say make my headers blue and later
on it would say make my headers green
well how does CSS know what one you want
to use the way it determines what one
you want to use is it looks at the most
recent rule so check this out maybe this
will help clarify things if I go ahead
and copy this and paste it in at the top
right there give you a little space to
work with
check it out now we're saying all right
make our header is green but later on
we're telling it to make our headers
blue so what happens when you save this
go to the index page in refresh our
headers are now blue so why are they
blue now even though we have this style
tag in this webpage it's because you
told it to go green first and then later
on you told it to go blue so since blue
was the most recent that's where it went
and again if we copy this or cut it and
make it green since it's the most recent
it'll change it to green and leave the
rest of your pages blue so that is on
how you override styles and again you
never actually want to put the style
tags above the external stylesheet
because the only reason you would have
style tags is to override what's in the
style sheet so having any of these style
tags above would be worthless so anyways
the com
practice of making web pages of this go
ahead and import all the rules that you
need before you start doing the
nitty-gritty stuff and then all the fine
changes that you want to make you want
to put them in style tags and these will
give you all the custom differences for
each web page so anyways that is how
everyone always sets up their CSS in the
web pages and this gives you a lot of
control to give your web pages exactly
the look that you're looking for so
anyways thank you guys for watching this
tutorial
in the next tutorial we're going to be
starting to talk about how to lay our
websites and make them look awesome but
for now that's all you get so anyways
thank you guys for watching thanks for
subscribing and I'll see you guys next
