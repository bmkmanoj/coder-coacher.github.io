slash on live gamer for the new boss Tim
and in this tutorial we're going to
start learning about inheritance now
inheritance is a very big part of
object-oriented programming and it's a
way to write the code once and be able
to use it over and over again now let's
go ahead and come into our all cars vbt
file and you can see here that we have
our class car now this is inside of the
name space all cars so it's come down
here at just under class car we're gonna
make another class so we'll call it
sports car go ahead and hit enter and
you can see it adds in class to us so
now we have sports car and car inside of
all our all cars namespace so what we
need to do to inherit from the car class
is type inherits car so basically what
this is saying is that everything that
the car can do or all of the functions
and methods and variables inside of a
car we can use those inside of our
sports car without having to rewrite the
code all of again all again now if we
didn't inherit we would have to copy all
of this and paste it down here and make
our code really ugly and you'd see a
bunch of the same thing over and over
again so when we're gonna what we did is
just we inherited from car so now let's
add some values to our car so we'll come
up here and we will add private weight
as let's just do integer
so we have a weight variable to get the
weight of our car and now all we need to
do is come down here and since we're
making a sports car you're probably
wanting to know what the horsepower is
actually I got that Miss mesh mixed up
we want to add horsepower up here and
then the weight down here so when you
have a sports car you probably are
wondering what the weight is in terms of
performance for the ratio of weight to
horsepower and this is something that
you would look at when you're trying to
choose a sports car so now that we've
added horsepower and weight let's come
up here into our sports car class and
we'll just in that right there now we'll
come back here to form one VB and we
will create a sports car object so we'll
do private default sports car as new and
they will use the name space all cars
dot sports car ok so now we have our
sports car now let's come back here
and we'll add a method that will send
back the attributes of the sports car
now you can see that we have the
overrides function to string for this
now this is what we use to get the
general information of our car so what
we want to do is we'll just copy this
right here and we will make a sub so
public we'll make it public so that we
can access it outside of this class
public sub get sports info we won't need
any arguments was pasted this right here
and what we want is we want the name the
color the doors the speed and then we're
going to add the
and the horsepower so we'll just add
horsepower and then we'll just type
horsepower uh-huh here's our air I made
it a sub and not a function so we wanted
to we want to make it a function and we
wanted to set it to type of string so
that it would return all of this
so we'll just send it the horsepower and
then the weight
and we'll just go ahead and put speed
right there so that it accesses the
property speed and you can see here that
we are not getting any errors now the
reason we're not getting any errors is
because the sports car inherits
everything from car so whatever is in
car we can use it in sports car now you
can see we do get an error on the
horsepower because we made that private
that's come up here and we will make a
property to get or set the horsepower so
gets and sets horsepower and for this
we'll just add in two horsepower right
here so it will type public property
horsepower
as integer now for our get we will just
return in horsepower and for our set
will type int horsepower equals value
okay so that will get rid of our error
right here you can see that horsepower
shows up and whenever you inherit from
something if you're inheriting private
variables they will not you will not be
able to directly access them through
this like I did you can see that car
name is public so we can access that so
let's come over here to our form one dot
V be again and we will just set some of
the values for our default sports car
now the sports car inherits the
constructor from our car so assess the
color of the speed and the number of
doors now sports cars ideally have two
doors but we'll go into overloading
constructors in the next tutorial but
we're just going to need to set the
weight and the horsepower so for now
we'll just make weight public and then
we'll add a property later on
okay so we'll come over here to for
Mondavi be will type default sports car
dot wait and we'll set it equal to let's
say a thousand pounds and then we will
set the horsepower dot horsepower equals
let's just give it five hundred
horsepower now for show info where is it
right here
we'll just go ahead and type default
sports car and if we use dot to string
it would work fine
and give us certain information but we
want all of the information so I'll just
type let's see get sports info okay so
let's go ahead and run this and we need
to hurry up here because I'm running out
of time but we'll go ahead and click
show info we've got the name we have a
senator named yet color red number of
doors five speed is zero horsepower is
500 and weight is 1000 now I didn't add
a new line in there but I will add that
and we will talk more about this in the
next tutorial so thanks for watching and
stay tuned for the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
