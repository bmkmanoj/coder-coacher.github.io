to your very first app review and due to
many many requests I'm gonna start doing
iPod app reviews and my first app
reviews couldn't be for call of duty
world at war
zombies I guess that's how I say it
because it's like call of duty world at
war and then just has zombies or in the
middle so that's what happened gonna be
reviewing today just going over some
basic controls and well we'll see you
this so if you have a like decision
whether or not you want to buy this game
because it's kind of expensive
well hopefully you can decide so as you
see on the main screen it says call of
duty world at war
zombies yeah Thai Chinese finish start
so let's go ahead and pick a
single-player and let's go ahead and you
have two difficulties recruit a new game
and excuse me recruit regular I'm gonna
be recruit because I'm a noob and go
ahead click new game and you don't need
the tutorial that's what you got me for
and pick up this right here this is
pretty much the first map so well that's
pretty much it wait on my fingerprints
on there huh getting nice and greasy
should always grease up your iPod before
you play and if you tap it and say go
faster go faster it actually loads
faster if you believe it or not so here
we are on our main screen and the first
thing I want to go over is pretty much
how to move aim and shoot how you move
it's pretty much just a little joint or
it's not a joystick it looks like a
joystick can you forward back left and
right now how you look around is using
your thumb or finger just move anywhere
on the main screen now to shoot just go
ahead and press this little button right
here and bam pop some caps right there
now any time you want to reload you see
your bullets up here in the upper right
just go ahead and tap your gun once and
you can reload now any time you want to
change a weapon you have two weapons at
a time I don't know if I have another
weapon
or not but you need to tap it twice and
that's gonna change your weapon now in
order to throw a grenade use your
grenade right here just press that
grenade button right there and
automatically throws a grenade and again
or not again anytime you want to aim
down your sights just press this little
say right here and that'll do that but
now I got to kill this zombie that's
coming at me so I'm gonna throw a couple
cabs in them right there and also
there's another zombie right there and
it brings me to another point this knife
right here allows you to knife and Oh
anytime you want to pause just press
that little pause button in the upper
left hand side of your screen so that's
pretty much all the controls and now we
can get to pretty much what the games
about in order to play a game you see
you got your points up here you get more
points for killing more zombies so I
think I just got 200 points for killing
them two zombies
let's see how many points I get when I
killed this one right here I got 70
points for that and I there's another
one actually like the knife for more
than I do shoot them I don't know why
more violence I think but anyways back
to thing what you can do with your
points is you can go and buy weapons now
the weapons are outline is chop and you
just go ahead up on the screen and buy
them and now see I got my weapon
replaced if I bought it yep I did so now
I got a new weapon that can pull some
zombies with it's pretty cool and the
thing is you can I don't know if you can
see it but there's two little check
marks right here
zombies come in two rounds and there's
pretty much spurts now each round gets a
little bit harder and another thing you
can do is build barricades on your
window right here prepare barricade now
they come through here and you also get
points for repairing barricades so well
that's pretty much it I think the only
thing I'm forgetting is that sometimes
you can plug this guy real quick
sometimes you can pick up things like
insta kill and it's pretty much bonus
stuff
and it's like double your points or in
skill or something like that
so the point pretty much is to kill tons
on these and you know it's pretty much
it and you're actually not sleep it's
hard to talk and tone zombies at the
same time you can also unlock new areas
and anytime you want to unlock an area
let me find where it is I'm this guy
anytime you want to unlock an area that
cost points as well so for example if I
want to unlock I can't even see it this
area right up here and I'm gonna get
pwned right here but in order to clean
this debris I need to repair it just
like that
and now I get another area the thing
with this is now you got to watch out
for even more zombies so that is pretty
much my review of I know that you didn't
see a lot of gameplay but I'm running
out of footage and this is HD okay
takes up a lot so the 3d in here is
actually awesome and they'll keep it
busy for a long time one of the best
games for your ipod touch the price for
this is it so good it's pretty expensive
I think it's like 10 bucks or something
but what I recommend buying it
definitely yes and I'm gonna do a little
thing where I rate each game out of ten
and I'm gonna write this one eight out
of ten um
one for the price and one for a lack of
storyline kind of but trust me this game
is well worth the buy and we just go
ahead and knife these babies real quick
there we go again like I said it's well
worth bite and I recommend buying it so
