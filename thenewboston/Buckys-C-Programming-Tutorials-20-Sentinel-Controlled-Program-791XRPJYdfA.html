20th tutorial and in this story I'm
going to be teaching you guys how to
build a Sentinel controlled program now
let me explain you guys what that is you
remember in the last tutorial where we
built that program and we ran a loop
five times and each time we allow the
user to enter a number
well sometimes we're going to want to
build programs where we don't know how
many times the user wants to enter a
number so if you like we're calculating
the average grades for kids in your
class you know how many kids are in your
class if you are calculating the average
age of like people in your family you
know how many people in your family but
if we build a program and we just sold
it to everyone in the world everyone's
family has a different size every
teachers class size is different so we
don't know exactly how long to make that
loop last so what we do instead is we
give a special code and this code is
usually something like negative one and
we use this because ages in weights and
you know number of things cannot be
negative one so whenever we answer
negative one this is when our program
knows to stop and you know make its
calculations or do whatever it does so
let's go ahead and I'm going to be
building a program that we enter the
ages of a bunch of people how many we
don't know yet but we're going to enter
the ages of a bunch of people what our
program is going to do is figure out how
many people we entered and calculate the
average age of all those people so let's
go ahead and it's pretty much an age
average er if I was to make this program
I would name an age average er 5.0 Wi-Fi
point no I don't know it's just like
five so let's go ahead and we're going
to need some variables the first
variable we need is some place for the
user to enter and store that age each
age at a time so they're going to enter
someone's age like 32 we're going to
store in the variable age after this we
need some way to keep track of all those
ages a total so if they enter 32 then 32
we want this this sort of total which
would be 64 because we're going to be
averaging it later on so int just name
it like age total and this of course is
equal to zero first but it's going to be
the total of everyone's age combined and
the third thing we need to keep track is
how many people did they enter so you
take the total over how many people they
entered and this gives us the average
age so int number of people entered and
I don't really like making variables
that long because it's easy to make a
typo the longer your variable is but
it's descriptive for this story so the
first thing we want to do is just write
a prompt on the screen see out um
enter first person's age or negative one
to quit so what we're going to be doing
is our code is negative one whenever we
get the input negative one from the user
we know we know that they want to quit
the program so let's go ahead and then
give them something to enter age so
they're going to enter a number and it's
going to be stored in the variable age
so now we just need to test make sure
it's not equal to negative run and we
need to loop this program as many times
as possible as long as the value is not
equal to negative one so as long as age
is not equal to negative one go ahead
and run this program and at the heart of
this program is this we're going to be
doing is we're going to be taking that
age total and it's going to be a running
total of the old age total plus the new
value that they entered for age so the
first time say they enter six is going
to be 0 plus 6 the next time they enter
10 is going to be 6 plus 10 so the total
would be 16 so then when we divide it by
the number of people which would be 2
their average age is 8 so let's go ahead
and now each time this loop runs it
means that they entered a new person so
let's go ahead and just write
number of people entered plus plus
because remember plus plus is the same
as adding one to it each time so now we
said all right our H total is good and
the number of people entered is good so
now every time we run this loop we want
to give them another opportunity to hit
negative one or enter someone's age so
make another C out and just write
something like enter next person's age
or negative one to quit so right now
they're going to enter negative one or
someone's age and let's just go ahead
and end that line so now semicolon there
we go so now we're going to store that
value an age so they're going to keep
running this and every time it runs
they're going to have a chance to input
input an age what this loop is going to
do is check and it's going to run the
loop over and over and over and over
again until the user enters negative one
once they enter negative one is going to
say all right that's my sign to bail out
of this loop and go ahead and make my
calculations so for calculations let's
first go ahead and make sure our program
is going to work properly by saying
let's first tell them number of people
entered and I know I spelled that wrong
big deal who cares and now we just
output number of people entered looks
good in line and after this what we want
to do is we want to find the average age
of all those people so C out
average h and then we just go ahead and
the formula for average age is age total
over number number of people entered for
example if your h total is a hundred and
you enter ten people then the average
age would be ten so let's go ahead and
run this program first to see if it
works see if I forgot any semicolons or
anything all right so the program is up
and running it looks good so what I like
to do whenever I build programs like
this is I like to enter values that I
already can calculate in my head just to
make sure that computer is calculating
so let's go ahead and enter a person
with the age of 10 the person with the
age of 20 and a person with the age of
30 now I know that whenever I average
these together 10 20 and 30
well that's 60 so 60 divided by 3 is 20
so I'm going to be expecting 20 and that
that way I know that my program is
working correctly so let's go ahead and
quit by hitting negative 1 and go ahead
and hit enter and it says number of
people entered 3 which is correct 10 20
and 30 average age of them is 20 because
60 divided by 3 is 20 so that is pretty
cool
and our program works fine number of
people entered it got that right and it
calculated their average age right so
that's what I like to do before I enter
big numbers like 87 68 5 and all those
like fives a real big number
so anyways how our program work is this
what we did is we built three variables
well let me just go ahead and skip to
the good stuff
it says alright enter the first person's
age and we went ahead and we entered 10
right here so it says alright is 10
equal to negative 1 nope so let's go
ahead and run this right here I'm going
to go ahead and store 10 and H total and
change the number of people enter it to
1 and now go ahead and give me another
age well we went ahead and we enter 20
so now 20 plus 10 our age total is now
30 and our number of people entered was
2 so it said all right give it to
we enter 30 so now our age total was 30
plus 30 which is 60 and number of people
entered was 3 so then they said are 8
now give me another age or negative 1 to
quit
we gave it negative 1 to quit so what
bailed out of this loop and it went
ahead and is make the calculations for
this calculation it just printed out the
number of people entered which was 3 and
4 this one is said the H total which was
60 divided by the number of people
entered which was of course 360 over 3
is of course 20 so again that is called
a sentinel control loop because we can
run this program in it doesn't matter
how many numbers we enter you know we're
not limited to 5 or 10 or anything as
soon as we hit negative 1 it calculates
how many people we entered and their
average age so again this is a much more
dynamic program in the sense that you're
not only limited a certain number but
you can disperse this you know maybe a
bunch of different types of people and
it doesn't matter their sample size any
size any amount of people in this
program is still going to continue to
work fine so that is the beauty of a
central control program these are the
loops that you're going to be using more
often rather than you know a fixed
number so get used to it become familiar
with it and once you are you're good go
so for now that's all I have for you
guys in the next tutorial don't know
what I'm going to be covering but my
throat is dry now so I need to go get a
drink water and you need to watch more
of my videos or something I don't know
so thank you guys for watching don't
forget subscribe and I'll see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
