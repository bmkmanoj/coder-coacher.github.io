video is going to be the coolest video
yet we're going to talk about keyword
research and I'm going to give away all
my secrets is going to be sweet so
whenever we're talking about keywords we
first need to decide which keywords we
should target so for example let's say
that you're making a website like mine
where I have a bunch of programming
tutorials how do I know to use the
keyword program tutorials why don't I
use programming lessons or programming
courses how do you decide which keywords
to use well let's go ahead and start
with the basics first of all do not
target impossible keywords so say that
I'm helping my grandma out with her
homemade applesauce business because she
is getting pretty successful around town
and she wants to expand sell these bad
boys online so she says oh why don't we
target the keyword Apple but of course
even though my grandma is fantastic and
making apple sauce she doesn't know a
lot about SEO so I told her grandma the
keyword apple is basically impossible
and you're never going to be able to get
number one on this no matter how good
your apple sauce is because you have to
compete with Apple the company so it's
just not going to happen and to be
realistic no matter how great your apple
sauce is she's probably never going to
rank number one for the keyword apple
sauce I mean there's probably going to
be a bunch of recipes and Wikipedia
articles and you know maybe like Mott's
apple sauce is always going to rank
number one for this so she should
probably try to target some less
competitive keywords so in that sense
just use common sense don't try to go
after you know an incredibly competitive
or popular keyword already now another
thing that you should think about is
what is the customer or user searching
for it's not always about what the
website is like homemade apple sauce but
whenever someone actually wants to buy
apple sauce online what do they type in
they don't type in grandma homemade can
I not type homemade applesauce because
they don't even know about her business
or anything like that
what would I type in if I'm
by applesauce online well by applesauce
online so even though the website maybe
graham is homemade applesauce this is
what the user is actually going to type
in so again this all comes from common
sense the majority of the time although
later on we're going to be taking a look
at some tools and check this out
so not only what the user is looking for
but what type of content they're going
after so my website right here like I
said I have a bunch of programming
videos I don't have a lot of like
programming documentation or ebooks or
anything like that so whenever I'm just
typing or looking to go up to your
program tutorials I need to think about
that so maybe I don't want to target
programming guide because people who
type programming guide they may be
looking for documentation about some
language or maybe some text or maybe
some ebook or something like that what
my website is right here our programming
video tutorials so this would be a great
keyword for me even though it
technically is like a programming guide
that you can watch online whatever so
just think about that not only what your
content is but what the user is actually
going to be searching for so now I'll
tell you guys something cool so that's
basically how you can use common sense
and try to guess what the user is going
to search for there's another thing that
you can do and that's let's not guess
what the user searched for let's just
figure it out so back in the early days
of YouTube whenever I was just like
first starting out like my very first
month I started making tutorials in no
one was finding them I thought they were
pretty good videos but I wasn't very
well known and you know there's just no
way that anyone could ever find my
videos in the hundreds of millions of
search results or whatever so I needed
to find a way to have my videos appear
at the top whenever a user searched for
word tutorials so I was doing a bunch of
stuff wrong but the main thing that I
did that I changed that really boosted
you know my
popularity is I would go to YouTube and
let's say that I was making a series
about Java I would type in Java and then
I would say you know what instead of
just trying to guess whether to use Java
tutorials or Java lessons or Java
courses in my title let me just look at
autocomplete now the way that this
autocomplete works is basically what
Google does and by the way Google owns
YouTube so whenever I say Google I'm
talking about the same thing is it
looked at everyone who typed in Java
before and then it says the people who
typed in Java before the most common
thing they typed after this was Java
tutorial for beginners so that's what
people are most likely to type in now a
little less likely is Java brains Java
programming for beginners so on and so
forth so basically whenever I made a
java video and the results are probably
different now than they were back then
but I would pretty much name it Java
tutorial for beginners so then whenever
anyone search for this look at this we
got to adds in boom look at that my
playlist number one so again you can
either like go with my grandma and just
guess try to find out what the user is
looking for or you can just use
autocomplete in again what this did is
it basically was like YouTube handing
all of the answers that I ever wanted
right to me on a silver platter
so after I started doing that my views
went through the roof and that is why
again back then I'm like who's going to
want to watch programming tutorials
online no one was doing it maybe like a
thousand subscribers was like the most
popular channel and now I have over a
million subscribers because I just I
don't know it's pretty cool trick so
there you go and again if you guys are
like I'm just going to use this trick
and then I'm going to get the most
popular videos or website in the world
you still need to have awesome content
so even though now users could actually
find my videos I still needed to make
the best videos possible so that's what
I always try to do so again
if you make the best content they're
going to find you naturally but there's
a nice little tip and another cool thing
is let's say arm you want to make a
website about like Java tutorials so not
only can you use autocomplete right
there but if you want to get different
ideas of kind of similar things people
are searching for you're like you know
what maybe tutorials isn't the best
keyword scroll all the way down and it
says oh the people who search for Java
tutorials also search for these things
Java HelloWorld a Java video tutorial
Java interview questions so if you're
like you know what my video is actually
HelloWorld it's the very first
introductory video so maybe instead of
naming an introduction I'm going to name
a hello world in boom I mean guys even
though they aren't naming their formulas
Google in YouTube is never going to name
or give you their formula they're pretty
much giving you all the answers slapping
it right in your face right in front of
you they even bolded certain things I
mean oh it's so beautiful guys so the
last thing I want to mention before I
let you guys go is this if you ever get
in a situation where you're like alright
so I found two different keywords and
they both are really good I can use
either or in my titles so I'm making
Python programming tutorials and I know
I want to use learn Python or learn
program what you can do is you can go to
Google Trends and this basically allows
you to type in two keywords and you can
pretty much see the popularity of it so
this is essentially the amount of people
who search for it so we can see that a
lot more people I don't want to say a
lot more about more people search for
learn programming then learn Python now
just keep in mind you don't just always
want to choose the one that's more
popular because yes the one that's more
popular more people are searching for it
but it's also more likely more
competitive as well so again just keep
that in mind and this video is getting
kind of long so yeah thank you guys for
watching hope you learn a little
something and
I will see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
