ready to go we're now looking at our
empty project in thinking all right how
do I use grunt on this now well the
first thing you always need to do
whenever you want to grunt off' i a
project is you navigate to that projects
home directory which we should have done
in the last video and type NPM in it and
hit enter and what this is going to do
is it's going to walk you through
setting up a core package JSON file now
this is just core basic information
about your project nothing really you
know grunt related but grunt is gonna
use this file to do you know all those
automated tests later on so all this
stuff's really easy the name of your
project I'm just going to name this demo
the version 1.0 looks good description
I'll be like websites about bacon entry
point index the HTML test command nope
git repository too lazy set that up
keywords nope you can just hit enter and
skip through most of these were too lazy
to fill them out author Bucky Roberts
just gonna hit enter for the rest of
these alright so there's you know some
core information about my project is
this okay yes it is looks awesome and
boom now check out what happened
actually if i refresh this you can see
that what that did is it created this
file right here package Jason and
essentially it's just a JSON file of all
the information that we just gave it so
now grunt can use this whenever it needs
basic info and we can actually delete
this scripts and this license right here
because I want to clunk it up with too
much crap that we don't need and let me
expand this again and all of might as
well keep that open alright so after
that what we need to do is we need to
install one more thing and that is grunt
itself and you guys are like um didn't
we already do that with the grunt CLI
this is where it gets kind of confusing
the grunt CLI is a program that allows
us to type grunt come
grunt itself is the thing that's gonna
be doing all those automated tests like
minifying our CSS and JavaScript and
watching our less files so against CSI I
mean CLI just allows us to type grunt
commands grunt is gonna be doing all the
cool stuff why they separated them I
don't know it's kind of confusing but
whatever so in each project that you
have you're gonna install grunt so I can
do those automated tests so again from
your projects home directory type NPM
install grunt now you also want to type
save - dev now this is going to do is
it's gonna save it is it dependency and
you guys are gonna see after you hit
Enter what that means and by the way
these warnings that pop up at first
they're not like error messages so if
you see them don't freak out this is
just saying hey um you don't like have a
readme you don't have a repository and
your package of JSON that license you
deleted it
it doesn't really matter it's more
actually information instead of warnings
it I mean what did they make it like
bright yellow makes you feel like I just
deleted like the most important file my
computer or something but don't freak
out now another thing I want to show you
guys is this so if you refresh your
package at Jason what you see is that it
actually added grunt as a dependency now
a dependency is just something that your
project uses so whenever we saw those
other plugins we're gonna see those as
dependencies as well and also it
installed grunt itself so it gave you a
folder called node underscore modules
and we now have a module called grunt
now we're never actually going to be in
here editing any of these files
it just says ok you can now use grunts
in your project so that's all we did
again a lot of this thing a lot of this
always happens behind the scenes but I
just wanted to give you guys a detailed
explanation because if you see a bunch
of files popping up in your project you
don't get freaked out so you now know
what everything is doing packages that
Jason
and we now have grunt installed in the
next video I'm gonna be showing you guys
how to install those plugins and
actually doing something useful so see
you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
