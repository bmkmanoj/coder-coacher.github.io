are a little bit smarter another cool
feature that I want to teach you guys
had to do is how to add health to your
monsters so right now whenever you play
the game we can just go ahead and shoot
each monster and they explode the very
first time you shoot them well what I
want to do is I want to show you guys
how to make it so that you have to shoot
a monster five times before it dies so
let me go ahead and do that I mean just
myself and my seat alright so go ahead
and click on one of the monsters or you
can actually click it in your objects
panel and what we want to do is after
it's clicked we want to add a variable
to it now a variable is just something I
don't want to say a property because
these are all properties but it's
something that you can change about the
monster and you can also make some cool
behaviors or excuse me events happen
when the variable gets the certain point
kind of confusing for me to talk about
so I'll just show you guys so in this
instance variable we want to go ahead
and next to add and edit we're going to
add a new instance variable so I'll just
click this and remember this is an
instance variable so whenever I change
it for this monster it's actually going
to apply this to all the instances in
other words all of the monsters so
that's another reason why I said it's
cool to just hold ctrl on your keyboard
and drag because then you can do cool
stuff like this and once we give this
monster health it's going to give every
monster health pretty sweet huh so now
we need to add a new one by just
clicking this little plus sign and for
the name of this I'm just going to name
a health and would you just set it a
some number right now and the initial
value is going to be five and basically
what's going to happen is once ever okay
take a deep breath Bucky and do this as
soon as the game starts every monster is
going to have a health of five every
time we shoot them it's going to
decrease by one so four three two one
and once it gets to zero then the
monster is going to be destroyed aka
they're going to die
so again that's why the initial value is
a five-hit okay close out of this and
now as you can see no matter where you
click any of these monsters they all
have the variable of health 5 to start
out so now what we need to do is we
actually need to tell it in our event
sheets that right now it says bullet on
collision with monster monster destroy
but we actually need to change that to
say no don't destroy them just take one
health away and we need to add some more
logic so wherever it said monster
monster destroyed what we can do is we
can actually right click the stris Troy
right here and we can press for a place
action right there so what we want to do
instead of destroy is we want to just
subtract one from the instance variable
so monster this is going to be our new
actions that is right so monster and
there's actually one called subtract
subtract from instance variables prepa
sure knows under that category so hit
next and home this is all good to go it
looks like so what instance variable do
you want well we only have one so not
many options there and the value is
basically saying how many do you want to
subtract well one looks good so we can
just go ahead and hit done so basically
what we did if we think about it is well
now whenever the UM bullet hits the
monster it's going to subtract one from
the health and it's going to make a
little explosion and the bullet is going
to be destroyed but we don't have a way
to actually kill the monster yet we just
subtract one from health but it doesn't
know when it gets to zero health to kill
the monster we know that but um we need
to tell our game back right now so this
is how we do that we actually need the
head add a whole new event and for the
condition what the condition is is
monster compare instance variable
compared instance variable right here so
click Next in and it's going to say ok
what variable do you want me to keep an
eye on well keep an eye on the health
and when it is less than or equal to
zero then just go ahead and press done
so whenever the monsters health is less
than or equal to zero what do you want
to happen well for the action we want a
couple things that happen the first and
foremost is of course we want a sweet
explosion so for the monster rubber the
monster was we want to spawn where yet
we're yet
spawn another object and what object you
want to create well we want to do is we
want to create an explosion and we want
to put it on freakin cursor layer one
and of course image point right now this
is perfect so whenever we shoot the
monster from the center of them there's
going to be an explosion you know
obviously our monsters are made out of
some kind of gas or some kind of
explosives looks good so just hit done
right there now an explosion occurs
wherever the monster is but the months
are still going to be there unless we
destroy it aka kill it so we need to add
another action as well which is monster
destroy so basically what we did is we
added an instance variable and then you
said whenever the bullet hits the
monster subtract one from itself and
also keep an eye on the monster's health
and when ever gets to zero or below zero
what we want to do is we want to make an
explosion and destroy the monster object
and the reason that I don't have it is
just make sure it equals zero is because
you always want to do this whenever
you're killing monsters because later on
if um I don't know maybe it'll just miss
a tick maybe you're playing with someone
else and you shoot it at the same time
or maybe you have a gun that takes away
like ten health at a time so then once
you shoot a monster that has five health
it's going to be negative five and the
monster is going to live
so always make sure that you check if
it's less than zero as well so anyways
if you go ahead and shoot a monster now
it doesn't get destroyed until you shoot
it five times and then it explodes to
have too much fun playing this game here
okay one two three four five so I'm
going to keep playing this game and yeah
it's getting pretty awesome but there
are still a lot of improvements that we
can make so thank you guys for watching
and well see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
