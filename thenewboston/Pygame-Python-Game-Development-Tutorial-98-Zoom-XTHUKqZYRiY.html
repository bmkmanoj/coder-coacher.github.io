another pining tutorial video with PI
OpenGL and Python so where we left off
we were basically pulling in these mouse
buttons we found out that for us forward
5 is reverse and now I want to show you
guys how we can kind utilize this to
zoom in and out of our object so we want
to do if event dot button is a4 then we
want to GL translate if 0.0 0.0 and 1.0
then we'll go ahead and just run l if
event dot button equals a 5 GL translate
F 0.0 0.0 and 1.0 actually this is
negative 1 point 0 and that will zoom
for us we're gonna turn off rotate for
now and you'll see why in a moment but
let's go ahead and save and run it there
is our cube now we come on screen and
we'll spoil our mouse and you'll see how
we are zooming in and out now now let's
go ahead and turn on rotate so rotate
there's our cube awesome and you see how
as we roll it's almost like it's it's
like we're having a really hard time
controlling it and the reason for this
is you need to understand what what is
happening so when we zoom it's like it's
affecting like us right but we're also
zoom in and out of the actual cube which
is spinning and then each time we zoom
basically we're zooming in and out from
a different kind of perspective and so
that's what makes this really confusing
initially here it we've lost it but
here's an example let's do let's turn
rotate will do zero zero and zero see
how that looks for us right and so now
we're just zooming in and out of this
cube okay
easy enough and then what I want to go
ahead and do let's make this and we need
to make let's do x s5 okay so now you
can see it's going like forward and
reverse now what if uh let's change this
to so it's not so steep okay oops one
more time okay now this is a good idea
or a good time to show you the clips or
you know clipping so we could change
this to 5 and this to 10 okay so as we
zoom out we can see it but as we zoom
before we see that the cube is being
clipped away right based on our view so
as we get closer to it it's like chopped
it's like slicing off the top of the
cube basically we can also get a better
look of that let's do 20 let's try that
right so as the cube comes closer to us
it's being clipped away and then as it
moves away from us it's also being
clipped away the more you know okay so
so that's that and let's see if there's
anything else I really want to show you
as far as it's like perspective for
example who made this 90 and we zoom out
okay so you can see that let us see if
there's anything else I really want to
show ya
I think that covers it as far as like
with zoom what I would want to show you
guys so anyway that's that we could turn
back on on rotate and rotate really
shows that well there's still a couple
of things I definitely want to show you
guys especially like coloring and stuff
like that so stitching to the next video
for that as always thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
