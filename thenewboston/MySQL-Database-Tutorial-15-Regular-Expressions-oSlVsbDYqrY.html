tutorial in MySQL and in this lesson I
want to talk to you guys about something
called regular expressions now regular
expressions is basically something
that's built into MySQL and it's a way
that you can search for more complex
patterns other than just using the
wildcards % and underscore I meant to
type those % and underscore so it's kind
of like a language all on its own it's
actually incorporated not only into
MySQL but a bunch of different other
programming languages like PHP and
JavaScript I believe so
learning regular expressions on its own
is a whole nother beast but for this
tutorial I just want to tell you guys
how to incorporate it into MySQL so let
me go ahead and let me go and select the
name of item from the table items where
the name and instead of hitting like I'm
going to type our EG e XP that means
that we want to work with regular
expressions now in single quotation
marks you go ahead and you type your
regular expression now the easiest
regular expression is basically just a
word for example knew what this regular
expression means just a symbol single
word is basically saying search for
anything that contains the word
new so whenever we hit go as you can see
it doesn't matter if it appears at the
beginning at in the middle or as part of
another word as long as it contains the
word new then there you go
so of course we can achieve this just by
using like in some wild cards but this
is how you incorporate regular
expressions now another thing that may
come in handy is the dot or the period
whatever you want to call it now the
period means any single character so if
you were to write something like dot
boxes then if any single character came
before boxes in your term then that
would go ahead and hit in your results
so for example a space came before all
these and before that a character excuse
me a number so that's why dot boxes
matched all of these
terms right here so of course we could
also do this now there are some other
regular expressions and I want to talk
to you guys about a few other ones the
next regular expression I want to talk
to you guys about is the pipe I forgot
what it's called technically the pipe
line the pipe symbol whatever is it's
the little thing above the enter on your
keyboard when you hit shift it gives you
straight up-and-down this is basically
the same thing as or in other words go R
and basically when I'm saying it's the
same thing as or you can go ahead and
hit two words on either end of this pipe
sign for example gold pipe sign car and
what this is saying is basically this
search for any item that either includes
the word gold or the word car it doesn't
have to include gold car or anything
like that just one or the other so
basically the pipe sign is the same
thing as or so let me just go ahead and
take a look at our results traditional
carpet now even though this isn't like a
traditional car in car is separate as
long as it includes the word car or gold
somewhere in there so basically it's
like using parentheses on either side of
gold or car it just may be a little
quicker whenever you're coding so again
as you are seeing already regular
expressions are just using symbols in
really weird ways now the last regular
expression I want to talk to you guys
about is something called a set now a
set is basically like a list or a bunch
of different or statements now I want to
show you guys this because it can save
you guys a lot of time instead of having
the type of whole bunch of different or
statements now if you were let's say you
wanted to match a bunch of specific
characters like for example one two
three four five let's say we wanted to
find one boxes of frogs two boxes frogs
three boxes frogs four boxes frogs well
we can do that using a bunch of
different my SQL statements or we can
use a set in regular expressions now
anytime you want to use a set make sure
to include it in square brackets
then type all of the different terms you
want to search for now make sure not to
include commas in between them it's not
like a list in MySQL so don't forget
that now go ahead and type boxes of
frogs and what this statement is
basically saying is okay search for one
boxes of frogs two boxes the frogs three
boxes four boxes or five boxes of frogs
so it's basically five different MySQL
or statements and one so now let me just
go ahead and copy that and run and as we
can see it returns three boxes of frogs
now we also have seven boxes in 48 boxes
but those that are returned because they
weren't in the set now another cool
thing that you can do real quick is you
can negate the set and then negate a set
means basically okay search for anything
except this list
so basically we're saying okay search
for any boxes of frogs but since we
included that little caret right there
and this is the symbol above the six on
your keyboard we're saying okay search
for any number boxes of frogs besides
one two three four and five so now
whenever we hit go that is when we get
48 and seven and again this is the gate
symbol that can be used with other
regular expressions to not only sets
again regular expressions are pretty
much taking all the symbols on your
keyboard that you thought you would
never use in putting them to use I think
I think that's what the creator of
regular expressions wanted to do he's
like wow since all of these crap you
know all this crap I don't use I'm going
to put a use to it and that's how
regular expressions was probably
invented and oh yeah I wanted teach you
guys one more thing you know how I said
that you can include a set like 1 2 3 4
or 5 anytime you want a set not only of
numbers like 1 through 5 but you can use
this with the letters like a to Z you
can go ahead and just write 1 minus 5
like you're writing 1 through 5 and
that's just a little shortcut instead of
you know having to write the whole set
so whenever you want to do something 2 3
4 5 6 7 8 9 you can just do 2 to 9 and
it's the same thing
so if we go ahead and search this since
3 is in the range of 1 to 5
five that's just a little shortcut I
thought to tell you guys real quick so
again like I said there are a ton more
regular expressions it's like its own
language made up with special characters
and it really for me to cover all of the
regular expressions would be a waste of
time because regular expressions are
really outside the scope of these
tutorials they're just incorporated into
MySQL so that's why I wanted to show you
guys this story real quick because
whenever you come across them this is
how you put them and incorporate them
into - grow so again I encourage you
guys to go online look at the list of
are the regular expressions and then
once you understand them learn how to
use them this is how you use them in
MySQL but for now thank you guys for
watching how to use regular expressions
in MySQL and yeah I'll see you guys in
the next video
oh by the way don't forget to add me on
