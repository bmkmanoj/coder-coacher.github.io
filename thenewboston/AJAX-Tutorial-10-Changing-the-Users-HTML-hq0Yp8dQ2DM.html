input all right so now we access the
elementary here and what we want to do
is we want to set the inner HTML equal
to in the inner HTML is basically on the
HTML in between the div so it basically
the inner HTML is the stuff that shows
on the web page so we can either set
this to you know the message itself but
what I want to do is I actually want to
color this blue so let me go ahead and
word wrap this span and this is a CSS if
you don't know CSS and just go ahead and
copy me style equals color blue and I
were to wrap this so this is actually
all on one line I just you know moved it
down so it would be easier to see for
you guys in the tutorial so basically we
want to create the message and now the
message is going to be colored blue once
I end the span tag right like that all
right
so that's basically what we're doing and
right actually I'm just going to go
ahead and code the rest of this and I'm
going to talk you guys through set
timeout and if-else now remember this is
what's supposed to happen this is what
happens when you successfully
communicate else if something went wrong
then just go ahead and alert you know um
just something stupid like something
went wrong how clever is that all right
so now I'm done our program is complete
so one more time remember that this
function is basically what's going to be
called whenever we get a request or
excuse me whenever we get response back
from the server the first thing that we
do is check for errors and hopefully we
don't have any of those if we do then
we're just going to go ahead and you
know let the user know that we had an
air
and after that we're pretty much
grabbing in dissecting the XML document
that was generated by our PHP file and
we pretty much take the message that was
in between the response tags and we put
it in between span just the color it
blue and we set the document on our HTML
file which was this right here we set
the inner HTML which is basically the
part that shows to the user we set it
equal to that blue colored message now
after this we just want to you know a
little pause before we do it again
because we don't want it to communicate
with our server like bam bam bam bam bam
like every single millisecond routes you
know it would be a waste of server space
or be very taxing on our server so what
we do is we wait a second so basically
whenever we're running this program it's
not going to check for everything every
millisecond what it's going to do is
it's going to wait a second check your
server
wait a second communicate with your
server wait a second communicate with
your server and that is kind of the
better way to do things
all right so now this is complete and in
the next tutorial we're going to be
running through it and I'm going to be
talking through it one last time very
briefly just now that we understand how
everything works so thank guys for
watching and we can subscribe and I'll
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
