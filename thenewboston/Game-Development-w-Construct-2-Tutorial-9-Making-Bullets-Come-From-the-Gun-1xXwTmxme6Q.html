or dude can move around and he can also
shoot bullets but as you can see he's
shooting them from the top of his head
which isn't a really good feature
because he doesn't have a gun taped to
the top of his head and the reason that
this is actually happening is because
what we're doing is responding spawning
a bullet according to where this object
is where our dude is and that's you know
really handy because then you can move
around wherever in his own little world
and bullets will come right from them
but the only problem with that is by
default whenever you spawn objects which
is the bullet within another object
which is the dude they come from the
center of this object and the center of
the dude is the top of his head not very
cool so how can we fix that to say okay
we want to spawn bullets revver this
dude is but we don't want to use the top
of his head for that origin point I'll
show you guys how to do that right now
so what we need to do is we need to
right-click the player in this objects
panel and that's right here right next
to tile map of course all your objects
are in it that's why they named it the
object panel so right-click your player
and choose edit animations so once you
click that your animation windows pop up
and you have all of these tools right
here and the one that we actually want
to work with is this it looks like a
little crosshair with a dot in the
middle it's actually the set origin and
image point tools so click that and once
you do this window will pop up and I
don't know if you guys can see it on
YouTube oh my yeah I think I just
swallowed up frigging flyer some of them
oh my anyways there's it looks like a
crosshair not my cursor but it looks
like a crosshair is on this dude's head
right here and oh one second you drink a
water oh man why did it suddenly get
like incredibly dry in my house anyways
so what this point is is every image or
every object has a default origin point
and you know that this is the
point because whenever the user like
swivels around this is the pivot point
where they swivel around now by default
the spawn object which is a bullet it
gets spun at this origin point so what
we need to do is we actually need to
build another point on this object and
say hey now you're going to spawn from
there so move this to the side a little
bit and click this plus button right
here and this is going to add another
point to our object so now you can see
the cursor turns the little crosshairs
and just go ahead and click this
wherever you want the new point to be so
I'm going to put it right in front right
there so now we have two points for this
object we have an origin and we have an
image point and you actually want to
take note of this the origin number is
zero it's like the ID number basically
in the image point the new one which is
where you want the bullets to come from
has the image point of one right there
so just remember that the important one
we want to work with is one and now we
can close all the windows and do this in
the event sheets double click this spawn
bullet on layer 1 action which pretty
much creates your bullet and now we can
change it from image point 0 which is
the one on top of his head to one which
is the one in front of his gun now when
we click done you can see whenever we
click the mouse it spawns a bullet but
it doesn't spawn a zero on top of his
head it spawns it at 1 so let me go
ahead and run that and now you guys can
see that the bullets are indeed coming
right in front of his gun and we
actually might even want to move that
back a little bit but uh yeah that looks
a lot better
so now just go fat me some monsters and
okay so we have a couple issues like
first of all if we shoot a monster with
these bullets right now you're not even
going to kill them because we didn't
tell them to do that yet so let's go
ahead and fix that issue in the next
tutorial and we're also going to be
working with some of those cool
explosions as well so thank you guys for
watching
in the meantime if this tutorial isn't
ready yet or you feel like taking a
break go check out my website
Lucky's reward shameless plug let me
know what you think and I'll see you
