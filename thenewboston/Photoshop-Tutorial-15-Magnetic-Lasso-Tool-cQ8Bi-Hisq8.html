Photoshop tutorial and in this tutorial
I want to talk to you guys about the
magnetic lasso tool it's right under the
polygonal lasso tool so make sure you
have that selected not the basic lasso
tool and what this tool basically allows
you to do is it allows you to follow
along a certain object and it's going to
snap along the edges so this actually
works really well when there is really
good contrast in your image so for
example if you wanted to select the hair
from her shirt you see how the hair in
ur shirt are basically the same color
it's not going to be able to detect that
very well but if we want to single out
this post to note we can go ahead and do
that because the post to note is bright
yellow and it's clearly defined against
the background so in order to use this
go ahead and click on the edge of your
object and you don't want to drag just
go ahead and move your mouse and it's
going to go ahead and snap along the
edges of your selection so again don't
drag it like the lasso tool just go
ahead and click and move your mouse and
once you get to the very end click on
your starting Anchor Point right there
now once you do it's going to go ahead
and make that selection and another
thing that you can do is if you deselect
this if you have this selected instead
of going all the way to the beginning
anchor point you can actually double
click and once you double click it's
going to make a straight line from
wherever you had to that point so
basically that's how you use the
magnetic lasso tool and it's awesome for
making something with very high contrast
so now if we wanted to select the
inverse and cut we can go ahead and do
that and we can have that post a note
singled out now just so I showed you
guys a good example let me show you guys
where this wouldn't be a great example
here is a photo of my puppy old Dan he's
a little bit order now but if we wanted
to use the tool right here as you can
see at the very beginning the image
right here has a lot of the same colors
so though I don't even know what this is
a piece of wood or the bed is kind of
the same color as its fur and with these
shadows right here as you can see it's
kind
working but the lasso tool is getting
confused really easily so if your image
has a lot of the same colors like Browns
in the background in the foreground you
probably want to stick with the basic
lasso tool but for tools that are I mean
excuse me for images that are very high
in contrast and you want to select a
certain portion of it the magnetic lasso
tool is easily your best bet because it
makes it so much easier you don't have
to concentrate so much on moving your
hand perfectly where you want it to but
for now thank you guys for watching and
in the next tutorial I'm probably going
to be covering the polygonal lasso tool
it's going to be awesome
so I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
