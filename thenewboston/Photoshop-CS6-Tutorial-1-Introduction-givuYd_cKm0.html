your very first Photoshop cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and I'm
going to be teaching you a slew of
Photoshop tutorials over the next couple
months maybe however long it takes me to
get the tutorials done the first thing I
wanted to start off with you is
introducing what Photoshop cs6 actually
does and what it is so it's a graphic
design and image enhancement program and
it runs on the Windows and the Mac
platform so you can use it on both now
Photoshop cs6 and it basically any
Photoshop version is pretty much the
industry standard for graphic design and
photo enhancement you can combine
graphic design and photo enhancement
together to create something called a
photo manipulation and that's also
another thing that you can do in
Photoshop so it's great for standalone
graphics and now you can even create
sets of graphics to put into an
animation it's really cool and I'll be
teaching all this stuff throughout the
series
you know Photoshop is used in a lot of
studios throughout Hollywood New York
City like London and all the big hubs
and it's also used in even like little
small areas because the user usability
of it actually is pretty easy anybody
can learn how to use it and it doesn't
it cost a decent amount of money but
it's not so expensive that people can't
use it or can't buy it like some other
like compositing programs and things
that are visual effects programs so it's
a very popular program and I'm sure most
almost everybody has heard of Photoshop
now my experience with Photoshop comes
from I went to call it a couple colleges
that used photos
shop and I worked in the industry out in
Los Angeles and used Photoshop to work
on commercials indie movies and some
actual Triple A blockbuster movies and
you can check out my profile on me pull
it up make sure I have the right stuff
up you can check out my profile on
Bucky's room and I'll pull that up for
you in a second here you go and if you
ever have any questions or anything like
that
you can message me on here through the
private messenger and this just launched
not too long ago and it has the old
forum in here where we can talk about
Photoshop together or if we want here's
the Photoshop section doesn't have much
in it yet but I'm sure it'll have a lot
of posts after I start creating the
tutorials and everything so Photoshop
you want to be pretty well-versed in it
so you can make some really awesome
things and you can show off your work to
pretty much everybody and they'll think
it's awesome so thanks for watching this
tutorial it wasn't like but it wasn't
like a tutorial but more of like an
introduction to actually what use what
Photoshop is used for so I thank you for
watching this and subscribe to keep
updated on the next set of tutorials
that we're going to be having if you
want to learn about Photoshop cs6 so
thank you for watching have a good one
