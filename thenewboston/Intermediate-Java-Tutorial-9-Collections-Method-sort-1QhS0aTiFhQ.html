to your ninth intermediate Java tutorial
and in this is aura we're going to be
going over a little more about lists in
generic collections and we're actually
going to be talking about collection
methods now I already went over how to
convert a list to an array and how like
add and delete elements and stuff like
that well I want to tell you guys in
this tutorial aside from just adding and
deleting elements in the list you can
also perform methods on a list just like
you can two arrays um and this is pretty
much all of these methods or most of
them come from the collection class so
they can be applied to any collection so
let's go ahead and um the best way to
learn it is of course demonstrate it so
let's go ahead and make a string array
first and I'll name it crap and let's go
ahead and just uh fill in you know like
five things maybe so let's go ahead and
first put apples lemons it doesn't
matter if you spell it right around
geese and don't ask me where I'm
thinking of the stuff bacon and YouTube
so you try to think of five things fast
and uh yeah anyways like I was saying so
now we have an array so what we want to
do is convert it to a list so the
easiest way to do this for testing
purposes is go ahead and put list and
put a string because that's what really
each string are you serious and go ahead
and name it
l1 because I don't feel like typing out
list because that takes more time those
three characters and you know I got
stuff to do tonight so arrays dot as
list and for our parameter put crap is
your parameter so now we have a list
made of l1 and it pretty much takes the
array and converts it to a list real
quick nice quick and dirty wet way so
now what can we do well as I said before
we can call methods from the collection
class to apply to our list and again we
can't do this to an array so we can only
do it to a list so that's why we need to
make l1 so obviously in order to get
methods from the collections class
collections dot and the first method I'm
going to tell you about is sort and what
this does is it takes a list and it
sorts it in alphabetical order so as
your argument of course you pass what
lists you want to sort out so now this
actually modifies the list it's just not
for display only it actually sorts the
list itself so let's go ahead and do
system.out.print on let's do printf and
as our two parameters for the first one
we need to put the format which would be
percent string and just go ahead and put
a new line in there because we're going
to be doing stuff out through this and
just go ahead and pass l1 now here's the
cool thing
instead of putting like a variable you
can just put an entire list as one
string and it'll pass it in and to print
it out so let's go ahead and run this
first and as you see my original one was
apples lemons geese bacon YouTube's not
in alphabetical order and now once we
sort it it goes Apple bacon geese lemons
YouTube in alphabetic order so the point
of this tutorial is not how to get
things in Hell petticord or it's just so
you can realize that you can actually
call methods from the collections I mean
that's the class that everything is
inheriting from and you can actually use
these collection methods they're called
to change a collection in this case a
list so let's go ahead and do one more
and once you do one more it's going to
get stuck in your head
so let's actually do soar again but if
you're wondering alright if I know how
to sort in this order and this is either
ascending or descending order but I
don't know I just up by let's see
ascending let's see sort I don't know
ascending descending but anyways if you
ever want to sort it in the opposite way
what you need to do is since this is an
overloaded method you can pass it in
either one parameter or two parameters
if it only has one parameter assaults at
regulary if it has two parameters it
looks at the second parameter and says
all right since he passed me in this
information he's going to give me a
special way to sort this so collections
dot reverse it should be in here right
there reverse order and what this is
going to do
as the as you pass in the second
parameter of how to sort it it's pretty
much this the sort method takes what do
you want to sort how do you want to sort
they're done talking so now let's go
ahead and print this out right here copy
because I mean no need to type it all
again and run it and here's what we got
I move this little butt apples bacon
geese lemons YouTube so here's our
original list sorted and now it's going
to take that new list and sort that in
reverse order so I got YouTube lemons
geese bacon apples so that's the basics
of how to use collection methods and
again these are methods that you can use
the any collection and in this case we
use it on the list and again sort isn't
the only method I'll probably going over
some more useful methods that you can do
and I mean well that's pretty much it
for the story I don't really want to
teach you guys anything else kin kind of
long so for now just want to thank you
guys for watching don't forget subscribe
and I'll see you next door</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
