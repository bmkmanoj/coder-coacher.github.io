another PI OpenGL with PI game tutorial
video from send X for Bucky in the new
Boston where we left off we've pretty
much run through the perspective
translate rotate look what those can do
and modify for you and now I just want
to run through the importance of
vertices and edges and to do that we're
gonna go ahead and turn back on this
rotate function so let's just run that
real quick and see it so now it rotates
our cube gives us a better idea of you
know basically a lot of parameters of
this cube so we've got that back on and
we're now going to let's say we instead
of 0-3 we drew this one to 0-6 okay so
we just might buy a single edge and
where it draws so now you can see that
it basically it changed where it drew
that line right this is supposed to go
from here to here right but instead it
drew to a different different number
conversely the other thing that we can
do is something like that let's just try
to mess it up right so basically just
like Miss placing all of these lovely
lines but so that's that that's why that
obviously matters okay leave that on and
then we're going to come up to our
vertices here and what if we do this as
a negative 5 and this as a 3 now we have
ourselves a relatively ugly cube it's
like a stretched-out cube so obviously
that's why obviously those matter
and finally order so what if we took
this vertices
cut and paste it down here and we took
this one and we cut and pasted it up
here do we have a yes sir so that's good
you would see that we have this really
strange-looking thing it still resembles
a square right because we have all the
necessary vertices right they're all
there it's just the order
that we're drawing and connecting all
the lines is not quite right so so
anyways those are that's like the
importance here of of this and the
orders so now the next thing I want to
go ahead and have us talk about well
first of all let's fix this okay
save and run there real quick beautiful
right my eyes are playing tricks on me
now I'm like oh that's not right now
okay so now one of the things I want to
show you guys is like interacting right
now so like right now we have this
rotate function and it's rotating our
cube for us and it like this is like the
iconic you know showing of 3d graphics
you you make a cube and you spin it
around but generally think that's not
really that cool and again this is
doable in 2d this could all be 2d and we
could do with this in PI game right
because it's just drawing each frame
what what makes a 3d environment shine
is when we change perspective in in the
rendering right so we can prove that
okay this really is like a 3d
environment so we'll start that in this
video and then we'll kind of build on it
in the coming videos but so we've got
while true this is our van loop quit and
now we want to do is learn a new thing
with PI game and that is your mouse
wheel so we remember when we were doing
clicks and I said well you get the left
right in the middle click not the wheel
but the click of that mouse wheel you
can't actually get the actual rolling of
a mouse wheel it's called a mouse button
up or down and it's mouse buttons 4 &amp;amp; 5
so 4 is forward 5 is reverse so for
example we'll just ask if event diet
type equals PI game dot Mouse
oops mouse button down print let's just
go ahead and print event die button well
we can also print event and then that's
also print event diet we'll do it in my
button so let's even to run that and
here we have this and we click so like a
click is a one right click three in this
middle mouse wheel is a 2 and a 4 and
then if we pull this up here and we
scroll forward that's a 4 right button
number 4 it also gives us the position
but we don't really care about that
right now but like for example if you're
on like like a mapping fun yeah map sort
of game or something you obviously want
to zoom where the mouse is while it's
zooming so that's how they get away from
that and then zoom back button 5 ok so
that's how we can at least in our game
we're not gonna be too worried about the
position of the mouse we're just
concerned that he's he's scrolling in or
out so that's how you can access that
data and then in the next video I'll
show you how we can actually use that
data to zoom in and out of our actual PI
game instance so let's go ahead and
close out of this and we'll continue on
in the next video so as always stay
tuned for that and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
