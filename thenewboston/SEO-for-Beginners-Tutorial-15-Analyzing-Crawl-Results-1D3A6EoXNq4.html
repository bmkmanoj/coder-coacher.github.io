have duplicate content on multiple pages
so by duplicate content I don't just
mean the actual text content right here
I mean the headings the titles so for
all of these video pages whether it was
this one about cooking or you know
whether it was uh like this one about
Java game development if all of the
titles were just the New Boston tutorial
then that would be awful that's not
something that you want to do so good in
general you don't want to duplicate
content and those include the titles the
meta description your h1 titles and of
course the actual content if you just
have a bunch of pages that are exactly
the same that'll be kind of stupid
anyways but yeah that's what that is so
same thing like before what you can do
is you can scroll down and look at every
single page that is scanned so these
little warning signs right here they
break it up in the title description
heading content it may say hey whenever
you see warning too that means that to
other pages well actually just two pages
have the same title
for your videos health page nine other
pages have the same title as this so if
you're wondering ah right let me go to
my health section right here so you're
telling me that nine pages have the same
title video tutorials I wonder what
other pages they are let's try to fix
this if you just hover over this then
it's gonna give me a bunch of numbers 2
4 5 7 8 9 what these are are they
indicate the rows that have the same
title so we can see that okay the math
page has the same title
the beauty page has the same title they
all just say video tutorials so again
that's duplicate content that's
something that I definitely want to fix
and ideally every single one of these
things should be a green checkmark if
all of them are green checkmarks then I
mean that's pretty awesome actually so I
mean it's probably a rare that you can
actually do that but if you can oh man
I'm getting excited just thinking about
it alright let's go ahead and hop
over two page analysis so page analysis
this is actually a pretty good place to
start to see what is wrong with every
single page so it actually breaks it up
for you into critical errors and also
warnings whenever you start you know
finding a bunch of SEO problems with
your site and you want to fix them
always fix the critical errors first
whenever you fix these they're gonna
give you the biggest boost in your
search engine results and these warnings
are slightly smaller issues they're
still important but again and these are
gonna give you the most the biggest
improvement the most improvements how do
you say it how do you talk how does a
language work all right
then of course warning second now
another thing is whenever you're
thinking all right I have a huge list of
stuff I have to work on where do I begin
you always want to begin with the most
popular we're most important pages first
so again whenever I'm fixing a bunch of
these issues I'm not just gonna go to
some random forum page and start working
on you know SEO for this as my number
one priority no I'm gonna go to either
you know the home page of the forum or
the videos pages or the home page for my
website the most important pages that
get the most traffic you wanna work on
first so again for each page it tells
you the number of errors what kinds of
errors there are so on and so forth so
that's what page analysis is pretty much
breaking down your problems page by page
now external links this is essentially
an overview of all the outgoing or
external links now on my website all of
the links I just have linking to other
web pages on my same website but if I
had a link to like Twitter Facebook or I
don't know like my Google+ or anything
like that then I would have some data
right here so for this example not much
to show you but you know it's useful if
you do an architecture again if you have
a lot of sub directories a lot of my
pages right here or just stemming off
the main directory like video
this is just a file in the main
directory however the forum once you
start going in here this would be a
subdirectory so if you have a lot of sub
directories like this as you can see
then it's going to give you a little
better visual overview but again like I
said most of my pages are just linked in
that same home root directory so if I
were to scan my entire website I would
get a little bit more of a spider but
there you go so that is the overview of
crawls basically a way that you can
crawl your entire website or a bunch of
web pages at once so definitely very
useful and in the upcoming tutorials
I'll show you guys the rest of this
stuff and it's actually really cool so
I'll see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
