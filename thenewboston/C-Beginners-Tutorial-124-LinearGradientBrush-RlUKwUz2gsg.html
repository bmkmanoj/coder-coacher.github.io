tutorial but I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to draw with a
gradient so for this tutorial we're
going to need to have a panel and you're
going to need to create an event handler
so that when the user clicks on the
panel you create new graphics for your
panels so they have a place to draw and
you're also going to need to use a using
statement to use the system dot drawing
drawing 2d namespace because the brush
that we're gonna be using in this
tutorial is located in there alright so
up until now the only things that we've
been using to draw with is the solid
brush and the pen well today we're going
to be looking at the linear gradient
brush which will allow us to draw with a
gradient so of course um that we're just
gonna want to do is create a new
instance of the linear gradient brush so
just a linear gradient brush I'll called
LGB for the new gradient brush and study
commit to a new linear gradient brush
the first argument that a calls for is a
point to start at I'm looking to have it
start at 1 1 so it's going to start a
new point here 20 points and this is
where it will end and we're just gonna
have it end at 20 70 and since we're
only messing with a lie it will be a
vertical gradient I'm gonna say new
point and obviously if you wanted it to
be a horizontal gradient you make it
like 70 20 year only mess of the X so
the next argument that it calls for is
the starting color and we're gonna have
it start with red so just a color dot
red and the next color that we're going
to use is the end color so color that
will end with or doesn't have any yellow
so I'm going to say color
all right so basically the gradient will
start at 20 o'clock then it will move
down and eventually turn into yellow so
we'll start with red and then move down
an end with yellow so now in order to
see this gradient we're gonna have to
paint with this brush so we're going to
create a new rectangle and paint with it
so this will say G filled rectangle
we're going to be using our linear
gradient brush shooter so just going to
say LGB and then we're just going to
pass through the coordinates and the
size of our rectangle and we're gonna
have it start at 2020 so that that's
where the gradient started so it'll be
perfect and we're gonna have it be fifty
five fifty so that like it started six
twenty and ended 70 so it'll just be
perfect they'll fit right within the
gradient so now you debug here and click
we should see it starts with red and
ends with yellow yep and if we wanted to
make the a horizontal gradient we're
just going to change or messed with the
X so we're going to say instead of it
starting it 20/20 and ending at 2070
we're going to have it start at 2020 and
end at seventy twenty so we'll move
along the x-axis yep and if you wanted
to make it like die ignore something
then we'll just have it start here well
the start at 2020 and ended 70 70 so now
it should just be a vertebral gradient
yep
all right and we can obviously draw with
other shapes we don't just have to use a
rectangle so if we wanted it to fill a
circle and we could do that as well
we'll just have it I store among your
ingredient brush here live it start I
guess this one
and at 70 arming the 50/50 so cool and
you're right where the linear gradient
Russians yep as you can see there's a
greeting in that as well and if we went
over this or something like that it
would just simply the yellow passed
there so you mean it like a hundred by a
hundred that it is not gonna see the
gradient anymore like yeah it just gets
all messed up all right so that's pretty
much it for this tutorial on drawing
ingredients so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
