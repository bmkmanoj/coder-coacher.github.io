this is buddy Blackford here with
another Photoshop cs6 tutorial today
we're going to learn how to create and
save your customized gradients awesome
so the way we're going to start out with
this is make sure you have your gradient
tool is selected here if you can't find
it it's underneath the paint bucket tool
if the paint bucket tool is selected so
go ahead select that now click on the
thumbnail here of your gradient and this
brings us to the gradient editor we've
got a whole bunch of presets here and if
you're missing these go ahead and click
on this gear here this is your options
go to reset gradients and then hit OK
and it'll reset it so that you have
these gradients know you are able to
edit your gradient here as you can see
so go ahead and select the gradient that
you want it that resembles close to what
you want so I'm going to go ahead and
pick this black and white one the next
thing you're going to do is you're going
to name your gradient and name it
whatever it's going to be not what it is
right now so we're going to do stupid
rainbow that's what we're going to call
it now what you don't want to do is you
don't want to hit new because it's going
to save this with all these options i
have here you want to hit new when you
have your gradient finalized so we've
got greedy entipy here we're going to go
solid or we're gonna go noise and you
can see what noise does here but most of
the time you're going to stick with
solid it's the easiest the next thing
that we're going to do is we've got the
smoothness here and the smoothness can
go from zero to one hundred percent and
then it just determines how smoothly the
colors of the gradient blend together so
that's just what smoothness is so if I
bring it down them great the colors
aren't going to blend with each other
that well but um alright let's go i'm
going to go ahead and change this back
to stupid rainbow because i changed it
because of the noise and now we're going
to start messing with some
the colors here now you messaged you use
the colors down here at the bottom so if
i double if i click on this color here i
can click on the color down here and
then use my color picker to pick a color
that I that I wanted to use so this one
looks like it's out of the range hit OK
and now we've got our color that I want
to use and my other color down here is
white so I'm going to select that and
change that color to something else I
want to use like maybe this green let's
make a break green so now we go from red
to green and this is how our gradient
works out now we can add other colors in
between as well if we just go to where
my finger or where the cursor goes into
a finger and click you drop down another
marker where you can also drag it around
and put it in the area where you want
your next we when you're wanting you
next color to be so I'll bring in like a
blue here and now we've got it going
from red to blue to green now if you
don't want that there you can just click
on it and drag it right off and it'll go
away so that's how you do that one thing
I wanted you to see or notice is that
there's these little diamonds here if I
click those and drag them it's going to
change where the gradient are how
quickly the gradient goes from one color
to the other color depending on what
side to draw drag that towards and you
can use ctrl Z to bring it back to where
it was before in the middle if you
really need to so to get off those click
on a different color and have those
different you can select the different
colors and it will show what is in
between them with these diamonds their
location here you can set that I'll set
this to like eighty percent and you can
see that it goes to where eighty percent
would be on the gradient so if I put
this as zero percent it's going to be in
the beginning you can see this one's at
forty-nine percent so if I want to in
the eggs
back middle so this is how you do things
precisely there you go now it's at fifty
percent so if you need to do things
precisely you would and had four colors
0 25 50 75 and then 100 so that would be
actually five colors but you guys get
the idea so so you're probably wondering
what these Black Rose up here do now
these black rose up here are for the
opacity and if I click on one of those
I'm able to change the opacity and the
stop that i have here that's what these
are called and if i change this down to
zero you can see that the opacity is
gone now and now it goes to wear this
other stop is here so that's where the
opacity goes so it works just like the
colors but with opacity so if i wanted
to i could bring another one up here and
make this a hundred percent and the two
edge 10 percent and then I get a this
would be like ideal for something like a
gradient or radial gradient where I
could emanate out and gradually get
gradually go out to a transparent
gradient it's good for blending stuff in
so when you are done and then you have
the gradient than you want go ahead and
hit okay oh I didn't name it again I
changed I never catch it when it's
changing on me stupid rainbow and then
I'll hit new and now you can see that it
is down there so if I go ahead and hit
OK and try to use my gradient let's put
it on radio and bring it out you can see
what it makes so this is how to make the
your own custom gradients and that's
pretty much it for that part now if you
want to save your gradient as a preset
click on it and then hit save and it'll
save your gradients for you there so
that's easy enough and then if you want
to load those gradients back up just
click on load and I bring
get to where your gradients actually are
so that's easy enough it is the same as
with any of your preset editors like
your brush or anything like that so just
remember that and that's all there is to
creating your gradients and now you guys
have a lot more control over using
gradients and opacity of your gradients
and things like that so I hope you guys
learned something and I look forward to
seeing you guys in the next tutorial see
you guys later have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
