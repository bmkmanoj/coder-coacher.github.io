welcome to your 32nd chemistry tutorial
and in this tutorial we're going to
start talking about chemical reactions
now chemical reactions are a little bit
different than nuclear reactions in the
sense that we aren't messing with the
nucleus at all
we aren't changing any of the elements
themselves we're just changing how they
are bonded together basically so this is
pretty cool in the sense that we can't
make any bombs orally but we can't make
new types of fuels drugs medicines
that's what they typically use these for
so let's go ahead and start with well I
guess I might as well say this before I
begin the process whenever I write this
is still the same as a nuclear reaction
we start with the reactants and we draw
our little arrow that's a terrible arrow
right there
could give a nice sharp point and we end
up with products so pretty much the
reactants are what you start out with in
the products are what you get at the end
and another thing that was I don't even
know if I talked about this whenever I
was talking about nuclear reactions but
I also have something called the
coefficient now if you have something
like two co2
this thing right here this two is called
the coefficient now the coefficient
pretty much means how much of each
molecule there is for example the
difference between co2 into co2 if you
just write co2 this would mean you would
have one carbon and two oxygens however
if you wrote two co2 it would mean you
have two of this so in other words you
would have two carbons and four oxygens
you see how that works so anyways if you
don't see then once I do a couple
examples then you guys are going to know
what I'm talking about so let's go ahead
and start with a couple terms that I'm
going to be saying thrown around a
couple times so I might as well explain
you guys what they mean right here
exothermic is a reaction where heat is
given off one of the products is heat
now endothermic is when heat is absorbed
for example you may have to add heat to
get a chemical reaction started and
absorb some that he
now activation energy as we can see the
amount of energy you need to start the
reaction and this is because in order
for chemicals to react they need to bump
into each other you can't just have some
carbon in Rhode Island and some oxygen
in Texas and expect them to form a
chemical reaction the molecules actually
need to collide with each other so they
can break each other's bonds form new
bonds and all that good stuff so heat or
activation energy or kinetic energy can
make this happen because whenever you
have heat stuff starts moving around
bumping into each other and once they
hit each other once they collide they
can break each other's bonds and that's
what starts the chemical reaction now
another thing I want to mention is that
aside from just having the energy the
molecules must also hit each other in
the right spots for example say that you
have some I'm not even gonna you know
make a molecule I'm just going to put
like if you had a molecule - and a
molecule 3 and they were bonded together
now this molecule one was going to come
in and react with this thing right here
well it needs to collide in just the
right spot for example it could go ahead
and hit number 2 and whenever it did hit
number 2 there may be a reaction however
if it hit I don't know let's say if it
hit number 3 right here there would be
no reaction so aside from just that
initial energy you also need the
molecules to hit in just the right spots
in order for a chemical reaction to take
place so there are actually a bunch of
different types of chemical reactions
and I'm going to be talking guys through
all the different types of reactions and
I'm going to start with something called
a combination reaction now this is
arguably the most simple chemical
reaction all it is is you take two or
more reactants or starting stuff and it
forms a single product so pretty much
you're combining two different things in
order to form a single thing pretty
weird huh so let's go ahead and take a
look at example say you have
- H - and you combine it with Oh - what
you can form let me go ahead and fix my
arrow is two molecules of water now
remember I talked to you guys about the
coefficients and I'll talk to you guys
about balancing a chemical equation
later on which pretty much means make
sure you have the same amount of stuff
on this side is on this side but if you
guys just cannot wait then I'll go ahead
and talk you guys through it so we
already know that h2o is water and this
is hydrogen and this is oxygen so I
don't need a you know tell you guys what
we're making here but in order to make
sure that this is you know a sensible
chemical reaction that is actually valid
we need to go ahead and balance this so
what we do is we make sure that all of
the molecules on the left hand side
equal the sum of all the molecules on
the right hand side we just can't start
with like six hydrogen's and eight
oxygen and end up with like two hydrogen
and 27 oxygen we can't destroy or create
stuff it needs to be balanced on the
left and right hand side so in order to
do that remember - h2 pretty much means
two of these h2 in other words h4 we got
four atoms of hydrogen now there's no
coefficient on the o2 which means we
just have two atoms of oxygen now if we
go ahead and take a look at the final
product we have two h2o which pretty
much means we have two H 2 so H 4 4
atoms of hydrogen in two oxygen remember
if there's no number written here it's
just implied that there's a 1 so we
pretty much have two oxygen atoms so
when we look at the final it says we
have four hydrogen four hydrogen to
oxygen to oxygen there we go so now let
me go ahead and show you guys one more
quick what color did I not use have a
user red yet so let me go ahead and show
you guys one more quick example again I
told you guys about balancing chemical
reactions real quick we're going to be
talking about it more later on whenever
you get the really weird chemical
reactions but for now we're just talking
about combination reactions how we can
start with
two things and they can combine to form
one thing in this example or excuse me
two molecules of water h2o so say we
have two sulfur atoms so two s now two
sulfur atoms can combine with 3 o2
molecules in Oh 2 is just um it's pretty
much two oxygens bonded together and
this could form to so3 now so3 is
sulphur trioxide and if we go ahead and
balance the reaction real quick we can
see that okay we have two s which pretty
much means we have two sulfur atoms we
have 3 o2 which pretty much means we
have 6 oxygen atoms and on this side we
have 2 s and remember when there's no
subscript here it just implied that
there's one so have we have 2 sulfur and
we have two pretty much this is three
oxygen atoms bonded together and we have
two of them so in other words we have
six total oxygen atoms so if we go ahead
and look on the left side two sulfur two
sulfur and on again the left side six
oxygens and on the right side six
oxygens so we're good to go and that's
the basics beyond you know balancing
chemical reactions it should be pretty
self-explanatory I probably didn't even
need to talk you guys through but if you
guys were lost and didn't understand the
difference between a coefficient and a
subscript then there you go so anyways
thank you guys for watching don't forget
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next tutorial where we're going to be
talking about all the different types of
chemical reactions there are a lot more
aside from combination reactions so
that's what we have to look forward to
thank you guys for watching and I will
see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
