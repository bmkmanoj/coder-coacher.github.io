11th Photoshop tutorial and in this
video I'm going to be teaching guys
about the ruler guides pretty sweet
because you know lasa toriel we learned
about the ruler now that we're expert
with that it's time to move on to
something a little more interesting so
what is a ruler guide a ruler guide is
basically a checkpoint or it's pretty
much a guy that allows you to visualize
exactly where a certain location is so
in order to better demonstrate this the
first thing we need to do is we need to
view our rulers so go ahead up to view
and make sure that you have a checkbox
next to rulers what this is going to do
is it's going to give you a ruler on the
very top and on the left-hand side of
your working area and if you aren't in
pixels right now just go ahead and
right-click the ruler and change it from
inches or whatever you're onto pixels I
just like working with pixels because I
don't know I think they're pretty cool
so how do we get a ruler guide well it's
simple we just go up to the ruler and
with our mouse left click and drag a
ruler guide out to wherever we want it
so say that I'm just measuring I don't
know the area of my face go ahead and
release and whenever we do that we
create a ruler guide that's this little
neon blue fluorescent lime lookin thing
this is pretty much a guy that says hey
you wanted a line at 47 pixels this is
it so now if we wanted a line right here
around like 330 pixels just go ahead and
grab another one drag it down release
and the cool little thing is a blob
tells you exactly where you're going to
drop it release and there you go now you
can also do this with the vertical one
again hover over the little ruler here
click drag and release so now we got the
distance for my face exactly where we
want it to be now this is useful like I
said whenever you want to find out a
specific distance and its really helpful
whenever you're making logos not that
useful whenever you just have a picture
of Bucky as a baby screaming but you
know for demonstration purposes this
will do just fine now another thing I
you guys is what happens whenever you
want to move these roller guides so say
that okay my face on this left hand side
is you know where I want it to be but I
actually want this left a couple picture
pixels because I don't want to cut off
my ear well what he can do is you can
select the move tool or just press V on
your keyboard and hover over the ruler
guide now you know that you're going to
hover over it because once you do your
cursor is going to change from an arrow
to a double sided arrow now just go
ahead and drag to wherever you want it
to be and this is basically adjusting
your previous ruler guide so we can go
ahead and adjust all these if we want
more of my face in the guide and once we
have our guide set what you generally
want to do is you want to lock your guys
into place why is that it's because your
move tool the one we have right now is
one of the most commonly used tools so
first sit in moving stuff around okay we
don't accidentally want to bump one of
these guides so in order to lock your
guides into place
go to view lock guides and BAM now as
you can see we no longer can adjust our
guides pretty sweet however once you're
done in order to get rid of your guides
this is how you clear all of your guides
because you know these lines are useful
but you don't want them there all the
time just go to view clear guides and it
gets rid of all your guides now the last
thing I want to talk about is this say
that you have I'm just going to make two
ruler guys real quick a really guy right
here and right here
now they call them ruler guides because
whenever you're using your ruler tool it
helps you guide your ruler tool so your
ruler too of course makes lines and
whenever you select the line starting
point here you can come up here and as
you can see it doesn't just you know
hover over it it actually snaps to your
guide if you look really closely snaps
right there so now you can go ahead and
move left and right in your line is
going to guide be guided along right
here now this is useful whenever you
want to you know just move the end
ruler to a certain place because if we
tried to do it with just your cursor
it's very difficult to go left and right
perfectly you're usually off by a little
a few pixels but anyways I won't go into
too much detail because I know rulers
aren't the most interesting thing in
Photoshop but now that you guys know how
to use ruler guides and you know how to
work with them a little bit you can now
pat yourself on the back congratulations
so thank you guys for watching this
video and in the next video um well it's
gonna be awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
