what we did is we created our very first
app and we named it music now whenever
Django created this app it gave us a few
files and a directory by default now
before we go on to the kind of fun part
of the story I just want to give you
guys a brief overview of what all of
these files are so like a real quick
summary
so migrations what migrations are are
basically a way that you can hook up or
connect your website all of your source
code with your database now if you guys
are like oh that sounds kind of tough
and it's probably going to be annoying
it is one of the easiest things ever and
it's one of my favorite parts about
Django you basically type one line real
quick in the command prompt and it's
hooked up it's awesome can't wait to
show you guys in it that py we already
know what that is
it basically says hey Python you see
this directory it's not just a normal
directory it's actually a package so you
know just something for Python and min
so whenever they're creating Django they
realize that almost every website in the
world it has an admin section a section
that you can go and like access that
base and delete users and delete posts
whatever you want to do so instead of
having to make it yourself it already
has that admin functionality so that's
what this is and there's a lot more to
it but that's basically what it is
apps this file is just again there's a
lot more to it but it's pretty much the
configuration file or settings for this
app and right now we don't have a lot of
settings it says the name of it is music
ah all right there we go so thank you
Django for letting me know that alright
so the next one is models so a model is
basically a blueprint for your database
so it's a template of how you are going
to store data for this app so real quick
let's go ahead and think about how we
are going to do that what do we want to
store what tables are we going to want
in the music app well we're probably
going to want one for like albums
and each album is going to need like a
title and maybe the artist and we're
probably going to want another table to
store maybe the individual songs so you
know each song of course is going to
have a title a length so on and so forth
so later on we'll create two classes in
here
one class is just going to be albums in
another class is going to be songs so
that's basically the blueprint of how
we're going to set up our database it's
going to be fun and this one right here
this test probably don't even need to
explain this you can create a bunch of
little tests to make sure that you don't
have any bugs in your code and this
views views are actually really easy
views are just functions
they're just Python functions and what
they do is they take a user request and
they give them back something now 95% of
the time these are just going to request
the webpage and you just give them a web
page like you're looking at someone's
profile they send you that HTML page you
look at a video page they send you all
those files whatever now other times it
isn't that direct like maybe these are
just wants to log out or download
something so you would perform some
action but basically views are just
Python functions that take a request
from the user and respond or get back a
response in some kind of way so once we
like create one single page all this is
going to make sense if you guys are like
oh my god there's so many files right
now but let's go ahead and just figure
out how to do something simple right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
