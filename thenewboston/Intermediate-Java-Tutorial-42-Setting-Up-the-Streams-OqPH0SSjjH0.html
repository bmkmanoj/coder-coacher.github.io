is we were pretty much sitting there and
waiting for a connection from someone
else well now we are connected to
someone else so what we need to do now
is we need to set up the streams or the
pathways of communication to and from
the other computer so in order to do
that we need to code a method called set
up streams so let's go ahead and do that
right now so underneath your wait for
connection method go ahead and make
another connection connection and what
this is going to do is you know get
stream to say name receive data so this
is of course can be private it's not
going to return anything void set up not
steams or I do want some steamed corn
right now okay set up streams and this
is going to throws ioexception all right
now okay deep breath deep breath okay
the first thing that we need to do is
well let's go ahead and set up the
output stream
now remember like I said a stream is a
way that you communicate with another
computer and you do that through streams
so output stream is the stream that
allows you to output messages output
crap to someone else so this is really
easy first of all you remember that we
coded these variables for output and
input streams right at the top output an
input stream objects so that's what
we're creating right now in case you
guys are lost so new object output
stream and as a parameter this takes
your connection so it knows you know
okay you're connected to someone what
stream in my building connection get
output stream so basically what we're
doing in this line of code is creating
the pathway that allows us to connect to
another computer
what connection or what computer do we
want to connect to
well whatever computer this socket
created so now what we want to do is now
that we have that pathway it's just good
housekeeping to do out
but flush and the reason for this is
because sometimes whenever you try to
sense not something the way that
messaging works is they have to deal
with buffers and bytes and sometimes
bytes get left over in the buffer buffer
how can I explain this sometimes data
gets left over when you try to send
something to someone else so imagine
that you know in order for you to
connect to someone else
you both have water pipes so sometimes
there's some crap leftover in the water
pipe what you want to do is flush it out
or push the rest of the crap through to
the other person that's basically what
it does um most of the time you
shouldn't have any crap left over but
just in case you want to flush the rest
of it out of your stream and send it to
the other person and again whenever I'm
talking about crap I mean bytes of
information you know just a little
analogy so the next thing we need to do
after this is now that we can send crap
away from our toilet we need to be able
to accept crap in to our toilet aka
computer so the input stream is much
like the output stream in order to set
it up new object input stream and as a
parameter it takes connection get input
stream right like that so this is how
you set up the pathways to send things
out and this is how you set up the
pathway to receive stuff from someone
else and buy stuff I mean the messages
that you guys are sending so now that
our streams are set up and by the way
they don't have to set up or you can't
set up a flush right here because only
they can flush your toilet or only they
can push bytes through their computer so
whenever they code their program um they
have to flush the rest of their crap to
you you can't you know reach over to
their house flush it to you only they
can do that so that's why you know I
only put a flush on ours our output and
not on their input but anyways once your
streams are set up then what you need to
do is just give you guys a nice little
prompt show message
just say you know what your streams are
now set up so we'll do that right now uh
I'll just something stupid streams are
now set up and there you go so again the
only errors we should have right now is
this show message a little method that
we didn't create yet but basically like
I said all it does is display a message
on your screen so again what we did so
far is we created two methods we now can
wait for a connection and once a
connection is made with someone else we
can set up the streams which basically
sets up the pathway to connect to
someone else in case whenever we send a
message some crap gets left behind just
push it through to them just good
housekeeping in Java and we also set up
the pathway where they can send messages
to us now once everything is set up then
I'm just going to go ahead and output a
message on the screen that says you know
what streams are now set up you can now
go ahead and start having a conversation
with them and that's what we're going to
be doing in the next video coding this
method while chatting which is actually
a pretty in-depth method it's the code
that allows you to have the actual you
know messaging chatting session with
them so thank you guys for watching
number get to subscribe and I'll see you
guys the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
