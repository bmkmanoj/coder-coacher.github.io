buddy Blackford here with another fun
after effects cs6 tutorial and in this
tutorial we're going to learn how to
animate some more motion graphics like
text and typography to make it come
flying from off the screen into the
screen and how to do it correctly so it
looks like appealing to the eye so this
is what we're gonna make real quick and
I'll start from scratch once you are and
I'll delete this out and start from
scratch and it's just text that's flying
in and it's como estas
and you know the rest and this little
guy here I just made myself and I stole
the trophies and the rest of it will
throw on and you can see how when
everything comes in it like kind of like
bounces at the end so that's more
visually pleasing if you didn't notice
it that's good that means I was doing my
job so well if you're looking for it as
a visual effects artist or motion
graphics artist you want to make sure
that you have that in so it doesn't look
like it's just slamming it there and
stopping which doesn't look very real so
I'll show you how to do this and we'll
start from scratch so I'll just turn
turn these layers off and what I did was
I grabbed a color scheme from cooler so
if you just type in cooler and I Google
it'll pop up and you can steel color
schemes from there it's not stealing
they're available for everybody so what
I did is I made my background out of
this green which f I turn this off there
is a green and just use these other ones
for my text so let's go ahead and create
a new text and we'll do Como first so it
comes out like this because this is how
I had my text at first so I've got KH em
er UI is the font family and then I set
it to bold
now I'm going to change the color here -
no I don't want to change that color I
want to change that
I want to change the fill color here -
though - the orange and then I'm going
to change the stroke color to purple and
it kind of gives it like an outline pop
more poppy effect with having the stroke
color on there and my stroke is let's
see what it's set to my stroke is set to
round so you come down to line join and
hit round and it'll be set to round if
you have miter on it's gonna be square
and that doesn't really go with what I'm
trying to do with the stroke and
everything so let's go back to round and
what I'm gonna do is duplicate this by
holding I'm gonna delete everything else
out here that I don't want delete all
that stuff so I've got this here I'm
gonna duplicate it and just bring it
down hold shift and bring it drag it
down and this one's gonna be estas como
estas means what's up and Spanish I'm
gonna make that different color make
that that red I don't know if these are
the exact colors I used in my other one
in the right order but then we're gonna
make our next one here control duplicate
ctrl D is duplicate bring this down
and I don't want to swear but you guys
know what that is
since I have a little star here it means
I'm not swearing and then I'll highlight
this and change the fill color here by
using my dropper to this color up here
hit OK and then we've got our colors
here and now I can talk turn my color
scheme off and we've got our text here
sorry for zooming in all over the place
now we can increase the size
what's a zoom out so we can figure out
what's going on increase the size here
that's probably good I just increase the
scale and I did them all at the same
time by selecting them all and
increasing the scale pressing s for
scale hmm move them all over at once to
the right because we know we're gonna
bring in our little Mexican guy and
bring these up I'm gonna press I'm gonna
hold shift and press the up arrow to go
up incremental e here and I'm gonna do
that exam with this one and I just went
down two spaces each now let's bring in
our Mexican guy here and what I did is I
just I just made this guy in Photoshop I
just found the trollface and just put a
hat around him and drew a mustache on
him let's bring him in and we'll scale
this way down cuz it comes in huge
that's about good and now it's time that
we need to animate this so we're gonna
animate this on the z axis
in 3d space so let's create a camera
layer new camera and the default 50
millimeter is good for us we're gonna
turn our layers into 3d layers now so
that's good
lock your background layer so you don't
click on it by accident and move the
background layer because that always
happens is really annoying let's start
animating these on the z-axis so let's
start with Como here which is gonna be a
is at the bottom and let's open on our
position and we don't want to affect X&amp;amp;Y
at all we just want to affect a Z so
what I'm gonna do is click on position
then right click on it and click on
separate dimensions now we don't have to
worry about animating X&amp;amp;Y while the Z is
being moved</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
