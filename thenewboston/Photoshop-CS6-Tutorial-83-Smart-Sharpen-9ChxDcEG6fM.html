tutorial everyone my name is body
Blackford and today let's go over the
smart sharpen filter and this is a
really good sharpening filter that you
can use to attempt to refocus blurry
images or sharpen the edges of blurry
images and one of the cool things about
the smart sharpen filter is that you can
remove some effects or some filters that
you've added on like the Gaussian blur
or Gaussian however you like to say it
the or a lens blur or motion blur and it
has filter or it has like a drop-down
menu in there that you can use to get
rid of that stuff so let's go ahead and
look at how this works
so let's duplicate our background layer
that way we have something to compare
the effect to so we can compare it to
like the original image let's go to
filter and we're going to apply the
smart sharpen to it without adding a
like Gaussian blur or anything like that
so let's just stay on the basic tab and
make sure you have your preview button
checked so we can see what's going on in
the main picture and I'll put this over
here so we can see what's going on now
the amount here is just the amount of
sharpness that's applied to the image
and usually a hundred percent is pretty
good and then the radius here you can
determine the width determine the width
of the sharpening effect so bring this
back down to zero and let's bring this
down to zero so we can see what's going
on and I'm going to move this over here
to where the time actually I move it
over here where the hair is so we can
see this area here okay
now let's start applying the effect
let's go to this to like a hundred
percent and then we'll come over and
bring the radius up and you can already
see that when I did that the shoulder
area got way more sharper so I'll bring
this back again and you can see blur
Lurie shoulder bring this up even to
just like one and a half pixels come on
and now it's like even with way sharper
so I'm going to bring this up the two
you know that looks pretty good and then
we've got nice sharp edges on here that
aren't blurry which is pretty nice they
don't blend in with the background as
much now remember I was telling you
about you can remove some of the filters
that you put on we've got the Gaussian
lens and motion blur on here and then
we've got this right here which is a
more accurate which gives like a more
accurate but a slower and it uses more
RAM so the sharpen filter is more
accurate but it's a lot slower to use so
I'm just oh yeah there's definitely
there's definitely a change in here when
you click on more accurate so this is
with it off then just take a second to
look in this preview area right here you
can see how the more accurate effects it
there goes it takes like a second to pop
in but it is whip it's definitely giving
them way more detail in her hair and
more contrast and everything like that
so we've got this angle right here and
this only applies when you have the
motion blur on because the motion blur
is kind of like an angular blur and it
goes in the direction that the motion is
going in since there's no motion in this
that we don't wouldn't want to ever use
that you wouldn't want to use motion
blur on this now there is an advanced
tab let's click on that you get the
shadow and highlight here and the place
where I saw the most amount of change
when I was doing this is down here and
in the leg area
because there is shadows and highlights
a pretty decent contrast going on there
so let's come to our shadows we've got
the fade amount here and that determines
the amount that we've got the amount
correction that's being applied so
what's bringing back this tonal width
all the way down we've got our more
accurate checked so that's good so our
tonal width here is pretty much the
width of the amount so kind of like the
radius a little bit and then the radius
here is the scale of the size of the of
the smart sharpen that we're putting on
on the shadows so let's bring this up
maybe a hundred percent or bring it up
to where you where it looks good starts
looking good bring up your tonal width
decent amount and then your radius and
you can kind of see that like that the
shadowy areas are getting a little more
sharpened same thing with the highlights
I can bring this up and you can just see
the different if you bring up the fade
here it looks like it's getting a lot
more blurry you can definitely see on
the left side of the oh sorry you can
definitely see on the left side of the
leg here that's with the fade amount to
zero and this is with the fade amount to
100% so you can see how that works now
check it out here this is the Fate
amount to zero on the leg and then you
bring up the Fate amount to a hundred
percent let's see not as much difference
with the shadows here but definitely
more difference with the highlight as
you can see okay now I let's see if
there's anything else to go over and
there is one more thing I wanted to go
over actually a couple what's let's put
on wanna look at Gaussian blur and see
what happens when we try to remove it it
does its best to try to remove it so
let's go to a filter and we'll apply
blur Gaussian blur and what's a Jack it
up to like three pixels so we can see
more
you can see how it's pretty blurry here
is that compared to the other one that's
the that's without blur and this is with
the blur now let's apply the smart
filter are the smart sharpen there we go
and we got the blur on there we're
trying to take that off if you increase
the amount a little more more accurate
let's see how let's see how well it does
hit okay and give it some time to
compute there we go
and it it tries to it tries to take away
the Gaussian blur it doesn't do the best
job edit but it's better than it's
better than nothing if you're trying to
get rid of it so mess with mess around
with the settings mess around with all
that stuff to try to get a better
sharpen on your blurred images so that's
all there is for the smart sharpen
filter and I hope you guys enjoy that
filter I use it a decent amount to try
to make everything look it like look
really nice and pop out sometimes what I
do I'm like a picture of like an image
like this I'll isolate the main focal
point here which is the woman with the
skateboard and then I'll apply the and
I'll cut it out and I'll apply the smart
smart sharpen there to the to the focal
point and it'll stand out from the
background a lot more instead of like
pulling out like instead of the smart
sharpen pulling out some of the
background image so just keep that in
mind when you're using the image when
you're using the filter and use it to
your advantage
well thanks for watching this tutorial
hopefully you guys learned something and
I I want you guys to have a good day see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
