the carburetor on your engine now you
have to plug one end and for now this is
the only connection will make will plug
the one end into the intake manifold on
our engine so first of all find the
intake manifold on your engine and make
sure you have a hose clamp and get this
is loose as possible there we go we have
little playing there so whenever you're
looking at your carburetor the part that
you want to plug into the engine is the
area that releases the fuel air mixture
now in a lot of carburetors this looks
the same as the area where the air is
coming into your carburetor so how can
you tell the difference well an easy way
where you can tell the difference is if
you look where your throttle is where
the throttle cable is going to go you
see that little door right there this is
the area that goes into the engine now
also on a lot of carburetors the hoses
are different sizes so this is the only
side that's going to fit it in but I you
know that's also another way to tell so
go ahead and carefully slide this into
the intake manifold and your engine you
actually want to be really careful
anytime you're working with carburetors
in general but now that it's live in pic
place make sure it's all the way tight
in there and tighten it up there we go
looks nice and tight so now I want to
mention a couple things because we don't
have the other system such as the gas
tank and air filter hooked up to our
engine yet but whenever we do remember
to connect everything you need to to the
carburetor for example whenever we hook
up the fuel tank this is where this is
the hose that's going to connect to the
fuel tank and also a residence of
carburetor um whenever we hook up our
gas pedal and throttle cable remember to
hook it up on this side whenever we hook
up our air filter this is where the air
filter is going to go and these extra
hoses are for something called the PCV
system and I'll talk about that later
but just remember that that is the
basics of what a carburetor is and how
you install it on your engine but just
remember you're not done working whether
you have to
other things in whenever I put those
systems in I'll show you guys how to do
that but for now I think as for watching
I'm going to subscribe and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
