sanitize our crap so go ahead and get
all your equipment fill up a big tub of
water and mix your sanitizer in now
depending on the brand of sanitizer
you're using it has different directions
on things like how much to use per
gallon and also how long you need to let
your equipments sit in there so
basically just follow the directions or
instructions on your sanitizer and it
will tell you exactly how to sanitize
your equipment so go ahead and sanitize
everything your primary fermenter bucket
the lid hydrometer airlock spoon and
once you're you know you have everything
sanitized you're good to go now once we
have our nice sanitized bucket go ahead
and pour about a half gallon of warm
water into your bucket and I say about a
half gallon because it doesn't really
matter at this point later on we're
going to be bringing it up to six
gallons exactly but for right now we're
just using this water to dissolve other
things in as you're gonna see in a
second so anywhere from like half
gallons a gallon is fine and it helps if
it's warm because it helps dissolve
easier and another thing is I like to
boil it and then bring it down to a warm
temperature because then when I'm
boiling it it kills any germs that were
in the pot and basically well that's all
now the next thing that you want to do
is you want to get your pack of
bentonite which is right there it came
with your kit and go ahead and pour it
in the water
now bentonite is actually a clarifier
and what clarifier means is basically
well just like it sounds it clarifies
the wine you're saying how can this crap
looks like mud clarify wine well what it
does is whenever you have particles in
your wine it attracts those particles
that are just floating around and it
allows them to settle to the bottom and
of course we don't want to use all the
gunk on the bottom so it does that
through pretty much static electricity
because this is pretty much clay and
it's charged
but anyways like I said bentonite is
basically clarifier so whenever you have
particles or flow
he's floating around your wine then it
pretty much sticks to them settles them
to the bottom so go ahead pour that in
and make sure that all the clumps are
broken up you start for about 30 seconds
for their spoon all right that's pretty
good right there all right and now your
wine is ready to drink just kidding now
the next thing that we need to do is
grab that big sack of juice that came
with our wine kit and carefully take off
the lid and pour it in your bucket
now with this juice it isn't that bad
but with some other juices like dark
grape juice whenever you're making
really red wine what you want to do is
just like that be careful be careful not
to splash it around because whenever you
have red wine you splash it those specks
get everywhere in there really hard to
get out so like I said if you're using
grape juice and make sure not to splash
it like or spill on the ground like I
just then
now you guys probably can't see this
because it's a really light juice it's
not like dark grape juice or anything
but there's a little bit left in the bag
let me show you like here and all around
the sides of it so what people like they
actually just take some water a little
bit in it we'll just go ahead and rinse
it around the bag and then go ahead and
pour this into your bucket and you know
get all the rest of the juice out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
