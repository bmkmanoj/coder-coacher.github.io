back to another video and uh sometimes I
feel like talking with a weird accent so
now that I got that out of the way let's
go ahead and learn about grid pain now a
grid pain as you probably could have
expected is a way that you can arrange
items in a grid no surprise there
however it's not just boring grid like a
spreadsheet we can actually do some
pretty cool stuff to it so let's go
ahead and get started first thing we
need is it grid pain I'm going to name
mine grid because I'm that creative and
we'll just set this equal to new gird
pain so this is our entire layout and if
we take this grid and we just plop it in
our window then what's going to happen
is our layout is going to be butted
right up against the edges of the window
and it's going to look really weird so
the first thing you always want to do is
you want to call a method called set
padding now as you can see this takes in
in sets object as a parameter so set
padding new in sets what the heck is in
sets it's essentially just a object that
you can have four values tossed into and
these are just the amount of padding
that you want to add to each edge so if
you want to say um like make a 10 pixel
padding around your entire layout you
can just put 10 10 10 10 if you want
like more padding on the bottom or
something then you can go ahead and
tweak those values but again what this
does is it's going to put a 10 pixel
padding around your layout in the window
but here's the thing the individual
cells themselves they don't have any
padding or spacing yet so even though
our layout isn't going to be butted
directly up against the window all those
cells are going to be bunched together
so how do we take care of that well what
we do is we take our grid and we call a
method called set V gap and this pretty
much sets the vertical spacing or the
padding of vertically so now with that I
think it looks good I tested this before
our vertical spacing is now 8 pixels and
you guys can probably guess
you need to do four horizontal spacing
each gap and let me set this equal to
ten pixels so all we did right here is
we made a grid layout and we added a
little bit of padding between the entire
layout in the border of the window of
ten pixels and the spacing vertol
vertically is eight in the spacing
horizontally is ten and again this is
the individual cells themselves not the
entire layout so now that we got our
grid taken care of let's go ahead and
start adding some items so what I'm
going to do in this example is I'm just
going to make a quick little it's going
to look like a login screen it's going
to have user name and then a place to
type your username password place it
type whatever password you want to make
up and a login button obviously it's not
really going to log in to any website
this is just you know demonstrating how
you would make it but cool little
examples so I'll say name label and I'll
name this one name label new label and
we'll just say username and I'll input a
little going right there all right so
now what we need to do is we pretty much
just made an item that we want to add
now we have to say where do we want to
add it what column what row and in order
to do that we need to call a method
called set constraints so this takes
three parameters the first one is a
child in other words what item do you
want to add to the grid ours is going to
be the label obviously and the other two
are what column and what row in other
words the position where you want to add
it so again what do you want to add the
name label label label not bad label and
of course since computers start counting
at zero this means the first column in
the first row in other words this label
is going to appear in the top left of
the grid simple enough easy breezy
beautiful covergirl all right so the
next thing is neigh
inputs which is the area that they type
their name in and this can be text field
and how about I name it name input new
text field and check this out
so what we could do is we can just
create it like this and that's just
going to create a blank and put pretty
cool or if we want to have default text
in there
for example maybe the user logged in
before and you wanted to save their
username like a bunch of websites too
you can actually pass a string into this
text field and it's going to give you
default text so I'll show you guys what
that looks like right there and of
course just like before once we're done
making our item we need to add it to the
grid second train so what do you want to
add name input where do you want to add
it well how about in the first column or
excuse me in this yeah second having a
talk and type different numbers then I'm
explained and it's a little bit
different in the first row which is row
zero so again this is going to appear to
the right of the label so now we have to
do the same thing with password pretty
easy we just copy this so for the
password label I'll just name this past
label and the label is just going to be
password grid panes what are you trying
to add we want to add that past label
where do you want to add it to well at
zero remember it's going to appear in
the same column all these labels well
it's going to appear in the second row
so zero one and the same thing for the
input actually let me show you guys
something password input and check this
out so of course just like before it's
going to be a text field and I'll just
name it has input equals
probably should just copy this text
field all right so I'm not going to have
any default text for the password and by
the way a prep should mention this
whenever I'm running this demonstration
since this is just a plain text field
it's going to display the password in
plain text but later on I'll show you
guys how to have an input where you can
type it in it will actually display like
those little circles or asterisks is you
obviously want to want to have a plain
text password or else whoever was typing
in their password uh you know someone
else could see it but this is just a
quick little demo demonstrating great
pain so what I want to do is show you
guys the difference between default text
in this right here which is pass input
set prompt text so if you guys are
familiar with like um HTML or if you
ever made a form for a website you saw
that there's these things called
password hints which is this light
grayed out text that was a pretty much
pretty much an indicator of what you're
supposed to type there so it isn't
default text because default text
whenever the user clicks in the input
field it's going to remain there and
it's going to be dark black prompt text
is lighter gray and just for this demo
I'll put like password if you had no
idea what I'm trying to explain then you
will see the difference whenever I'm
running this program but I just want to
show you guys that there is indeed the
difference between default text which
you throw as a parameter whenever you're
making the text field object and prompt
text so that's all I'm trying to save
right now so of course just like before
when you do one more thing if I can type
grid pain set constraints and pass
inputs one one which pretty much means
the second column second row tomato
tomahto now the last thing we need is
just a login button button and inside
here to say a login
now I actually want this in the second
column in the third row so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to call grid
pain second strange login watching and
this would be one two so second column
third row looks good it's going to
appear right under the inputs I think it
looks weird if you put it right under
the labels so you know there's that all
right
so simple enough the last thing we need
to do is add everything to the grid
because all we did is we made the items
and we position them so I don't know
this is just a weird rule so grid just
like before get children at all in what
do we want to add first a name label and
add that name input past label pass
inputs and the login button so now we
have everything add it to the grid and I
probably should you kept this from my
last tutorial seen seen equals new seen
how all right so for your scene we have
one thing we want to plop in at the grid
that we just made how big do you want it
about 300 by 200 why not and we need to
call window set scene let me tighten all
this up so you guys can actually see all
right there you go so everything is
looking pretty good let me run this and
see what I fudged up all right so let me
hide this so first of all you can see
that this is default text this Bucky
right here and whenever I'm clicking in
the input area it doesn't disappear so
whenever we were checking for text that
the user typed in this would pass
through however a password hint or in
other words as it's called in here
prompt text this is just a little gray
indicator and whenever I click in here
check out what happens it disappears and
whenever we're doing data about
a nation that value wouldn't get passed
through so again that's the difference
that's what I was trying to explain
again like I said a lot easier if you
just see it but yeah there you go
click login nothing happens beautiful
however we now know how to use grid
panes so uh actually in the next twirl
what I'll show you guys how to do is
actually get input from the user so we
can actually extract these values and
use them in our program it's going to be
sweet so I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
