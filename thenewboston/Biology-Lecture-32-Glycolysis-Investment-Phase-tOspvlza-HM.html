biology video and in this video what I
want to do is I want to talk to you guys
a little bit more about cellular
respiration
now cellular respiration of course is a
pretty complex process but it can be
broken up into three main steps the
first step is called glycolysis now
glycolysis is pretty much the process
where cells break down the glucose so
let's go ahead and start with the
glucose molecule which we know as c6
h-12 o-6
so our cell pretty much wants to start
breaking this down so we can use it for
energy now how does that happen well
whenever a cell wants to start breaking
down this glucose molecule it first gets
an enzyme called hexokinase and I'll go
ahead and draw my enzyme like this e
with a little cloud I guess that's the
at least that's my symbol for an enzyme
so what this enzyme does in this again
is called hexo kinase is it pretty much
gets energy from the cell to add a
phosphate group to the glucose now
whenever a cell does anything it needs
energy in the form of a TP now remember
when we were talking about ATP whenever
it uses energy it gets converted to a D
P now whenever this happens you go from
3 phosphates to two phosphates so
therefore you lose a phosphate but it
doesn't just disappear in the thin ear
thin ears no thin air it gets added on
to your glucose molecule right here so
now what you do is you end up with
glucose plus a phosphate
so if this thing was you know a little
street gang what would happen is this
this hexokinase right here would be like
yo ATP why don't you give a phosphate to
glucose and then the ATP's like alright
so it gives a phosphate to glucose so
now we have a molecule that is glucose
plus phosphate in your ATP is now
converted to a DP now a couple things
that we need to know is first of all
remember what we're trying to do here
we're a cell and we need energy but
what's happening right now is we
actually invested in ATP or we lost some
energy just to get this process going so
we actually need to invest some energy
before you can create any energy so what
happens is this gets the glucose
molecule ready to give off energy so now
the glucose and phosphate is almost
ready to give off energy and glucose
plus phosphate this molecule is
technically called glucose 6-phosphate
so whenever you have a glucose with a
phosphate group added on the molecule
that we have right now is called glucose
6-phosphate now once we have glucose
6-phosphate we can move on to the next
step so let me go ahead and get a new
slide open so remember what we have now
is glucose 6-phosphate which is pretty
much a glucose with a phosphate added on
why they called it they named everything
in biology super long words I would call
it glucose with a phosphate molecule at
a time but that's probably why I'm not
you know technically a biologist so now
what we need is another enzyme to get
this process going to the other step
step number two so this other enzyme
I'll draw it right here and this is
called phospho glucose isomerase what
this does is it takes your glucose
6-phosphate and it turns it into another
molecule called fructose 6-phosphate
now a couple things that I want to point
out here is that fructose 6-phosphate
this molecule right here it has the
exact same molecular formula as glucose
6-phosphate
now the reason that they aren't the same
name is because the atoms are arranged a
little bit differently so basically what
I mean is all this enzyme does right
here is it changes the shape of glucose
6-phosphate
and whenever we change the shape we need
to give a new name and this new name is
fructose 6-phosphate so it changes the
shape of molecule and that's all step
number two is using this enzyme called
phospho glucose isomerase to change the
shape of glucose 6-phosphate and end up
with what we have now fructose
6-phosphate so let's go ahead and write
that on a new slide what we have now is
fructose 6-phosphate so where do we go
from here
well now what we need is another enzyme
let me go ahead and write that a little
bit neater another enzyme it's pretty
cool-looking enzyme right here and this
enzyme is called phosphofructokinase and
what this enzyme does is it uses another
ATP so again we need to use more energy
which are my ATP a little bit neater a
t.p so we're using more energy and of
course whenever we use a ATP it goes to
a DP and it loses a phosphate
so what happens in this process is your
fructose 6-phosphate which is
it gets the phosphate from ATP so this
is pretty much a molecule that has
fructose 6-phosphate plus a phosphate
now this molecule is now the chemical
structure of let me pick a good color c
6h 1006 and two phosphates now the
reason that I didn't write out the name
like I have been is because the new
molecule this one right here it's
actually called fructose 1 6 by
phosphate like I said again let me
repeat that this molecule right here is
called fructose 1 6 by phosphate and I
want to stress one more time I don't
name these you know these molecules if I
did I would just call it fructose
6-phosphate with another phosphate added
on but technically you know that's not
what it's called but the important
concepts to take away here is that
notice so far what we're doing is we're
trying to create energy here our cell
needs energy but right now in the very
first step we needed to use an ATP so we
needed to use energy and then on step
number three we needed to use another
energy so we're trying to frickin create
energy here but already we needed to use
two atps so this is what we called the
investment phase because so far all we
did is we had to use or invest two ATP's
and we didn't even create any new ones
yet so step one of breaking down the
glucose and adding a phosphate group to
it step number two of converting the
glucose 6-phosphate into fructose
6-phosphate in step number three of
glycolysis which you take the fructose
6-phosphate and add another phosphate
group this entire process we used or
invested two ATP's and that's why step
one through three of glycolysis is
called the investment phase because we
invested energy in in order to make
ATP's
it takes ATP is kind of like the saying
it was it takes money to make money well
same thing it takes
a TPS to make a TPS so now that we have
our investment of a TPS ready to start
cashing in getting some energy that the
cell can use but for now thank you guys
for watching and I'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
