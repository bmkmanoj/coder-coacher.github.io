Roberts and welcome to your very first
tutorial in angular 2 now what I was
going to do is I was actually going to
take a whole video at the beginning and
talk to you guys about angular to give
you guys an overview of it a nice
introduction but then I was like you
know what I'm pretty sure that everyone
watching this video is already going to
know what angular 2 is and they just
kind of want to get up and running and
kinda get their hands dirty so that's
what I'm going to do instead so the
first thing I want to show you guys is
what you need in order to just use
angular 2 so the first thing you need to
have on your computer is node J s now
again I assume that most of the people
watching this already have this
installed but if you don't hop over to
no js' org slash en slash download and
just go ahead and download whatever you
know proper version depending on
whatever machine you're on so I'm on
Windows so I chose this of course if
you're on Linux and you can just use the
command line and once you have this
installed it's actually going to come
with tool code n p.m. so this is a tool
that you use from the command line and
it allows you to download a lot of the
libraries and packages that we're going
to need so after this what we need to do
is we actually need to start making our
angular project now I'm going to admit
right now that even to make a very base
core project with angular 2 it's kind of
a pain in the butt there's a lot of
files included however what I did before
the series started is I made this right
here so these are all of the files and
packages that you need to just get
started in up and running with angular 2
so if you go to github.com slash buck
your Appert slash angular 2 template you
can go ahead and download all of these
files so if you don't have a github
account then you can just click this
button download zip and it's going to
allow you to download all the files or
if you do have a github account then you
can go ahead and clone this or fork it
so you have your own copy whatever and
again all this project is right now is
the most basic angular 2 project you can
think of once you have it running it's
just a little bit of text on the screen
and it says like welcome to
- or something so the most basic file
you can have so what I'm going to do is
I'm just going to go ahead and hit
download zip and once I have it
downloaded I got this right here so I
need to extract it so once you have it
extracted you're going to get this right
here and for some reason
what github does is it actually takes
your files and puts it in another file
with the same name so you essentially
have an extra file that you don't need
so again if you click your main
extraction file inside here this is
actually the one you want and you can
see when you click this that those are
all the nice juicy files so take this
file and move it to somewhere either on
your desktop or some folder and you can
actually rename this to whatever you
want so let me go ahead and rename it to
angular 2 template name it YouTube
alright so I'm actually going to move
this to somewhere on my desktop alright
guys so now go ahead and open up that
directory in any IDE that you want I am
going to be using webstorm for these
tutorials I'm sure a lot of you guys are
going to be using sublime you can even
use notepad if you want I don't
recommend it but again just any editor
whatever one you feel comfortable with
and in the next video what I'm going to
do is I'm actually going to go through
each of these files and directories and
talk you guys through what each one of
them do and then you're going to have a
basic understanding of all the different
pieces of a angular2 application but for
right now just so you guys have kind of
a idea of what we're about to do next if
you click package.json i already wrote
all the dependencies and if you guys
don't even know what dependencies are
they're pretty much just extra files
that we need in order for our program to
work we depend on those files so we
actually don't have these downloaded or
installed yet so that's why I told you
guys to install nodejs because it came
with a tool called NPM and it's a
special tool for downloading these
dependencies so you use that tool from
the command line and if you're using
webstorm then you can just pop open this
terminal and it comes with like a
built-in
man line right here which is pretty
awesome but if you don't then what you
can use this go ahead and navigate to
wherever you have your project and I
have mine on my desktop in a folder
called projects and right here angular2
template youtube now a cool little trick
is if you're on Windows and you hold
down the shift key you can right click
and hit open command window here so that
way you don't have to actually navigate
to it so you know say if you see you
guys like two seconds but hey two
seconds is two seconds and from here
just go ahead and type NPM install so
whenever you run this command what it
does is actually looks for this file
called package Jason and it looks
through and sees what dependencies you
need to have installed so it installs
those in this directory right here so it
actually made this folder called node
modules and look at this how awesome is
this tool and that way we don't have to
download all of these one by one we do
all in one big shebang how easy was that
so it's going to go ahead and download
all those so I'm going to pause the
video and look at that actually didn't
even need to pause the video because it
took like five seconds but whatever so
we have everything we needed installed
now I'm just going to hit CLS just to
clear my screen now what I also did is
to help us out with development what
people usually do is they write a little
bit of code and then they save it and
then they test it in browser and then
all right working on something now let's
write a little bit of coats more maybe
edit some things save it
refresh your browser yada-yada-yada well
what I did is I actually set this up to
use this test server right here and
instead of having to do that all we have
to do is edit our code and whenever
we're working with our project it gets
updated in the browser automatically so
I already included all this for your
development environment so just type NPM
starts and that's going to start your
development server it's called light
server and
it's going to automatically update in
the browser so just go ahead and hit
start run enter and it actually should
pop up in your browser whatever your
default browser is so look at that
minimize this say you guys can see all
right so boom roasted hopefully this is
what you guys should see now don't even
follow along with what I'm doing right
now but I just want to show you guys
something cool so I'm just going to
change a bit of texture to show you guys
what's going on so I'll change it from
Engler to template to angular to Bucky
and look at this now whenever we go back
to our browser it automatically updates
so again don't worry about that last
thing I did I just want to show you guys
that whenever you set up your project
this way it's going to make your
development process incredibly easy so
in the next video what we're going to do
is I'm going to talk you guys through
what each one of these directories and
all these files are and why they're
important so think guys for watching and
I will see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
