slash Centex here for another tutorial
for bucky in the new boston today we're
going to be doing is giving ourselves a
bit of an intro to OpenGL and using PI
OpenGL so we can use OpenGL with Python
so to get first of all to do this you're
going to need PI OpenGL so to get that
bring over OpenGL here so this is the
official PI OpenGL website and then here
just basically says that you can use
this with a bunch of GUI libraries with
Python including and then all of these
and we're going to be using it with PI
game so we have that we know that that's
all set we have Python three three
hopefully and I'm actually on Python 3.4
and it works so that's good so to get it
come down here to you the downloading
and installing it we want just simple PI
OpenGL go ahead and click on that and
then basically these are your standard
bindings if you're on Windows you know
either you can install this here and use
the typical setup high installation
you're on Windows however you can use
this which is just the windows
installers and they basically have the
windows installers for all of your
versions of Python and different
versions of Pi OpenGL be careful and
don't click on the accelerate one unless
you want accelerate but you're gonna
need PI up in jail first
so for you if you're on 64-bit you would
want this one and if you're on a 32-bit
you would want this one so once you have
those you should be able to do the
following should be able to say from
OpenGL GL import asterisk and when you
hit save and run you know wait for it
apparently forever and you shouldn't
have an error if you have an error you
need to go back to the installation and
figure out what the heck happened so
with that let me go ahead and minimize
this basically all this stuff and we'll
just we'll leave that line here
so so as I explained in the previous
video OpenGL is like a 3d graphics
engine so to speak so what it's gonna
allow us to do is make both 2d but also
3d code and do it very efficiently and
what OpenGL does for us too is it
utilizes a lot of things that you
probably have no idea about like the
need to match your monitors refresh rate
and all this nastiness so so OpenGL is
definitely a very useful useful engine
so anyway what we're gonna go ahead and
do now is or if you haven't noticed
we're just gonna write a new script so
they have nothing to do with the
previous scripts that we've written so
save those if you want and then start
clean and let's go ahead get started so
we're using this with PI games so we're
gonna go ahead and import PI game and
then we're also gonna do from PI game
locals import basically everything this
just allows us to use all the typical PI
game commands without having to type a
game dot then we have from OpenGL dot GL
import everything and basically what
this is is this is just your standard
OpenGL functions so if you are not
familiar with typical OpenGL so you go
to simple google.com here and just type
in OpenGL documentation and then head
over here and this has all the
documentation you could possibly want
and the other thing that you can do is
for example I guess I'll show you when
we get there but basically if you're not
sure what like a certain function might
do you can just Google that function and
you'll find yourself on the OpenGL
documentation page and it tells you
exactly what that function does
so anyway from OpenGL GL import
everything again just through typical
OpenGL functions and then we're also
gonna do from open dot OpenGL dot geo
you mind the caps import everything and
this is more advanced OpenGL functions
especially like some of the newer ones
you'll find are going
here anyway oh and then also I just
shouldn't mention OpenGL is I believe
completely backwards compatible so
everything that used to work still works
it just might not be the best or the
industry standard actually probably is
the industry standard since it is fully
backwards compatible a lot of people
don't move forward but with OpenGL
you'll find that there are a lot of
outdated things like some things that
used to be required but they're not
required anymore and then there's also
like some things that are just like
they're almost as like standard or
something and then there's some things
that are new that you can do that you
probably don't understand because like
if you knew the old way that OpenGL
worked and you looked at the new way
you'd be like boy I don't even
understand and if you're taught the new
way you're probably looking at the old
legacy OpenGL and you're like what is
the purpose you know that kind of stuff
so just keep that in mind that if you're
looking at examples of OpenGL just
understand that that might be really old
stuff and you might be trying to compare
it to like what you know how to do today
even in my code that I'm going to show
you here especially depending on when
you're watching this some of this is
legacy some of this is newer stuff and
so you just have to kind of keep this in
mind so that's that now with OpenGL
basically what you do is you start you
just specify XYZ and opengl takes the
rest takes the reins basically from
there so first we're going to keep it
really simple and you want to define
first your vertices so your mercies are
like your notes like the little corners
of everything you define those then you
specify the opengl like hey like this is
the type of object I want you to display
in our case it'll be lines so the draw
lines from all of the vertices and then
when we're all done we'll render up and
it'll be a nice-looking cube and we'll
see that we can do all kinds of things
we can change our perspective of the
cube and everything is like near perfect
so so anyways you want to define your
vertices next so we'll go ahead and do
that in the next video since that's kind
of a longer topic as well but it's kind
of like the nodes that we defined but a
little little more complex
so anyways stay tuned for that thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
