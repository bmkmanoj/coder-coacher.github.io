c-sharp tutorial that I'm making for the
new Boston and in this tutorial I'm
going to be showing you how to use
threading a little bit more so you're
basically just going to need everything
that we had in a previous tutorial
seniors are just a button multi-line
text box with the vertical scroll bar
and all this code and since we're using
not since we're doing threading you need
to be using a system dot the reading
namespace so today we're going to be
looking at passing parameters through
methods that we're going to be threading
so if you wanted to thread this method
you think I'll walk you split string
right here and then just do like name
and then it will just do name like that
and then those pass through our name
well no you can only pass through an
object so we would do object and you
cannot pass any other variable type
through you can't do like an integer or
anything you have to has to be an object
nothing else and then you can just pass
through the string anyways but you're
going to have to do dot to string
because this is an object so now I'm
going to bug it should work fine yep and
if you want it to pass through another
object like say you wanted to do arm how
many times it'll loop through you think
you can just do their object well no you
can only pass through one object so
since this is an object we can set um we
passed through anything that we wanted
so we're going to pass through an object
array with the first element being the
name and the second element will be how
many times you want to pass through so
we'll just go up here and create an
object array study equal to whatever you
want to pass through so like I said the
first parameter will be the name so just
do I guess we'll do Bob this time and
the second one will be common times you
want to loop through and we'll just loop
through 500 instead of a thousand time
and now we can just pass through obj a
and you cannot do just all this make
this
I'll call array this time and you cannot
do just like array and then put what
index you want to access no because this
is an object so what you're going to do
is you're going to have to cast on this
object array in or this object right
here into an object array so we're just
going to create a new object array we
just call it tow and we'll study equal
to array as an object alright so now we
can do oh and then 0.2 string and then
how many times we want to loop through
would be oh one dot oh I'm going to
convert this into integers or after the
convert dot two into 32 all right so now
this should work fine so now it can pass
through basically two parameters however
you're not doing that you're basically
detect passing through one parameter but
we're using an object array so it's like
passing through the two parameters so
now we should see it only loop through
yep and I'll end up to 500 times and if
you stop and now it can change these
however we wanted so if we wanted to
pass through Steve and then want it to
loop through 1,500 times do that now it
wrote Steve and yep 1500 times and this
says 1499 but if there's a zero at the
beginning so it actually did move
through 1500 times and one last thing
I'm going to be showing you on where we
end here is the sleep method inside of
the thread class and it's a static
method so we can just do at the red dot
sleep and then for how many milliseconds
you wanted to sleep or stall so if we
wanted to stall for 100 milliseconds it
will stall for one
hundred milliseconds so it will just
wait 100 milliseconds and I'll do this
code loop through again we a hundred
milliseconds then do this code and we're
going to make it a little bit less so we
don't do wait like forever for to load
all the characters so we'll make it like
50 so oh wait 50 milliseconds then we
through and do this and continue over
and over again and 50 milliseconds just
in case you're wondering is a point zero
five seconds so now let me be bug here
it should be a little bit slower you
gotta wait that's taking too long so
let's just make it like 10 but yeah it
just slows it down and you can do this
if you're working with something that um
yeah there we go you can do this if
you're trying to like have it wait for
something or something like that um this
is it for this tutorial
so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
