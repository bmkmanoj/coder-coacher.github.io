tutorial and and this is order i'm going
to show you guys how to fade a filter
now we're not working with the Smart
Filters anymore so go ahead and get rid
of that just get like a regular layer or
a picture of pretty much anything you
want and I know you guys were wondering
because in lassiter i said i was going
to go to food lion but i actually just
found an apple pie from mcdonald's in my
refrigerator from last time so that's
what i'm eating right now in actually in
case you want to know whenever they had
monopoly at mcdonalds last time they had
it for like a month and i went to
mcdonalds every day and play Monopoly
and i gained 13 pounds in a month so now
you know that's quite embarrassing
shouldn't have told you that but I did
so anyways to the tutorial now that I
show you shoo shoo shoo I showed you
guys how to use Smart Filters i'm going
to show you guys how to use a wriggler
filter now not only masking but you can
also use the selection tool like
anything that draws dots around your
image is a selection tool so go ahead
and I'm going to grab my ellipse tool
and draw a selection around here and now
once you have your selection you can
apply a filter to the selected area so
go ahead and press something like um
well filter you want to use filter
stylize lets you sketch chrome that's a
good one so looks good and now we have a
filter applied to the cow's head but
sometimes you don't want the full
intensity of the filter and you want to
be able to adjust the opacity of it so
in order to do this while the filter is
still selected go ahead and press edit
fade chrome in or it's not going to say
fade chrome for everything depends on
what filter using my name is a fade but
put fade something and that's the fade
your um whatever filter you're using so
now you can go ahead and lower the
opacity
and that is how you lower opacities of
filters and another thing you can do is
select the mode I know we didn't go over
modes but on these pretty much just give
you a new kind of cool effects the modes
but anytime you want to work with the
filter that's how you do you put edit
from up here and then you put fade and
that's how you do it so I'm going to go
ahead and cancel this since I don't want
it and I'm going to go ahead and get rid
of that too by pressing ctrl alt Z and
now we're back to our regular image so
another thing I want to teach you guys
in this tutorial is how to work with
contrast and how to focus an image so
there's a new filter for this and I'm
not going to select anything and when I
don't select anything and applies it to
the whole layer so make sure you got
your layer selected and press filter
then you want to press sharpen and then
you want press unsharp mask this is the
best filter to a sharpen your image so
turn these all 20 and I'm going to go
through them one by one with you and
just my microphone right now and pretty
much how this works is by sharpening it
how it works is it increases the
contrast between neighboring pixels so
for example on this like this green
right here in this brown it will
increase the contrast between that and
therefore it'll give the appearance of
sharpening your image so it pretty much
is like if you had a camera that was
blurry and you turn the camera lens
until it came in the focus sharper
that's what this effect is doing right
now except instead of turning the lens
we're doing it on a computer so let me
go with these go through with these
things mean right now you have three
settings right here amount radius and
threshold the amount is pretty much how
much you want to sharpen so as you slide
this higher it's going to produce kind
of it's going to be a stronger effect
the higher you go and it's going to go
from 500 usually never want to go to 500
unless you're gone for like
artsy effect but I usually put mine
around like we'll all put it pretty high
like 79 just so you I can make sure you
see it on youtube so again amount is
pretty much a strength now the radius
determines how wide the edges remember I
said that it increases the contrast
between edge the higher you go um it's
going to be it's going to look at a
bigger area so let's go ahead and put
this to the to it looks good mm I'll put
like 22 or something just so you can see
it and as you see the contrast is
getting more and more and I you I
normally wouldn't go this much but um
just for so you can see on youtube easy
I will so now once I talked about on and
off you can see that the cow is coming
pretty much uncontested and then
contrasted so whatever pixels are near
each other they contrast and pretty much
just makes it pop out now when you're
doing this for real don't put your
amounts as high as this is you're
probably going to want to put it like I
asked some some around like that right
there to sharpen your image but for
YouTube purpose let's upload this baby
up so you can really see it pop oh yeah
that's what I'm talking about in this
last one threshold right here you didn't
think I'd get to it did you this pretty
much is the value that it needs to be
between pixels in order to sharpen so
for example when you have it is zero
there needs to be a little different so
sharpens a lot when you have all the way
up to 255 then it's not even going to
notice the difference so it's not going
to sharpen at all so I always leave this
20 and just adjust the amount or radius
so remember the rules um adjust the
amount and radius by like guessing check
pretty much just move your sliders and
never move the threshold unless you know
you absolutely need to but usually never
want to move
so again once i blow these up and I talk
on my preview on and off that is how you
can bring a blurry image into focus and
again normally you wouldn't want to do
it this much but just so i can make sure
you see on youtube that's what's going
on so thank you for watching my tutorial
on focus and contrast and also filters
and in the next tutorial i'm going to be
showing you other cool stuff that you
can do with um probably a sharpening and
stuff so thank you for watching i'm
going to enjoy my apple pies and i will
see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
