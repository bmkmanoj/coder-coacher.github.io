with a video tutorial for the New Boston
in this video we're going to be creating
our own jQuery plugin so let's just take
a look first of all at the index.php
page and just how well what I've done
with this function and also how I've
included it now you see that I've
included three different files the first
one is jQuery j/s which is our jQuery
library which obviously we need we've
then created our plug-in inside plug-in
j/s and we're using this plug-in or
calling this plug-in making use of it
using ext das so essentially what the
plug-in is going to do is it will take
all of the links on a page as long as
you actually call the plug-in and it
will apply target equals underscore
blank so at the moment you can see that
we've just got our normal link we can
use target equals underscore blank so we
can use this target attribute to set
where we want the link to open in now
let's just say you wanted all of your
links across your entire page to open in
a new window now it would be quite
annoying using target you know equals
underscore blank and I'm sure they're
probably easier ways to do this without
jQuery but you know that's the example
of the plug-in if this doesn't exist
so if target blank sorry target equals
underscore blank doesn't exist or the
target is equal to nothing we will add
automatically add using jQuery target
equals underscore underscore blank now
if it equals something like underscore
self we won't be applying the underscore
blank obviously because the user might
have predefined that they want it to
open in the same window so we're
creating this plug-in you know just as
an example but it can have useful you
know effects you can be you can use this
and it
I guess do a job that you might have to
do manually so let's take a look at it
in action on our in our browser as you
can see I've created this Google link
which you can see here I'm going to go
ahead and set target equals underscore
self now what this will automatically do
is it will open it in in the same window
now let's go ahead and get rid of this
and just show nothing inside of here
you'll see that it automatically opens
in a new window so we've used this
plugin obviously this is all done with
ext ojs to add underscore blank in here
now if I was to go ahead and not include
anything this will add the whole
attribute on for us so it still opens in
a new window and we've called this in
ext ojs I've called the plug-in target
blank so I've applied this using a
selector to all a tags so we're
essentially just saying you know any tag
that has an A we apply this this plug-in
too so that's essentially what the
plug-in does it's quite a simple concept
but it means we can now use this basic
idea to go ahead and create our own
jQuery plug-in and you can obviously go
ahead and use this information to expand
and create your own plugins if you have
a really good idea that you'd like to
actually create as a plug-in rather than
an external file that you want to that
you want your users to just you know
simply include on the page it makes it a
lot better and all easier for a user to
just call this particular plug-in name
so let's go ahead and look inside
plug-in j/s and we'll start to actually
write out this plug-in
okay so I've gone ahead and blanked this
document also we have plug-in j/s which
is empty as well I've still kept the
link here because this isn't too hard to
create so I'm not going to waste time by
typing it out but let's take a look at
what we need to include once again
obviously the jQuery library plug-in j/s
is where we're going to define our
function or I'll plug in and actually
allow it to be used and then ext top j/s
is
going to take all links on the page as
we've already seen and apply the plug-in
to it
so inside plug-in j/s we need to go
ahead and outline the structure of how
we actually going to go ahead and create
this function so let's go ahead and
start doing this now now the first thing
I'm going to do is I'm going to say
function and then dollar sign and this
gives us the ability to use this
correctly as we normally would a jQuery
plugin sorry that should just have a
parentheses there and parentheses there
so essentially we're starting out with
parentheses like this and then we're
creating a function with the dollar sign
and then we're doing this and just
pulling that down so that's just how you
might normally view this now after this
we need to use jQuery and essentially
this means that we can use the dollar
sign instead of having to keep
referencing jQuery and that clears up a
lot of problems that we might come
across in in the long run as well so
there's this information about that in
the jQuery documentation but you know
this is the way we would standardly do
it now we need to create a function name
and we do this by using a dollar sign
and then dot FN and then the name of our
function or the name of our plugins so
essentially a plug-in is just a function
it's just called a plug-in in jQuery so
if I do refer to it as a function then
think of it as a plug-in anyway so the
name that we've called this is target
--blank remember in the previous part of
the tutorial where I showed you through
this you could see that I'd called it as
target --blank so this is the function
name obviously it can't override any
other function that jQuery has so any
other standard you know that's something
that's standard ly built into the
library so call it something unique you
might have a catchy name for it or you
might just have it something that you
know does what it does and in this case
target --blank pretty much says what it
does</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
