to your 16th objective-c tutorial and if
you're watching for I did get my hankie
this time and also it is 94 degrees
right now in my apartment in my air
conditioner broke so I got a fan over
there and it's blowing on my face but
I'm still as hot as crap right now
but anyways in this tutorial I'm gonna
be going over something called the
do-while loop or some people cut the do
loop um what it is is pretty much the
same thing as the while loop except
reversed it does this statement first
and then it tests if the condition or
test is true so in essence since you do
your statements first and then your test
even if your variable in your statement
is false it runs it at least on one time
and before it tested so you'll see in a
second so let's go ahead and make a
variable called n and we'll set it equal
to 1 and now let's go ahead and make our
do loop and since X for a do loop or a
do-while loop is do and then you go
ahead and you write your statements
right here so I'm gonna make the same
loop as the last time just to show you
guys the difference is let's go ahead
and NS log this stuff at and what we
want to do is just print out this
variable I and N and now what we want to
do is add 1 to n each time and I prepped
many of my semicolons that'd be a good
idea and now after you do your bit of
code you give a test and you give it a
test using while and don't forget to add
a semicolon after a while unlike last
time so n is less than or equal to 5 so
now what exactly is this doing we have a
variable here called n and we set equal
to 1 now the first thing that it's gonna
do is print out n and add 1 to it so
it's now equal to 2 but I only printed
it out one and now it's gonna test all
right is n less than or equal to 5 yes
so I'm gonna do this code again so
unlike before whether it was
the test first and then the code in this
do-while loop it does it and then a test
if the condition is true so let me go
ahead and run this and I want to
demonstrate one point one two three four
or five exact same as before so how is
this different and when would you use
this they're gonna come instances when
you want to run code at least one time
so for example if this n was equal to 9
what this would happen is if you had a
basic while loop then the test would
never run but if you wanted to do the
code first
it will run it once and then when it
tested it it would see that it was
greater than 5 so wouldn't run again so
let me build this and show you guys what
happens all the output was 9 nothing
else and why did it do this did you guys
even see that or was that way too quick
9 9 there we go
take some time so what it does is it
prints out 9 adds 1 to it so becomes 10
and now it says alright while n is less
than or equal to 5 which was 10 is like
whoa whoa whoa I am done with this I
already did it once that's enough so
that's the basics of do-while loop it
pretty much ensures that you're gonna
run your code at least once and you know
let's just go ahead and build a program
demonstrating a useful bit so let's go
ahead and set that equal to 1 of course
and delete everything else and now let's
go ahead and build what I like to do
actually is build the shell for the
do-while loop I actually put 2 in there
and I put while just like that and now
all I have to fill in is the stuff I
really care about so let's go ahead and
print out let's go ahead and make like a
table of the number squared and see I
need this again and by the way if you
guys are like why do you use a hanky so
much it's actually pollen season down in
North Carolina and there's pollen all
over the place and is really annoying so
that's why I have a really bad allergies
pretty gross I know but anyways NS a log
nice transition into that
NSLog at posh three posh free let's go
ahead and write the number squared is
another number so now what we're gonna
do is take that number n + 4 squared we
write n times n so NS log and then after
we're done with this we just go to the
next number using n + + and how long do
we want to do this how long do we want
this table to run this put while N is
less than or equal to 10 that's a nice
even number actually let's go to 12
because most multiplication tables are
12 even though this is like a square
table but anyways let me build and run
this save it and I forgot a comma or
something and plus it Oh gotta
capitalize that that's embarrassing save
that and now check this out 1 squared is
1 2 squared is 4 3 squared is 9 10
squared is 100 12 squared is 144 and go
on and go on and you can do this all day
so that's a lot easier than typing in
you know doing all this for the
calculator that's a that's why computer
programming is awesome so I'm gonna
expand you guys one last time what
happen in this program see that's a
really effective program this might be
the first effective program yeah that's
nice I'm gonna send that into Microsoft
see if I can make some money off of that
baby I'm just kidding Microsoft doesn't
even use objective-c anyways listen to
me ramble oh what a little nevermind and
anyways int n1 so he took it variable
and and set it equal to 1 instead no
matter what the test is we're gonna run
this bit of code once so we printed it
out we printed it out the number and
then we times it by 1 and print it out
then both a nice little sentence here
and next we added one to our variable
which then made it 2 and then it finally
tested it is your number less than or
equal to 12
yes it's 2 so I'm going to run the skin
2 squared is 4 add 1 to it it's 3 now
test it again it's 3 less than or equal
to 12
yes it is so let's do the skin and I'm
going to do again and again
again and eventually when it got to 13
it said all right it's 13 less than or
equal to 12
hey I could no it's not so I'm done with
this program finally I'll see you later
and then that's all it did basically I
mean it didn't talk like I'll get oh
like that
but I mean essentially it's what it
really was thinking so anyways that's
the basics of a do-while loop I hope you
understand now and this is a program to
demonstrate the usefulness of it even
though you could have done this easily
in a 4 or a while loop so uh that's that
so thank you guys for watching don't
forget to check out my blog and please
subscribe because these videos are
awesome in they're free so thank you
guys for watching now see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
