hour and a half of more walking I got
some good news and I got some bad news
but first of all the good news because
this definitely changed my mood around
big time put a smile on my face maybe
you can hear an awesome freakin river
check that out right there it has
actually those look like Rapids down
there let me give you guys a better view
so down there it looks like there's some
Rapids but right here in front of me
look at this it's like a freakin sand
beach oh my that's awesome
and right here it's actually pretty deep
I don't know if they're fishing there oh
my if there are fish in there I'm gonna
be incredibly excited and man this river
is so much better than the other one the
other one was a pain this is actually
what I expected to find whenever I first
came into that around X all right now
for the bad news in order to keep going
east I have to climb this fricking rock
wall we step back and give you guys a
better view
so yeah look at that and that isn't even
a mountain I don't know if you guys can
see it but that's pretty much straight
up I'm not very good with Heights but
it's about at least a hundred feet in
the air so uh first of all I'm not going
to climb that I have to see if there's a
way around either there it looks pretty
steep the whole way I don't know what
I'm gonna do yet but uh yeah I got a
freakin canyon blocking my path to where
I wanted to go but that's okay because
I'm just gonna chill here for a little
bit and I'm actually probably going to
build a spear and see if I can catch
something to eat so first things first I
want to make some Spears I want to
actually make two Spears one for fishing
and I want this one the one for fishing
I want to be a little bit thinner just
so I think it will go through the water
better and I want to make another one
that is kind of like a walking stick
because I really need a walking stick
my legs are killing me after walking for
freaking day and a half and I'm also
gonna put a point on the end of it in
case I don't know I figured it will grip
the ground better if I have a point and
also like I said I really doubt that I'm
gonna find a bear anything and even if I
do I think that they rarely like
whenever they see whom and they pretty
much run for it but that way you know if
you have a walking stick might as well
put a point on it and make it a spear
but anyways I found this tree right here
and I think that this would be good for
it's a little too thin as you can see if
I put my hand around it it's a little
too thin for a walking stick and a bear
killer but uh I think it'll make a good
fishing spear so we'll go ahead and set
up the tripod I'll try to get this out
of gram a knife right here is definitely
not gonna cut through there we go gonna
cut through that tree so I'm gonna try
to yank it out of the ground what I
would do what I think is a better idea
is if I had a sharp rock that had an
edge on it then I can just go ahead and
cut the bottom but all these rocks
around here aren't like you know the
wrong ones that you saw on the river
that were like perfectly smooth through
all like that so unless I crack one in
half and get a sharp edge then I can't
really use a rock so
okay take two
pulling the tree out of the ground is uh
probably a lot harder than it looks
I can't twist it
oh thank is it looking what I got</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
