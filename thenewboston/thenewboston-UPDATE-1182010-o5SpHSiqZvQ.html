want to make a quick update telling you
guys what's going on with my channel
because I've been getting a lot of
common questions kind of the same
questions so i thought i'd make a video
and answer them off the first in most
common question is when are you going to
make another like Java tutorial or after
effects Torah or 3ds max story or any
blank tutorial well I actually have a
virus or I had a virus on my computer so
I had to reinstall my entire operating
system and I don't have the screen
recorder to record me making like um
videos on my computer like program
tutorials and after effects tutorials
and all those so if you can see my
computer you see that all of my icons I
had a gun and the only thing I have
thought on it right now is like premiere
pro after effects and pretty much
everything but screen recorder so I
ordered on it won't be coming in for two
weeks so now all i can do is like edit
video that i can choose with my
camcorder and not like record it so if
you're wondering when I'm coming out
with more Java tutorials or Python PHP
anything like that at least two weeks I
apologize guys but it's these retards
who make viruses you can blame them
second most common question what kind of
camera do i use because people like
evidently this is a high def camera
that's the most important thing any
camera you get then shoots in high def
it's going to look it on YouTube but I
have a let's see vixia hv30 and like I
said I edited in Premiere Pro and make
sure that your output is high def I
output in 720 you can output in 1080
budget file size are really a lot bigger
and it doesn't make that much difference
and also I used to output with a mpeg-4
compressor in quicktime as a quicktime
file but now i do flash just as good in
the file sizes are incredibly small so
that's what i do again my camera fixya
canon hv 40 highly recommend it and the
less question i got this is
have a couple weeks overdue but what is
my new year's resolution my new year's
resolution is to get a hundred thousand
subscribers right now I have like thirty
five thousand or something by the end of
the year I want 100,000 subscribers and
that's just kind of if you want to know
nothing Noth nothing important but I
just want to make this video tell you
guys that pretty much I got a dumb virus
and I won't be able to record videos
other than what I can shoot in my
camcorder for a while so nothing with
the screen recorder no program tutorials
no 3d tutorials or anything like that so
I apologize once again so you probably
are going to be seeing a lot of ipod
touch soils and maybe updates like this
if i feel like it but again i apologize
but once i get my screen recorder i will
go full blast making the best tutorials
you have ever seen so thank you guys for
sticking with me thank you guys all for
supporting my channel and don't forget
subscribe and I'll see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
