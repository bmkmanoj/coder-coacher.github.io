28th C++ tutorial and in this Israel as
you can see I'm going to talk to you
guys about something called default
arguments so of course we're going to be
building a function that takes a couple
arguments and a default argument is
basically exactly what it sounds like
you know how we can have a function to
like calculate the area of something and
then the user would need to enter
arguments like length and another value
for width well they can either enter the
values explicitly or we can have a
default value already in that function
so let me go ahead and we'll build a
really basic function here just to
demonstrate this point so let's go ahead
and calculate the volume of a just
something a box or something and so we
have three arguments or three parameters
int length and width and int height so
we can go ahead and make this function
right now and well let's actually go
ahead and make this function right now
go ahead and copy this and under main
make sure you're not in main when you
make this go ahead and paste it and
calculate the volume in case you don't
know it's just length times width times
height so now we can go ahead and call
this function C out
volume and the user can enter three
values like four five and five so this
should go ahead and print out 100
because four times five is 20 20 times
five is 100 so the volume of this box is
100 so alright we have you know just a
regular function here with three values
or three parameters that it takes and
the user goes ahead and passes in those
values and it calculates it perfectly
but in order to add default arguments or
default parameters here's what you do in
your function prototype right here
instead of just having you know the
variable type and a variable you can go
ahead and set these equal to something
automatically like one what you set them
equal to one right now so if a box is
one by one by one
we can go ahead and assume that well
it's basically this if the user doesn't
enter any values explicitly then it's
going to use those default values of 1 1
and 1 so whenever we call this function
without any values check it out it gives
us the value of 1 because a box 1 by 1
by 1 has volume of 1 now let's go ahead
and say that the user enters a number
like 5 okay so the user enters a number
like 5 and it gives us the value of 5
but you're saying all right so does that
function use that 5 for length width or
height
well when a user enters one value and
you have a function that has three
default values the computer is
automatically going to assume that you
meant 5 equals the first parameter or 5
for length so if you go ahead and run
this again we get 5 that's because it's
5 by 1 by 1 so if you go ahead and enter
something like 5 &amp;amp; 6 the user is
automatically going to excuse me the
computer is going to assume that you met
5 for length 6 for width
and by default height was one so the
only thing you're really overwriting is
length in width so it's basically the
rules this you can have a function that
has default values and by default it's
going to use those values unless the
user overrides it with values of its own
whenever the user does override it with
values of its own it's going to pass
them in in order of which it would
receive them so if it has send one
number it's going to replace default
value for that number if you pass it in
to number it's going to replace the
second value for that number right there
and if you just pass it in two numbers
is going to of course keep that same
default value of one for the last one so
you get 30 for your value so of course I
just want to point out that you can you
know go ahead and add three values if
you want but you know what's the point
of having default values if you're just
going to have three parameters you're
going to pass in anyways so basically
that is how you have a function that
uses default arguments in other words
default parameters and one other thing
that people typically mess up you only
have to put the default value in your
function prototype right here whenever
you create the function in the function
body itself down here you don't put the
values down here because you already
sent all right if I don't explicitly
pass in any values I want to use these
as defaults so you don't need to re-type
it right here so people get this wrong a
lot so don't forget to you know just
remember that simple rule so now you
understand the basics of having default
values in your function why they are
useful in how you can pass in a
different number of functions like six
or six and five or six and five and
seven and it will all work fine
basically whatever you pass in it
replaces the rest with the default
values so that's all I have for you guys
for this tutorial hopefully you
understand if you don't just go ahead
and ask me one of the questions on my
forum the new busting comm slash forum
and I will be more than happy to answer
it for you guys so thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and I'll
see you guys in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
