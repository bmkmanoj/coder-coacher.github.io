geometry series so for our last lesson
we're just gonna do some more proofs
okay so we're given that BA D is
congruent to CE da so b 8d which is this
big angle here is congruent to CE da
which is this big angle here and angle
one is congruent to angle 4 and they
want us to prove that this angle is
congruent to this angle okay so first
thing we're gonna do is rewrite our
given
and Gobi AG congruent to angle CDA and
go one current angle for and that's our
given okay so if you remember what we
did when we first started learning
geometry we learned this postulate that
the measure of this big angle is equal
to the measure of each one of these
little angles and same for this one so
the measure of angle B ad is equal to
the measure of angle one plus the
measure of angle two and in the same
step the measure of angle CDA is equal
to the measure of angle four plus the
measure of angle three and that's our
angle addition property addition
property of angles okay so since we know
that these two angles are congruent we
can say that they have equal measures
same thing with angle 1 and angle 4
because if congruent then they are also
equal and then using substitution we can
get angle measuring one less measure of
angle 2 equals measure of angle 3 plus
measure of angle 4 and that's by
substitution because we're gonna
substitute since we know that these two
are equal and we know that this equals
this and this equals this we can
substitute each pair of these angles
into this equation so then using our
addition property of equality we can get
the measure of angle 2 equal to the
measure of angle 3 addition property of
equality because since we know that this
is congruent to this or this equals this
in order for this statement to be true
these two have to also be equal so in
our last step we get angle 2 congruent
to angle 3 for the opposite of this
if equals then they are also congruent
ok so we have one more proof we're gonna
do and it's using parallelogram so we
know that a b c d is a parallelogram and
angle 1 is congruent to angle 2 and D F
is congruent to EB so first we're gonna
rewrite our given a base
parallelogram Engel 1 congruent angle 2
DF congruent to EB and that's our given
okay so since we know that ABCD is a
parallelogram that means that it has
opposite sides that are congruent so
that means we can get this congruent to
this piece right here so ad is congruent
to B see if parallelogram then opposite
sides are congruent ok so now I can get
this angle congruent to this angle
because we know it's a parallelogram and
parallelogram halves have opposite
angles who are congruent so angle a is
congruent to angle C if parallelogram
opposite angles congruent so now we have
a side congruent to an angle congruent
to an angle so we can get these two
triangles congruent triangle d AE
congruent to triangle bc f by angle
angle side and then we can get this
congruent to this
de congruent to b f if triangles are
congruent their corresponding parts are
also congruent and then finally since I
know that one pair of I was told one
pair of opposite sides are congruent and
we just proved the other pair congruent
we can say that EB F D is a
parallelogram if two pairs opposite
sides are congruent then it is a
parallelogram so like I said this is the
last video for our geometry series but
make sure you check out our other series
is and next we're gonna do algebra 1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
