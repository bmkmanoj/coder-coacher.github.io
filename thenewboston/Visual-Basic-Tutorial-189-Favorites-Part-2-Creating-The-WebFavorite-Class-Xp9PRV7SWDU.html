slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're gonna
continue working on my favorites so
before we get started I just want to
give full credit to the authors of
beginning Microsoft Visual Basic 2008 by
Theron Willis and Brian Newsome
published by rocks because I don't want
to take credit for this they made this
program I'm just using it as a teaching
tool so that you guys can learn about
programming and how to and a lot about
object-oriented programming is which is
what we're focusing on in these
tutorials so let's come over here to
favorites view at YouTube and we'll add
a class so if you don't know where we
are right now or what we're doing then
you may want to move back to the start
of this series so we'll just call this
class web favorite
go ahead and click Add so here's our
class web favorite now we want to be
able to dispose of items in web favorite
and we want to be able to use the using
keyword so that we can conserve
resources and memory so in order for us
to be able to dispose and use the using
keyword we need to implement eye
disposable so when you press one when
you press ENTER after typing implements
eye disposable you can see it adds this
region for you and that has a whole
bunch of stuff and you don't really have
to know what that does you just have to
know it'll allow us to dispose of
objects that we create from this class
so now let's go ahead and below the eye
disposable support inside of our web
favorite class let's create some public
variables so we'll make a name so public
name as string and they'll do public URL
as string so the name is gonna be the
name of the favorite the name of the
website and the URL is gonna be the URL
of the website so let's go ahead and
create a method and we'll call it load
and this is gonna take a an argument so
the argument is going to be file name as
a string so in order for us to be able
to open and read files and write two
files that we're going to use with file
name we're gonna have to import system
dot IO so imports system dot IO so now
we can open files and write to them and
read them and so on so now I need to
make some variables that we can use in
this method so we'll have string data as
string and what this is going to do a
string data is going to hold the content
of our favorites file now the your
computer has a file in it for internet
explorer and it stores all of your
favorites
for you well it doesn't or all of your
favorites let me rephrase that it's got
a folder that still stores all of your
favorites and these are stored in
different files each so the string data
is going to hold the strings that are in
those files that contain your favorites
and then we're going to do we're going
to create a an array of string so string
lines as string now the favorites files
that you have on your computer they are
split up into different lines let me
just go ahead and find one for you so
you guys can see what they look like
well it looks like I couldn't I can't
find a way to open the text of these
files right here without creating a
whole new application that will read all
the text but basically what is in these
URL files these internet shortcuts is it
has the base URL and then and this is
all separated on different lines as base
URL has the URL the icon file the icon
index and other stuff that has
information about the URL of the website
so we'll go and close out of that so the
string lines array is going to hold each
of the lines in this text file that
we're gonna load it's not really a text
file but we're reading the text from a
favorites so let's go ahead and we will
start adding some more so we're going to
need a variable called string line so
string line we're going to be using
string line in a for each loop to go
through each of the lines in string
lines array so now that we have some
variables initialized
we're gonna declare object file info as
a new file info and then file name so
what we've done is we've created an
object it's called object file info and
it's a type file info and it says
provides instance methods for this
creation copying deleting moving and
opening of files
so file info just gives us a whole bunch
of stuff that we can use with files and
we're gonna get the file info for the
file name which is passed to this method
right here
so now what we want to do is set name
equal to object file info dot name dot
substring so we're getting a substring
of our file now name is going to be the
name of the website so this is going to
take some arguments we're gonna have our
start index which is 0 and for our
length we're going to do objects file
info dot name dot length minus object
file info dot and now what we need to do
is get the extension for it so we can do
this by typing objects file info dot
extension dot length okay so let me try
and explain what this does we've got our
name variable which is gonna be the name
of the website and we want to get a
substring of the name of the file file
name so file info contains the input
info for filename so we're gonna use the
object of that and get the name of the
file which is the whole file and it
doesn't include any pass so let's say
we've got Google dot URL that's our file
so we're gonna start at index 0 which
would be G and we want to go to this
ending index right here so we want the
length of the file name let's say we
have 10 minus the extension so minus the
length of the extension so dot URL would
be 3 so it's gonna be 10 minus 3 so it's
gonna go from 0 to let's say 7 so it
would just give us Google and then no
extension length so the name is just
gonna be set to the name of the website
so let's go down below this and add some
more code so what we're going to do is
we're going to split all the data in
this text file into different lines
so we'll do string lines
our array and we're going to set that
equal to string data which is the data
everything in the file so we're opening
that file I'm getting all the text from
it and we want to split it so string
data split and the first argument is
going to be an array of characters or we
can use another overload that has an
array of string so we got separator as
strings so we need an array of strings
so we'll create a new string array and
inside of these curly braces we want to
tell it where to split the items so it's
got an array and the first item is going
to read the full line and then once it
hits an in line we wanted to create a
new item that so we'll type control
characters control chars
it says the control characters module
contains constants used as control
characters so we want to use CR LF now
crlf stands for carriage return and
let's see what else stands for carriage
return and line feed so basically when
there's a new line we want to split it
split that so the first item in our
array is going to be the first line in
the string data the second item in the
array it's gonna be the second line so
whenever there's a new line it's going
to create a new object in that array so
for our options what we want to do is
just remove any duplicates so we'll do a
string split options dot remove empty
entries so if any empty I mean if any
entries go into our array that are empty
it's just going to go ahead and remove
those for us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
