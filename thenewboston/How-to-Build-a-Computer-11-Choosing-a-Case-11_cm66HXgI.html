your how build computer it's toriel and
in this story we're going to be looking
at what case to buy when we're building
the computer now the first thing that we
got to look at when building a case is
actually the motherboard because the
motherboard that you bought when
building your computer it comes with a
form factor you know what the form
factor is is pretty much the shape of
your motherboard now there are usually
three major form factors or shapes of
motherboard the ATX the micro ATX and
the ITX the 8x is a most popular the
micro ATX is the next most popular and
the ITEX is the least popular so those
are the three shapes so whatever shape
or form factor your motherboard has to
be that's what case you're that's what a
shaker case has to be just to make sure
it physically fits into your case now I
want to with a micro ATX motherboard so
this case has to support micro ATX
motherboards the next thing you got to
look at one buying a case is the actual
fiscal size of your case now this has
little to do with performance but it has
a lot to do with how much stuff you can
add into it and how much space is going
to take up in your room there are three
sizes of cases the mini case is a small
thin cases that most people turn
sideways on your desk up and set their
computer right on with those are called
many cases the mid cases are the cases
we have right here so the most popular
type of cases they're just the midsize
they have a nice variation between size
and how much you can expand how much
stuff you can put into it and on for our
Brailled we went with a mid case just as
most of the computers you buy you're
going to be using a mid case
99% of amylase in the full case is
pretty much a case that's twice the size
of a mid case don't ever buy a case like
this unless you're building like a
server like a personal home server or
something because uh there's not really
any need for it it takes up a bunch of
space and with the mid case you have
more than enough room do whatever you
want to so don't ever buy a full case
those are pretty much just for servers
even though you can fit your motherboard
into it it's like why would you so now
that we look at the form factor which is
if your motherboard can fit in and the
size which is pretty much just the size
not much more to it there is some more
thing you want some more things you want
to look at when buying a case for your
computer sides looks which is pretty
much obviously does it look cool I
personally like the all see-through
cases my computer down here you can't
see it but it's completely see-through
maybe I'll put a picture up of it maybe
not but it's see-through all the way I
like critters like that just because I
think they look cool but your looks are
pretty much a personal preference
whatever thing looks cool is up to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
