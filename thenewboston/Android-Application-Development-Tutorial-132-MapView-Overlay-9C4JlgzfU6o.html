Android tutorial for the new boss in
what we're going to be doing this
tutorial is working a little bit more
with our map stuff and quickly just to
go back to the previous tutorial where
we set our zoom functions and all that
good stuff I told you I thought there
should have been a zoom function down
here I wasn't getting it because well
there it is now but I wasn't getting it
because I don't work with Google Maps
all that much I thought I included in
the tutorial because a lot of people
asked about it but just two lines of
code we can get it so we can pan around
here and also have our zoom functions
try and get it where I live maybe not
but yeah resume function is not work and
we can pan around our map so that's kind
of what we're doing this tutorial
anyways we're going to set that up so
we're going to go into our XML here and
like I said just two quick lines of code
is going to free up our map from being
locked as is so we're going to say
Android enabled and we're going to set
this equal to be true and now it's going
to enable our map we also want our map
to be clickable because what we're going
to do is we're going to have our map if
you hold you know if you hold down on
the screen like touch the screen for
like a second or two seconds we're going
to give up give some options that the
user can do with the map so we want to
be clickable so we're going to say
clickable and we're going to set that
equal to be true because I believe by
default it's set to false and less if we
you know we set that up so now your Maps
going to be looking like this like I
just showed you guys so now that you
guys have that set up let's get into
today's tutorial what we're going to
learn about today is something called
overlays and you can think of it overlay
is some PS I've worked with like
Photoshop or some kind of you know
graphic editing software there's like
different layers and you know there's
transparent layers with an object on it
that's kind of what the overlay is for
Google Maps because you know Google Maps
is processing a lot of graphic
information so we can't do like
touch methods for google mat of the
actual main class that we have here we
need to refer to an overlay class and
that way we can put like pinpoint
locations and all that stuff in an
overlay which is basically going to be
painted over the top of the map as well
that's also we're going to handle you
know our touch methods within this
overlay so let's get it set up what
we're going to call our first overlay is
touchy because we're going to have it
handle all of our touch methods and
we're just going to say touchy class
touchy again within you know our main
class and we're going to say extends
comp or overlay and then we have to
import overlay class which comes from
kombu Gold Android Maps package and now
that we have our overlay we can do or
use some of the overlay methods such as
the on touch event and that's going to
pass in both a motion event which we can
get the action down action up we've kind
of worked with motion events before but
it also gives us a map view so let's set
that clip that let's set that method up
it's called public boolean on touch
event and again this takes a motion
event and we're going to call that E and
a map view which we're going to just
call em something like that and then we
have to spill map view like this sorry
and we're getting in an air right now
because again since we're using a
boolean statement we have to return true
or false so we're just going to return
this as false for now anyways and now we
kind of have our overlay set up which is
going to handle all of our touch events
obviously it's not doing anything yet
but we can kind of keep track of the
motion events and the map view that
working with and now what we have to do
is we need to relate or register this
overview or overlay class within our on
create method so what we're going to do
is we're going to set up a new instance
of our of our class that we just created
so we're going to say touchy we're going
to call this T and we're going to say
new touchy and then what we have to do
is we have to we're going to have a list
array of are basically a list of
overlays that we can get so we're going
to just create a list of overlays now
again just well we have to define the
type so we're going to say overlay type
of list and then we're going to call
this overlay list something like that
we're going to set this equal to our map
view which we called map and then we say
dot get overlays that's kind of set up
over of our list over overlays and then
what we're going to do is we're going to
add this touchy or this touchy instance
to our list of overlays so all we have
to do is just say over we have to say we
have to say overlay list and then we say
dot add and as you can see it adds an
overlay to our list for the most part so
we're going to click that and then refer
to our overlay which we called T and now
we have pretty much everything set up
for this overlay in the next tutorial
we're going to use these touch events to
kind of register when the person clicks
on the map whether it be a kind of a
long click like for over two seconds and
then we're going to create a dialog
where we can either say like you know
posts a pinpoint get location get
address so I don't know what we're going
to do yet haven't figured it out but as
we're going to do this that tutorial but
again this tutorial think of an overlay
as a different layer that we're going to
paint on top of her mat map and we can
you know paint stuff to that overlay
because we really can't do a whole lot
with you know a map view so this is how
we're going to achieve a
a lot of things through this overlay
when working with Google Maps so I hope
to see you guys in the next tutorial
have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
