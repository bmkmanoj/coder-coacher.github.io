video and I got some good news in this
video we are finally going to be done
with the main.css file because all we're
going to be doing is styling the search
box right here the elements inside it
rather and also styling the buttons for
the website now every button on this
website is going to have the same exact
style as you see search submit on the
login button they're all going to have
that same basic style so like I said we
only have to style this once and then
we're going to be good to go no matter
whenever we decide to use a button so
let's go ahead and before we start with
the buttons I want to style the elements
inside the search bar now the search bar
by default gives you the black in plain
old text with not very much styling so
let's go ahead and change these right
now so the first thing I want to do is
add a new class called search box so
what I want to do is whenever I apply
this class to an element the first thing
I want to do is give it a padding now I
want to give a padding of two pixels and
let me show you what happens whenever
you write something in here can you see
how the text is kind of separated from
the edge of this um text area it isn't
budded right up against the edge of it
well that's what the padding does and
also this all categories default text
isn't padded up right against the bottom
of this I just like to give it a little
bit of space I think it looks really
cool and now what I want to do is I want
to give it a border color now the border
i'm going to have one pixel solid in the
hexadecimal I already figured all this
boring stuff out is benign be DC one
yeah you guys are like how the heck did
you come up with that actually just
cheated online and I looked at a
actually this has to be at nine hello
looked at a little color chart and
that's the color I like so it has a
border and the color for this is the
color of the text now I don't want plain
black text by default I want kind of a
dark grey because it just goes with the
flow of the website so the color of the
text is 50 50 50 now like I said
going to be applying this class not only
to this right here but also this so the
color of all this text is going to
change this is going to be padded as
well so there you go there you have it
so now the only thing we have left to do
is style the buttons for the website now
what have okay how can I explain this
what I did is I already coded the
classes that we need I know I kind of
cheated but instead of taking guys
through all the little itty gritty
details about one button I'm going to go
ahead and just look at this paste all
this which i coded in between the last
tutorial and this one and explain you
guys what these things are so the first
thing is pretty much the shadow of a
button and you need three different
lines to make a compatible cross browser
the next thing I did is the default
color of the button now this entire
thing is a gradient and if you don't
know how to do gradients in CSS then go
ahead and watch my html5 and CSS stories
and you understand that but like I said
I just want to skip over these things
real quick because you know this isn't
like core information that you need to
know for the website it's just kind of a
one-time thing in you know we're never
going to make gradients again other than
the sponge so I don't want to spend a
whole bunch of time on it and other than
that I added a border radius which
rounds the button and of course thank
you for not standardized using this
because we need way more lines of code
to do this then is necessary and then I
added a border I made it an inline block
so it flows in line with the elements
and doesn't you know move down line or
anything like that the color is white
which is the color of the text the font
families Ariel the font size is 14 it's
bold now the padding to pixels 10 pixels
means the top and bottom padding are two
and the left and right are 10 pretty
much no underline and I also gave this
text a nice text shadow so as you can
see it looks like text pops out a little
bit and that's why BK because I gave it
a nice text shadow so there is your
styling for the button and remember guys
you can just go ahead and download the
CSS file and you don't have to you know
pause the video and copy everything down
just go ahead and download this file and
if you suggest any changes or have any
recommendations to make it button look a
little bit prettier go ahead and let me
know on the forum many ways this is the
main default button now aside from this
I already coded a button hover and a
button active now whenever you hover
over the button all I did is I pretty
much just changed the background so
check it out hovering over the button
pretty much the background gets reversed
where it was dark it's now light where
it's light it's now dark just lets the
user know that they are interacting with
it that's why I like to add a hover and
the last thing I did is coated a button
active now whenever they press down on
the button as you can see it says
position relative top one pixel so it
basically says okay we're going to move
it down one pixel and that's whenever
the user clicks down the button the
button shifts down one pixel and that is
just you know like i said the let them
know that they're interacting with the
button and it's working correctly like
to give them that feel of interaction
satisfaction there you go that's cool
line I'm going to end on that so anyways
thank you guys for watching don't forget
to download your files and i'll see you
guys in the next video where we are
hopefully going to be um you know what i
think i'm going to save her friend so
anyways I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
