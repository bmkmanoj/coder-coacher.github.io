first tutorial and in this series I'm
going to be teaching you how to make the
gtk applications in Python now if you
guys never heard of gtk before it's
essentially a way that you can make GUI
applications with Python so if you guys
programmed Python before and you're
getting kinda tired of those old command
line programs because you're like hey
this program is cool but who the heck is
going to buy a command-line program I
can't open up a software company and
sell like crap you have to type into a
terminal I want something with windows
with buttons with images graphics so
that's what we're going to be learning
in this video actually this video series
now another thing I want to mention
before it begin is that I am on a boon
to Linux right now so if you guys are on
Windows or a Mac and you notice
something weird about my computer like
it seems a little bit different that's
why so yep there you go
and before we actually start typing any
code we actually need to import a module
so if you're using um jetbrains IDE I'm
using Python right now but what you can
do is you can go to file settings and
don't it on let me move this so you guys
can see all right so on the left hand
side go to project whatever your project
name is project interpreter and if you
click this little green plus button in
may move this so you guys can see to
type PI G object so this is the package
that you're going to want to install so
again like I said if you're using
pycharm this is how you do it I already
have it installed so I'm not going to
hit it again if you guys aren't using
pycharm then install it using pip or
whatever method do you want you know I'm
sure you guys install these before and
again this isn't a Python tutorial you
guys need some experience with Python
before you start watching this if you
have never learned Python before then go
watch my Python tutorials so uh yeah
enough talking let's go ahead and get
started
so in this tutorial the first thing you
want to do in the first thing in every
one of these tutorials is you want to
import that thing and then I just told
you guys to install so import capital G
t K now essentially all we're going to
be doing in this example is I'm just
going to be showing you guys the basics
of how to pop open a single window
so all this window is going to have is a
closed button as you can see right here
the minimize in the maximize so in the
upcoming tutorials I'm going to be
showing you guys how to add buttons to
it how to make things happen whenever
the user actually clicks the button but
for now let's just get a window so I'm
just going to have a variable called
window and it's going to be equal to aji
TK I have to wait for it to pop up I'm
too lazy to you know type three extra
letters so there you go so this creates
a blank window object now before you
just run this there are a couple other
things that we need to do the first
thing is this window we need to connect
something to it and that is a delete
event and also gtk may quit all right so
what we did in this line of code is
we're connecting GDK main quit to a
delete event now all this is doing is it
says we want to ensure that whenever the
user clicks this close button that it
emits a delete event signal and I'm
going to be talking about signals later
on but basically for right now just
remember that this line of code says
whenever the user actually clicks closed
on the window to actually close the
window and close out of the program so
after this now that we took care of all
the kind of housekeeping stuff what
we're going to do is we're going to hit
window show all now this line of code
does is it actually displays the window
to the user so now the window popped up
on their screen but before we run this
program I'm just going to call gtk main
so you guys
that especially if you ever made a game
a game before that your program is going
to have this main loop and it's
essentially the brains behind it and we
don't really have any really smart logic
to this program right now but this is
essentially your main loop and it
essentially keeps the window open until
the user hits the X button so whenever
they run this program the window pops
open it starts whenever they hit close
as you guys are going to see boom look
at that and if you guys notice down here
of course the windows looking good
whenever they hit close everything's
running normal but check out what
happens in my little run panel you see
this immense process finished with exit
code zero whenever the program ends so
I'm going to pop this open the window
gets displayed and whenever these are
hits close then it breaks out of the
main loop and then the program ends
simple enough so that's the basics of it
and again we got a boring plane window
right now so in the next tour I'll going
to be adding some more interesting cool
stuff to it so yeah thanks for watching
and I will see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
