last video what we did is we published
our initial code to github now I have a
feeling I'm not 100% positive but I have
a feeling that this project is about to
blow up I mean this website is just
completely awesome
um everyone's going to be talking about
it telling their friends about it so I
think it's a good idea if the first
thing that we do is on our main
repository homepage we can go ahead and
add a description and also provide a
link so just go to your home page pluck
your upper slash dogs or whatever your
username is and hit edit so right here
is the area where you just give a brief
like one sentence description of what
this project is about and I'll say uh
this is a sweet web site about dogs da
wgz
now let's stick with s we'll stick with
us this time and then of course if you
have a website set up already or maybe
you're developing this project for a
company you can go ahead and paste the
company's website but I'm going to go
ahead and paste sweet dogs
edu so I'm going to go ahead and save
that and check it out now whenever
anyone is just looking at this home page
or later on if they're actually
searching and github for like websites
about dogs then they click yours and
they're going to say okay what is this
Oh a sweet web site about dogs and boom
there's a link if they want to click it
find out some more information about the
company or the project alright got that
taken care of now what we should do is
we should actually go ahead and start
making some more changes to this website
so let's look at this alright this is a
dog's web site so let's say in this
video we're just going to change the
heading right here and also this title
the subtle says the new Boston this
obviously is not the new Boston so you
just go ahead in my source code and I'll
change the title of it to a sweet dogs
and for this heading I'll say
best website about dogs ever alright so
let me just go ahead and review these
changes alright looking good best
website about dogs ever change the title
art so now we made some changes on our
own personal computer and now of course
we need to publish them to github so if
i refresh that now nothing changed so
let's go ahead and update this
repository right here so how do we do
that so if we go to github desktop and
just click the name right here
and what is this thing like log me out
every time I minimize the art so we can
see that we have one change that we
didn't publish it and if we actually
click this file so it said before the
title was the new Boston and now you
change that to sweet dogs and also you
used to have a heading that said three
column layout which wasn't very exciting
and we change that to best website about
dogs ever so of course anytime you make
a change you need to add a message and
I'll just say a change the title and
main heading and I'm going to go ahead
and commit this semester and also I'm
going to hit sync now if we remember the
last time the very first time you added
anything to repository it was called
publishing from now it's just going to
be sync because you only publish it once
when you're first pretty much creating
your repository that initial code now
that we already have code in there we
just want to sync it up and sync it up
just means update the github project
with the changes I made locally on my
own computer so click that give it a few
seconds to do its thing
dun dun dun alright now go back online
and if you refresh this I didn't refresh
your page yet check it out we only have
one commit right now and that was that
initial commit when every published our
initial code I'm going to refresh it and
it says two commits so there you go that
means that you made
two changes overall to this project the
first one was publishing your initial
code and the second one was what we just
did now if you actually click this right
here this is one of the coolest things
about github you can visually see all
the changes that were ever made to this
project throughout its entire history
now the entire history of this is only
29 minutes since I just you know made
these tutorials but it's pretty cool
because you can click each one and you
can look at the project at that point in
time so let me just click this latest
change right here and before I do I want
to break up what this is basically you
have the commit message right here and
you also have a little icon of who made
that change and right here is how long
ago they made it and it's also pretty
useful for telling how maintained a
repository is because if you have one
from like three years ago
and one from like two years ago and
that's it like wow this project you know
people probably forgot about it but if
you have a lot from like the last week
then that's a sign of a healthy
repository but anytime you want to
review the changes let's say hmmm
whatever Bucky did two minutes go just
click that and you're going to have a
little split file by default the left
one is the old version of it and the
right one is the changes that were made
to this file and if you have multiple
files they're going to be separated into
these little islands but as you can see
it says okay on index.html what it used
to be was the new Boston in three column
layout and right now after this command
what it is now is sweet dogs best
website about dogs ever so yeah that's
the basics of how to update your
repository and also how to look through
the change history and see each
individual change that was made who made
it and how long ago it was we are
learning more about github by the minute
think guys for watching I will see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
