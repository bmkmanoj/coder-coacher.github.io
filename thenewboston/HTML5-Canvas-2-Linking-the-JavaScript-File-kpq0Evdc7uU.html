canvas tutorial and in this video I
actually want to draw some text or
something very simple on the canvas by
the way before I go on I want to mention
that if you hear any weird noises in the
background
that's my dumb dog he likes to make a
bunch of noises whenever I'm making
videos and I just got him a new toy a
beaver today and it's a stuffed beaver
and it has like these squeaky things and
it's pause so any time I'm talking he
decides that it's a good idea to bite
his beaver and like that kind of sounds
weird but his beaver but he you know
thinks it's a good idea to make his
beaver squeak and they really mess up my
videos many ways I'm just gonna try to
fight through it so let's go ahead and
get started in the last video what we
did is we basically made a blank canvas
on the web page
now remember that all of the cool stuff
actually happens in the JavaScript file
all of the cool drugs in the animations
and interactivity so how do we link the
HTML file with a JavaScript file what's
actually really easy the only thing we
need to do is make a script tag of
course anything script tag and as an
attribute just go ahead and put source
file in whatever name of your JavaScript
file so mine was named Bucky J is for
JavaScript go ahead and save this and
now this is essentially a link to your
JavaScript file so anything that we
write in here is essentially included in
this file so let's go ahead and now that
we connected it to files essentially
let's go ahead and hop over to the
JavaScript file so like I said in the
JavaScript file what I wanted to do is I
basically just want to draw something
simple on the canvas just as a
demonstration now in order to do this
our JavaScript file needs to know that
we want to work with the canvas so how
do we do that well the easiest way is
just a store in a variable so there I
just go ahead and name a canvas equal
and now we come across the problem
alright we're working with JavaScript so
how does JavaScript reference HTML
elements well it actually has a built-in
function document dot in the document to
Java is basically the web page itself so
the documents get element by ID because
usually on your web page you have a
whole bunch of elements you guys here
that freaking all day and squeaking is
dumb paper you know what I'm gonna pause
the video I'm gonna take that away
because it's really annoying me one
second all right guys I took aways
beaver and I give them a bone instead
hopefully that's a little quieter so
basically where was I all right whenever
you're in JavaScript and you want to
work with a specific element in your
HTML file what you can do is you can
reference it by its ID and this just you
know helps JavaScript determine how
you're working with this are you working
with the body are you working with the
head
well actually we want to work with the
ID and the ID of the canvas which was a
canvas let me just go ahead and copy
this and paste that right in there now
whenever we use the canvas variable in
JavaScript and knows that we're working
with a canvas element in our HTML file
now after this I actually wanted to do
the exact same thing but I want to make
a variable called context and I'll talk
about this in a little in one second
because canvas is easier if I type in
then explain it
get context and I set this equal to 2d
all right now let me go ahead and
explain what the heck context is think
of a context like your it's kind of like
a really advanced awesome paintbrush it
can draw a bunch of cool things on our
canvas so basically what we want to do
is we want to say okay this canvas we're
going to be drunk 2d objects on it and
in order to draw on it because remember
a canvas is just like a piece of paper
you can't draw with a piece of paper you
need something to draw on that piece of
paper and that's the context so
basically the context allows you to draw
cool things on the canvas so now the
first thing we want to do is we want to
actually say change some settings for
this context the first thing is the font
so context
font because remember for this
demonstration what we're going to be
doing is we're just going to be drunk
some very simple text on the canvas so
the first thing I want to do is set the
font and I'm just going to set this to
32 points Arial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
