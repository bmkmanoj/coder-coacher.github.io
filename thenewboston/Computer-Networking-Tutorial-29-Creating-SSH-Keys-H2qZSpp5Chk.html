our server the next thing we need to do
is we need to create those SSH keys for
them so you can actually log in and
connect to the server so again this is
how it's going to work
whenever you use SSH you have two keys
one is called a public key and one is
called a private key now the user is
public key it goes on the server and it
just stays on the server now their
private key it gets stored on their own
computer their desktop their laptop
wherever they're working from now
whenever they try to connect to that
server it's going to look at the private
key and it's going to look at the public
key and if they fit together using this
special algorithm then that user is
going to have access to the server so
we're not going to be using that
password that we saw in the email
anymore that's how it's going to work
and again SSH is little bit more complex
than that but that's the bare bone
basics of it all right
sounds cool so how do we make these keys
well check this out
there's actually a program that came
with if I can find it
putty called putty Jen so I can go to
start putty putty Jen and this is a
program to generate keys so what type do
you want to generate this SSH these are
just different algorithms or formulas
but the one that we want to use is SSH -
- RSA it should be there by default and
if you hit generate then it says ok this
is a random key that's going to be
unique to each user so in order to give
us some random numbers as the seed you
just move your mouse over here
well maybe write your name to do maybe
draw a picture of you know whatever and
then it says okay here is your random
key so again this is the public key that
you see right here this is what we're
going to be sticking on the server so
select this select this all in just copy
it and then eventually we're going to be
pasting into that terminal whenever we
set everything up but for right now
let's just go ahead and save both of
these keys on our computer
so whenever we close out of this you
know we don't have them lost so I'm just
going to save the public key as it
doesn't really matter what its name so
droplet a1 public and you always want to
say this is a text file dot txt and
whenever you save your private key you
usually want a password to protect it
but just for this tutorial I'm just
going to skip it hit yes
so these private keys they are stored as
a special file a PPK file so I'm just
going to name this droplet 0 1 private
so now I have droplet 0 on public and
private keys both stored on my own
computer but again the only one that you
really need is your private key and the
public key you need to stick on the
server but you know just in case I lose
anything I want to have it backed up so
now that we got both our keys generated
let's just open up putty again and add
that public key to the server so the
first thing I'm going to do is actually
su which means switch user space - space
Bucky so I'm going to switch from root
to Bucky and I also want to clear this
screen because it's getting a little bit
you know jumbled up alright so you have
to put these keys in a very specific
directory in that directory it doesn't
exist on our server by default since
this is a brand-new server it barely has
any files on it so m'kay derp this means
make directory what do you want your
dirt directory or folder to be named
well dot SSH and you have to name it
this you just can't name anything you
want so we now have a folder called dot
SSH on our server and now what we want
to do is we want to give the proper
permissions so to change the permissions
that's I can change the permissions of a
directory use chmod and then you give it
a special code 700 means that owners can
read write and execute from the
directory SSH and by the way any time
you're trying to
edit permissions for a directory just
look online at all the special codes you
don't have to memorize them all so I
know that this one is 700 hits enter now
after this we're going to add a file in
this directory and this is where we're
going to be writing all of our keys so
Nano is I don't even know it's like a
text editor that's built into the
terminal it's the ugliest text editor
you've ever seen but it's the easiest
way so I'm gonna show it's not it's like
worse than notepad since it's all like
through your editor but whatever so what
file you want to open in this little
text editor if you can even call it that
SSH - authorized underscore keys let me
make sure that spell properly authorized
looking good now hit enter and there you
go look at this beautiful text editor we
have so all this file is going to do is
going to store the public keys so
remember we already copied this this
public key so if we just paste it in
using shift inserts we're only going to
see the end of it because it's this long
string but the entire thing is pasted in
so once we have our data paste it in our
public key just hit ctrl X and that
exits this now before we exit out of
this text editor saying you want to save
the data that you just entered hit Y for
yes and then hit enter to confirm it so
again whenever you made some changes and
you want to save it and then come back
here ctrl X Y and then enter alright
pretty cool now the last thing we have
to do is this we already set up our
permissions for the directory but now we
want to edit the permissions for that
authorized key file and we want to do
this so the owner can read and write to
it so chmod this is 600 700 is if you
want to execute them to 600 is just for
reading and writing without executing so
again that's Tut SSH
authorised underscore keys and hit enter
so now we have our public key setup so
what this means is that whenever Bucky
logs in he's going to pass in his
private key it's going to look at the
public key that's already in there and
if everything works out he's going to be
able to connect to the server alright
pretty cool so you can actually close
out of this are you sure you want to
close this session yep and we can
actually close out of this as well so
you may be wondering art whenever I try
to connect to the server how does it
know where my private key is I know
where I save it but how does my computer
know well actually if we go back into
all programs putty and open up this
program P AG en T I actually already
have it running so I just got to click
right click it in View keys this is your
SSH private key manager so whenever it
tries to connect using SSH it's going to
look here for all of the keys now we
already have it generated we just got to
tell it where it is so I'm just going to
hit add key and droplet 0 1 private
that's my private key and boom there you
go
now if you ever have an old one I don't
know maybe you're working for a website
and they went out of business and you
don't need any more just highlight it
and hit remove and it won't be there
anymore but this is what this little
program is now that we added it we can
close out of it and check it out so now
when we open up putty again no more
passwords needed use droplet 1 that's
where you want to connect load open who
do we want to login is we just want to
log in as Bucky and hit enter and check
it out it didn't ask us for a password
it didn't ask us for a private key we
are connected why didn't we need to type
that in because it already knew what
public keys are on a server and already
knew where to look for our private keys
so it did it all behind the scenes we
now have a secure awesome connection to
the server pretty sweet
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
