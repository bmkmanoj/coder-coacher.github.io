what's going on today we're going to be
learning about animation in After
Effects cs6 it's basic animation
techniques that you can use all the time
there's a lot of animating in Adobe
After Effects a lot of 2d and 3d and
they both have different techniques
today we'll be learning a basic 2d
animation so I was at McDonald's the
other day and I was kind of getting sick
of the same old menu I don't get it all
the time but McDonald's has been around
forever so I wanted to try to spice
things up so I heard about this new
sandwich I figured I'd try it out and it
was pretty damn good so what I did was I
got a McDouble and I was good mine with
no onions because I don't like Daniels
there and I also got a McChicken and
what I did is I put the McChicken inside
the two patties of the McDouble the two
beef patties there and what it is called
is Amick gangbanged and it's effin
delicious and it's probably like a heart
attack waiting to happen but I didn't
care that day because I was just hungry
and lazy and I just wanted something
greasy so I figured I'd just share that
with you if you guys have any other cool
concoctions from these fast food
restaurants please leave a comment below
and I'll definitely try some of them but
on to the tutorial delete this crap
there we go
so I pulled up this I downloaded this
little squishy monster here and I have
to give credit to the to the company
that made it free pick and I found it on
flat icon and I just downloaded one of
these and it came in as a PNG which
doesn't work too well with After Effects
so I went at the Photoshop and saved it
as a TIFF and saved the transparency so
that I could
do it add transparency on to the map so
I'll show you a real quick import file
and then this is the PNG and when you
see I bring it in it's got the trans the
output is the white alpha is still on
the back and that's not my want so I
just saved it as a tiff and that's how
it works it's a it's an easy way you
don't have to mess with effects or
anything so still like that under there
so basic animation you use the arrow
arrow key here to move your guy around
see and you twirl down here and you can
see the transform menu if you twirl it
down again then you get these different
settings here the anchor point position
scale rotation and opacity well the
position is what you use for moving left
to right and up to down in 2d space so
that would be on the X and y axis to
start animating you always want to click
on this little stopwatch here and that
sets a keyframe and that'll be every
time you have that stopwatch enabled
right there it'll always set keyframes
every time you move so let's move ahead
two seconds and if we move this guy over
if you hold shift he'll move in a
straight line while you're dragging if
you let go shipped he'll just he'll move
or move anywhere you want so straight
line across and now you can see he moves
so if you go in the middle here maybe
you want them to move up a little so
there we go then you got a nice little
nice little motion path there now it's
not always time efficient to always be
twirling down and going here because the
little triangle so small you got to get
right on it so the quickest way to get
to your animation to animated position
is the hotkey P while you have your
layer selected so press P position comes
up there you go easy enough so that's
the that's a basic quick tutorial on how
to animate your position and then in a
later tutorial will go over advanced
techniques so thanks for watching stay
tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
