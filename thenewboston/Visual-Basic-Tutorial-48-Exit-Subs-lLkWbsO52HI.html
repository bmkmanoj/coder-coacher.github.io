slash on live gamer for the new boss sim
and in this tutorial we're going to be
taking a look at exiting subs early now
if you're familiar with this in another
language what you can do is you can just
go ahead and type return which will exit
the method or function that you are
using now it's a little bit different in
visual basic so let's go ahead and get
started and make a demo application for
this and you're going to be learning a
little bit more than just exiting the
sub we're going to be working a bit with
a listbox in this so go ahead and select
new project select windows forms
application and then go ahead and name
it exit sub and we'll click OK so now
we're up we'll open up our toolbox and
we will add a button here and we will
set the text to exit sub demo and we'll
make it a little bit bigger and let's
just stretch it all the way across here
now we'll come down here and we will add
a list box we'll stretch it out a bit to
fill up the whole screen and we're going
to go ahead and set the name value to
list numbers and we will set in the
button name to button exit sub so let's
go ahead and double click on the exit
sub button we'll close out of our
toolbox and zoom in here now let's go
ahead and create a sub down here so
private sub count and we will just pass
a variable to it so by Val num as
integer and now what we're going to do
is we are going to increment num so go
ahead and add a while loop so we'll go
ahead and do while
true then we'll go ahead and in the
while now what this is going to do is
it's going to run this while loop
forever because we typed while true and
then all it's always going to be true it
can't possibly be false so we'll go
ahead and type num plus plus now if we
go ahead and come up here we'll create a
variable so dim number as integer and
we'll go ahead and set that equal to ten
and starting it my language is confused
there we'll do num plus equals one and
every time we add one to num we're going
to go ahead and access our list box so
we'll type list numbers and then we'll
add a dot and we'll type items and add
so list numbers that items I add and we
will just add num to that now what we're
going to do is we're going to add an if
statement so if num is greater than
let's say 54 get rid of this parentheses
right here so if num is greater than 54
then go ahead and exit sub so now what
we're going to do is we are going to
call the count sub so we'll just count
and then we'll pass number to it so what
this is going to do is whenever we click
the exit sub demo button right here it's
going to create a variable called number
and it's going to set that equal to 10
then just going to call our count sub
now what this does is it runs an
infinite while loop and now it is ok for
us to use an infinite loop right here
because we have an way for it to exit
the loop if a value is or if something
is true so if num is greater than 54 and
if that's true then go ahead and exit
the sub which will exit
while loop so now what we'll do is since
we since I just explained what we didn't
count
we call it count and pass number to it
because we have to have an integer value
to add to pass to count now if we go
ahead and run this we can go ahead and
click exit sub demo and you can see here
that we get starting at 11 and it goes
all the way up to 55 now the reason it
goes up to 55 is because down here in
our count sub it will add 1 to it before
and then check if it's greater than 54
so it is equal to 54 when we hit this
and it comes back up here and it's equal
to 55 and then it's going to exit our
sub so you can see it has all of these
values right here now you can also use
this with a function so go ahead and you
can create a couple subs or functions
and you don't have to use a loop in them
you can do whatever you want practice
exiting the subs based on a certain
condition and once you got that down
then you're not going to forget it go
ahead and move on to the next tutorial
