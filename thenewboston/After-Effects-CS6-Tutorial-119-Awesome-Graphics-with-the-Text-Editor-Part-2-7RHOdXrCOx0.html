this time each word is going to animate
on instead of each letter so how many
words are there one two three four five
six seven so this should be at seven at
the end here and our ending will be at
seven also so now our our letters are
our words are going to animate word by
word so that's cool there now we've got
the mode here which tells how the words
are going to animate on so I have ad
right now that means the words are
coming on right now
now if I want to change if I change this
subtract and I preview it now the words
are going to subtract out
and then you can mess with these other
modes here and figure out what they do
I'm just gonna go over those two real
quick because those are the most
important ones
now amount is just the amount that
everything happens you don't really need
to mess with that too much the smooth is
here is the next one that I want to go
over so I have a smoothness at a hundred
percent let me change this back to add
because we want the words to animate on
if I change to smooth this to zero and
do my animation you'll see that they
just pop on so that's how the smoothness
works if I put it at 50% you guys will
see that it it just is a lot faster and
it's not as smooth when they pop on so
that's what smoothness does put that
back up at 100% now we've got the ease
high in ease low here these are kind of
like your easy ease keyframes almost so
if I animate this ease low to 100% it's
gone the text is gonna start out fast
but then ease in when it's a animating
so that looks pretty pretty nice
actually now if I go the opposite way
and put the east load 100 or zero and
the ease hide 100 it's gonna start out
slow and then just go animate on at the
end faster
as you can see there just let it go
again so you can see it again there we
go so that's how those work so I'm gonna
keep this at zero hang up at the ease
low at 100 because I like that look a
little better now when our text is
animating on here it seems to be each
each it seems to be animating each
pretty much each letter at the same time
instead of animating them all together
from the same point they're animating
out from their from their letter if you
understand what that means I'll show you
when I come up here too I'm gonna close
the advance a little I'm gonna come up
two more options and we have these more
options up here and then we have this
one called anchor point grouping if you
click on it and I move to the end here
you can see that all these little X's
show up this is where the anchor point
is for each letter and space and this is
how it's going to animate up I can
change the anchor anchor point grouping
to word and now the anchor points are
here at the at the end here or in the
middle of the words and instead of each
each set of letters animating from the
anchor point it's going to animate from
the center of the word now now I'll send
you I'll do a ram preview for you there
so we got that going on now that looks a
little better than what we just had I
put it I mean what looks good what
doesn't always depends on your project
so now we can change the anchor point
here of the where the words animate from
by moving this grouping alignment here
and if you watch the little X's in the
comp screen I'm gonna move the X's to
the left by scrolling scrubbing to the
left on my access point here and they're
gonna animate from this corner now
so there we go
now one of the cool things is you can
add more animation animators or
animation properties to this type of
animation so if I come to this Add
button here right next to my animator
not close my more options right now and
I click Add property I can add something
like the opacity to this and if I set
the opacity down all the way now now the
enema the opacity is going to animate on
along with the scale as you can see this
is not opaque it has some transparency
in it because the opacity is also
getting animated on and it's going to
take on the same properties that you
have all selected in your advanced
settings and in the range selector so
you can add more properties to the range
selector which is really cool so that's
how you use your rent your animate tool
here and we can add other we can even
add everything here that we want add
blur we can add I mean we can change the
skew and everything like that we can
have them rotate in when they animate on
and everything so that's how it is your
range selector and animator properties
there that's a basic intro to some
typography here and just use that
messing around with that thing and I'll
make some more tutorials about how to
use that more in-depth and we can make
some really cool stuff so thanks for
watching this one hope you guys learned
some cool stuff and I hope you guys have
a nice day see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
