little bit and we're going to talk about
the perimeter of polygons now the
perimeter of a polygon is the distance
around the outside of the figure and if
you remember we did some stuff about the
perimeter of a triangle and the same
kind of rules apply to find the
perimeter you just add up the distance
around the shape so the perimeter of
this shape would be 4 plus 5 plus 4 plus
5 5 plus 5 is 10 4 plus 4 is 8 10 plus 8
is 18 so the perimeter of this polygon
is 18 so now we're going to do some
examples find the perimeter of these
polygons well if you look at this
polygon it has four right angles
opposite sides are parallel so that
means that it's a square and that
opposite sides are congruent and because
it's a square that means all sides are
congruent so every one of these sides
has a measure of five so to find the
perimeter of this we're going to take we
have one two three four sides at each
measure five so we're going to take four
times five and you get 20 so when you
find the perimeter of a square you take
for the perimeter is equal to four times
the length of one side but it's only if
it's a square so now we have this funny
looking arrow right here and we need to
find the perimeter of it so the
perimeter is equal to one plus four and
I don't know if you can see it but this
little side right here its measure is
one plus five plus five
plus one and this if you look if you
were to draw that in this would be a
little square so that means the link of
this side has to be four so plus four
plus 11 plus 4 is 5 plus 1 is 6 plus 5
is 11 plus 5 is 16 plus 1 is 17 plus 4
is 21 plus 1 is 22 so the perimeter of
this shape is 22 okay so we have two
more examples to find the perimeter and
they give us this little note right here
that this is a regular hexagon now if
you remember a regular any kind of shape
any kind of polygon means that all the
sides are congruent so a regular hexagon
means that every one of these sides has
a measure of 8 centimeters so like a
square that has a special little
perimeter formula any regular polygon is
going to have a special perimeter
formula because you can just take the
number of sides times the length of a
side of one side and you'll get the
perimeter so the perimeter of this there
are six sides in a hexagon so six times
and the measure of one side is eight so
the perimeter is equal to 48 and this is
the first problem that's given us unit
so that means we have to make sure our
answer has units on it as well so this
isn't a formula you really need to know
because when you add up all the sides
it'll still give you 48 it just makes it
quicker sometimes so we know that we
have a star right here and all these
little tick marks that means that every
single one of these sides are congruent
so I'm going to count how many sides we
have for this star we have one two three
four five six seven eight nine ten so
the perimeter this is equal to the
number of sides times the length of a
side so p is equal to 60 inches now this
kind of formula only works if it is
either a regular regular polygon or all
the sides are congruent which is true of
a regular polygon so that's all we're
going to do with perimeter for today but
make sure you come back because in the
next lesson we're going to talk about
perimeters and ratios</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
