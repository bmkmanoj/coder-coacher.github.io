thing that we want to install is the CPU
cooler also known as the heatsink or
just a basic cooler so what came in my
box are these two parts these are for
Intel motherboards we got a AMD so we
don't need that what we do need though
is this the only other thing that came
in here and this is um I call a heatsink
grease people call it thermal grease go
ahead and tear this open but I don't
need to show you guys how to tear it up
and you guys probably hear that out and
mert we're going to want to do is apply
it right here so apply it right there
and spread it across just like that and
what this is going to do is make sure
that once this touches your CPU it's
going to give you a nice tight cool
connection and it's going to make sure
it stays cool so go ahead and spread
that on there just like that
now let me get rid of this and we want
to go ahead and place this down right
here now there are two little clips in
two little brackets on your motherboard
go ahead and hang one clip on your
motherboard just like that and take the
other clip they're going to be hurt
there we go easy Bessie now our CPU
cooler is locked in now this this is a
different than an Intel motherboard on
the Intel motherboard there are four
plugs on either side and buttons you
press into but on AMD it has a built-in
bracket so um that's how we do that
again clip it to one side apply thermal
grease do apply thermal grease before
clip it to one side hang it over to the
other side clip it in and it actually
was a lot tougher than I remember it
being so um once we do that we can go
ahead and hook it up to our motherboard
go ahead and take this off
and this little thing is our CPU plug
for our CPU fan now there's going to be
a little thing on your motherboard and
if you read it it says CPU fan so why
don't you put a and B together go ahead
and plug that baby in make sure you
don't bend any pins and it should plug
in make sure this wire is out of the way
you actually might want to put your
rubber band back on which I'm going to
do right now just to make sure that
nothing gets in the way of your fan
so now we install our CPU fan we are
ready to move on to the next component</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
