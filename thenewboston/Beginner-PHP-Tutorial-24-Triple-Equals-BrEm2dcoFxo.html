and this is a short video created for
the new Boston now in this part of our
operators when we're looking at
operators we need to think about an
operator that doesn't just deal with
equating the value but we have to look
at the data type as well so let's just
give an example of num1 and I'm going to
equal this to one and that's in a string
so we've got a string with the value 1
now num2 and that's going to equal 1 but
as an integer datatype
so now what happens if we create an if
statement and we actually compare these
two values so let's compare num1 - num2
so we're using the double equals
operator which is a is equal to
essentially as echo equal else echo not
equal okay so this is a basic if
statement we're saying num what if num 1
is equal to num2 a co-equal otherwise
echo not equal so let's just open up our
browser and refresh and preview what we
get so we've got equal here so we're
essentially saying that 1 does equal 1
however if you look at this from a
logical point of view we've got 1 as a
string so we've got our single quotation
marks rounder and one here is an integer
so this is in fact a number this is in
fact a string now what PHP has done is
it's dealt with this as a 1 in itself
and it's dealt with this is a 1 in
itself so they're essentially the same
character even though this is an integer
and this is a string so therefore it's
saying that they are equal then what
happens if we want to say is num1
actually equal to num - you know in
reality if I was to say the number 1 or
a picture of the number 1 they are the
same thing but we need to think about
the difference between numbers and a
graphical representation so a string of
something so for this we use the triple
equals comparison
operator so instead of putting two
equals remember equal is an assignment
operator this is a comparison operator
triple equals is also a comparison
operator
but what triple equals does is it will
compare not just the value but it will
also compare the data type so if the
data type does not match in this case
using the triple equals then we'll eat
with it we're going to be air coming out
not equal because this statement here
will be validated false so let's give
that a go let's come and refresh okay so
you can see that now just by adding in
that extra equal symbol we're now saying
not equal so we now know that one as a
string data type is not equal to the
number one so why is this useful and
when might you use it that was useful
for the obvious reason that we may want
to convert we may want to keep our
comparisons as literal as possible we
won't say it must equal the number 1
must equal number 1 now for example if I
was submitting form data and I was to
type in a number 1 and we were comparing
it to number 1 as in a 1 we wouldn't use
the triple equals operator we would
compare it like this because this is
still the number 1 so there's places you
can use it in places you can't use it I
mean a lot of people tend to use it even
when they don't actually need to but
it's just for added sort of comparison
integrity if you like so you'll find
that perhaps in in other instances you
find this other times you may need to
use the triple equals especially in some
of my tutorials as well I tend not to
use it a lot but in things like dealing
with files as well we might need to use
it as a literal so this is the triple
equals a comparison operator and
hopefully you will find some use for it
when you are comparing exact values and
you want to check data types as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
