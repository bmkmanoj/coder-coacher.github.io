and just wanted to make a real quick
video to let you guys know about another
teacher give away i'm having this time
i'm giving away 100 as you can see they
are white playing t-shirts but they save
the new boston and cool it's kind of
like a worn-out i don't know if you can
see it let me hold it a little closer a
little worn out letters right there so
how cool is that i'm giving away 100 of
them and i have sizes small through 3x L
so a little bit for everyone so just
like the last contest the rules are
pretty much the same the only thing you
need to do to be eligible is you need to
be a subscriber to my channel I want to
give them way to my subscribers because
those are people who support my channel
and watch on my video so my way of
saying thank you to you guys and I sell
a lot of guys had questions in the last
video the first question was will I ship
them internationally yes anywhere you
live in the world I will ship it to you
as long as your subscriber doesn't
really matter where so everyone in the
world is eligible to win now another
thing is do I have to pay for shipping
or the cost of the teacher or anything
like that no I'm going to cover the cost
of shipping and the cost to make all the
t-shirts I making myself actually so I'm
going to take care of all that the only
thing you need to do if you want to win
teacher is first like I said you need to
be subscriber subscribers only and if
you're not it's easy one click of a
button the next thing you need to do is
through youtube or google+ you can
private message me your full name your
address and make sure you include your
country if you live overseas and also
your shirt size a lot of people have
been forgetting their shirt size so i
can't send them to you because we're not
going to right everyone back so guys
sorry I'm a little bit tired because I
just ran down here and I need to hurry
up and make a video so i can go watch it
and they chill playoffs that are
starting tonight right anyways like i
said if you want to win then private
message meet your phone name your
address in your shirt size make sure
your subscriber and 100 people are going
to be receiving in the mail brand-new
