the server and actually I already filmed
this tutorial but in the middle of it
someone actually called me so now I have
to redo this and show you guys again
so anyways once you get your email it
gives you all the information you need
to log in so this is the IP address you
can actually copy that right now we're
going to need it and this is the default
username and the default password now
once we actually log in to the server
then we're going to be changing all
these for security reasons but for right
now there you go now in order to connect
to the server remember I told you guys
that we're going to be using SSH now
there's a lot to cover regarding SSH and
what I would eventually like to do is
take a whole tutorial series and devote
it just to covering every single detail
about SSH but for right now I just want
to go over the bare basics of how to set
it up and connect to the server because
this isn't really SSH tutorial it's more
of a tutorial on how to you know work
with an administrative cloud server so
for now I'm just going to go through
this real quick go to this webpage right
here
WWWE GRE green ended or UK all that
stuff and what we're going to be doing
is we're going to be downloading and
installing a program called putty so
this gives us a bunch of tools to pretty
much do everything we ever want to do
with SSH so this link right here
it's the installer it's the easiest way
to install it so just click this
download it and then once you have the
file downloaded double click and run it
and it's going to pop up a wizard just
keep all the default settings next next
next
the only optional setting that I chose
whenever I was installing it is I chose
to add an icon to the desktop so if you
don't do this then you're going to have
to go through your Start menu but either
way it's going to give you this program
putty now whenever you double click this
as you can see I already have everything
set up but let me delete this because my
stupid friend had to call me art so
whenever you first open yours then this
is what it's going to give you so the
first thing we have to
is the IP address all right let's say
this is the IP address of the server
we're trying to connect to so I'm just
going to copy that and paste it in there
now you want to keep the default port is
22 right now yes we're using SSH and
also another thing that you want to do
is you want to save these settings so
I'm just going to say this is droplet 0
1 and hit save and all this does is it
says ok whenever you open up putty again
actually let me show you so say we you
know we're doing our thing came back to
putty trying to connect again we just
have to choose whatever session we have
saved and load it in and check it out
all of our settings are right there for
us so it's pretty much just the easy way
so we don't have to type in our IP
address every time but I'm lazy so there
you go so after this we're just going to
hit open and it's going to connect to it
now the very first time you're connect
you're going to get this error that says
hey you're not doing this securely and
the reason for that is because whenever
you set up SSH the proper way to do it
is you need something called a public
key and a private key
now I didn't set those up yet we're
going to be doing it in just a minute
but for right now we're just using our
regular password that they gave to us by
default but whenever you get that
warning since it's the first time
connecting to our server you really
don't have a choice so we don't have
anything set up so just hit yes and then
you're going to get this screen that's
what we're looking at right now now for
the login remember the default username
was root in the default password was
this so type a root and hit enter and
now it asks for our password after the
password you can either just type it in
or we can just copy it now another thing
I want to mention is whenever you're
copying into a show you just don't hold
ctrl V like you would like you're
copying into a browser or a Word
document
you actually hold down shift and hit
enter now nothing's going to appear on
your screen because it doesn't display
for security reasons but after that hit
enter
and you're going to log into your
account that's going to say okay since
this is your very first time logging
into root you need to change your
password so this is just again for
security purposes the first thing that
asks for is your current password so
that's the one that we just pasted it in
so just paste it in again shift inserts
and hit enter now it says choose a new
password so choose any one you want hit
enter and there you go
so now we are in we can start typing and
running commands so again whenever I run
any command like delete file it's not
going to delete it on my computer that
I'm sitting at right now we are now in
control of the server so whenever we
install something it gets installed on
the server pretty sweet now one command
I want to show you guys is clear and
this just clears your screen it doesn't
like you're still going to be logged in
and anything you did it doesn't like
remove anything it just wipes out your
screen it makes it a little bit cleaner
so I'm going to hit clear and another
thing I want to do is this I really
don't like this big blocky green little
cursor so I like you know just a regular
cursor like you're typing into a browser
so I'm going to hit right click this
little arm windows bar at the top if
that's what it's called
who knows and go to change settings
appearance vertical line cursor blinks
and now you see my cursor I don't know
it's just a little more natural feeling
to me so we are now connected to our
server now one of the first things that
we're going to be doing is creating
those public and private keys so we can
actually use SSH properly but before we
even do that there's one other thing
that I want to do and I'm going to
recommend that you do this every single
time whenever you log into your server
for the first time right now we are
logged in as root this is the main
overall master of the entire server now
you guys may be thinking that's pretty
cool I want to have full control over
the server over all the files over
everything but the thing about using a
root user is that it almost has too much
control
in other words it's really easy to mess
something up so you always want to add
another user and give them proper
privileges then if you accidentally you
know hit like one letter on your
keyboard by accent it doesn't delete or
mess with any files so I'm going to add
user another user called Bucky in well
it doesn't have to be Bucky whatever
your name is in hit enter so it says
okay you added another user
his name is Bucky what's his password so
just gonna say whatever password boom
there you go now for all of this you can
just hit enter
why just ask for your room number I
never got that full name I know I can
kind of get you know like phone other
but room number room number come on is
the information correct yes it is all
right so we just created a user called
Bucky we gave them whatever password we
typed in and if you have different
people working on the server then you
probably want to set up an account for
each of them but there we go now take
note that we are still logged in to root
but eventually whenever we're installing
managing files setting up our website
we're going to be logged in as Bucky
because like I said it's a lot more safe
that way
now sometimes Bucky is going to need
those administrator privileges he is
going to need to access some of those
files that we wouldn't usually have
access to so in order to give him
privilege to do that we do is this type
G PA SS WD and this command is just used
whenever you want to administer group
and I'll talk to you guys about what
that means in a second but put a space
and hit minus a and this means add what
user are you trying to add to a group
we're trying to add Bucky to the group
sudo now sudo is just the administrator
group in other words what we're doing
now is we're giving Bucky root
privileges so by default whenever he
logs in he's going to have all those
safe settings but if he ever wants to
run a command
that could typically only be run by the
root user what he has to do is type sudo
and then the command so in other words
whenever he type sudo then the command
then it says run this command as root
user so now we have a user that set up
we ensure that he doesn't really mess
anything up too bad
and also we gave him root privileges so
if he ever needs access to some files he
can do that as well pretty awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
