40th Python tutorial and in this
tutorial we were showing you guys how to
get help with built-in modules now in
the last couple tutorials I'll show you
guys how to make your own modules but
there's also a lot easier way to get
modules and that's to use built in
modules now there are a bunch of
different modules that plate on go in
and one of those in one of the most
common is actually called math so let's
import math and I'll show you guys a
couple things to do with it one of the
functions that's built into the math
module is a square root function so to
use this just go ahead and put math dot
square root then put a number and it's
going to return the square root of that
number this is just to show you guys
that there's a bunch of different
functions that are built into this
module but if you're saying are a how
the heck was I supposed to know that
square root function was built into the
math module well there's a built-in
function that's in Python altogether
that's used to find out all the things
that a module contains and this is the
variables the functions other modules in
that bill and function is the dir and it
stands for a directory and whenever you
want to find out what information a
module contains just go ahead and put
the name of that module after you
imported it in the dir and go ahead and
press Enter now once you press ENTER
you're going to get a list of all this
crap and all of these things in here are
what the module math contains so again
to use that put dir and then your module
name in as its parameter and that's how
you do that in so you see all these
names but you don't really know what all
of them mean and if you're saying
alright I don't know what F sum or
radians or any of that does so I need
help even further to do that well to do
this you need another billing function
that's built into Python and that's
called the help function dir tells you
what the module contains but help with
your parameters as your module
it tells you exactly what each function
does so let's go ahead and press ENTER
and it's going to give you a huge list
of all of those function names and
variable names in module names but this
time it's going to tell you exactly what
each one does so for example say that
you didn't know what atan2 does well you
just look after your help function that
says returns the arctangent in radians
all right and if you know what all that
stuff means then good for you and if you
don't oh then you shouldn't be using it
anyways it also gives you on the list of
variables and all that stuff so again
that is how you use the dirt function to
get a list of everything that a module
contains in the help function to give
you like a definition of what each
function and variable and all that other
stuff does in a module and the last
thing I wanted to tell you guys about is
if you want to just look at a module
real easy and see what it does before
you get to using it there's something
called underscore underscore we get my
cursor out of the way do doc actually do
C stands for documentation underscore
underscore and how you use this is you
put the name of the module such as math
underscore underscore do C underscore
underscore and this is going to give you
a quick documentation of the module and
it says this module is always available
all right so what does it do it provides
access to mathematical functions so it
pretty much gives sx2 mathematical
functions defined by the C standard so
unless you don't want to go through all
that problem this is a way to give you a
quick summary of what the module is all
about so again that is how you use
import functions that already exists
excuse me modules that already exists in
your Python language how to use the dirt
function to find out all the things the
module contains how to use the help
function to give you guys a detailed
look of what each function does and also
how to use the built-in doc to give you
guys documentation
of whatever module you're looking at so
that's your quick tutorial and modules
and just to show you guys one more thing
real quick
whenever you use der with Bill in math
you're going to have come across a list
of these things a list of names the one
with underscores and right here those
are the ones that you don't usually use
in programming these are the ones like
cosine PI power radians those are the
ones that are going to use typically the
doc is pretty much stuff like help and
name these are kind of like things that
you wouldn't normally use so again
that's just a little other tidbit of
information since when you're looking at
these but wondering how to use in your
program I just don't worry about it so
again I thank you guys for watching I
don't forget to subscribe to my channel
and I look forward to teaching something
in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
