this video I'm going to show you how to
sort custom objects by any attribute
that you want so let's go ahead and say
that you were working on the social
network and you had a bunch of users
signed up and they all had like first
names last names birthdays maybe a user
ID
they also listed their favorite colors
and I don't know like how much money was
in their bank account for whatever
reason many ways these users had a bunch
of different attributes and you were
having a tough time figuring out how to
make an algorithm or function to sort by
each one so let's say you want to sort
by favorite colors or birthdays you can
do that so check this out what we're
going to do is just like before we're
going to use operator module and we're
going to import attribute getter so now
item getter by attribute getter so now
let me go ahead and make a real quick
class and I think you need two spaces
Pepe all right so class user and let me
just make dunder init and we'll say that
whenever you make a new user object
we'll say that they need a name and user
ID so we'll just say x and y all right
so self name equals x and so I'll just
name it a user ID equals y so whenever
we initialize object we'll just say like
Bucky ten or whatever so something like
that all right looking good now actually
another thing that I want to do I'll
show you guys a cool it's not really a
trick but dunder init of course that
means whenever you initialize there's
another one called ar e PR so this is a
string representation of this object so
that means let's say that you just
wanted to print out let's say that you
had um an instance of this user class
that was Bucky
so the info was just the name Bucky and
my user ID which was ten but then later
on in your code you just said print out
Bucky well then Python would be like
what exactly do you want me to print out
a about him his name or his user ID or
his name and his user ID or do you want
to print out where that object is in
memory I mean what the heck am I
supposed to know what Bucky is what you
want well that's what this is for right
here so what we can do is we can
basically just return whatever
representation we want to make and we
can make this however we want so I'll
say whenever I just say print out Bucky
then it's going to print out that
object's name and then I'll print out
his ID and I'll separate them by like I
don't know semicolons or whatever so
plus and again this user ID it's
actually going to be um an int so we
need to make sure to convert that to a
string sofie's your ID and the name of
course is already a string so that's why
we don't need to do that but again
whenever we say print out an instance or
a user object then this is what it's
going to give us so just save us a
little bit of time from formatting
everyone later on all right so now let
me go ahead and make a bunch of users
paste that in so you guys don't have to
watch me do it all so now I have a list
of user objects I have Bucky
Sally tuna Brian who's name is tuna
that's weird but actually that would be
a pretty cool name I'm gonna name my kid
tuna all right and they all have user
IDs nothing special
however what we want to do is we pretty
much just want to sort all of these
users so let's see what order they're
sorted in by default so for user in
users just go ahead and print user so
run that and check it out and again it
prints it and maybe if I add a space
right there might be a little bit easier
to see but again it prints it in the
specified order so by default and see
what's going on here prints out Bucky
Sally tuna Brian re so it prints it out
in whatever order we initialize objects
in however we want to you know make
special functions to sort them by name
and also the
our ID since whenever like you're
looking for a friend you just don't want
to look through all of them randomly
randomly wouldn't be very efficient so
check this out
let me add that little separator so they
don't cut it all jumbled together and
we'll do this for user just name it user
still in sorted and again what do you
want to sort users nothing new there
but what we're going to do is we just
don't want to sort it in the default
order what we want to do is we want to
sort it by we'll say sort them by name
first so get an attribute and in this
case we'll just type name and this is
how we can specify how to sort so just
like before we'll print user and check
this out so again what this does is it
just doesn't print them out in default
order it sorts them by their name and
then this is a lot more efficient and
again if you want to do by ID
then what I just name it user ID then
we'll just say sort this iterable by
this attribute so now we can go ahead
and run this and check it out so this is
default this one sorted by name and this
of course is sorted by their user ID two
five nine forty three sixty one and 77
so how awesome is that again a lot
easier than you may have been doing it
before oh yeah there you go in six
minutes you learn not only about
representations about how to sort custom
objects I mean this is absolutely
fantastic so think as watching I will
smell you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
