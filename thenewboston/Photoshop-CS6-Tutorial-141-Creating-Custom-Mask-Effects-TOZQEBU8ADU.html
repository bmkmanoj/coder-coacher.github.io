today we're gonna learn how to create
some custom layer mask effects in
Photoshop cs6 just like this kind of
custom masks around the edge that I've
got going on here so let's go ahead and
start out that so go ahead and load up
an image and make sure that it's not a
background layer anymore and make it
into a layer and then go ahead and
create a new layer and fill it up with
any color that you want I'm gonna fill
this layer up with black and it's behind
this other layer so when we cut out our
mask we're gonna be able to have
something to compare it against go ahead
and make a selection and you could just
make a square box if you would like
it'll work so we'll go ahead and do that
and then click on your image and create
a layer mask so we've got our layer mask
here make sure your mask is selected and
that that layer is selected as well and
come up here to filter and then come to
filter gallery which is right here now
you can use these different kinds of
filters in the filter gallery to affect
the edges of your mask or other parts of
your mask now this one in particular is
under the brush jokes folder and it's
called sprayed strokes now you can click
on that and you can see the it will
effect the edge of the mask you can mess
with the different lengths and
everything like that here and the radius
to give yourself some different looking
styles and just go ahead you can go
through and look at all these different
things we've got some distortion here
this is ocean ripple here's glass all
that stuff I'm gonna stick with the
spray strokes because I think it looks
cool and then I'm just gonna hit OK and
now you can see that the custom effect
has been applied to your layer mask
now if you really wanted to go that in
there and really really fine-tune this
you can use your brush tool no you can
make it smaller or bigger if you want
and go ahead and paint in some black and
you can really give yourself some new
kind of really custom effects that just
don't use the filter but obviously what
I just did was awful looking and it
would probably be better to just use a
rounded rectangle tool too at first to
get like rounded corners but I'm just
showing you how you could create custom
layer masks by using filters and as
using your paint brush as well now if I
was working really hard on this I
probably wouldn't use my brush for the
edges I'd use some kind of selection
tool to get nice crisp rounded edges but
that's I'm just trying to show you how
to do it but that's how you can go ahead
and create custom layer masks effects
make sure you go into make sure you have
your mask selected filter and then
filter gallery and then you can go ahead
and look at all the things you can also
use some of these different effects here
such as I showed you how to use the
Gaussian blur and to create some
transparency so if I went ahead to did
that you can see that it's becoming
transparent and you can I'm showing you
this because you can apply more than one
effect to your layer masks to create
more unique layer mask effects so that's
all I had to show you for that and
hopefully you guys learned something see
you in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
