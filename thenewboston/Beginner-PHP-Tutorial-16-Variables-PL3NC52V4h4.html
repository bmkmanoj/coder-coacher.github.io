this is a video tutorial on PHP
variables for the new Boston now if
you've programmed in any other
programming languages you'll know what
variables are and you'll understand what
they do that you have to assign values
to variables and there's different types
of variables now in this video I'm going
to be showing you how to create
variables by assigning value values to
our standard structure that we use for
variables and then how to echo them out
to the browser so usually in programming
languages such as JavaScript anything
like that you'd have to use a keyword
such as var then what you do is you type
the name of the variable and then you'd
assign a value to it so in this case it
would be var name equals Alex and this
would be surrounded to show that it's
string data now same as if you would say
save our age equals 21 that would be
exactly the same example
however in PHP we don't really need to
use any keywords to define anything all
we really need to do is use dollar sign
notation or variable start with the
dollar sign they can either start with
an underscore or a character an
alphanumeric character circum it can be
upper case it can be lower case or in
fact it can be it can start with a
number that can't consists of just a
number so if we were to say create a
variable here called text and we could
make that equal to hello world so the
notation that we've used is we've used
the dollar sign to start our variable
notice we haven't specified what type of
variable it is it's not a string
usually we might have to use a string
keyword we've just used dollar sign text
equal so we're signing a value to this
variable here and the value that we've
assigned to some string data a nice
hello world inside there now we could
say
and a sign we want to create a variable
with a number so we could type number
equals and without using quotation marks
because if we were to put say a number
in here this is now classed as string
data so if we take it out you can see
that my text editors turned it red and
we're just dealing with a numeric value
an integer value and as well as integers
you can also use a floating value so you
can use decimal points within so we
could have a hundred point five for
example but for now I'm just going to
work with integers we also have things
like boolean values which is equal to
true false and it is equal to this a
boolean for true would be the same as
one it just means that something's true
so we can use that later on when we work
with if statements and things like that
so we've got our variables but how we're
going to output them now there's one
easy way to output variables and that's
just to put an echo straight in the
middle so what or at the start sorry so
what we're doing and just add a false up
in here what we're doing is we're
echoing out essentially the assignment
of the very the text to the variable and
here we're coming out the assignment of
this integer to this variable but this
will work so if we have a look and
refresh you can see that we've got hello
world and then the number 100 printed
now this is a not a great way to do
things because what we want to do is we
want to declare the variables up here
and what with our assignment and then
here we want to display them to the user
so for example I could say echo text and
we can refresh our page and you can see
that that's just echoed out our single
variable text so we're just echoing text
don't forget your line terminator as
well we can echo number so if we refresh
we've got 100 there
so we've just basically echoed out a
number now as you're programming and you
find different uses for storing
different things for example you might
want to take the users age
or take the users name you'll find that
you will be storing things or you'll be
storing string data and you'll be
storing numerical data as well so
integers floats things like that so in
actual fact it's so easy in PHP because
you don't need to think about what data
you're storing you just need to use the
notation with the dollar sign the
variable name following the rules and
then just the value to the variable so
you can see that PHP variables are in
fact really easy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
