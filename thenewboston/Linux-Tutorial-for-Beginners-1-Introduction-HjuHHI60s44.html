and welcome to your very first tutorial
in Linux now in this video series I'm
going to be showing you guys how to do a
whole bunch of cool stuff with Linux but
before we begin I probably should answer
this question what the heck is Linux
well Linux is an open source operating
system all right what does that mean and
why would I care about it well you
already know what an operating system is
Windows is an operating system um if
you're on a Mac you probably have OS 10
as your operating system an operating
system is pretty much the core component
that any you know personal computer
needs in order to work so normal users
really don't care about these because
they usually work behind the scenes and
do stuff like handle memory and you know
handle devices like whenever you plug a
USB flash drive into your computer and
like I said normal users are like who
cares as long as it works whatever but
to developers in like server
administrators they really want to learn
about this thing called Linux because
not only is it a different type of
operating system but it's open source so
what's the benefit of having an
operating system that's open source well
check it out the people at Microsoft
whenever they make Windows or people who
make OS 10 they write the code in all
that code that they used to write it
it's hidden now Windows and OS 10 don't
get me wrong they have lots money and
they made awesome operating systems I
love them I have computers that have
Windows and OS 10 both on it but here is
the problem that I have with these
operating systems first of all whenever
the people of Microsoft and Apple are
making these operating systems they
write the code and they just give you
the CD or it comes pre-installed on your
computer but you really don't know how
the operating system is made or the
source code behind it so the problem
with that is how do you know that you
know everything is secure like it should
be programmed properly and there aren't
any backdoors shout out to the NSA if we
can
me so how do you know that you know
there are no issues like that well you
don't you can never see the source code
so you just kind of have to trust these
companies now another it's not really
issue but it's kind of a problem that
you have is what happens when you want
to change something on your operating
system what happens when there's a bug
that you want to fix or maybe there's
just something about it that you want to
customize well with Windows in Mac OS 10
you can't really do that so you're
pretty much stuck with what they have
sure you can pick like Windows 7 8 or 10
but that's pretty much all the
flexibility you have so that is where
Linux comes to the rescue
so not only is it completely free but
it's completely open-source as well this
means that all of the code that they
made to create this operating system you
can see you can actually just copy it
and change a few things and you can
release your own version of Linux called
Linux if you want and since it's
open-source instead of a company of
people working on it you have the entire
world that can you know fix bugs make
updates and add features make
improvements to it so it's pretty
stinkin cool so sounds pretty awesome I
mean a Linux alright sounds pretty cool
let's go ahead and play around with it
but here's the problem you see there is
no way in the world I am uninstalling
Windows and installing Linux no matter
how cool it is because I got a bunch of
stuff on my computer I don't want to
mess with any of my files got all my you
know pictures from my girlfriend on here
so what can we do well you have a couple
options so just like any operating
system what you can do is you can just
install it as your main operating system
so you can uninstall Windows and install
a distribution of Linux and oh shit I'll
show you guys what distribution means
later on but you can do that but that's
going to be a pain so instead what I'm
going to recommend is this in this
tutorial series and if you're just
getting started with Linux I'm going to
show you guys how to install something
called a virtual machine now a virtual
machine is pretty much a computer
within a computer what the heck am I
talking about well whenever I show you
guys how to set up this program what it
is is going to allow you to pretty much
host an entirely separate operating
system within windows or within your Mac
so that way we can you know install
Linux we can you know install games on
it have a whole bunch of files txt files
if we accidentally you know delete the
entire core operating system then it
doesn't affect our main and this is
called a host operating system so it's
entirely sandboxed entirely separate
from our main computer in that way we
have a nice safe environment alright
that sounds much better so how do we get
this a virtual machine well there are a
couple different virtual machines
VirtualBox is one of the most popular
ones but I like the virtual machine from
VMware so if you go to VMware comm and
this is entirely free by the way click
on downloads and if you scroll down
until you see where you at where you at
where you at right here VMware Player so
whenever we click this this is the
product that allows us to pretty much
have virtual machines or have separate
operating systems within our operating
system so pick what one you want to
download and I'm going to download mine
for Windows don't download one for Linux
because if you're already on Linux in
this tutorial then you know you don't
even install Linux within Linux but I am
on Windows so I'm going to click
download and let it do its thing
so once it's downloaded double-click it
to open it and this is just a wizard so
if you ever installed anything this is
going to be a piece of cake
click yes you minimize this and another
thing I want to point out I read this
before but I never really had problems
with it some people say that they have
problems installing this whenever they
have USB drives plugged into their
computer so before you run this
installer unplug every USB drive from
your computer again I personally never
had a problem with it
some people say so you know just giving
you guys the heads up all right so
continuing just click Next Next where
you want to install it default location
looks good and check for product updates
on start why not make sure we have the
most up-to-date version and we want to
send them anonymous now I think I'm good
and click Next and you want to create a
desktop on or do you want to create a
shortcut on your desktop yes I do
and also in my Start menu in that way we
can just you know easily open it next
and continue and that is it how easy was
that so once it's done click finish and
drag this over see you guys can see and
we now should have this shiny new icon
on our desktop so we can click it and
boom there we go
so you're not going to have any of these
in fact let me remove these so let me
just remove it from the library so yours
is going to look like that the reason
that I had those is because I had
virtual machines before actually just
uninstalled this and installed it for
the tutorial but you're now ready to
create a new virtual machine and this is
pretty much a new virtual computer
within your computer but don't click
this link yet because um we don't even
have an operating system yet so before
we setup our new computer we should go
ahead and download Linux so our computer
actually has something to do so close
out of this and I'm going to show you
guys how to download Linux right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
