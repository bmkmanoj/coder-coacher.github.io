really matter about placing just yeah
but let's just go to this example let's
just say you only wanted names in this
first div but you wanted places in this
second div the accept options basically
allows you to only allow specific groups
of objects so by class to be dropped
into particular elements so we're going
to be using the example that only these
two names are going to be allowed to
drop be dropped into here but London the
place is not going to be allowed to drop
into here so let's go ahead and change
around our code inside here I'm
essentially just going to allow both to
be draggable so both of our class names
so name and place to be draggable so we
say name comma and then place so now
that we have name and place draggable
these are both draggable and london is
also draggable as well that's the place
so we've got name and place that are
both draggable containment is within the
document and they both revert back to
their original position so now that
we've done this we've made our drop area
which is a div droppable however now we
can specify which class we want to
accept so I'm going to choose to only
accept class name so now that that's
happened we can go ahead and test this
out now when I drop dragged London over
here you'll see that nothing happens
however when I go ahead and drag oh no
that's not worked
it is dots name when a drag London over
nothing happens when I drag Billy over
which is a name we get this border so
that's allowed the drag will allowed the
drop so London doesn't change the
outside because remember we specified
the hover class here because this only
accepts name none of these will be valid
well this one at least won't be valid
the tolerance will still be valid but
hover class will only add this class in
when it's accept
a specific class so now that we've got
that you can start to see the use of it
for example if you didn't want places a
list of places to be dragged into here
they're not allowed to be dragged but
names are allowed to be dragged okay so
now let's take a look at some of the
events that we can apply to this to
actually make more use out of it now
we're not actually going to be creating
a list type drop box essentially what
you could do this is when you dragged
Alex over and released you could add
that name to this box and the same with
Billy you could then add that under Alex
again London wouldn't allow you to drop
it so that would be the point of the
application however you'll find this
tutorial in the example tutorials in
this series so you'll be able to
actually create a draggable and
droppable list application but for now
we're going to be looking at events so
at least we know how to handle specific
events so I'm going to create a comma
after here and come down a few lines and
I'm going to create an over event and
this is going to be a function and then
going to comma and I'm going to come
down and create an out event and that's
function again and again just keep comma
separating and the last event we're
going to take a look at is drop and
again that is a function so pull that
down there pull this up just to tidy R
and we can indent these so hopefully
that doesn't look too messy and it makes
sense to you the over functions
basically what's going to happen when
something hovers over the out function
is going to is what's going to happen
when we've hovered something over and
then we take it out again and the drop
function is going to be when we actually
release something inside of this box so
we're going to change some text inside
of this box depending on whether we've
hovered over taking an element back out
of the box or when we've dropped an
element inside of the box so over all we
won't really want to do is add some text
to our drop
how drop div so I'm going to add the
text something has hovered over me so
now when we hover something over we get
this text inside something as hovered
over me when we take it out nothing
happens it just remains as this text
here let's just go ahead and give this
some padding so it looks a bit better so
when we hover that over something has
hovered over me that's fair enough
now what we want to do is go ahead and
specify what happens when we drag a
particular element out so we again use
the selector to select drop and we apply
the text something has been dragged out
and when we refresh we can drag
something in when we drag it out it
changes to something has been dragged
out so now the last thing is the actual
drop of it so we again use this selector
to select the drop div and inside the
text something has dropped now we'll
just put something dropped now do
okay so let's hover over something has
hovered over me we can hover back out
drag back in so these work sort of in
sequence with other one we wouldn't let
go it says something dropped same with
Billy and London doesn't do it because
it hasn't got the acceptance to be
dropped in so we can't actually hover
this over and let go so these two
elements work because we've applied the
accept option and we've created these
three events that handle the dragging of
the hovering of something over something
being dragged out or or something that
is hovering being taken out of this
particular div and then we've applied an
event to see when something has actually
dropped inside so now that you have the
fundamentals of dropping you droppable
you can go ahead and look at the
the jQuery UI documentation and actually
take a look at some of the other options
however these should be enough to allow
you to drop things into them form lists
based on things that have dropped etc
etc so that's the droppable interaction
in jQuery UI</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
