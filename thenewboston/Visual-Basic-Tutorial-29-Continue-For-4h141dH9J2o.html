youtube.com slash on live gamer for the
new Boston and in this tutorial we're
going to be taking a look at the
continue statement now what this does is
lets say you're making a for loop and
it's for num1 equals 1 to 30 now let's
say if num1 is equal to 23 then you
don't want it to run that iteration of
the for loop so it will print out let's
say we're doing constant outright line
num1 and you don't want 23 to be printed
out you would use if num1 equals 23 then
continue for so basically what that does
is it skips that iteration of the for
loop and moves on to the next one so
let's go ahead and make some examples of
this so we'll type console dot write
line normal for loop and we'll make a
for loop
let's just do 15 with your console dot
write line num1 so basically what this
is going to do is it's just going to
write out 1 through 15 on our console
now let's add a space here and let's do
continue statement ok so now let's make
our for loop that has the continue
statement in it so we'll just start off
by using the for keyword will create our
num 1 variable and we'll go to 15 now
num 1 can only be accessed inside of
this for loop and nowhere else because
we didn't actually declare it so let's
go ahead and type a simple if statement
so if num1 is equal to 5 then what do we
want to do we'll just type continue for
so what this is going to do is it's
going to skip the iteration of num 1 if
num 1 is equal to 5 it's going to skip
whatever code comes after this now
here's here's a trick that I wanted to
teach you guys in this tutorial if you
have an if statement with only one line
of line of code in between then and
India you can just go ahead and take out
and if and do this instead so if num1
equals 5 then continue for and by doing
this you don't have to have the in if
statement and your code is a lot neater
and easier to read so now that we have
our if statement done we'll just do a
console dot write line num1 so if we go
ahead and run this we're going to get in
our normal for loop it says 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 you can see that
all the numbers are there
but if we come down here and look at our
continued statement you can see it looks
like all the numbers are there but we
are missing a 5 in between 4 &amp;amp; 6 now
let's do this for a couple other values
so let's go ahead and create a
multi-line if statement so if num1
equals 5 then continue for let's just
add an or operator so if num1 equals 5
or num 1 is equal to 8 or num 1 is equal
to let's say 12 so we didn't really have
to make that multi-line we'll just go
ahead and put this right after that okay
so now what it's going to do is it's
going to skip the number 5 8 and 12 so
if we run this we're going to get 1 2 3
4 6 7 it's going to skip 8 PCs to get 5
and it also skipped 12 so go ahead and
practice some continue for statements
you can come up with different ways to
use it within your program and once you
know how to do that and you're not going
to forget it then go ahead and move on
to the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
