awesome tutorial and in this video what
I want to do is I want to start building
the world so our dude can actually walk
around on because right now if we just
have a dude right here he just going to
fall all the way to the bottom of the
screen and die in to me that doesn't
sound like a very fun game at all unless
you name it like suicide 2.0 or
something but uh I don't want to make a
game like that so that's what we're
going to be doing but first I'm going to
show you guys something that I always do
in something I recommend you always do
so if you scroll out by holding ctrl on
your keyboard and using your mouse wheel
to scroll out you can see that this is
our game right here
now what I want to do is since this
background is perfectly fitted to our
layer and this is pretty much a layer
that we're not going to be editing again
we're not going to allow the player to
blow up the background or anything like
that it's perfect right now what I want
to do is actually lock this so we don't
accidentally select it or delete it and
so it stays that way for the rest of the
game development so in order to do that
this is actually our background layer
and if you click this check mark you can
see that it appears and it disappears or
it's visible and not visible what the
first thing I want to do is actually
create a new layer on top of it now I
actually already renamed this the
background but it was layer 0 in order
to rename anything just click this
little pencil whatever it's called and
rename that one to background and for
the new one right here rename this one
to main so basically this background
layer is the layer that we're never
going to touch again so it would be a
good idea I said to lock it and of
course if you're familiar with Photoshop
or anything you know to lock layers just
click this little lock icon right here
and it goes from being open to being
closed and what this means is it's
locked
meaning can't select it so try to select
your background you can't anymore
now just the heads-up what we're going
to be doing is for the rest or for 99%
of it unless we
I'd make another level or something
we're going to be working in this main
layer this is going to be where our dude
is or all the enemies the stuff he can
jump on the block so you can break stuff
like that so make sure that you have
this layer selected from here on out so
now that we got our main layer good to
go press control hit zero make sure you
are in the right window and actually
whenever I'm developing game I like to
put everything in the top-left corner to
start just because I know it's kind of
like habit but the first thing we need
to do is we need to like I said give the
dude a world some stuff to jump on some
ground for him to run around on we just
can't import the dude right away so
let's start building the world and this
is how we do it in order to get that
land we're going to import a sprite so
double-click on this layer right here
and you're going to put in insert new
object that's what window is going to
pop up and scroll down until you see
sprite so double-click this and it's
going to give you these crosshairs
basically saying where do you want to
put it now just click anywhere because
we can reposition it later just like we
did with the background and it says ok
so you can either select an image right
here and it has some other windows too
now in this game development series
whenever you're making a platformer game
it's good to work with a lot of of those
sprite strips or um you know in the last
tutorial I told you to download those
sheets of like characters moving in tile
sets they were called well that's what
we're going to be using because it's
pretty much the best thing to use in a
platformer game as you guys are going to
see why later on but in order to
download our first title set what we
need to do is not click this folder but
if we go in this animation frames a
window right here and right click it
choose the selection import sprite strip
and now what we want to do is if you
have it downloaded then select that but
the one I'm using is in sprite jungle
performer tiles
and this tiles right here now hit open
and what I want to do is maybe I can
show you guys first so you know what's
going on media bundle lalala sprites
drum performer tiles preview so what
this basically is is it's not really
easy to tell right now but it's a twelve
by twelve it's actually broken up into
blocks for example you guys can see in
this area each of these little squares
is actually a part of the world that we
can build so if you want to build a tree
you would use this if you want to build
a ground you would use this first one
right here but what we need to do is
before we import this entire image
because it looks weird right now
is we need to tell construct two to
actually break this up and a twelve by
twelve arm no formation or River
whatever you want to call it but that's
how we want to break it up so we'll put
twelve by twelve and hit OK
and whenever we do that we got to give
it some time to work but it's
automatically going to split that one
big image into a twelve by twelve
section giving you 144 smaller images so
that's what it did right there and if
you click this if it I don't know why
that just disappeared but as you can see
it now broke it up into 144 images now
this zero one right here you're always
going to have that that's pretty much a
default one before you import it any
images so if you right-click and just
delete that then you get rid of that
blank one but obviously these are the
pieces that we can use to build the
world and that's what that title said I
had you download that's what it
basically is so pretty freakin cool and
well in the next video I guess we're
actually going to be starting to put
these pieces together and build a world
for our dude so it's going to be awesome
and well make sure
that you have your tileset imported and
also if you have any questions or if you
come across any problems you can ask me
in my forum and I'll put a link below
but anyways thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe in well I'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
