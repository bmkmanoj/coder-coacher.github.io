ago and it was actually a lock holder
and I thought it was gonna be and I
couldn't really sleep that much I don't
know
I definitely need to get a fire started
today probably as soon as possible
because I don't know it's just so so
much colder than you think it's gonna be
I don't know why it's almost summer
right now so I figured it wouldn't be
that cold I wish I would've brought more
than just that little zip up Hoodie but
now it's getting pretty hot out there
warmer and uh I think I'm gonna try to
start a fire real quick and then maybe I
need to go find some water really so
that's probably what I'm gonna do see if
I can start a fire go find some water
and I'll just take it from there as I go
I guess
whoo all right I'm like a quarter-mile
away from my camp right now and just
like what I found right here pretty
awesome
Oh a nice little running stream and
water that is a wrap on that oh I'm so
excited now I'm so thirsty too and I
campus a little ways over that way
but it's not far so I could find it
pretty easily again but this is awesome
oh my god I'm so excited I finally get
to drink
that is awesome
well I just found this little frog Nick
from my stream but surprisingly I'm not
really hungry enough to eat a frog yet
and I don't really have way to cook it
so probably just gonna let this one go
ladies already walked around for a
little while and find anything too
interesting on the way back to camp and
I'm gonna give that fire another crack
probably should have worn pants out here
though because my legs are getting cut
up by all this grass so note to self
pants when you walk around and I guess
that's it for now see what I can do with
this fire</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
