with a video tutorial for the new Boston
in the past couple of videos we have
looked at the fade in and fade out
functions however the disadvantage to
this is you don't have the option to use
one button to toggle this effect we've
already looked at toggling different
effects such as showing and hiding
things however there is a function in
jQuery called
fade toggle and this allows us to use
two different states the first state
will be well the option you give it and
then the second step it will be a fade
in or fade out and then the second state
will be to obviously do the reverse
so to fade in off to fade out so what we
can actually do is start to create our
image so I'll just include our image in
here and this is tartan jpg oh I'll just
give tartan we need to give this an ID
as well so I'll give this an ID of image
now what I want to do is create one
single button which is going to fade in
and fade out these simultaneously so if
I go ahead and create an input type
button and we'll give this a value of
fade in/out
okay so let's break up now in a
paragraph there okay so let's go ahead
and preview this in our browser you can
see that we've got one button fade in
our Anna and our image is currently
displayed and because our images that
currently displayed when we press this
button it will actually fade our image
out when we press the button again it
will fade the image back in so now let's
go ahead and create the functionality
for this inside effect Jas I've already
included this in my page as well as
jQuery so let's go to effects Jas okay
so first of all we need to create a
event handler so an event handler for
the button which we have named we didn't
give it an ID so let's give that an ID
first I'm just gonna call this say in
out so the button in out we need to
check for a click what we then need to
do is inside we have this function and
inside of this block here we'll bring
that down and we start to use the fade
toggle function so we reference our
image so that's hash image and then we
say dot fade toggle so this doesn't
require any parameters such as like the
hide the show function the fade in and
the fade out function however let's go
ahead and test it and then give it some
additional parameters so let's click
this you can see our image fades out and
we click it again and you see it fade in
now similarly if you wanted the image to
be faded out beforehand you can use CSS
to style this so I'm gonna just create a
style attribute in my image tag
obviously inline CSS isn't recommended
but for the purpose of this tutorial I'm
going to use it and I'm just gonna write
display and then none so now what will
happen is when we refresh our browser
the image doesn't exist well it does
exist but it's not shown when I click
fade in fade out it automatically fades
us in so it detects its visibility and
then toggles it accordingly
we can then again fade out and back in
again now there are additional
parameters for fade toggle we have
either a textual representation of the
speed for example slow will just simply
slow the animation down you'll see there
is significantly slower we can also then
give it a speed so alternatively we can
give it a speed for example 500 which is
5 seconds 5000 sorry which is 5 seconds
we were to fade in you can see it takes
significantly longer to fade in we also
have the option to use a callback
function well beforehand you can set the
the animation type as well by default it
is swing that's if you don't give it any
parameter however you also have linear
which doesn't make too much of a
difference but this can be used in most
animation effects so we also have the
option for a callback function and this
essentially will just do something once
the animation has been complete so for
example we can alert the user animation
complete what's going to happen now is
once we click the button we're going to
toggle the fade it's going to be 5
seconds the effect type is going to be
linear and this callback function here
with this block in here will be run but
only once the animation is complete so
ie
the image is completely faded in or
faded out so we can test that now by
clicking fade in you'll see that that
takes about five seconds to fade in and
once it has faded in we will have a
alert box come up saying animation
complete and then again that's the same
with fading out if we press it we wait
about five seconds well exactly five
seconds for it to fade out and then we
have the same dialog box up here so
that's the fade toggle function in
jQuery</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
