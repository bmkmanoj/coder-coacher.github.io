studio max tutorial and in this tutorial
we're going to be talking about
modifiers now what a modifier does is it
pretty much distorts an object in some
way and you can only apply these to
editable objects so I already made this
too bright here and I right clicked it
and I press convert convert to editable
mesh and I didn't show that on my
tutorial because when I right-click my
screen recorder messes up so you should
know how to do this from less toriel
just make any object you want it doesn't
even have to be a tube and convert it to
an editable object and now once you do
that you're ready to begin so like I
said a modifier is used to distort an
object so go ahead and select the object
you just created and when you do you
should get white brackets around it and
now you should have the name of that
object right here in your model modifier
list right here and again I'm in the
modify panel right there so this
modifier list is all the modifiers you
can apply to your object to select on
just go ahead and take your list scroll
down and press something like Bend and
now you can see this orange bracket
surrounds your object and this means
that a modifier is applied to it so the
parameters of your modifier
automatically pop up in your rollouts
whenever you apply it to and here's
another neat little trick if you want to
apply a modifier to several objects at
once all you have to do is select
several objects at once and select a
modifier and that will apply them all to
the objects at once so you don't have to
apply a modifier this tube then apply it
to another to apply it to another tube
you can just have three two selected
apply modifier and I'll apply it to all
three so anyways once you apply a
modifier or select it from the list
your pyramidal your parameters for that
modifier will pop up so then you can go
ahead and change that modifier and these
parameters are different for every
modifier their modifier specific so this
Bend lets you choose the angle and also
the distance
so I'm going to leave that like I don't
know might as well leave it like that
for the bend and you can't you don't
have to just apply one modifier to an
object you can pipe multiple as many
modifiers as you want actually so I'm
going to go ahead and with this object
still selected go in my drop-down list
and pick another one
what's a good noticeable one lattice
right here this moment this pretty much
means weaved so now you get this nice
little weave pattern and I'm gonna in my
parameters I'm going to drop the radius
down a little bit there we go so now you
can see that we have this new object
that was bent in latticed whatever the
heck that means you know but hey we're
not here to discuss what means where is
here discussing modifiers and how to use
them so each of these modifiers all of
these does a different really weird
thing and we're going to be using these
in the future but right now I just want
to show you guys how to use modifiers
and I picked the probably two most
noticeable ones we got so again any time
you want to apply modifier just use it
from the drop-down list and also change
the parameters right here when they pop
up now another thing that you're going
to take note of is these have the two
little light bulbs next to the it's
called the stack in the stack we have
each of your modifiers in two little
light bulbs next own what a light ball
means is toggle the modifier on and off
so if you click it off then it stops
bending if you click this one off the
lattice disappears so if you only want
the C of U or excuse me see a few of
your modifiers just click them off and
you should probably know this from like
After Effects or like Photoshop or
something but anyways that's what it
does so anytime you want to get rid of a
modifier here's what you do say you just
pick the one you want to get rid of like
lattice I don't really like that weave
so I want to get rid of it you just
highlight it by clicking on it then
click this little remove modifier from
the stack and if you're wondering what
the stack is it's this box right here so
that's what the stack is
so that is how you remove modifiers so
I'm gonna add that modifier again just
because I want to show you something
else
add lattice and move this radius that
radius is kind of annoying and there we
go you don't have to do that but the
last thing I want to talk to you guys
about is how to or actually what
collapsing an object or collapsing the
modifiers mean anytime you work with
your modifiers and you got them just how
you want them and you want in you're
like all right look at that all that is
the perfect animation right there I want
to keep it just like that what you can
do is collapse your modifiers and this
will permanently apply them to the
object so what you need to do is in your
edible mesh or whatever you applied it
to and probably want to do that right
click or excuse me right click and pick
collapse all and now you're going to get
this little warning just click yes and
now look at your editable mesh in your
modifier list
you have no modifiers that's because the
modifiers became part of the object and
you can't edit them anymore so again
anytime you want to permanently set your
modifiers on that object and you know
you're not going to be editing them
anymore what you have to do is
right-click the mesh and collapse all
and that will permanently apply them to
your object or model so that's all I got
for you for this tutorial hopefully you
learned what modifiers are and how they
can distort your object and also why
they are useful so we're going to be
using these in the next couple soria but
for now I just want to show you guys how
to use them in the basic one run-through
of them so thank you guys for watching
it and don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
