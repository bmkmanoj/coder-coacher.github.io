16th java game development tutorial and
in this story we're going to be building
that method that compares two different
display modes and if they are ill or
pretty much if they match each other
the resolution bit depth and refresh
rate all match each other then it's
going to return true but if they don't
match each other it's going to return
false again this is a boolean method so
let's go ahead and we're pretty much
building this method to compare the
display modes that we have towards sway
modes that a graphics card has right in
here so we built this method in takes to
display modes is parameter so let's go
ahead and write a little comment checks
if two modes match each other and it's
pretty much is what it's all going to do
check if two modes match each other
evidently each other is two words not
one just learn that after 22 years of
living so public boo lean so this it's
going to turn true or false that's we
put boolean for display modes match and
as a parameter of course we're going to
take display mode we'll just name this
one m1 display mode and while this name
this one m2 and I said only I didn't hit
the right button there we go so what we
do is we have a method called display
modes match and we have two modes we
pass it in a first mode in a second mode
so all we have to do is compare them to
one another simple enough but it's
actually really confusing we're going to
have to make three separate if
statements one for the resolution one
for the bit depth and one for the
refresh rate so let's go ahead and make
our first one if m1 dot get and what we
need to do is get width get width I say
width width there we go is not equal to
m2 dot get
with so if they're not equal or if m1
that get height is not equal to m2 dot
get height so if either of their height
or width I keep saying I'm just going to
say width from now on if they're height
or width it is not equal then what do
you want to do well since we need a
return statement we're going to want to
return false in that case scenario so
now that we got the width under control
and height this is the resolution we
need to make another check for a bit
depth and the bit depth is pretty much
how many colors
can it display there's a little more to
it but in essence that what it is
so if m1 dot get bit depth right there
is not equal to m2 actually before we do
that I need to tell you guys something
about display mode bit depth multi and
what this is if we hover over it and it
doesn't say but well this is too
confusing it just completely out because
it's really um complicated but what
we're going to do is check it against
bit depth multi and I'll tell you guys
what means later on but it's going to
take me like a minute and a half and I
really don't feel like talking about
we're pretty much going to be comparing
the bit depth of one and two and do
something special in this case but for
now we'll just skip it so let's go ahead
and put and so what do we do for m2 is
not equal to that I messed everything up
now so if m1 get bit depth and m2 dot
get bit depth and we'll say not equal to
copy that not equal to display mode bit
septa Multi make sure where am i and one
more and m1 dot get the depth if this if
the bit depth if of the first mode is
not equal to the bit depth of the second
mode then what do we wanted to do so I'm
going to mess anything up if the bit
depth not equal this and the bit depth
is not equal there and and one bit step
is not equal to m2 but depth what do you
want to do return false so maybe I'll
tell you what this means later on but
here we go
value of bit depth and multiple bit tips
are supported in this display mode so
some display modes have multiple bits
Epps in it's just really confusing but I
mean it's even confusing for me to
understand so I just usually just copy
this and forget about it so now what we
did is we made a test for the resolution
to see if they match and if they don't
match we want to return false if the bit
depths don't match we want this to
return false and if the resolution or
eight or excuse me refresh rate if m1
dot get refresh rate is not equal to
display mode dot refresh rate unknown
and m2 dot get refresh rate is not equal
to RIA
oh I know display mode refresh rate
unknown and one more one m1 dot get
refresh rate is not equal to and two dot
get refresh rate see that is really long
and this is like the worst part of these
stories I promise return false so now
that we have all those weird tests that
we need and you actually need to type it
in just like that because pretty much
when you work with resolution bit depth
in a refresh rate on your computer they
have a bunch of weird things that you
really only do this once oh no one
actually really learns them they just
copy them from other people and these
are pretty much three tests if the
pretty much this is all exciting if the
first mode its resolution doesn't match
the second modes or resolution then we
want to say false if the first modes bit
depth doesn't match the second mode spit
depth return false if the third or
excuse me if the first modes refresh
rate doesn't match the second modes
refresh rate return false and if you
pass all those tests then it means that
all three of these things match so what
we can do is go ahead and return true
and now in this method right here find
first compatible mode or excuse me not
that one why is this underlined oh I
know what I did wrong because it's going
to do all this for a check and make sure
we're to put that return null good thing
we have that so now what this does is
display modes match it's going to take
two modes right here in whenever this
whenever these two modes match then this
whole function is going to be true so
soon say all right if true run this bit
of code and it's going to return the
mode that's not only compatible with our
program which would be this but is also
compatible with your graphics card right
there so now we are pretty much on our
way to building the perfect screen
manager
and now this game can run not only on
our computer but anyone's computer that
has this game using these two methods
find compatible mode and see if they
match so now we just got to do a couple
more things in this class and then we're
ready to run our animation again and
watch it with beautiful no flickers at
all but for now just pretty much copy
this we're never going to be really
learning about this anymore but if you
want to then go into job a website but
just pretty much copy this and you're
ready to move on to next tutorial
because we're done with this finally
because it pretty much sucks so thank
you guys for watching and next story
we're going to be building a method to
set fullscreen don't forget to subscribe
it now see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
