slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
talking about initializing a raise with
values now if you remember from the
previous tutorials we created an array
called string classes and then when we
went through and we assigned a value to
each one of those we assigned a ya value
to each one of the indexes in that array
now this could take a lot of time and
there's an easier way to do this by
adding those values to the array when
you initialize the array so we'll go
ahead and open up our arrays project I'm
go ahead and zoom in some and we will
find string classes right here okay so
now what we're going to do is we're
going to come down here and find form
one load and you can see under form one
load it takes all of our indexes and
string classes and it sets a value to
them now we don't need this we can go
ahead and assign it so that when the
program is built it's automatically that
all of the strings in the indexes of
string classes I already have a value
and they aren't set at for one load they
are just there so we'll go ahead and to
assign values you set you declare your
array as string or int or whatever you
want and then you add two curly braces
and now you're going to have to since
we're using a string we'll go ahead and
type web design for the first index
which is going to be zero and now to set
the value for the second index what
you're going to do is you're going to
add a comma so then we'll type Spanish
chemistry
English history and calculus so now we
have all six of the items in string
classes set to a value now when we set
the values for this we're no longer
going to need the number under string
classes which is it's going to give us
an error so if we take out five it's
going to see that we assign this and
when we assign it it's going to say
we're going to use zero one two three
four five which is six items and it's
going to automatically know that instead
of having to look at what we specify
right there so if we run this we should
get the same results as last time we can
do whatever we want and it'll still work
now we can also do this with integers so
we'll just go ahead and type private
string or int let's just do my numbers
as integer and we'll go ahead and assign
each value in there so we'll just do one
two three four five and six so instead
of using string classes in here we can
go ahead and type my numbers
so this should make it a little bit
easier if you guys to see what's going
on and looks like we're getting an error
here so instead of string for our add
items to list let's go ahead and make
another add items and we will use
coercion so private
sub add items to list and we're going to
use our Garre as integer so instead of
string we will just do integer and we
will copy this right here so now we have
two copies of add items to list and we
can pass an array as a string or an
array as an integer and it will still
work so we'll go ahead and minimize that
and if you don't know what coercion is
then you might want to go back and view
that in one of my earlier tutorials so
let's go ahead and do my numbers right
there my numbers and we'll go up here
and get this one that we missed and
we'll go ahead and delete all this right
here because we don't need it and now
let's go ahead and run our program so
you can see here that we can go ahead
and click add array elements and we get
one two three four five six and now if
we click sort it right it's not going to
change anything and if we click reverse
array we get six five four three two one
and if we click sort array what it's
going to do is since this is of type
integer it's going to sort it in
numerical order now when we use string
or character it's going to sort it in
alphabetical order so we can reverse
that and click sort and it will set it
back in numerical order so go ahead and
you can create this program that we've
just made and add the step that I added
here's a look at our add items to list
you can pause it right there if you
don't know what's in there and then go
ahead and make some arrays initialize
them with value
is already make them of other types
besides string and integer so you so you
can get some more practice with them and
once you got that down and you're not
going to forget it go ahead and move on
to the next tutorial and thanks for
