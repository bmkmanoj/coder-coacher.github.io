slash the on live gamer for the new
boston and in this tutorial we're going
to be talking about eye disposable now
what i disposable let you do is get rid
of objects after you've used them so
that you can make better use of the
memory that you're using and you won't
have to have garbage collection do all
of the work for you
so what we're going to do is create a
new project here so we'll go to file new
project will shrink it down and we'll
call will select windows forms
application and we will call it eye
disposable test and then go ahead and
click okay so now what we need to do is
we need to add a class to our eye
disposable test
so we'll we will add a class and we will
call this class do stuff so we have a
class that will do stuff dot VB and
we'll go ahead and click add so here's
our class that we've created and so now
we need to do is to be able to dispose
of objects created on this class we're
going to have to use the implements keep
keyword to use eye disposable so the way
to do this is by typing implements eye
disposable and we go ahead and click tab
and click enter you can see that adds a
whole bunch of this code for us
so it says region eye disposable support
so it just creates a region in our class
that holds all of these subs for us and
we have a disposed value as believe
which we'll see if the current object
has been disposed we've got a disposed
sub and a dispose a second one of it so
you can read the comments on this if you
want to see what it does but we don't
really have to worry about that right
now we can just leave that the way it is
and I highly suggest that you do not
change that so we will add some subs
here so what type of public sub
so message and then we'll just type
message box this is a message okay so
now that we've created a sub that will
show a message we can go ahead and come
into our forum 1vb designer and we will
add a button to this so we'll just set
the text to show message and we will set
the name to button message and we'll
just make this a little bit bigger so
that it will fit all these words we'll
double click on the show message event
handler and we'll just zoom in here okay
so now we need to do is we need to
create an object of the do stuff class
so we'll go ahead and type dim new do
stuff as new do stuff so this creates an
object of our do stuff class and now
what we need to do is we need to call
show message so we will type the name of
our object and we will just use the show
message sub okay so now it's just show
the message and now once that's done
showing the message what we want to do
is we want to get rid of ours to us new
do stuff object so that the memory we
have more free memory so we'll just go
ahead and type new do stuff and then
we're going to use dot right there and
we will just call dispose so dot dispose
and you see that it has been created by
eye disposable for us okay so now we
need to do is we need to come back into
new form and do a formal VB and we need
to set new do stuff equal to
nothing which will completely get rid of
our object so let's go ahead and run
this and you can see that if we click
show message right here it says this is
a message and the title is the by
default when you call message box the
title is going to be the name of your
project let's go ahead and click OK
and when it does that you can see that
it gets rid of our new do stuff object
so go ahead and create a couple classes
that implement eye disposable so that
you can dispose the value I'm not
supposed to value dispose the object
once you're done using it and then after
you've done that go ahead and move on to
some of the next tutorials we're going
to be talking a little bit more about
eye disposable and using objects and
making it more memory efficient so
thanks for watching and stay tuned for
the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
