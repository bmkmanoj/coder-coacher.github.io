Android tutorial for the new boss in in
this tutorial we're going to show you
how to load data from a shared
preference of some sort so the first
thing that we want to do is we want to
say an update method of some sort
because we edited our shared preference
within our Save button so we kind of
want to make sure that our shared
preference instance is updated so again
we created a shared preference called
some data within our on create method
and we're basically going to use the
same line of code to update it goes
right on our on create method it you
know sets it up for us and at that
moment is there's nothing defined really
and now what we're doing is we're saying
hey yeah since we made this edit we're
going to update it again and see if
there's any changes so again we're going
to get the shared preferences from our
shared preference class or object here
and we're going to load the same
filename and the default setting and now
what we want to do is we want to set up
a string because we're going to again
get this string that we put in right
here within our Save button and we
called that string shared string here so
we're going to just set up a string
variable called data return something
like that now we're going to set this
variable equal to our some data again
our shared preference we're this time
instead of saying put the string we're
going to get string because again we're
loading the data and we're going to use
the same file name or reference that we
use in our last tutorial when we put
that string in so we're going to say
string I'm sorry
shared string
and the second parameter basically this
is going to what this is what's going to
be loaded if we couldn't access this
shared string for example if we miss
type this we don't have a file name
within our shared preference called
sharded string so it's going to give us
this default value so we're going to say
something like Conant load kind of load
data something like that so that's what
that second parameter means again all
we're doing is they're setting up the
string variable to get the string from
our shared preferences called shared
string and if we couldn't do that it's
going to say current load data that's
going to be the default return and now
what we have to do is we need to set up
our textview that we created called data
result to match our shared preference
that we just received so we're going to
say data result all right what was it
data results and we're going to say dot
set text again kind of a review for the
set text but now we're going to set it
to this string that we just got so we're
going to say data returned and then we
go we're pretty much done with this
tutorial but let's quickly talk over
everything again just make sure you guys
know what's going on so we created a
shared preference type variable and it's
going to say get shared preferences and
we're going to say hey this is the file
name so again we set up a static file
name that's never going to change called
my shared string so that's what that
file name means and it's going to load
that kind of the default loader and once
we set that up we're going to kind of
access that to save certain data or
certain strings or boolean or whatever
type of kind of variables we want to
save within here
but again again just kind of clarify
think of this some data or shared
preference as a folder now I know I said
it's a file name but think of it as a
folder and then within that folder we
can say stuff like we want to create a
string reference or file called shared
and we're going to put that in there so
think of the shared preference as a
folder and then we're going to say hey
we want to edit that folder so we're
going to just refer to that folder and
say we want to edit something and again
we set up the string that's going to
kind of convert our edit text into the
string and we're just going to use that
editor that we create here because
that's where we're going to edit stuff
so we're going to say we want to edit
and put in a string variable and we want
the file name to be shared string and we
want that value to be our basically our
edit text converted into a string and we
want to commit to that we are pretty
solid on that decision and then our load
is again we're going to set up our
shared preferences the same file name so
we know we're working with that folder
for the most part and then we're going
to say we're going to set up a new
string variable and we're going to get
basically the string from that folder
called shared preferences and if we
couldn't do that we're going to say
couldn't load the data and then all
we're going to do is convert our
textview into basically this string that
we set up here so let's run it and make
sure it works real quickly so we're
going to go down to our shared
preferences class and we're going to
type something like test1 and we're
going to first let's say we load it
before we save it so we're going to load
it it's going to say current load data
because again we haven't set up this
this value called shared string we do
that once we hit the Save button so
we're going to say save and now it's
going to create this file called shared
string I'm just going to load the data
from our edit text and now when we hit
load it's going to say test1 because we
saved it again we can whoops
even if we I mean we aren't just
converting an edit text we're saving
some preferences so if we hit load again
it's going to load test one because we
didn't save this test once we save it
and load it again it's going to load the
test file there so again you can guys
you guys can create as many files as you
want within our folder again think of
the shared preferences as a folder and
so example you can set
of more strings with different type of
references that you can load up later so
hopefully you guys kind of understand
now the shared preference is a little
bit more clearly than previously in the
series when we use it for preference
activity and again the shared
preferences is just beneficial if you're
saving strings boolean's kind of simple
variables not a whole bunch of data just
kind of preferences true/false
statements stuff like that so I'll catch
you guys in the next tutorial we're
going to get into some more data stuff
and using a class that's different than
the shared preferences so I'll catch you
guys then have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
