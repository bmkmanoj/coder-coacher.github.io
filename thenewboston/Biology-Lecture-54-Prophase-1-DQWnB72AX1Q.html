to your 54th biology lesson and in this
lesson we're gonna get started talking
about the different phases or stages of
meiosis so if you remember from the last
tutorial
the very first one was prophase 1 so
prophase 1 is actually similar to
prophase from mitosis in a lot of
different ways so the very first
characteristic of prophase is that your
chromosomes are gonna condense and
become visible very similar to prophase
in mitosis another thing that happens in
the very first page of meiosis is that
you're gonna have those spindles again
that form so remember these spindles
were those little bugs that are
eventually going to pull apart the
chromosomes but right now in prophase
one they're just forming so the last you
know similarity to prophase in mitosis
is that your nuclear membrane is gonna
start to dissolve break down and it's
eventually gonna disappear so no matter
what type of cell division you have no
matter if it's you know mitosis or
meiosis you really don't need your
nuclear membrane for anything it just
gets in the way so no matter what type
of cell division you're doing the
nuclear membrane always disappears so
that's kind of where the similarities to
mitosis end because now we get to see
kinda the way that meiosis is unique so
actually let me go ahead and draw
everything I need to draw because it'll
be easier if I draw everything first and
then talk about it all right so now as
you can see what's going to happen is
the homologous chromosomes are going to
pair up forming something called a
tetrad so this right here would be a
tetrad and a tetrad is just basically
four sister chromatid
so ever seen okay how the heck did you
end up with four sister chromatid well
remember that in each so in every cell
in your body you have a chromosome from
your mom and it pretty much matches up
with a chromosome from your dad they're
physically similar to one another and
whenever it matches up with a chromosome
from your dad
we called this pair homologous
chromosomes now also remember that I
said during interphase every chromosome
is going to be duplicated so that's why
you have not only your homologous
chromosomes but another sister chromatid
to match it why is that because they get
duplicated in interphase so that is why
we have these things called tetrad which
are basically four similar sister
chromatid so now let me go ahead and
zoom up on this right here and I want to
talk to you guys about the next process
of meiosis and that's called crossing
over especially let me go ahead and draw
everything that I need to draw I can
draw those a little bit better this this
and we'll say that the left hand side is
what we start with and on the right hand
side will be the result or what happens
after the process of crossing over so
again this process is called crossing
over and you know it's a little bit
different than that TV show if you guys
ever saw it there's a TV show called
crossing over where this guy he was like
you know the host he pretended to talk
to dead people it was you know a big
hoax but anyways the process of crossing
over in genetics is basically when these
four chromatid right here are going to
come together in a bunch and remember we
called that bunch a tetrad and what's
going to happen is whenever they come
together they're gonna stick together
and whenever they do that they're gonna
start swapping genetic material with one
another so basically instead of wow I
lost my cursor right here so basically
instead of these two chromatid and these
two chromatid we're gonna end up with
four unique chromatid that looks
something like this
so when they're in the tetrad they're
gonna start swapping genetic material so
some of you know genetic material from
the mom is going to go to dad in some of
the genetic material from the dad
chromatid is going to go to the moms
chromatid so what we end up with unlike
before where we had just two unique
chromatin are actually four unique
chromatin so since each chromatid is
genetically unique that's where your
sperm eggs are very genetically diverse
and this is actually why because each of
these chromatid are eventually going to
end up in either a sperm cell or an egg
cell in your body that that's why when
ever you have kids they don't look the
exact same every time that they're
genetically diverse and also if you have
brothers and sisters even though you
guys came from the same parents that's
why you guys don't look all the same and
you guys have different traits so
anyways that's what crossing over and is
and that is prophase one so next we can
move on to the next phase of meiosis</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
