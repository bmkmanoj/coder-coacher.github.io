congruent segments and they're just
segments that have equal measurements
since the only way we measure a line is
to measure its length we're going to say
that they are segments that have equal
length so down here I have two segments
drawn already and if you were to measure
them you would find that the distance
from A to B is 5 centimeters so we write
that as a B and since it's a line
segment we put a little bar on top of it
is equal to 5 centimeters
don't forget your units those are always
really important in geometry ok we're
going to measure C to D and you would
find that the length is also 5
centimeters so I write that C D is equal
to 5 centimeters and since they have
equal lengths we can say that line
segment a B is equal to line segment CD
or that a B and CD are congruent
line segments okay all right let's say
you're given this information and they
want you to find the length of a line
segment ad given that a X is equal to
four centimeters and X D is equal to
eight centimeters so we're just gonna
label this right here for
and eight and since this is what we're
trying to find we can add a X plus XD to
find out what a D equals and this this
is called the addition property of
segments and it allows us to take one
part of the segment right here and add
it to the other part of the segment to
find the whole measurement of the whole
segment so all we do is we since we know
a X is four centimeters plus X D which
is 8 centimeters we just add those
together and you get 12 centimeters
therefore a D length of a d is equal to
12 centimeters now the only reason we
can do this is because X lies in between
ad if X say X was over here somewhere
and this was X and we wanted to find the
length of AD
we couldn't we couldn't do anything with
X it's only because X is between a and D
that we can add ax plus XD and this
makes sense if you think about it
because if you had a pizza and you had
this much of a pizza so this is 1/4 of a
pizza and that's how much was eaten if
the rest of it was also eaten
1/4 plus 3/4 it gives you the whole
pizza it's kind of like these are
fractions of a lime segments so that to
get the whole number you add each part
together ok so using those two
definitions we just learned we're gonna
do some examples okay so we already know
that the length of a B is equal to 3
that's already given to us right here so
they say if BC is equal to 12
centimeters how long is AC so since AC
is a whole segment we're gonna take each
part of the segments and add them
together to find the whole length so 12
centimeters plus 3 centimeters is equal
to 15 centimeters therefore AC equals 15
centimeters all right so on the second
one this one's a little different they
tell us what the whole length is if H J
which is the entire light line segment
is equal to 10 centimeters what is this
part equal to so you're using the same
idea we're gonna take the whole length
minus part of the length to find out
what the other part of the segment
equals and IJ equals 5 centimeters okay
for our last example we're gonna put the
two things we learned together so if a b
and b c are congruent and a b is equal
to 8 sentiment centimeters what is the
link
of a/c okay since we know that a and B
are congruent that means that they have
equal length so if a b is equal to 8
centimeters that means that bc also has
to be equal to 8 centimeters so to find
the whole length of this we're going to
add a b and b c together so we get 8
centimeters plus 8 centimeters equals 16
centimeters so AC equals 16 centimeters
okay now that you understand the basic
properties of line segments be sure to
come back and watch the next video which
is going to go over the properties of
angles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
