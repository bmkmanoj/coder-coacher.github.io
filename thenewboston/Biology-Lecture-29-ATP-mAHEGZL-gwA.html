biology video and in this video I want
to talk to you guys a little bit more
about the molecule a teepee now I
already said in the last couple of
videos that ATP is a molecule in your
body that stores energy but where
exactly does this energy come from and
the answer is food so here's the process
whenever you eat a piece of food and
this could be you know a big food
molecule like a carbohydrate or maybe
you a cheeseburger and you got some
lipids or maybe you just ate a piece of
fruit and you got some sugars food
molecules are really big complex
molecules so what happens is your body
whenever it sees one of these food
molecules is it breaks it up into
smaller molecules so here are smaller
molecules and of course we know from the
last tutorial whenever your body breaks
up a larger molecule into a smaller
molecule this is called a catabolic
reaction in all catabolic reactions
release energy so again whenever you
have a larger food molecule that gets
broken up into smaller molecules energy
is released now of course it would be
kind of silly if you just released
energy and wasted it and that's where
ATP comes in handy because this energy
right here isn't wasted it's actually
stored in a molecule called a TP and
we'll talk more about this specific
molecule right now but first let me go
ahead and answer the question why the
heck would your body or your cells want
to store energy in a molecule called a T
P well the reason for this is because
your cells don't really need
cheeseburgers they can't eat a
cheeseburger like me and you can but
they do need energy to form you know
whatever molecules they want to form
there's a variety of different molecules
that your cell needs but the important
thing is they do this through anabolic
reactions now anabolic reactions of
course require energy and what happens
in an anabolic reaction is two or more
smaller molecules like a and B need to
bond together
no one ever smaller molecules bond
together of course this consumes energy
so basically what happens is ATP is a
molecule that stores energy and the
energy comes from from food breaking up
into smaller molecules now whenever this
energy is stored in the cells like hey
I'm actually doing something right now
and I'm going to need some energy
the ATP is like oh okay dude I got some
energy stored right here here you go
so then the cells like alright thank you
now I can bond my crap together Thank
You ATP simple enough now let's go ahead
and talk a little bit more about ATP now
ATP stands for adenosine triphosphate so
pretty much it is let me just go ahead
and write this so the adenosine would be
something like this and tri phosphate of
course means three phosphates I drew a
phosphate would look like this and this
and this so basically it's a molecule
with three phosphates attached to it so
what happens is whenever your cells need
energy from this molecule remember this
is the molecule that stores energy what
happens is it needs to break up some way
because energy is only released whenever
larger molecules like this gets broken
up into smaller molecules so what
happens is this molecule right here in
what arrow should I draw it becomes
adenosine dye phosphate which is pretty
much your a right here but instead of
three phosphates you only have two now
so P and P and then another P gets
released so this molecule is broken up
and remember whenever a large molecule
breaks up into smaller one energy gets
released
so put energy released now when the
energy is released your cell can use
that to you know bond together whatever
other molecules you know maybe it has a
random arm molecule down here a that it
wants to bond with this one B so uses
the energy from this to bond those two
together
so again what happens in this process is
ATP which is triphosphate or three
phosphates it becomes ADP which is dye
which is two phosphates simple enough so
remember that you start with a TP which
is pretty much molecule that stores
energy for your cell now the first step
that it goes through is whenever you
know another cell requires energy for
whatever function it does it needs to go
ahead and lose a phosphate so just put
lose P P stands for phosphate and
whenever this happens energy gets
released now the energy can be used to
you know do a bunch of different
functions in your cells but for right
now let's just go ahead and concentrate
on this cycle right here so whenever
energy is released this ATP is no longer
ATP because T stands for tri and it no
longer has that third phosphate so it
now becomes a d P however your body
can't really use ADP for energy it needs
a TP so what happens is this a DP which
is two phosphates it needs another
phosphate so what happens is it heads
over to the mitochondria because
remember the mitochondria is the place
where it's pretty much the power plant
of yourself it makes energy and we call
it this because what happens in the
mitochondria is a DP gets another
phosphate so this is going on in the
mitochondria this little process right
here and when it gets another phosphate
what happens is in order to do that of
course this is a chemical reaction that
requires energy because whenever you're
forming a bigger molecule it needs
energy so this energy right here
actually comes from the breaking down of
food breaking down of sugars lipids
carbohydrates so that's where the energy
comes from to add another phosphate to
ADP so once another phosphate is added
then it can go ahead and become a TP so
one more time let me explain you guys
what happens whenever a cell is like
dude need energy so here's my little
cell that needs energy right here what
happens is it talks to ATP and ATP is
like alright I can spare some energy by
getting rid of a phosphate so it does
that and then the energy heads over to
the cell and the cell uses it for
whatever it needs however now we have a
problem now we are left with ADP in ADP
can't give energy to any cells so it's
pretty much useless
so the ADP molecule heads over to the
mitochondria and it's like dude
mitochondria I need some help I need to
turn back into ATP so I feel useful
again so the mitochondria breaks down
some food and whenever it breaks down
food it gives energy that allows the
phosphate to bond to the ADP why is this
occurring because it takes energy to
bond to smaller molecules and the
molecule is a phosphate and ATP molecule
together so that's why it needs energy
and whenever these molecules are bonded
together it once again creates a teepee
that can of course give energy to
another cell that's yelling at it so
that's the entire process hopefully you
guys understand that and in the next
tutorial we're going to be going over
something that's hopefully a little bit
more confusing
so thank you guys for watching don't
forget subscribe and I'll see you guys
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
