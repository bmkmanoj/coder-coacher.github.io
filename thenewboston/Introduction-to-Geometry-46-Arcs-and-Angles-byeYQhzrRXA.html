angles of a circle so first there are
three types of arcs we have this let's
call the semicircle which is arc P RH
and you have to go in the order of
points so you start with P you go to our
go to H and that's half a rotation of a
circle which is equal to 180 degrees so
the semicircle is always equal to 180
degrees an arc of 180 degrees that's not
the link of it length of it that's just
how how this arc is a might major arc is
greater than half a rotation so if I go
to p2 h2m see how this arc is bigger
than this semicircle arc so that's
called a major arc and a minor arc and a
minor arc is less than half a rotation
so it's less than 180 degrees so this
arc we have right here would be arc CH
or you can do H see it doesn't matter so
this arc right here which is less than a
semi-circle arc so now we have what's
called a central angle and I say central
angle has its vertex at the center of a
circle and it's measure is equal to the
measure of its minor arc so if this
angle equals 50 degrees then this arc
right here and it's a minor arc because
it's less than half a rotation so the
measure of Arc LK is 50 degrees now that
only works with central angles so don't
try and use that
rinsable for any other kind of angle
only a central angle so now we're gonna
find the indicated measures so they want
the measure of Arc C D or D Z so since
we know we know that B is the center of
the circle so this angle DBC is a
central angle so that means this arc is
equal to the measure of the central
angle so arc de c is equal to 51 degrees
now they want the measure of DB which is
this arc right here now if you think
about it
this line right here DB is the diameter
of the circle so if I go from D all the
way to the other side of the circle on B
I've completed half a rotation so this
arc right here is a semicircle so that
means it's measure has to be 180 degrees
now they want me to find this part just
this section of the arc arc CB well if
you remember those rules we had about
segments where you could add the parts
to find the total or subtract one of the
parts to find the other part well we can
do the same thing here since this big
arc CD B is a hundred and eighty degrees
and this smaller are great here is 51
degrees we can minus 51 degrees from 80
degrees to find out what just this Archy
equals so we're just gonna call that X
so 180 degrees minus 51 degrees is 129
degrees so the art length of CB or the
arc of CB is 129 degrees now they want
this arc right here a B well if you look
see BECs
DBC is a central angle a B that should
have been pointing right there let me
just change that I had to point B's for
a second okay so we want so DBC is a
central angle and a B E is a central
angle so that means that this arc is
equal to this angle well if you look at
these two angles right here they are
vertical angles and if you remember our
rule about vertical angles they have the
same measure so the measure of this
angle is 51 degrees now because this is
a central angle that must mean that the
measure of a E is also 51 degrees now
they want us to find the measure of D a
so we're gonna do the same thing we did
to find the measure of C e so da is part
of this big arc de which is equal to 180
degrees so we can take 180 degrees minus
this piece right here which is 51
degrees and we'll get 129 degrees equals
x
which makes sense if you think about it
because these two angles right here are
also vertical angles so they have to
have the same measure so that's all
we're gonna do with arcs and angles
today but make sure you come back when
we talk about other kinds of angles of a
circle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
