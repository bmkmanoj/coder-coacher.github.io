34th intermediate Java lesson and in
this video what I'm going to be doing is
teaching you guys how to start building
a very simple web browser so our web
browser program is going to have you
know all the things that usual web
browser has the address bar at the very
top where you can type in your URL like
I don't know HTTP google.com and then
once you press Enter it's going to go
ahead and display the contents of
google.com so again this isn't going to
be a really advanced web browser nothing
as cool as Google Chrome or Firefox but
it's going to use a lot of important
concepts for example you know reading
HTML file and displaying the contents on
the screen so I already made a new class
and I imported four different things so
just go ahead and copy all that right
now now what this is going to do is it's
going to inherit from the frame or
excuse me in here from the class jframe
just so we can get all our good gooey
stuff make it look nice and pretty now
remember that I said this GUI is
basically going to consist of two main
parts the address bar at the top where
the user can type something in in the
main window that I don't know all the
crap all the webpage crap gets displayed
so the address bar at the top is
actually going to be a jtextfield so
private jtextfield
and I'll just name this address bar now
the main display window is actually
going to be a J editor pane so private
editor pane and I'll just name this
display so remember we're going to be
typing in the URL such as you know the
new boston.com right here and it's going
to display in the main window so the
first thing that we should do is some
housekeeping stuff but it's actually
more than housekeeping stuff the
constructor so go ahead and make your
constructor public whatever you know the
name of your class was read file it's
not going to take any extra information
now the first thing we should do is give
our application the title
so go there call the superclass's
constructor and pass in you know
whatever you want to name your browser
Buckey browser I think that's a pretty
cool name for a browser so this title is
going to appear at the very top of your
screen or the top of your application
rather so now that we have the title
taken care of we can begin working on
the address bar the part where the user
types in the URL which website do they
want to go to so the first thing we have
to do is of course create it so address
bar equals new jtextfield now whenever
you create a new text field go ahead and
I as the parameter for this type in some
default text such as enter a URL pause
and I'm going to do that
so basically the default text whenever
the user first opens this application is
enter a URL host now obviously they're
going to have to enter a proper URL if
they want this application to work but
for now we'll just give them a little
prompt on the screen so even though they
have to delete it you know it's probably
better for the user to do it this way so
now what I want to do is in this address
bar the way that they're going to you
know pretty much submit their URL that
says okay this is my URL now I want to
go to it is they're going to hit Enter
when they're done typing the URL so
since they're pretty much hitting Enter
and that enter from the user is actually
an event we need to add an action
listener to wait and listen for the user
to press ENTER so how do we wait and
listen well we need address holy
caps-lock
address bar add action listener just
like that so now let me go ahead and get
my spacing all taken care of all right
add action listener now inside this we
need an anonymous inner class new action
listener now the method that gets called
whenever the user presses enter is
action performed so public void
actionperformed hopefully I spelled that
right all right looks pretty good action
listener alright so I don't know I'm
getting a bunch of weird error messages
but I think it's just because I didn't
finish coding this method yet so
basically what we need to do is
passionate pass in an action event and
we'll name this event and that event is
basically the hitting of the enter
button so again like I said whenever
they hit enter on their keyboard this
method is going to be called so
therefore we probably should put some
instruction in here so what we want to
happen whenever they hit enter on their
keyboard well they're only going to hit
enter after they entered a URL so
basically what this program is going to
do is it's going to get the URL and say
ok then I want to go to this web page
read the file the HTML file and display
it in the main window so that's kind of
a whole separate thing so what I decided
to do is I decided to make a separate
method for that called load crap now the
load cramp method obviously isn't one
that's already billing the Java we're
going to have to make this ourselves but
what this method is going to do is it's
going to go read an HTML file for
example the HTML file from the New
Boston org and read it and then display
on the screen so again we're going to be
coding that in the upcoming tutorials
but before you do that what we need to
do is we actually need to pass it in the
URL as a string so they already typed in
the URL in this address bar so how do we
get
the URL from that address bar well well
let me just go ahead and type it then
I'll show you guys get because this
method is one of the ones that are not
named very good in Java so get action
command if I hover over it maybe you'll
see ok says return the command string
associated with this action and I put my
semi colon in the wrong place so what
this means is remember whenever you hit
enter an event is generated in this get
action command which is not properly
named is basically going to take the
string that's inside the address bar and
it's going to go ahead and pass it into
this load crap method so this get action
command should more be more properly be
named get string from jtextfield but
that's basically what it does whatever
URL that you typed in is going to treat
it as a string and pass it into this
load crap method which eventually what
we're going to be doing is building this
method to pretty much go to a file and
display it on the screen so simple
enough so well that's pretty much it for
this tutorial in the next tutorial we're
going to be doing is working on the
display and then we're going to be
working on the load crap
method so once everything ties together
you guys are going to be able to see
what's going on but for now just stick
with me and I promise you guys like I
usually do everything will make sense
soon so anyways thank you guys for
watching and subscribing I will see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
