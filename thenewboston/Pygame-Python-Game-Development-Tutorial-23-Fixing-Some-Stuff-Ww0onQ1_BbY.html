another PI game video tutorial for
bucking the new Boston from youtube.com
slash cent X we're going to do in this
video is kind of transition into another
topic so first I covered how we could
have like two objects crossing over when
they're exactly the same size so with
this game of snake we got lucky with
that so we were able to do that but in a
lot of games you're not going to get so
lucky and there's going to be times
where maybe you're like for example we
just show was that if our snake is for
example smaller the question is you know
did we cross over at any part of that
box so like this you know did we cross
over at any point of that box yes yes
yes yes and all that so that's great but
the other question though is so our
snake moves in intervals of 10 and so
because of that very structured movement
we know that we'll always be either
completely outside of that box or will
be completely inside that box we'll
never be like the boxes here and the
squares here and it's hitting like this
like you know if part of the snake is
hitting the Apple we'll never really
have an event like that so what happens
when you do though because again in a
lot of games there's no such thing as
like the game just knows hey there's an
impact or because these two objects are
overlapping each other so what we have
to do is actually code in handling that
you know takes the shape and the
dimensions of that shape and they you
just decide logically with math are they
crossing so what what kind of code do we
need when they're crossing over and
that's what we're going to be getting
into now there's a couple of things that
I want to change with this script first
of all um I was noticing that we were
having some trouble um basically on the
game over part so we were having let's
see game x equals true um
so yeah right so probably see when we're
running our snake around let me just
show you what I mean so we get off of
the screen and I think it was one yet so
we're hitting the X button but nothing's
actually happening
so the prop but if we hit Q we do get an
exit so why is that occurring well this
question is while game over is true we
run this stuff right here so if I'm not
even seeing the quit event that's
because that's down here so I'm not even
seeing that we have a quit event at all
here so like what we would do is if
event dot type equals PI game diet and
then all caps quit if that's the case
then what do we want to do well we would
initially we would say write game exit
equals true but we also need to say um
game over equals false so we get out of
this loop and we get out of this loop
now the question that I will pose is why
can't we do it this way why couldn't you
ask game bar can you say game over
equals false and then game accident Roo
well as soon as we set game over equals
false will we actually exit the game so
let's go ahead and save and run that
just for our own purposes so praying and
then we hit the exit and we were able to
exit so so it does not really matter if
you put game over over game exit or vice
versa so some people might ask well when
does the loop actually break like are we
going to break mid if statement or not
and if you wanted to break mid if
statement you really could you could
throw a break here right and that will
stop the statement from running so
sometimes you can ask questions and then
insert a break
if it's the case but anyway it won't
really matter so just because you ran
game it's going to set game over Eagles
Falls and game exit equals true and then
so no matter what we'll exit the game so
now we're able to you know play the game
run off the screen and actually exit in
both ways either hitting Q or hitting
hitting X on the window so now that
we've got that the next thing I wouldn't
mind changing here now is we've got in
the definition of Randolph LX and rein F
of Y let's go ahead and stop these from
dividing you know because we're we were
trying to get them to always be like a
multiple of ten so now I'm going to get
rid of that code as well so it's going
to take two parentheses I believe I
don't know just one I suppose I'm just
see that should be fun so just one extra
parenthesis and then we can comment out
you can delete this if you want I like
to leave commented code sometimes they
are just because it's really easy to
comment that section out and if I ever
wanted to go back to it I can just
uncomment it so sometimes I leave code
commented out for a while before I
actually fully delete it so we'll leave
that one there um and then we also have
another definition of the redefining
Apple I believe right that's down well
is it yeah okay so we'll do the same
thing here so parentheses calm comment
and then again parentheses comment out
and that should be it
so now our Apple doesn't you know always
spawn in the same exact location or like
as a multiple of ten basically
and you'll see that we're still able to
actually that time I think that I don't
think we actually were supposed to have
gotten the Apple at that at that point
we try that again okay anyway okay um so
now they've made those few changes well
we're going to be doing in the next
video is actually making the we're going
to make our snake larger and we'll see
kind of the problem that arises when we
do that because now it's not just as one
object within another object it's we're
asking are we like partially touching
those objects so now you've got quite a
few more if statements that you're going
to need to add to cover you know are we
fully within that's fine we've got that
covered are we partial one object in the
other one that's fine we've got that
covered but we don't know you know what
if we're just grazing it and not only
are we grazing it on either left or
right but top or bottom as well so
that's what we're going to be covering
in the next video or maybe even the one
right after that one probably the next
video though how to handle that
situation so anyway thanks for watching
and stay tuned to the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
