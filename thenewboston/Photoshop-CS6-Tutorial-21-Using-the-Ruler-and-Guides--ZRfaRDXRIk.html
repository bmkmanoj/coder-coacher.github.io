Photoshop cs6 tutorial buddy blackford
here and I'm going to teach you how to
use rulers and guides now there is a
ruler tool in Photoshop cs6 and then
there are also rulers and guides that
you can put on your canvas so I'm going
to show you how to use both of those in
this tutorial and you can use these to
line up different things within your
scene so I'm going to do real quick is
I'm just going to create two rectangles
and they're going to have a fill-in I'm
going to make it a different color
because this color sucks let's do it
like this blue color and here go there's
a square and then here's another square
now what I want to do is align these
squares up so that they're like evenly
even at the top with each other so what
I'm going to do first is come to view
and I'm going to come down here to
rulers and that's going to bring the
rulers down on the side and now you can
use this measure these measurements here
to guide yourself where you need to have
everything lined up now the coolest
thing about these rulers is that you can
click on the ruler and drag down and it
will bring a guide down for you so it
snaps to different things so it has
snapped to this top of this square so
I'll do that and now when I can come to
this other or a rectangle now I can come
to this other rectangle and use it to
snap to here and now our rectangles are
lined up nicely so the way to get this
off is to just bring it up back off the
screen on to the ruler up there so you
can do that from this side also and it's
a pretty helpful I use these a lot
figuring out what I want to do so
Oh got that you can move these along and
snap them to them pretty easy you don't
even have to hold anything to snap these
to it it just automatically do when you
move it close so that's how that works
let's get this ruler out of here and
I'll show you the ruler tool which is
right here and it's underneath the
eyedropper tool or the note or color
sampler tool so it's within that so with
the ruler tool you can draw your own
lines and they don't have to go across a
whole entire screen or anything you can
draw them any way you want like this
they don't have to be completely
straight or anything like that
so now I got my ruler here and if you
can see on the actual guides up at the
top and on the sides there's a dotted
line and that dotted line represents
what part of the ruler amount so you can
use that as like a little measurement
helper there so I'm right now I'm moving
it and if you look at the top I'm moving
left to right so the top one is actually
moving a decent amount between nine and
ten right now you can see that so use
that for helping yourself figure out
where you should be so I'm going to drop
this tool down so all I did was click
and drag and it gave me these two points
now I can select these rectangles here
oops
no it's gone I've got to select this
tool again
my computer actually kind of like closed
for a second so I'm going to start over
so right now I'm on my rectangle layer
there and I draw my line out for my
ruler tool and then if I come over to
like straight and layer it'll rotate the
actual square up upon the way that the
ruler was actually created now when
you're using your ruler tool if you drag
it and hold shift it will snap to
45-degree angles like this you can see
that let me come up we come over here so
you can see it maybe a little better
so that's how that works and it does
45-degree angles for you
oops it control-z by accident so to
clear out your ruler you just go to over
here to clear and I'll click it out if
you hit control Z to try to clear out
your ruler all it does is nothing it'll
like it control Z is undoing all it will
do is undo the last thing you did that
wasn't the ruler tool so sometimes that
happens to me most things I hit control
Z for but you got to hit clear to clear
out your ruler tool you can also create
like a protractor with the ruler tool so
if you drag out and you let go you
create a line now you can go to the ends
and move them around if you would like
still with the ruler tool selected but
if you hold down alt and mouse over you
get the protractor icon and with that
you can drag out a whole new angle
so that's useful on that and then you
can move the entire thing by moving over
top and then you can also still move
your different points here with your
tool so that's fairly nice there
so that's how you use the ruler tool and
I guess that's where our tutorials going
to end today so it's got kind of nice
let's keep on saying like all the tools
are kind of nice I guess they are they
all got their purposes and uses so I
mean thanks for watching this tutorial

thanks for watching see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
