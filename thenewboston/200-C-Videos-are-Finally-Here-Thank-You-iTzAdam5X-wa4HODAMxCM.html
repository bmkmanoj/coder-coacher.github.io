just want to make a video real quick and
this probably is gonna be a real quick
video and I want to announce something
but first before I even get to that I
want to say that no I'm not just crazy
obsessed with windmills as you can see
as you can tell from all my windmill
pictures it's just that I ordered a
bunch of artwork and it has not come in
yet so you know I just wanted to get
that out of the way before all you guys
think that I'm a huge wooden little
fanatic so anyways the point of this
video is this I want to announce that
beginning tomorrow in all throughout
this weekend I'm going to be doing
nothing but uploading the c-sharp
tutorials the 200 c-sharp tutorials now
for those of you who are like well
c-sharp did what the 200 what are you
talking about well I made announcement a
while ago that I had someone making 200
c-sharp tutorials for me and the reason
behind that is this um about a couple
months ago I noticed that I was starting
to get a lot of requests for c-sharp
programming tutorials and for those of
you who don't know c-sharp is a
programming language and I want to make
these tutorials but like I said I just
don't have enough time to make all the
tutorials that you guys want so what I
did is I went on YouTube and I looked
for someone who was making c-sharp
tutorials already and I found this guy
named itz Adam 5x or it's Adam 5x and he
already had the series of like 20 C
sharp tutorials that was just absolutely
perfect just what I was looking for I
mean they were the quality was crystal
clear and they were super informative
and they're easy to understand and easy
to follow
so I basically messaged them and I was
like Adam and I basically begged them to
make tutorials for the new boss then I
told him who I was told him why I needed
these tutorials and you know all the
people who were requesting them so and
super nice guy he decided to go and make
two hundred tutorials for the new Boston
and finally about I want to say about a
week ago maybe I got them in the mail
and I haven't had time to upload them
yet but this weekend nothing but
uploading tutorials so there you go and
for those of you who are curious
it's basically covering everything
assuming that you never even programmed
in your life before
in taking you to an advanced c-sharp
developer I mean it starts out with just
basic variables if statements arrays and
you know it goes all the way to making
cool applications like a cool painting
application and a cool hangman game and
trust me if you guys have ever wanted to
learn c-sharp I would highly recommend
it it's super useful these are the
tutorials I know a lot of you guys have
been waiting for him so there you go so
anyways like I said itz Adam 5x or it's
Adam 5x I'll put a link to is a youtube
channel below but please if you guys
could go subscribe and I you know leave
him a comment say thank you for these
tutorials again it takes an incredible
amount of time and effort to make 200
tutorials you guys have no idea so you
know he basically spent his summer
making tutorials for the new boss and he
didn't have to but an incredibly nice
guy and yeah I'm super excited for these
so if you are interested in c-sharp
tutorials or I know he teaches like
Autodesk programs and also he has a
bunch of like Xbox videos if you're
interested in anything or you just want
to show your support and say thank you
please go and subscribe to his channel
it would mean so much to me so much of
the new Boston it's the least I could do
to get people to subscribe his channel
because it is absolutely an awesome
channel and another thing now that he's
done making all these videos for me I'm
sure he's gonna have some time to make
videos for his channel now so anyways to
Adam I want to say thank you so much
you've done so much for not only the new
Boston but for worldwide free education
as a whole so thank you for contributing
and to everyone else to my viewers to my
subscribers thank you for watching my
videos and I hope you look forward to
and I hope you enjoy these c-sharp
editorials and if he could go and
subscribe to his channel it would mean a
ton to me so thank you and I'll see you
