printing things out in the command line
fascinating but you're probably a little
bit more interested in how to use your
plugins I mean that's why we downloaded
grunt in the first place isn't it
so to use your plugins what we're gonna
be doing is this we're gonna be setting
up each plug-in individually in giving
it whatever options we need to give it
and then we're gonna be loading them in
and then running them so three different
steps it's actually pretty easy once we
break it up so just to set up the core
plugins you let me have a comment be
like uh configure like main project
settings something like that whatever so
in order to do that call grunt init
config and thanks to JavaScript you need
like parentheses and semicolons and
curly brackets everywhere so let me get
those out of the way so before we even
start loading in the plugins we're just
gonna say hey grunt look to this file
package like Jason for all the basic
information not only about our project
but in this file
it also has information about our
plugins what plugins were using what
version they are all the extra crap that
you know we really don't worried about
grunt needs to know you know just the
basic information so type actually let
me add a comment I'll put like basic
settings and info about our plugins all
right so in order to have grunt to read
in this file what we do is we write p kg
grunt dot file dot read jason and we
just give the file path and since we're
in the same directory package jason so
all this is going to do is it's going to
hop over here and read in all of the
basic information that it needs to work
with our plugins simple enough now in
order to set up an individual plugin and
for this example let me go ahead and I
will use a the CSS min so this is my
little website right here this is the
home page and I have two CSS file one is
content and one is sidebar this is a
really simple website it just has a
bunch of crap like says welcome to the
site in the main area and then it has a
little navigation menu I don't know why
because it doesn't mean a navigation
menu because I only have one page but it
was a quickest example I could write up
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna write
the CSS min plug-in which is gonna take
all the CSS and minify it into one nice
compact single CSS file now I'm gonna
use that file and I'm gonna call it main
CSS so take these two files compact them
and create a main CSS file that I can
use for my actual website so that's what
we need to do we need to set up the CSS
man plug-in so I'll just write name off
plug-in no ulcerate bug without the
alright so whenever you're setting up a
plugin you see how the naming convention
is grunts - can't read - something grand
- can't read my something well just take
the name of that such as CSS men or
uglify and that's the name of the actual
plug-in itself so the one that I'm gonna
use is CSS men and now what we need to
do is we need to give it the options in
other words the options that we need to
pass in this plugin it are what files
are you trying to minimize and for the
final result the final file that I'm
supposed to be creating the minified one
what is the name of that now the exact
naming convention is different for every
plugin if you just go to the whenever
you're looking at plugins they're gonna
give you a bunch of demos and you're
gonna see the name of convention and
what information you need to pass into
it but for this one I know that I'm
gonna combine since I'm combining a
couple files into one and inside here I
need to give it the files
so the files then I'm gonna use in is
first what's the final file going to be
called well it's in the HTML CSS
directory so HTML CSS and name the final
result once you're done with everything
main dot CSS now it's saying okay this
is the result what files are you trying
to compact and combined and we touched
those in an array so actually let me
just copy this because I'm lazy so the
first one is what was its content dot
CSS and the second one was sidebar dot
CSS so what this is gonna do is we're
configuring our plug-in to take this CSS
file which is this one and another one
which is this one tighten them together
and make main CSS so that's our
configuration settings and we have two
little lines of code that we have to do
after this the first one is actually
load the plug-in so we're pretty much
gonna go into node modules and load it
so we can actually use that code so
grunt dots load and PM tasks and for
this as you can see it's grunt -
contributing to load in this last line
of code that we need I'll just write
something like do the task so this was
just all information about setting up
our plugin last thing we need to tell
ground is hey um actually can you like
run this plug-in so grunt register tasks
and just say this is the default task so
whenever we run grunt whenever we type
ground in the command line just do this
by default and what do we want to do
this right here which is CSS men so the
reason I toss this into an array is
because if we ever want to do more than
one test then we can add it
here but right now I'm just making an
array with one single task in it and
that is minified the CSS files now I'm
about to run this and check this out so
right now in my CSS directory I only
have two files right here however after
I run it keep your eye on this and all
you do is you open up and you type grunt
and check it out one file created and
now if I open this you see that we now
have a main dot CSS with a nice minified
actually isn't that nice it looks pretty
ugly but it did its job so there you go
that is how you actually set up and use
a grunt plug-in again whatever plug-in
information it needs whatever data it
requires set it up right here in your
init config and then load the plug-in
and then actually say hey grunt can you
actually do what we told you to so
that's what this line of code is saying
right there and if you ever want to use
more than one plug-in at the same time
then let me clean all this up and
actually we don't even need that anymore
and what I can do is run that uglify and
I'll show you that JavaScript file I
have so this is my JavaScript file
nothing really important in here I
actually had to throw in a bunch of
worthless JavaScript just because I
thought I didn't have enough but say
that I wanted to minify this as well in
other words uglify it which it's called
you know I like how they keep changing
up the names so all we have to do is
this actually let me copy this comment
too so give it the settings and for this
one remember the name was uglify
and you pretty much set it up the same
way but the name of convention is a
little bit different the ist and files
is the same and let me clean up this
since we only have one file so my
JavaScript file my original one was in J
s and what was it called toggle dot J s
now actually when people minify these
files not only javascript but CSS they
usually a dam in um key word or I don't
even know if it's called a key word like
a separate extension kind of so if your
original one is toggle j s the minified
one would be something like toggle dots
min j s and alright so this looks good
to go we now configure two plugins the
one to minify CSS and the one to uglify
which essentially just is minify for
javascript now in order to make that
work we need to load the other plug-in
which is uglify and right in here we can
also say do the uglify task as well so
this right here is the task name and
this is your task options so these are
the options of the plugins the settings
essentially we're loading both of those
right there and then we're gonna say
okay actually do those things that we
just set up so now in my terminal if I
run grunt again keep your eye on this
directory now right now there is only
this toggle ojs file but I'm gonna run
grunt and it's gonna go through and do
the same thing with JA or excuse me with
CSS like we saw last time it's also
gonna create a new toggle dots Minjae s
so look at that and right now you're
probably thinking alright so it's
probably just quicker to download
separate tools and do this by hand but
trust me whenever you have an actual
website that has hundreds of CSS files
hundreds of JavaScript files then it is
incredibly easy and useful and
time-saving to set this grunt file KS up
one time
just like grunt anytime you want to
build your entire website or project so
that's the core basics of how to use
grunt I hope you enjoyed it see you guys
