am sniping on a derail i'm using my
personal favorite weapon in this entire
game and call duty in general the
Barrett 50 Cal I'm not sure if it has
FMJ on it not sure if I got it this game
yet and as you can probably realize i'm
using a spaz 12 as my secondary and I
was about say that and I am playing
domination this time instead of instead
of playing a regular team deathmatch I
decided to play I wanted to play
domination I got a good game out of it
and unfortunately I get killed by a
camper is camping with some light
machine gun don't know what it's called
done on which that one is called but
over here I'm trying to snipe of trying
to get to a good night sniping point and
then I go around and I get knifed by
some dude which I should have taken out
with my spouse 12 but apparently not
enough bullets went around hit him okay
over here um I get a kilogram I fleetly
stolen don't think that was fair at all
I decided a lot of people don't know you
could do this but you can actually climb
up on this you can climb up on this area
and you can actually jump from like
train to Train it's actually it can be
pretty useful but you're completely over
exposed I think personally okay I
decided to take out this guy's UMP
because rapid-fire rapid-fire is a very
good attachment wouldn't recommend using
it unless you it's like you're starting
out with it obviously better than no
attachment but um
let's get uh here I decided to just try
and get a good sniping point here and
see a decent portion of the map trying
to find least somebody that I can snipe
with my virtual Cal here decide to start
going on top of these things jumping
from one to one and going closer to
where they're spawning which that's
pretty good decision I think I see this
dude on my radar take him out with my
buried my beretta another dude and take
them out Oh in this game instead of a
care package I decided to use UAV very
helpful especially on this map there's a
lot of twists and arms and blah blah
blah okay here i see everybody on the
other team is inside this house
everybody and with my UMP I ate a lot of
them out like I don't even think yeah
look here's my hair your strike right
there I think nice I thought I was gonna
use my there yo there's where i was
going to use my area strike and i
decided to go up here and use comedy
predator unfortunately i don't get
anybody cousin dude had painkiller and
boom a triple kill as and if it wasn't
awesome enough i keep going on this kill
streak
trying to look around barriers start to
do some work basically on their small
basically on their spawn they cap day so
they're surprised we don't cap see it oh
there you go anyway I'm trying to find
somebody down this corridor right here
and I'm not sure if I do let's see
securing I know I decided to go start no
ok let's see i decided to go over here
and I'm trying to just like basically
kill anybody who comes down this
corridor and then I decide I want to
rush the side of this building oh when I
rest this building or no then I just now
I decided I want to go rush in the
building as my claim I've got um pretty
much on my team in general just pretty
much has this place covered at least
this half of the map covered and I just
started sniping people like crazy at
this point
I almost died right there unfortunately
and thankfully actually no thankfully I
didn't die I just gotta kick completely
kill steal okay in this game you saw I
haven't you saw I died and then i got
all of my kills i'm pretty sure i got
around a 20 kill streak i take that guy
out and i think they start spawning it
over at sea again so I'm just over here
see that yeah then my Claymore gotta
kill thankfully I see this guy and then
I died I would you position it sucks i'd
i'd never phone and he was using mozilla
mini uzi
a some other attachment don't remember I
made using a holographic sight excuse me
that's what it was it shot in the back
here because there's somehow drop behind
me I enemy UAV and thankfully we're
starting to win again and you can go
down don't probably last stand guy
speaking of lust and it's actually not
the greatest perk call of duty 4 was
actually pretty good because you're only
sidearm was a pistol so it wasn't
actually half bad get a kill steal um
but in this game with the shotguns and
regular and go and not regular handguns
the automatic handguns that you could
have it's just it's pretty useful with
right there a pretty awesome drop shot
right there and I'm just trying to look
around get another carrier strike which
I think I do not entirely sure but we're
winning here at this point I think
that's not team deathmatch so it's not
going to end trying to find somebody I
put my clit remember this time I
remember to put my Claymore down so I
don't die and get shot back how I die a
lot in this game
okay before my radar goes off just like
before securing Jerome I saw some guy on
my radar that was like to the left of me
aside the other team and I see son and
all of a sudden there are like four guys
to the left leg that's scrambler another
one edit are 21 something like that some
assault rifles and boom I got my
secondary instructions when I put it
exactly where those two guys were
and I think I get a kill but
unfortunately deja vu the guy didn't die
because of painkiller which is about
twice as worse as juggernaut if
anybody's ever compared I'd probably say
it's about three times as much health as
Jagran compared to a call of duty for
securing height which it can be annoying
as hell sometimes but that's like that's
just what it can't really
here I'm just trying to keep going on
another kill streak a time on we lost
Charlie think I think I sniper few more
people the game is getting nope epsilon
as I've said before I either get sniped
or get shot in the back this case night
in this case knife to the back but I'm
not mad because I got here your strike
and I'm not happy because I've got a
good Cajun I see this guy in the window
trying to trying to find out he doesn't
even come back right here I didn't
really don't get how I didn't kill that
guy at one shot and a boom headshot okay
right over here decided to try and no
you cannot dot you not kill me unless
again
not like last stand fast 12 oh and of
course it's another guy with some light
machine gun just like running around
light machine guns can be annoying put
that again I do know some people that
are pretty good well I guess what and a
little somewhat of an epic fail right
there cuz about Jill guy was mice past
12 right as the game ends and I got
thirty one and six really good game and</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
