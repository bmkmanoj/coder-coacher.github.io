this is a video tutorial created for the
new Boston now in this tutorial I'm
going to be talking about time stamps in
PHP now time stamps are a widely used
standard that has been utilized by PHP
in order to keep track of the current
time the current day and in fact we have
functions that can retrieve say a date
and a week or so or we could go with
just things like that now a time stamp
is a numerical value of the amount of
seconds so it's an integer value of the
amount of seconds from the first of
January 1970 so for an example let's
just echo out time we're going to echo
out time and this is a function that
returns the current unix timestamp so
let's come into our page here and
refresh and we can see that we're giving
given a large integer value now this
value here that you see is in fact the
amount of seconds from the first of
January 1970 now if you watch carefully
at the end here we've got 75 let's
refresh the page and see what changes
you can see it's changed to 90 now if we
do that again we're going to 94 and if I
gradually refresh it say every one
second you can see that this value keeps
incrementing so it's really useful to
keep track of the amount of seconds or
sorry of the current time depending on
you know the account depending on how
you process this value at the moment if
I was to say I uploaded a file or a
process to comment or I just did
anything on a webpage that would require
me or the functionality would be there
to tell me when I did it for example
let's say I did post a comment I might
want to create my website to show when
the comment was posted now if you were
showing you used as this value they
wouldn't really make much sense of it
I could say for example
the echo the current time is um and then
I append the time on to the end of that
if i refresh and this is really onions
not user-friendly at all
because what we're doing is we're
showing we are showing the time in terms
of from a certain day in it within
seconds we're not actually displaying in
a human readable form so how can we how
can we change this well let's just get
rid of that for now and let's go up here
and create a variable called time and
give it the current timestamp now down
here what we can actually do is we can
create a new variable called actual time
and we can proce this process this using
the date function now the date function
works with x as well and it takes two
arguments the first argument is how you
want it to be displayed that will go in
here and we have keys of different
things to use this and then the second
argument is the is a timestamp so I'm
going to type in time which is obviously
our current timestamp here so I'm using
this date function to process our
timestamp and show it correctly so
obviously after this we wrap we're going
to show the actual date so we can append
that on there now at the moment nothing
is going to happen if we refresh you can
see that it's blank
because we've taken the timestamp but we
haven't actually processed it in a way
now the most common way would be to do H
a small I and a capital s this is just
the way I always do it I prefer now this
is the hours this is the minute and this
is the seconds so we can put a colon in
between each one let's refresh and you
can see that what's happened
oh no what's happened
okay yet that's because I've actual date
instead of actual time there that's my
variable naming wrong there so let's
refresh we'll see what's happened well
we've got s T there oh that's it sorry
that's a small X refresh so okay now
we're showing the current time is 2014
34 and if I look at my clock on my
computer right now that you can't see I
know that that's correct so if i refresh
you can see that this time will increase
and as we come into the 50s we see this
time start to increase and go up and
then instead of just showing the normal
boring seconds that we've shown before
in the timestamp you can see this
changes according to according to the
time Stan that's dynamically updating
because the seconds are increasing so we
can format this in any way you like if
you go over to the PHP manual and search
for the function date you'll you'll be
shown lots of examples of how to format
this now what we can also do in here is
we can include the date itself so you
can do something like a capital D so we
could say D and Y so this is going to
show you the date the month and the year
because obviously using a time stamp we
can work out what the day is the month
and the year as well so if i refresh
that you can see it's coming up with
Friday April 2011 so I can change this
again I can put say a small D and a
small M and what this is going to do is
this could this is just going to process
it slightly differently
and show it a numerical format so
there's a lot there's lots you can do
I'm not going to cover everything that
you can type in here in every way but
what we could also do is we could say D
my and we'll just change this to make
sure it makes sense time or the date
time and then I could say at H I sorry H
PI s the code the colons in here are
just for display purposes so this now
reads the current date time is Friday
April 2
eleven at to zero or 816 and 31 seconds
so by doing this I have taken a time
stamp which originally we let's just
kill the page there originally we found
hard to understand because it's just an
amount of seconds
however PHP has some really useful
functionality in order for us to turn
this into a readable date so that's
basically what a time stamp it is that's
how you use it in PHP and like I said if
you go over to the PHP manual and search
for the date function you'll have a lot
more that I have a lot more options
there that you can format the date and
time in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
