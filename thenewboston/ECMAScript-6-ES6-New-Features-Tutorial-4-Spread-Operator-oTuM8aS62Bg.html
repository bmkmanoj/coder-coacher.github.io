this video I want to show you guys the
spread operator now the spread operator
is actually kind of confusing just to
kind of explain so instead what I want
to do is just get right into the
examples because once you see it you're
going to see how useful it is and kind
of how awesome it is to so I'm just
going to go ahead and make a function
and this function is just going to take
in three numbers and add them all
together so add numbers so I'll say a b
c which are going to be three different
numbers and we just actually let's just
not a even returned them which is log
them out so a plus e plus 3 or plus c
embarrassing all right so let's say that
i have an array of numbers called nums
and this is equal to i'll say 3 4 &amp;amp; 5
now anytime i want to use this function
with these array elements i mean we know
what to do we go nums that would be 0
and then let me do it the long way first
1 &amp;amp; 2 1 &amp;amp; 2 oh my god this is a pain in
the butt already so let me run this and
check it out we get 12 by I mean just
looking at this there has to be an
easier way of kind of taking all these
and throwing them right in there I mean
why do we have to use all this stupid
syntax right there well before we
couldn't we had to do it the wrong way
the way I just did but now with es6 it
allows us to do that using the spread
operator so anytime we want to use a
spread operator or in other words expand
an expression or an array we just use
three dots and then the name of the
array so what this does is instead of
treating this as an entire array it kind
of splits it up into three parameters
that we can throw inside a function so
now if i refresh this you can see that
we still get 12 let me just change this
to something else to show you guys that
it did indeed work 14 so isn't this
syntax a whole lot easier I think so so
again anytime you want
use the spread operator just have three
dots and then the name of the expression
or the array that you want to spread out
now in addition to just kind of taking
array elements and throwing them into
functions you can also do something like
this so say you had an array of meats
this of course was equal to the two best
meats in the world which were bacon and
ham and then you had another array
called I know food so what you wanted to
do is you wanted to take this array
which consisted of apples and then Kiwi
and then rice and you actually wanted to
make a brand new array so you just
actually console.log so alright so what
I want to do is I actually want to make
a new array or let's say that I just
wanted to take these meats and add them
to my food array but I wanted to add
them right after apples so I wanted
apples bacon ham Kiwi rice well what am
I going to have to do I'm probably gonna
have to like slice and then push I don't
know let me think about this I'm
probably going to have to iterate
through food and then after I get to the
zeroth element I'm going to all right
there has to be easier way that I can
just join these two arrays together
right well believe it or not there is so
anytime you want to take elements from
one array and throw them into another
one to pretty much make a brand-new
array all you have to do is this
after apples just go ahead and spread
out meats and that's it that's all you
need to do so what this does is it takes
these elements and it combines them with
these elements and then we get the
result apples bacon ham Kiwi rice
so how easier is this rather than you
know iterating through and then
iterating through this and adding each
element and then tacking on these ones
using a like push or something I mean
all we have to do is pretty much spread
it out and plop them in so that's what
the spread operator
is basically a way to take a JavaScript
expression which is most of the time in
array spread it out into individual
elements and then we can use it however
we'd like so the guys for watching and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
