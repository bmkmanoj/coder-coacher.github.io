tutorial on XHTML last time we learned
how to add line breaks and also how to
align the paragraph and today I want to
be talking you about a list specifically
definition lists an ordered list a
definition list is a little different
way of organizing your information other
than your typical paragraphs people use
it to define either terms or words or
sentences sometimes and to do that let's
get started the first tag that we use is
the DL tag
this stands for definition list and I'll
definition lists end with ending DL tag
so here's your beginning tag and here's
your end and anything when you're
writing this list is going to go right
here in between it so let's make the
first term in the tag for that is d t
stands for definition term and say we
want to say first term and then write an
ending DT tag to let the browser know
this is the end of your term on the next
line we're gonna want to write the
definition for of it for whatever that
terms are going to be and in fact for
this is d D it stands for data
definition so let's just write this is
my definition
and let me just copy that and paste it a
few times to represent what actual
definition might look like and you
always end it with a closing DD tag so
now inside our list we have a term first
term and the definition so let's save it
and take a look at what this looks like
as you can see the term is aligned to
the left and the definition is indented
slightly so this makes it stand out and
it's easy to define term so you just put
your word or sense that you want to
define right here and any term will be
indented directly underneath it so let's
get rid of your entire list so you have
a clear body and the next list I want to
talk to you about is called an ordered
list whenever you see something numbered
either a b c or one two three on the
internet they made it using an ordered
list and the tag to begin this is ol4
ordered list so let's start that and the
ending tag is a typical oal tag
and any items that you want to put in
the list are gonna have the tag li4 the
list item so let's add a first item type
in Li inside this is number one and you
end it with a typical Li tag so let's
add another item type Li type this is 2
and then close it off with the Li tang
now let's save that and take a look at
what it looks like as you can see you
this order list automatically numbers
these one and two and if we were to go
on it would keep numbering them three
four and five
depending on what order we type the list
but say we don't want to have numbers
and we want to have something like the
letters well that's easy in your opening
tag of your ordered list press between L
and the ending bracket and press space
and write type and the attribute change
a type if you want to change it to
uppercase you type a capital A for for
your value so your attribute is type and
your value is capital a so let's save
that and take a look at what it looks
like
as you can see now instead of numbers
the list has changed the capital letters
and there's a bunch of different types
that you can change it to there's
lowercase there's Roman numerals there's
lowercase Roman numerals and I'll
include all of this all the different
types of attributes you can change it to
on my website if you're not already
there you can go to www.hsn</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
