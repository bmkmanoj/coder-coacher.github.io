Python tutorial in this tutorial I'm
going to show you guys how to put
multiple parameters in the function now
in the lessor I showed you guys how to
build functions with a set number of
parameters but there's going to come
times like when you're building a
shopping cart or grocery list program
that you don't exactly know how many
things the user is going to have so you
need a way to tell Python that I don't
know exactly how many things or elements
are going to have but I need you to do a
certain thing to them so to do that
let's go ahead and make a function let's
call it lists for grocery list and
inside before I would show you just how
to add a single thing like that but if
you want to add many things an unknown
amount of things what you need to do is
put an asterisk before it and what this
does is this extra cells is how all
right whatever you put in for this
element instead of just treating as
single single thing treated is a tuple
so let's go ahead and do something to
this list and what we want to do is
print out food this is a really simple
function so now if we have lists and we
add an element like apples and call it
as you can see it doesn't just print out
apples it prints out apples as an
element in the tupple so now using this
asterisk we can add many elements to one
parameter instead of just writing a
whole bunch of different parameters so
let's go ahead and put list and let's
add I like to do that to get everything
that way apples peaches and beef why not
hey where my thing go alright now once
you press ENTER as you can see we get a
couple of apples peaches and beef and
this is a way that you can put these
parameters into tuples and also it's
useful with regular parameters too so
not only can you make a function to
treat multiple parameters or an unknown
mount we can also combine this with
regular parameters too
you say you wanted to make a profile for
someone that only has like one name or
something but you wanted to get like on
the ages of all the girls they dated so
let's go ahead and define profile move
my cursor out of the way and we want one
regular parameter called name and again
this has no asterisks in front of it and
I shouldn't have put those so since that
has no asterisks in front of it we can
only add one element to that so after
that we want a variable element so let's
go ahead and put extracts and put ages
and now this um profile function is
going to allow us to enter as many
parameters as you want it's going to
treat the first one is name and every
one after that it's going to treat as
ages so let me go ahead and print out
let's go ahead and just print name and
then print ages after that and now we
got a profile function name and is many
parameters after that so let's go ahead
and call the profile sure it's photo
right our first parameter let's go ahead
and put Bucky and then every parameter
after that so this is what we did our
first parameter is the name it's going
to print the name every parameter after
this is going to be treated as a tuple
or multiple values so let's go ahead and
add some 4243 what are these the girls I
dated 76 I dated a 98 year old woman 4
and a 54 not really but just for example
and let's go ahead and press ENTER and
let me show you guys what this what
happens the first thing it did is
treated this as name and this is because
it could only take one parameter so
that's all it took and next it's alright
you have multiple parameters right here
so I'm going to take the rest of these
things and treat it as ages so I'm going
to print this out is ages so that's a
way where you can get a function in
that are just having a known value or
you know how much the users in enter if
you don't have something like this where
you don't know how many girls they dated
all you have to do is press star and it
says all right just treat the rest of
them as a tupple and then you can
perform functions on this and it's a lot
easier than trying to deal with the
unknown value so that my friends is your
quick tutorial on how to use many
parameters in your functions and how to
convert many of the values in your
parameters in with tupple so I hope you
enjoyed I hope you learned something we
will be using this later on so practice
it get used to it again thank you for

channel and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
