and in this tutorial we are going to be
talking about groups so in the last
video we added a new user mom so now me
and my mom have access to this computer
but now I want to start setting up
groups so let's say that we um I don't
know maybe we're working for some
hospital and my mom is a nurse by the
way so I was going to make a group for
all the nurses and another group for all
the doctors and maybe a group for
unalike the surgeons service is
different than doctors who freaking
knows but that's what we're going to do
now if you guys are wondering why would
you ever make a group you probably
already know this but a group is a
really easy way to set privileges or
permissions for an entire set of people
in that way you don't have to go to each
individual user what you can do is you
can stick them all inside a group and
say hey you guys are allowed to access
these files but you guys are not allowed
access those files and it's just a
really easy way to manage permissions
for a bunch of users at once sounds
awesome let's go ahead and get started
so anytime we need to make a group we
need to run it as a super user and just
write group add now write the group name
and I'll just name this nurses so make
sure I have the right privileges and
boom we now created a group called
nurses now I am going to add my mom into
this group because well she's only other
user on this computer right now but
eventually more people are going to be
added to it you know depending on what
they do for work so in order to add a
user to a group you call the command
sudo
usermod' and then you write - a let me
type this person though explain what it
means - gee nurses mom alright so
usermod just means we're modifying a
user and this - a what this means is we
want to append them or add them to
another group now this gets you see this
a lot with - capital G a lot and a lot
of people
don't understand the difference whenever
they see a capital G and a lowercase G
whenever you see a capital G it means
we're going to just add them to another
group now if we have a lowercase G it's
going to change their primary group so
remember that I said that whenever I
created mom she was automatically added
to another group of the same name so
right now she already belongs to a group
called mom now if I just were to write
lowercase G it would remove her from mom
and only add her two nurses but I'm
gonna say whenever I do this now she's
still in mom but she's part of the
nurses group as well so she belongs the
two groups kind of weird but um you know
that's how Linux works so I'm going to
hit enter and I now add in my mom to the
nurses group so my mom's and nurses and
mom now if I ever want to delete my mom
oh no maybe I got mad at her because she
told me that I couldn't have I don't
know why'd I get mad my mom Iowa never
but if I ever wanted to the leader she
was worried about privacy issues then
like mom I'm your son this is my
computer I'm not going to hack you but
you just use userdel' which means user
delete what user do I want to delete
well I want delete my mom I'm mad at her
alright so that's how you create users
that's how you create groups and that's
how you add users and also delete them
from groups and we already sub for all
the different permissions for individual
users and also groups so if you guys
want to just stop watching this video
move on to the next one um feel free but
for those of you who want um who are
looking for you know a pretty advanced
explanation of how it works ban the
scenes then I'll show you guys something
really cool and by the way don't follow
along like don't type what I'm typing um
you know on your own computer because
you might mess something up but I'll
show you guys something cool alright so
right now I'm in my home directory and
you know that whenever you like go up
into a directory like desktop if you
ever want to go back into home then you
use dot dot what
if you ever want to go back a couple
directories itself : CD CD is separate
commands you can use CD dot slash dot
this means go up or go into my parent
directory twice so whenever I run this
then as you can see I am in like the
main core directory so you can't get any
deeper than this so again that's why I
said that don't really mess with any of
these files but what I wanted to show
you guys is this actually I won't clear
that out yet so a lot of your system
configuration files are in this etc'
directory right here so if we navigate
into etc' do LS la so we can see that a
lot of important files are right in here
now the passwords for users and hold on
I'm gonna sneeze nope I'm not gonna
McKenna I don't know I might all right
so the passwords for every user is in
this password file and we know it's a
file instead of a directory because it
has a - instead of a D so alright that
looks pretty interesting let's take a
look at that now to read file remember
we're just going to call cat password
now alright so this is the password file
for all the users on the computer and of
course my mom's not there because I
deleted her by the way your computer
makes users for like different services
as well it's not just like you in a root
arm you can see that root is right here
mine is right here and you know maybe
some different software they have a user
account as well but I want to explain
what these things are for anyone who is
interested so we have a bunch of
different pieces of information
separated with a colon this first one of
course is the username the second one is
the password but it says X right here
because the actual passwords even though
that this is the password file they
aren't stored in here so alright that's
pretty interesting
remember that for later on now all of
these other things are just the user ID
the group ID and so apparently Bucky has
1000 1000 for the user group this is you
can also have a real name for the user
so if you know just this is the user
name and this is my actual real name
which would be like Bucky Roberts if I
want it to optional and this right here
is my home directory so if I ever wanted
to change my home directory then I would
edit this piece of code right here and
this last bit of information this is
your shell path so whenever you just
open up your terminal or you're using on
well we'll talk more about shell scripts
in shell scripting and why your shell
path is important but that is the path
to your shell so there you go so let's
jump back into this password thing
because you know we're really worried
about a you know concerned about that
for whatever reason why are they all X
though well this is because like I said
the actual passwords they aren't stored
in this file and by the way if you just
want to you know hack into some system
and start looking at the passwords you
can't do that they're all encrypted
Linux always encrypts their passwords so
they're never stored in clear text all
right well we know they are all X so
where are they they're actually in a
directory or folder code shadow so this
is where all of your passwords are now
if we tried to look at this file
it said permission denied
even though our encrypted you're not
allowed to look at everyone's password
so remember I said that root was kind of
the user that could do anything that
they wanted so since I have super user
privileges if I call pseudo cat Shadow
then what I'm going to do is I'm gonna
say okay I'm not allowed to open it hey
shoot oh yeah you're opening it now I'm
going to tell you what to do so boom
roasted and there you go so now you can
see that our a a lot of the same
information before but instead of
this is my encrypted password now you're
like okay what about these other guys
right here why do they have a star well
oh sure I'll talk to you guys real
briefly about the different password
symbols X like we saw it means that the
password is stored in a separate shadow
folder and that's what we saw in the
regular password file this star means
that the user can't log in so this is
just a user for some kind of service on
your computer it's no one that you want
actually you know like SSH into your
computer and like an actual user account
they're different there for something
else and if you don't have any of these
symbols no encrypted texts no X no star
this means that no password is required
to log in so that's someone that may be
vulnerable and that's something that you
usually don't want but there you go
again never mess with any of these files
this is just a something that happens
behind the scenes so you never even want
to be in this directory but if you want
to know how users are stored and you
know where their password file is and
how their passwords are stored then now
you guys know how Linux works a little
bit better under the hood so I'm just
going to move CD to move into my main
home directory where I'm nice and safe
clear everything out and boom I'm good
to go
something guys for watching don't forget
subscribe see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
