video I want to start talking to you
guys about IP addresses now in the last
video I told you guys how to use binary
it was actually a video from 2009 one of
my earlier videos one of the first ones
I actually ever made but the reason I
told you guys about binary then is
because you need to understand binary
before you can really understand IP
addresses now a couple key points before
we begin is this so in that last video
we were demonstrating on an 8-bit system
in other words we had eight decimal
places eight zeros or ones now we saw
that with the 8-bit system we can have
256 different values so that's how many
possible combinations of zeros and ones
that you could have now a cool little
formula for figuring out how many
different values you can have depending
on what bit system or how many places
you have is this if you take - Wow that
was a horrible - if you take all right -
and you put it ^ whatever
bit system you have such as 8 that's
going to give you the amount of values
so in other words let's say that you had
a 32-bit system so you had 32 ones and
zeros if you took 2 to the 32nd power
this is going to give you something like
4.3 billion now this is actually pretty
important because later on we're going
to see that an IP address is essentially
like an ID number for your computer and
this means that we're limited to 4.3
different computers or devices that are
allowed to be connected on the Internet
and I'm going to show you guys exactly
why this is a problem and how we get
around it it's actually pretty cool but
first I need to explain something else
now let's forget about computers let's
forget about IP addresses in binary for
just a second because I want to explain
how to send a letter through the mail
now I know people don't do this very
often but whenever you send
through the mail you got to put a stamp
on it and then you write your return
address right here bucky Roberts New
York yada yada and I don't know let's
say I was send one to my friend in Texas
so I write his name I don't know like
Tom Smith and all right whatever
whatever Texas you know the zip code all
right so we have two different dresses
that are needed whenever you want to
send a letter this is who I'm going to
send it to and this is my return address
and it works pretty efficiently because
whenever we give it to the mail lady or
the mail guy she knows exactly where
it's going and where it's coming from
and also whenever Tom receives this
letter if he ever want to send one back
to me all the as to do is he just looks
at the return address
now IP addresses are a lot like regular
addresses just you know for people for
sending letters they're used to identify
each computer so that they can
communicate where do you want to send
the data and whenever you know let's say
you're requesting some pictures from the
server whenever you get that data back
where is it supposed to send it simple
enough now every single device that's
connected to internet is assigned an IP
address now like I said an IP address
just like a regular address this is just
a way that we can identify each
different device now whenever I say
device I'm not just talking about you
know laptops and iPads
I mean routers they have IP addresses on
every server has a unique IP address so
again like I said this is a way that we
can identify which device we're trying
to communicate with now whenever you see
an IP address and if you want to see
your own just go in google and type in
what's my IP and it's going to pop up
but you're going to notice that they're
written in this weird format it kind of
looks like it's broken up into four
different chunks one two three four and
these four different numbers are
separated by dots now these different
chunks these different numbers they're
technically called octets and they're
broken up just so it makes it a little
bit more readable instead of one law
a huge number but essentially what you
can do is you can take this 32 bit IP
address you can convert it to its binary
format so each of these numbers can get
translated into an 8 bit string now
since we have four of them that's why
every single IP address is 32 bits and
there are some exceptions that I'm going
to talk to you guys about later on why
those are and what those exceptions are
all that fun stuff but essentially
that's what an IP address is behind the
scenes it's a way to identify each
device on the Internet and it gets
translated directly to binary
whenever computers actually want to send
and receive data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
