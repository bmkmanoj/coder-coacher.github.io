talking about styles and themes so first
of all what is a style well let's say
that you had a bunch of I don't know
maybe you had a bunch of these inputs
where the user could type something into
your app and uh we just change the size
of this to like 300 DP alright so you
had one on the signup page and you had
one I don't know maybe they could like
leave a comment to their friend or
something and you wanted all of these
little inputs these plain text fields to
have a gray border and I don't know
maybe like a tinted light blue
background so what you decided to do is
add a bunch of these in then okay got to
go to background and uh and where's
border got to change okay that's going
to take like a thousand days if you're
going to have to do that to every single
one so instead what you can do is you
can make something called a style now a
style is kind of like a class in CSS
it's a reusable design so you can make
one style and then apply it to every
single element that you want and if you
ever want to change it I don't know
maybe you want to change the color of
the border to red then you can just
change the style once and it changes on
all of your widgets so let me go ahead
and delete that and let's go ahead and
learn how to make these babies right now
so right click on values because this is
where you put them new values resource
file and I'm just going to name this
something like ocean XML since this is
going to be out my like cool blue ocean
styling and hit OK so by default we're
given this alright this is just our XML
stuff and in resources is where we're
going to stick everything so the first
thing I want to do anytime you want to
make a new style let me adjust my seat a
little bit you add the element style
just like that now the name of your
style is just what do you want to let's
say you're going to make a bunch of
you're going to apply the style to make
your text blue so I'm just going to name
the style something like baby blue
and you have an option to add a parent
but we won't do that right now
now what a parent is is essentially
something that you can inherit from so
I'll show you guys how to do this later
on but right now I really don't want to
overwhelm you the really basics of a
style is anytime you want to make a
reusable design just include a style tag
and give it a name and then you can use
this name whenever you want so of course
if we're going to make a reusable design
we might as well add some you know cool
designs so each attribute or property
you add in the item tag so the name I'll
just write Android the first thing I
want to do is just set the layout width
if I could find it layout width and
height all right so the property of
course is in your tag in in between you
write the value so wrap content let me
just copy this and sets layout tight so
I'm going to be applying this style to a
bunch of different text she let's drag a
few more on there check a large text
right here and a large text down here
all right so the first thing I want to
do is I just want to change the width
and height just to wrap the content and
that's just for housekeeping stuff now
let's go ahead and get to the good stuff
so I'm going to cut this one more time
and the property that I want to change
is text color so on all of these
elements I want to set the text color to
something like actually here's what I'm
going to do I'm going to set this to ef
ef ef which is kind of like a light gray
and then I'm going to set the background
of it because I don't know I just think
that'll be really easy to see so the
background color is just background and
one my favorite blues is zero zero six
six nine nine so this is going to have a
blue background with um like a light
gray font
so now we have a style whenever anything
is baby blue then it's essentially going
to make that widget blue so how do we
apply this style to these widgets well
if you go in your activity or wherever
the widget is then let's go ahead and do
it to this first one right now and also
what I would like to do is just select
all of this and then hold down ctrl alt
L and then run this and then this is
just going to reformat everything again
that's ctrl alt L and it makes
everything nice and neat so the first
thing that you can add is a property
called style so in your text view and
apparently I selected the second one oh
well still work add a style attribute
inside the property to add style
baby-blue now check it out as soon as I
apply a style to this widget right here
it changes it to blue as we specified in
our XML style right there now I can
apply this to every single one this
third one and also the first one and how
awesome is that
now the cool thing about this is if you
ever wanted to go back and say you know
what I actually want to change these all
to have a red background so instead of
just going through ok let me select this
background then this one background then
that one background all you have to do
is go to your styles and then just
change this to some color red and then
pop back over pretty stinking awesome
but of course the name is baby blue so
I'm going to keep that blue for now and
check it out so now let me explain that
inheritance thing I was talking about
because it's going to make a lot more
sense now so you guys already know what
inheritance is it's pretty much grabbing
all of the stuff from somewhere else and
using it in whatever you're creating so
it's just like Java kind of so let's go
ahead and our oceans that XML and
inherit from baby blue now of course
whenever we inherit what we need to do
is we need to give a new name and the
name is actually really important the
first part is
if we just type it baby blue right here
that says inherit everything from baby
blue and then add a little period in
what this allows us to do is it allows
us to give it a kind of our own custom
version of baby blue so I'm going to
name this one big blue and that's how
you inherit from any other style so
right now even though that it looks like
nothing is in here essentially what we
did is we copied all of this and we're
pasting it in here so now if we add
something like item and set something
like enjoy I know we'll just change the
text size so what we can do here is just
change the text size to like something
big like 30 SP then again anything that
we apply the style baby boo baby blue
big blue is not only going to get all
the stuff from baby blue right here but
we also overrode the text size to make
it 30 SP and this just bumps up the text
a little bit so for this first one right
here let me go ahead and change this to
baby blue dot big blue and check out
what happens so again it gets all the
stuff from baby blue but also the new
crap from big blue as well so that is
inheritance and the thing that may
confuse you so I just want to touch on
this a little bit whenever you are
inheriting from a style that you created
yourself use the syntax of the Styles
name dot separator and then the new name
now if you look in Styles right here
which is the default one whenever they
inherited from some routes they had this
parent attribute so again that's the
only difference if you want to inherit
from something that you created then use
the dot separator but if you want to
inherit something from Android then you
need the parent so right now we are
inheriting from the dark action bar
which pretty much is
um makes the actionbar like dark gray
and all that stuff so if you guys ever
get confused about like different
inheritance that is why but now that you
guys know the basics of styles in the
next tutorials what I want to do is I
want to show you guys something called a
theme and the theme is how you can
pretty much apply an overall style to
your entire activity and not just
individual widgets</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
