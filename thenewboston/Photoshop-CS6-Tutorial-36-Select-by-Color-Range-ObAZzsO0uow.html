awesome Photoshop cs6 tutorial where i'm
your host buddy blackford and today i'm
going to go over a selection tool but
it's not actually within the tools over
here it's up within the select menu and
it's called color range so what we're
going to do is be selecting by color
range and this is useful when you need
to just get certain things out that just
aren't that easy to remove so one thing
that we've got here is the different
color splotches that are within my
letters here that I've got going on and
the the client doesn't want these
letters to be this kind of yellow he
wants them to be a different color so
what we're going to do is select by this
color range and then we'll be able to
change the color of of that so we're
going to use our eyedropper tool here
that's selected over here and we're
going to select that color and we can
see down here in our selection that we
have just the that color selected I'm
going to hit OK and we can see that that
color is selected now I can change that
color here by maybe going to the blue or
something like that and then if you hold
down alt and hit backspace you can fill
in the selected color with whatever
color that you want so you pick your
color over here in the color picker and
then you hold alt and press backspace to
fill up your selection with the fill
color that you have picked now we can
see that it has gotten most of the color
but some of it not so much so we have to
adjust the color range
here so I'm going to step backwards and
try to fix our range that's going on
here
let me zoom in so I can see what's going
on and it just looks like that our
selections aren't wide enough so what we
want to do now is come over to select
and we're going to come to grow and then
puts our pixels of our selection out a
little bit more and selects everything
that we have going on as you can see so
what I did was select and I want to grow
and it grew out the selection by a
little bit and it selects everything so
now if I hit alt backspace to fill this
in now we don't have as much yellow now
I could come in and fix some of the
stuff that's - that has some yellow in
it but overall for the most part I got
everything I mean there's this piece
here you can just come in and like
manually come in and fix these but for
the most part we have got our color
selected and changed so that's how you
use your color range selector you could
also use it to just take out like the
the white or something like that
so I select this I take out the white or
select the white hit okay and notice
that the insides of the letters are
selected unlike when you use the magic
wand tool
I've hit delete here and now everything
is deleted out now you don't have to
come in with a magic wand tool and
select the insides of these letters so
that's a little bit quicker way than
using just the magic wand tool so
there's more than one way to do things
so think just think of all the tools you
have and think of what you can use to
help get you help get stuff down quickly
so I might as well go over some of the
different options that are in the color
range tool we've got our select the type
of colors we have here if you want to
use the eyedropper to click on things
use the sample colors and click on this
and then there's a drop-down you can
pick reds yellows whatever then we got
highlights mid-tones and shadows that
you can pick and then you got skin tones
to help you select things in like the
face or something like that
so with when you have skin skin tones if
you click on detect faces and then start
picking the colors from the skin tones
it'll help you get a better skin tone
selection and that's new and cs6 so
let's just go to simple colors here and
go over the different things in here
because you probably mostly use the
sample colors so go to this localized
color clusters here and what that does
is it constrains your selection to a
specific area and if I have that
selected I use this range slider here to
select a different area so what I did is
I selected this white from up here and
it's selecting the certain area off the
white but if I move the range it's not
selecting as much so just use that as a
like let's try it well we'll try it and
I'll hit delete and I'll show you what
it meet what it did so it kind of like
feathered it off and faded it off but it
didn't completely make everything
transparent so it didn't completely
delete out everything so I may go back
go to color range again and take off the
tech faces we don't need that and we'll
take off the localized color clusters
now the fuzziness here just it increases
or decreases the color value selected so
if you move back move it to the left it
will decrease and you move it to it if
you move it to the right it'll decrease
if you move it to the left it will
increase the basically the hardness of
your selection
we've got selection and image down here
and these are pretty self-explanatory
your selection is going to display what
you have selected and the image is going
to just display your entire image going
in and selection preview you can you can
change the different ways you see this
selection up here so there's black Matt
there's greyscale there's none so that's
how pretty much all there is you want to
invert there's the button there if you
want to add to your different selections
so if I wanted to select the white and
the blues and hit OK it's going to
select the blues and whites and since I
have the localized colors on when I
selected this one it only selected
within the area but let me go back again
want to select white and I want to
select blue I'll hit OK
it now has selected the whites and the
blues so if I delete it now it's just
the black colors so that's how the color
range selector works very useful tool
and I if you remember that it's up there
within the Select color range
you're going to be able to mask out a
bunch of different colors that you would
want to otherwise have a hard time
getting at so thanks for watching this
one a little bit more likely but it's a
good tool to know and no three went
through so see you guys later on the
next tutorial subscribe if you want to
see more photoshop and like the video if
you thought it was a good video so see
you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
