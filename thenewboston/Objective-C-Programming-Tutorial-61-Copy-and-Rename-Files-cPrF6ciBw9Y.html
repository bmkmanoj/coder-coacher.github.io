we learned how to do is pretty much well
we created the basic tester file named
tester file and inside was just some
text my name is Bucky and I like him
with pretty much everything spelled
wrong
and we created a file manager to work
with this file and we pretty much just
made a simple test to see if the file
existed but now what we want to do is
you know kind of mess with this file a
little bit like make a copy of it show
how to rename files right from your
program so let's go ahead and do that so
like I said the first thing I want to do
is show you guys how to make a copy of
that file so go ahead and add a little
comment make a copy of the file so in
order to do this go ahead and add if
statement and go ahead and might as well
make your error message right now NS log
cannot copy the file and let's see we're
on return too so check this out if we
get this error message we're gonna say
return 1 this one return to that way if
you have like a huge program you can
easily see which error message you're
getting so anyways the method to do this
to make a copy is called copy item and
path so you're gonna put in your if
block the manager since this is the only
object that can mess with our files copy
item at path and it's your first
parameter you're right alright
what is the file that you want to copy
and this is tester file and is your
second parameter this is called to a
path you're right alright where is the
path you want to copy to or pretty much
what do you want the new file name to be
so go ahead and press at and just name
it new file so what this is gonna do is
it's going to create a new file in the
same directory remember we didn't put it
in any other directory like that this is
in the same exact directory but this
file is going to be called new file so
now after this there's one more
parameter and this is
err parameter and just go ahead and set
this equal to null so all of this is
either going to return a yes or no and
if it returns yes it means that it works
if it returns no then we get this error
message and it says cannot copy the file
so let's go ahead and watch this run and
alive real time see what happens tesslar
file and bang our new file pops up it
copies this file which look at the
contents
my name is Bucky and I like ham and
Tesser file new file
my name is Bucky and I like ham so the
same exact contents from one file to
another so that is pretty much how you
make a copy of one file again you have
to use your file object manager and for
the first parameter you write what file
you want to copy for the second
parameter your right where do you want
to copy and what's your file going to be
and make sure you just put air in all
equals no now check this out we actually
need to delete this file right now
because in the next example if I try
running this exact same thing again re
running this code it's gonna say all
right
well let me go ahead and run it right
now I'll show you guys it says if I run
it again it says cannot copy the file
well what the heck I just ran this
program and we're fine why can't I copy
it again because when I try to copy it
again
a file already exists called new file so
when you say all right copy this file to
this path it says hold on bussy we
already have a path con new file so go
ahead and delete this move to trash and
now I can go ahead and show you the next
example so the next example I want to
show you is how to rename that copy so
once this code runs we're going to have
a file called new file even though we
just deleted it so then your boss comes
in he says alright I want you to rename
the copy so here's what you do go ahead
and make if statement and let's go ahead
and make our error message might as well
NS log
can not rename the file and let's see
where our on a return three so even
though we spelled that wrong
if this pops up then it means we cannot
return the file so there actually is no
method to rename a file what you need to
do is kind of trick our program in doing
so so of course we need that manager
object to manage the files in this is
called
move item at path and if you're saying
alright Bucky you told me we're gonna
rename a file
you didn't say we're gonna move anything
around so what's the deal well check
this out you write what file you want to
move new file alright and then you're
right where you want to move it to path
alright still we're not renaming
anything but check this out we're taking
that file and putting it in the same
exact folder or same exact directory
with a new file name so it was a new
file and now it's new file - and go
ahead and as your third parameter err no
and if this is exactly equal to no that
means something went wrong so check this
out we in order to rename a file all
we're doing is we're picking up that
file putting it in the same path right
next to it with a new file name so I
mean we aren't actually moving it we're
just moving it in the same directory
with a new name so in essence it's like
just like renaming the file so let's go
ahead and run this hopefully I didn't
type in the errors and see what I get
tesslar file of course save it and it
says new file - pretty cool so before
your eyes before you could even see it
what the is it took Tessar file made a
new copy called new file and then it
took that new file got rid of it moved
it in the same path with a new file name
new file - so we ended up with a tester
file in a new file - which again has the
same contents of
sir file so again one last time in order
to rename a file there's no method to
rename what you need to do is move it or
copy it in the same path just with a new
file name um the difference between copy
it makes actually a duplicate and move
it just picks up the old one and moves
it somewhere else
in this case we just move the somewhere
else and gave a new file name which only
which didn't create any duplicates at
all so that's how you rename the copy
and there's a ton of other stuff that
you can do with files a ton of very
helpful stuff and we're gonna be talking
that in the next tutorial but for now
I'm out of time so thank you for
watching don't forget subscribe and I'll
see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
