playing Search and Destroy on Afghan and
um really quick I'm just gonna
completely ignore what I do for the
first two rounds here um because I
pretty much only get like one kill and
then I start doing really good in this
game so I'm going to talk about
something else um announcement I have an
announcement to make me and Bucky are
going to take like a pole or something
like that or popular or a vote for what
you guys want me to use in call of duty
like would you want me to use a what or
would you want me guys want me to use
like what you guys use what you want me
to use what I've been what I've been
using now do you want me to use
something or do you want me to use like
so something Bucky with me Kirsten
anything like that I just want to let
you guys know um that work we are going
to do something like that to get you
guys involved if you guys how how
exactly we're going to do this is I had
you have my own YouTube channel yes I do
um I'm gonna put our Bucky's gonna put a
link to my particular channel on this
put it in this video and he's uh what
you guys can do is you can send me like
I'm you can send me a message
sent or put like a comment on one of my
videos or something like that and say
like do you want or say like I want blah
blah blah weapon set up for call of duty
blah blah blah weapon set up for Bobby
yeah you get ready for the next bad
company two okay and I just wanted to
say something right here or in this
round I switch to a UN silence to ump
with search and destroy a full-blooded
proactive and I know not coldly not
cold-blooded pro just regular
cold-blooded and a marathon steady aim i
think and a spaz 12 anything and this is
this a round or next round or one of the
next few rounds i was actually when i
start to dominate this game back to what
i was saying about my announcement
um just letting you know yes this was my
idea if anybody was ever wondering did I
think do I think it'll work maybe so i
think i could get some gameplay maybe
you i think that you guys are probably
gonna pick what I'm just keep to keep
what i'm using now probably not so i
just wanted to say i just wanted to say
all that um and just send a message to
my epic fail click but next thing a
claymore right there and a lot of people
don't know that you can knife a claymore
and I learned that from only use me
blade who is my favorite favorite
machinima director gonna know anyway um
as I was saying before what we're gonna
say I'm gonna have Bucky put a link to
this channel and you guys can either
leave a comment on one of my videos or
sent a message to my channel um and then
you can got and then you guys can um and
then I'll record it in whatever way like
writing it down or on my phone or just
something like that and then I can have
you guys do it all right that I can have
yeah and then I can just do it if you
guys want me to use like the worst
weapons in the game don't expect you
gameplay every week because if I'm using
so much what you want something crap so
I'm using some crap random like
that it's not very good like if I'm
using like I'd say that the worst sniper
is the wa2000 or other guests by my
brother likes to call it the lawsuit it
is it's good but probably start playing
hardcore with that because it's only a
one shot kill inside hardcore which I
probably wouldn't have a problem with
that but I don't expect new gameplay
every week or if you guys want me to use
I'd say that either the p90 or the
vector would probably be the worst
submachine gun I'm probably going to get
a lot of hate comments for saying that
but that's just my opinion for the next
round I'm probably not gonna get do very
good well I might be able to get some
flips do some pretty well with the
vector um that'd probably be it if you
guys want me to do free-for-all gameplay
I'm not saying that's the worst I'm just
saying it's probably what I would you
are probably what I would end up doing
that's probably what my gameplay would
be in because sana no prestige like
Bucky's name it'll suck oh and one thing
if you saw what the guy that I just kill
watch this watch this watch this knife
with a laptop
that was complete pure ownage right
there no questions okay um I get like
these up like if you guys want back to
what I was saying if you guys want me to
use like let's say like a vector or
something like that I'm I would play
searches just I wouldn't be playing
search destroy with that I'd still would
be playing a game type like some I would
be playing a game type like free-for-all
or dominate domination demolition where
I could probably still get a decent
amount of kills with it and then let's
see first assault rifles definitely the
W or the f2000 opinion because it's so
much recoil on it I could probably do
well with everything except that for
that particular assault rifle if you
guys want me to use the riot shield
actually I've been thinking I sendeth
put a comment send me a message I will
use the riot shield on if you guys want
me to I do have some friends who
actually use the riot shield also and
they loved it so I think I'd probably
have a good time I probably just
wouldn't have to best out Katie strike
just saying um and uh let's see what's
the other type of guns that there is
some rifles submachine gun sniper rifle
Oh light machine gun um light machine
guns I usually wouldn't use if I was I'd
probably be I probably be still using
the rpd which is my personal favorite
just for the sake because I never use it
or I'm not good with it all right I'm
good with it but I'm not like very good
with it I don't do very good with it at
all me soon um okay um over here I just
want to say this is a quick tactic i
usually don't use before i continue you
see I don't even go anywhere towards the
bomb because they're either expecting me
and there
multiple people I hits and I did see
that guy so I just let the bomb go off
and then I get but he's not spammed with
double desert eagles by some retards
using as you called i modded controller
so much and destroy if you see people
with the modded controller send them
either a hate message or send them a
band message because it pisses everybody
off pisses me off this is my friends off
this is people I don't even know
if you're going to use a modded
controller just don't really just don't
want any fun for you but it completely
ruins every aspect of this game okay um
this round I think we only get like our
I kill and maybe I don't get I'll kill
and um this is basically what I
announced today is basically all I
wanted to say for this entire video
basically pretty much I think I've got a
bomb planet or maybe I die trying to
plant the bomb I don't remember what
happens here but this is just an old
video I never put up because I got sick
last week
and um just the end of the game we
definitely pretty much have the win
right here basically all that happens
and I think some other some guy and my
team gets this guy over here or maybe I
do I don't remember I just don't
remember so um I hope my i hope this
video put some more interest to you guys
when it comes to luckys channel i hope
you guys can check out hope you guys
would check out my channel at all and
there's the game winning kill right
there and that's basically all i want to
say we are going to be hosting that and
that's it Kyle out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
