and he asked me for a way to print out
all the information about every employee
in our company so we have 500 employees
and they each have a user ID a first
name a last name and we also store their
age and their weight because while my
bus is where you wants to make sure um
you know no one's eating too many
cheeseburgers so we also keep track of
their weight so this is what I did I put
int user ID and then I put char to make
a character array first name and no one
has a first name longer than 25 I also
did this for their last name and I also
needed a store and print out their age
so that's an integer and their weight
which is a float alright so this can
store all the information for user 1 and
now let me just do this for user 2
okay okay oops oops messing up there
your - - you know what if I do this for
500 freaking people it's going to be a
pain in the butt so I'm scratching my
head and I'm thinking would it be cool
if we could just make this template one
time a template that could store the
user ID first name last name agent
weight and we can use it over and over
and over again I know what I can do I
can use an array is you can store a
bunch of crap in there okay well wait a
minute an array can only store a single
type of variable for example it can only
store in or floats you can't store an
INT and a char and a float in the same
array ah crap so we can't use that well
ladies and gentlemen welcome to the
wonderful world kind of a tongue twister
of structures a structure is a way that
you can group a bunch of variable types
together and they don't need to be the
same type for example you can pretty
much create a blueprint for a person and
store an INT a care and a flow all
together pretty freaking sweet so let me
show you
had to do that and you guys are going to
love me after this now I want to mention
one thing whenever you make a structure
you can just go ahead and make it up
here or wherever you want but 99% of the
time programmers like to make their
structures in a different file
it just helps organize everything and
it's just I don't know comment amongst
programmers so they put them in a
separate header file and maybe remember
that we made this header file like I
don't know 20 tutorials ago or something
so open that back up first of all cut
this because we don't add any of our
structured definition in the main file
so now let me show you guys the basic
syntax of how to create a structure
whenever you create a structure the
first thing you write is struct pretty
much they'll see hey I'm going to make
any structure the next thing you do is
you need to name your structure and this
is just so if you have like a structure
to store employee information and if you
have another structure to store I don't
know student information maybe teacher
information well if you have multiple
structures you're going to need to be
able to identify them so we need to name
it so after this what you do is add two
little curly braces and a semicolon the
semicolon just says we're done with the
structured now in between those curly
braces is where we write all of those
individual variables these are called
members of the structure so a structure
is pretty much just a group of variables
and those individual variables are
called members simple enough so now
basically as I'm going to be showing you
guys later on what we can do is we carry
a bunch of users and they can each have
an integer character for their name all
of this crap and we just group together
a bunch of variables of different types
pretty freakin sweet and if you're ever
wondering well what's this useful for
it's really useful whenever you're
working with um you know like users or
employees and you want to like display
all of their information at once as a
table or anything like that so I'll show
you guys how to actually use this
structure right now
now that
we made it might as well use it right so
of course since this is in the header
file the first thing we need to do is
import this so or include it I should
rather say I'm use the program Python
anyways include and remember we can just
use those double quotes
Bucky's info H and what this does is
essentially copy this and paste it right
in here it does the same thing even
though you know it's going on behind the
scenes so now we have that structure
included so let's use it right now so
whenever we use a structure the first
thing we need to do is remember we can
store as many people as we want using
the same template so how do we sort each
individual person well just say that
we're going to be using the structure
what when are you going to be using what
were you going to be using the user
structure that we just created and after
this you write like the name of the
person so we'll say for this one for
this template we're going to do it for
Bucky and you can do this for as many
people as you want now we're going to
say okay let's do it again and let's use
another one for Emily okay simple enough
so if you're saying okay so Bucky now
has a user ID first name last name aging
wait Emily now has user ID first name
last name agent wait a lot faster than
typing out you know uhm user ID one two
three four
save this a whole bunch of freakin code
but how do we actually set Bucky's
weight to something or set Bucky's user
ID to something well in order to do that
you do this type the name of whatever
you named it up here so Bucky and then
after it hit the dot and this is a new
operator that I want to tell you guys
about this is called the dot operator
and it's used for accessing individual
elements or items inside your structure
and again they're called items or that's
what I call them but technically they're
called members so user ID as a member
first name is a member so this is how we
says each member or variable inside the
structure
so say to set Bucky's user ID just put
Bucky's dot operator user ID and just
treat it like a normal variable so
what's my user ID I don't know we'll set
this equal to one so whenever we're
setting the user ID of Emily Emily user
ID course she doesn't want one she wants
to so on and so forth now after this
again we don't just need to set it
explicitly using the equal signs we can
do cool stuff like puts so just give
them a little prompt will allow the user
to run this program and like enter their
first name or something I don't know so
enter the arm first name of user 1 and
on this okay actually that's good
I'll keep this program simple and of
course whenever we do gets just like
before we put Bucky first name and
typically just just feel like user 1 and
user 2 but just saw so I can like really
easily display what's going on or just
put Bucky first name you know a little
bit easier now of course we can do this
for another the first name of user 2 of
course that would be Emily's first name
so whatever name they enter right here
get stored in the first name of Emily
and Bucky tomato tomahto
simple stuff so I guess now that we know
how to access the members of a structure
how to make a structure might as well
just go ahead and print it out get this
story over oh so we can move on to
something a little cooler actually so
put like
okay these are one can't type I'll print
out
Bucky's ID user one ID is percent a and
I'll keep that tuned to the line who
 cares so ID is bookies user ID
and copy this
alright so users - let's see first name
is that would be a percent s because of
the string and that would be Emily's
first name which is hopefully Emily all
right and that's pretty much it so now
when I run this bad boy come on there we
go
all right so enter the first name of
user one well that is Bucky enter the
first name of user - that's Emily check
it out
user one which is me my ID is one these
are - Emily her first name is Emily
simple stuff so again this isn't really
useful in this sample because right now
our program is really small it only has
two users however when you have uhm
bigger programs and when you're actually
working for a company what's going to
happen is instead of having to type
these variables 500 times for each user
you can just make one single structure
and it can be a blueprint for every
single user so then you can do just cool
things and loop through in like a print
out all of their items and database or
in a CSV file or whatever you want to do
but now you know how to use structures
and since we know how to use structures
we learn about memory in the next
tutorial I want to start talking to you
guys about files how to create a text
file programmatically and some really
cool things that you can do with them so
thanks for watching remember to
subscribe and how it will see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
