and sixty ninth the Android tutorial for
the new Boston we're doing this
tutorials we're just gonna set up a
renderer the basic framework and just
kind of render something and just get
something going and we'll just kind of
talk about the methods that the renderer
uses and what it's what it's for for the
most part well let's add that code that
line of code I told you guys we need to
add it within this tutorial for our GL
example class and again we set up that
surface for you called our surface and
all we're gonna do is add a renderer to
it so we're gonna say dot set render and
we're just gonna say a new GL render a
renderer X which is what we're creating
and there we go just basically we're
setting up a renderer that we're
creating this you know when I thought
about making the classes named I was
debating whether I should put the GL in
front or not because this isn't you know
this is just a class that we made so
just keep that in mind so that's what we
need to setup now is this GL renderer
example class so let's switch over to
there and what we're gonna do is we're
gonna allow this class to implement a
renderer so we're just gonna say
implements render so we get all of the
methods available to us and then we just
have to you know import this and add the
implement methods unimplemented methods
and we have three methods that we can
work with I'm just gonna change the
order of these because it's just more
convenient for me so I'm just gonna cut
this one and paste it above top where we
have our service created and we're just
gonna change some of these variables
just so it's more familiar we're going
to change this one to GL we're gonna
change this one to egl config as well as
for this second method which is our draw
method to GL and some of it some of you
guys Madhuri have these names as as I'm
displaying them here but if you do you
can just skip that I'm just gonna say GL
for that
for again for a GL 10 object and we're
also going to change this one to width
and this one to height so there we go we
have the basic framework of our renderer
setup now let's just talk about what
these methods do when they get called
and all that good stuff
so obviously our surface created gets
called the point our render gets created
and we get this GL tin object which I'll
talk about more as you can see all of
the classes get that get that object to
work with so that's pretty important
which we're gonna get into in more depth
later but as for now just the basic
framework of the methods here again our
surface when our surface view gets
created it calls this method to set up
some of the basics that we want our
render at a handle like we can set and
if you guys have worked with like 3d
graphics before like blender or 3d
studio max whatever basically there's
this where we set our camera like when
you render you can have it render smooth
or you can view it while you're making
it as smooth and you know all that kind
of stuff that's where we set up our
render basics that you know look on
create kind of stuff within this on
surface created method this on draw
frame method is where we have the fun
where we you know change this is
basically like our canvas and our on
draw or where we unlocked our canvas and
we like painted some stuff to it then we
locked it back up again that's kind of
what this is this is what's gonna get
refreshed over and over so if we want to
change stuff it's gonna happen within
this draw frame so that's pretty basic
this on surface created method is if
we're I'm sorry on this on surface
changed method is if we go from like
landscape - you know portrait it's gonna
change the basically the way
everything's been set up so it's gonna
call this method and see if we want to
you know handle that somehow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
