tutorial for the new boss and we're
gonna do in this tutorial we are
actually aren't gonna work with you know
our alert yet I'm just gonna show you
some of the basics before we jump into
into that because it might be a little
bit more complicated but what we're
gonna do is basically add a compass to
our map activity that will tell us the
direction that we're heading which is
north and all that good stuff it's gonna
be pretty simple and to do that we're
gonna add an object that's from the my
location overlay and we're just gonna
call this compass you got to import that
and then what we're gonna do is we're
gonna go down here within our on create
method and we're gonna set compass equal
to new my location overlay and then we
pass into the contour pass into the
parameters the context which is main
this and then our map or a map view I
should say which we call the map and
then all we have to do is add to our
overlay list that we created a
fugitoid's go add our compass and now
we'll have it an overlay that displays
the compass it's pretty simple I mean
that's that's pretty much it for for
adding a compass what we can also do is
you can right click and go to source
override unimplemented methods add the
on pause and on resume method and then
we can also define our compass within
here basically to just say we're just
gonna say compass dot disable compass
and then we also have a method called
compass that enable method very compass
I should say
so there we go now our compass is gonna
be disabled when we go and pause and
enabled when we are in resume but now
let's also learn about something called
a controller now controller is going to
be able to animate where we're going
through our map activity so what we need
to do is we need to set up a map
controller object so we're gonna call
map controller and we're going to call
this controller or control yeah
controller and add this import and I'll
just show you a quick example of what
this can do so what we're gonna do is
first set up our controller where we're
gonna have controller is equal to map
which is their map activity and then
we're going to just going to say get
controller now what we can do is we can
animate our controller to go to a
certain location if we have a certain
location in mind and how we set up those
locations is by kind of longitude and
latitude and we create a geo point and a
geo points going to basically handle the
longitude and latitude so let's set up
one of those within our on create method
so we're going to say geo point and
we're just going to call this point
we're gonna set this equal to new geo
point and within the parameters it takes
the latitude and long longitude so if
you guys know the latitude and longitude
make sure if if it's like one point
something something something you need
to take it times 1e whoops times 1 e 6
and I'll just get it and kind of format
that Android like so just keeping that
in mind you know if you have like a
longitude that's one point seven four
three or something like that but for
exit for this example I'm just gonna
type in a longitude like 51 so I'm just
gonna type in something like that or
actually like that and that's for my
latitude and for my longitude I'm just
gonna again type in some numbers let me
make sure this is an actual point so
about six yeah that'd be about seven
point eight and fifty one point six if
you guys are familiar with that now what
we can do is you can say our controller
and we can dot say dot animate to a geo
point and since we just set up this geo
point called point that's what we're
gonna animate you we can also set our
zoom with our controller so we can say
controller dot zoom and we have some
zoom methods like zoom in zoom out but
what we're gonna do is we're just gonna
set our initial zoom to be something
like six maybe and C so our controller
can do a lot of different things what's
gonna do with it there's within this
oncreate method is locate this geo point
animate to that point and then zoom in
and basically these are different levels
of zoom you guys can test those out and
have fun with that but let's run our
application make sure it works and you
know that's just kind of the basic some
more basic stuff that we can do with
Google Maps and then see our controller
zooms and somewhere over looks like
Germany or something yeah Germany ich in
that range again it animates to that
point and then zooms in so that's kind
of the basic functions of the controller
we can still use everything else for the
most part but that's pretty much it guys
I'll catch you in the next tutorial
whoa where we're gonna get into
something else that's gonna be sweet
so see you guys then have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
