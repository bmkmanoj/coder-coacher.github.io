getting down to this spry validation of
the text field I know in the past few
examples we have been working with the
text field but there are a lot of
options that we did not go over in the
past two tutorials on form validation so
I'm just going to throw in a text field
real quick call it example then I'm
going to wrap a spry validation text
field around that I'm going to go ahead
and save this make sure that everything
is working right there we go get out of
this okay so down here in our properties
we have a lot of things to choose from
we have a lot of different options
starting with type and format pattern
min max value and required and validate
on player and on change and so we're
going to start we're going to start by
looking at what types of texts we can
validate and this is the spry text field
validation contains is the largest
amount of options because there are so
many different things that can be
entered in a text field and as you can
probably guess an integer is basically a
number that does not have decimal
decimal points so you can type any
number without decimal points inside of
an integer field but if you do type
something with a decimal point is going
to return is an invalid format the next
which we have already covered is email
address and I don't think I really need
to go over that one because we have
definitely check that one out twice
so let's move on to date ok now after we
click date you notice that this format
option was highlighted down here and
when you click on that you can see that
there are some options here and you see
these mm's dds and why wise and if you
don't already know this the the MM
stands for month the DD stands for day
and the why why stands for year with two
letters the one below it mm and DD still
stand for month and day and they do not
have to actually be like 09 or 01 you
could actually just put in one for the
the date as far as the month goes and
you could also put in one for the day
instead of 01 so if you put in 0 1 will
still be valid but if you put it in 14
mm and DD it'll also still be valid and
the the four walls means that it
requires you to put in the full year so
this is the same thing just reverse you
can see the different formats here and
you can see here we've changed from a
forward slash into a hyphen and so on so
on to here we change to a period so that
is the date format and all those are
good options to use I usually just use
the default option the next thing that
we have is the time and with time it's
pretty much the same thing as before we
see HH stands for our and mmm stands for
minutes HH indicates the hour specified
using the 24-hour time like 13 4 1pm for
example HH is like little H little H is
the hour and little M little m is
minutes and little less little SS
seconds little T little T is before noon
afternoon notation that is a.m. or p.m.
so T indicates time of day using a
single letter A or P so ok and the next
one will be a credit card and basically
that's self-explanatory it validates
that is it doesn't actually validate
that the card is valid but it validates
that the card is in the correct format
the next one we have is zip code and you
have some options here you have the u.s.
5-digit zip code and then you have the
u.s. nine-digit zip code the 5-digit zip
code in the front and then hyphen with
the four you also have the the english
UK pattern and the canada and then you
can also create a custom pattern which i
will go through and the next tutorial
the next one we have is a phone number
you use the format menu to choose us or
canada phone number format or select
custom patterns which you we then define
in a pattern field so i will describe
what custom patterns are just like i
said in the next tutorial the next one
we have is social security number and
that is pretty much self-explanatory
this option requires three numbers a
hyphen two numbers a hyphen and three
more numbers so basically just like your
standard
social security number with with social
record with social security numbers
though you might want to avoid
requesting those for reasons of privacy
and fear of identity theft many people
they don't want to give out their social
security number and by law they don't
want to share those so just distal side
now alright the next one is currency
here you can see that you can format it
like that or like that you probably what
you want to continue to select that one
thing to note here is that a dollar sign
is invalid or a Euro sign is invalid
inside of the text field so if somebody
is going to put you know dollar sign
1000 that's going to be invalid but they
just put 1000 then that's going to be
invalid or that's going to be valid the
next one is real number or a scientific
notation basically this is a number that
allows decimal points and a scientific
notation so if you if you have a number
where you want to use decimal points
instead of using an integer then this is
the number you would use the next one is
IP address you see it's a ipv4 only or
ipv6 only and then the newly not yet
fully implemented ipv and ipv4 format
and lastly before I in this tutorial is
a URL make sure and note that in this
validation here with the URL it has to
have a HTTP colon forward slash forward
slash for it to be valid so hopefully
those work out if they don't then
there's something that's called a custom
pattern all right customer validation
field and if so if you're not happy if
any of these and you can just make your
own and if
if you continue watching I'll let you
know how to do that one other thing
though that I want to say about this is
these right here on blur and on change
onblur means when you click outside of
the text field and on change means every
time a letter changes so if you click on
change then it's going to validate every
time you talk I mean not talk about
every time you type so if you're typing
a letter then it's going to validate its
news you type a letter but if you use
blur and uncheck change then you can
type in and keep typing in and once
you're done and click outside of the
text box then it's going to validate so
that is it for this tutorial in the next
tutorial we are going to be going over
custom validation of a text field and we
are also going to look at a few other
things that have to do with the Spry
validation of a text field so thank you
for watching don't forget to subscribe
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
