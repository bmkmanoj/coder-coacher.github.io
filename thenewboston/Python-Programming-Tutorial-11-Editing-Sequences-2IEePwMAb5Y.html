11th python tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm going to be teaching you
guys how to edit sequences now I don't
know if I told you guys this in the last
tutorial but uh I'm going to be teaching
guys something new you know it's not
important when I'm going to be teaching
just pay attention so um in this story
I'm going to show you guys that
sequences unlike strings can also be
concatenated so let's say we have two
sequences right here before my cursor on
so it actually works let's have one just
put some random numbers in there six
four or five and you have another
sequence right over there with four six
five
you can concatenate sequences just like
you can do um whatever else I told you
concatenate just by using the plus sign
and go ahead and once you press ENTER
instead of two separate sequences you
have one long sequence or a list in this
case in again as I said you can also
concatenate strings which is also kind
of a sequence bulky plus oops
Roberts striking Canton eight that Bucky
Roberts wham-bam think man
so you can concatenate lists of numbers
and also strings of text but what
happens if we try to concatenate lists
of numbers enjoying it with a string of
text well so one way to find out say we
have a list four five six and we want to
add it to Bucky now once you try to
concatenate that we get an error message
and this is because you can't join
something there are two different data
types it doesn't know how it's like how
do you join this with this I don't know
how here's the error message thank you
um so you can't do that you can only
catenate them or join them if they're
the same type and this is useful when
you have two smaller lists and you want
to join them to one bigger list it's
also useful if you want to store in a
variable so then you don't have to do
that every time but another thing I want
to tell you guys how to do is how to
multiply a sequence or well that's
pretty much it
now say you have sequence of or string
like that anytime you multiply this and
you're going to say RA how can you
multiply this by this what it does is it
doesn't really multiply it like you
thinking on math but it kind of does it
just takes this whatever this is and
repeats it however many times you said
multiply it by which I guess that is
truly multiplication so as you can see
we now have ten buckey's and this is
different than like say we want them to
do this with a number well before you do
something like this 21 times 10 that's
not exactly what we wanted but that's
multiplication as well if you want to
repeat 21 10 times then you have to
enclose it as an element in the list and
once you times this by 10 21 21 there so
these are two different ways um if
you're if you tried this and got this
result or you tried this and got this a
result then that is what you were doing
wrong so there's a difference between
how to multiply numbers in how to
multiply items in a list one gives you
an answer and then another gives you
answer just in two different ways so
take note of that
and the last thing I want to talk to you
guys about in this story is something
called membership now um there's one
little I don't know if it's a function
but there's something in Python called
in and what it does is check if your
specific value you're asking it is in a
sequence therefore the name in so let's
go ahead and make um let's have variable
name and set it to a string Bucky Bucky
right there actually we get sick Bucky
she's a roast-beef there we go now the
value name or the variable has the value
roast beef so now what are we going to
do with roast beef we can check if
certain characters are in roast beef by
using see see all you have to do is the
put the first character you want to
check then press in an N is a built-in
keyword in Python what it's going to do
is take this character and check if it's
in name so is there a Z in name press
Enter false hmm is there are in the name
roast-beef true because here's our right
here but it doesn't find a Z so that is
how you can check if one element is in a
big sequence by using the end built-in
well got stuffy nose by using the built
in in mmm think about that built in in
word huh that's kind of interesting to
say so another thing that you can do is
apply this say you have an entire list
of well I guess its entire list just a
list so you have mom and your family and
then um dad and then a bro bro for
brother and once you press Enter right
there you now have a list created that's
stored in family in just like on my
search for one letter in a whole word I
can also search for one element in the
list
so I can say alright is sis in family
enter no sorry sis is not in family I
guess she wasn't cool enough what about
um is mom come on keyboard is mom and
family true because this element is in
this sequence so that's what in does
check if this element is in this
sequence I can't tell you guys any more
simple than that so that is your quick
tutorial on how to join sequences and
also how to check if a specific element
is in a sequence so study this tutorial
I hope you guys learned something and
forget to check out my next tutorial and
make sure to subscribe so thanks for
