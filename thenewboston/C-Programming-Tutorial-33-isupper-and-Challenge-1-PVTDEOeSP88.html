I know I say that every time I said I'm
not going to say it and you know I went
ahead and I freaking said it's like a
habit or whatever but in this video I'm
going to be teaching you guys one more
cool function and that is how to test if
a character is uppercase or lowercase
and then I'm going to be giving you guys
a challenge at the end and I want to see
if you can complete it so since this
function tests if a letter is either
uppercase or lowercase we don't need to
include it right here because this bit
of code is only going to run if this is
in the miracle or not a letter so we
only need to put it in alpha because
that ensures that it is a letter so the
if condition is this the function is
called is upper and what it does is you
pass in a character and it returns true
if it's uppercase so if you have
something like f this were to return
false
but uppercase F return true so from here
you can just print something out on the
screen like C is an uppercase actually
uppercase letter now else since we
already know this is a letter because it
passed is alpha it passed this test and
it's not an uppercase we know that if it
got the list line of code it would be a
lowercase letter so now let's go ahead
and run it against capital F capital F
is an uppercase letter and just make
sure everything is working correctly
lowercase G lowercase G is a lowercase
letter so now we know how to test this
something's a letter if something's a
number if something is a symbol if it's
uppercase lowercase so you guys have
some homework now and you're like what
just watch it in the YouTube video this
isn't school going to give me homework
well actually we'll call it a challenge
in that sis
this function right here in these
functions that I've been teaching you
guys for last couple tutorials are
really useful whenever you're building a
piece of software and you want to ensure
that the user enters a good password so
I want you guys to build a program where
the user enters a password by scanning
it in and it checks it for an uppercase
letter a number and we'll say a dollar
sign so again check or write a piece of
code that checks the thing they typed in
and make sure it has an uppercase letter
a number and a dollar sign and if it
does then just output okay your password
is good to go or something like that if
not output hey your password sucks now
once you're done with it post it in the
forum in hopefully arm we're going to
see a bunch of awesome looking programs
and also whenever you're writing it if
you have any trouble then post it in the
forum as well and I'll show you guys
what you did wrong and give you guys
some tips on how to complete it properly
so hopefully you guys have the knowledge
to do that so far and well looking
forward to seeing you programs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
