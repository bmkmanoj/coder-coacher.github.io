3ds max tutorial and this is the last
tutorial that I'm going to teach you
before we begin and creating objects and
I know that's what you guys have all
been waiting for but this is the last
toriel that you need to know and in the
next one we're going to be begin making
sweet objects so if you're thinking
about this just skipping to the next one
you can't do that because there
definitely some things in this tutorial
that Nate teach you or else you'll be
lost when we start creating objects and
the main thing that I want to teach you
in this tutorial or the first topic is
what these buttons mean right here all
of these buttons are ways that you can
edit your viewport so let me go over the
basics right here the ones that we're
going to be using most commonly this
zoom right here is your basic zoom in
and out if you go ahead and drag you can
zoom in and out just like that now aside
from that you also got this little
button right here and this is the zoom
extents what this means is whenever you
select an object and click it it zooms
up on that object automatically without
having to like adjust it like this you
just pick an object click zoom extents
and it zooms up on it now aside from
these you got well let me go probably
two more you got the pan of course and
this is the hand and this is just
another way where you can pan around
your object and you also got this little
button right here and this is called the
walk through now what this is if it
pretty much even looks like you're in a
first-person shooter
it pretty much centers around one point
and you could look in different
locations so by boom boom boom boom boom
boom just pretty much like you're in
first-person shooter just uh the camera
stays in the same position and it acts
like it's on a tripod kinda and it just
so it rotates around that one axis so
that's pretty much arm the only thing
we're going to be going over for
viewports right now
aside from that aside from like the
angles and stuff I just want to let you
know that you're not stuck with these
four custom sizes or preset sizes you
can also customize it by either dragging
up on one of these or going in the
center until you then this will
north-south-east-west
arrows and you can drag custom sizes
right there and if you're afraid to do
that to mess everything up I just want
to let you know that if you right click
any of these borders and click reset
layout you go back to defaults so you
can go ahead and play around with that
and I anytime you want to get back just
right click it and press reset layout so
the last thing I'm going to be going
over is the basic application buttons
and again this application button is
where pretty much the file button should
be but they change it to a button
instead now all of the files that we're
going to be working with are called max
files dot ma X that's pretty much the
default on file when you're working with
3ds max now in order to start a new
application brand new you go to file
button or the application button and
click on new and then go ahead and it
says the scene has been modified do you
want to save your changes well I don't
want to save that teapot for anything so
I'm going to click no so now we go and
we got a new file but sometimes if your
interface is like last time giving you a
new file does not give you a new
interface so anytime you have like all
this adjusted and you have some of these
moved around anytime you want to get it
back to how should we say like standard
in order to do that you just go to
button and then you go to new or excuse
me
reset right there and it says do you
really want to reset and press yes and
look at that it rearranged
every single thing all your panels and
brings them back to like you just open
your program so again a new pretty much
just gives you a new file but
reset it makes the interface change back
to the standard interface so that's why
those two are separate and yes they do
actually do two different things so
aside from this anytime you want to open
a file that you've already been working
on you could probably guess I just got a
file and then open but sometimes people
have like a file like that teapot file
and say I already have a couple of
shapes here that I want to keep as well
well if I go to open like I want to
incorporate that teapot into this new
one it's just going to open the teapot
file alone on itself but if I want to
take that teapot file and move it onto
something I've been working with here's
what I need to do I need to go to
application button import right down
here and I need to go to merge and what
merge is going to do is bring those
objects from another file into the
current file so it's going to merge two
files into one so don't if you want to
use another file in the file you're
working on you can't use open you have
to go to import merge and we'll be doing
that in next tutorial Oh actually we
will be making objects in the next
tutorial but we may use that as well so
thank you guys for watching this
tutorial
in the next tutorial we're actually
going to be creating our very first 3d
objects it's going to be awesome
I can't wait it's going to be the
funnest tutorial yet so again thank you
for watching don't forget to subscribe
and I will see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
