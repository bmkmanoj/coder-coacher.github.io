third java game development tutorial and
in this tutorial we're going to be
building a window in a screen to put all
our images and graphics on now this is
usually the first thing you do in
building a game in Java and there are
three pretty much types of different
games you can build you can build a
Windows screen that appears like a
windowed application on well windows or
you can make something called an applet
that runs pretty much on a website or
from a web server and you can also build
a full-screen game in full-screen games
are once you know how to do these you
know how to do everything else so I'm
going to be teaching you how to build
full-screen games so what we're going to
be doing is pretty much going into the
graphics card and taking over this whole
entire screen so much so that you can't
even see this bottom toolbar at the
bottom and this is how pretty much all
games like World of Warcraft um
modern warfare all your first-person
shooters pretty much every cool computer
game does this so that's why we're doing
that and another thing whenever I try to
run my full screen it won't appear
because my screen recorder is owner
recording this and the full screen is
going to appear on top of that so what I
did is I had to whenever I run the full
screen I had to capture it and this is
pretty much working to be building I
can't show this to you because when I
run it and appears on full screen but
this is going to symbolize the full
screen what I have to do is actually run
it and then take a picture of it using
my print screen on my keyboard and then
just show you guys right there so
without further ado let's go Aaron how
to do this so as you see I already
import java.awt in java swing jframe for
pretty much our appearance and the first
thing i want to do is put private
graphics device and then I want to put
VC or you can name it whatever you want
and what this graphics device is it
pretty much gives you an interface into
your video card so now with this VC
variable we can access the graphics card
or video card
in what your graphics card is if you
don't know if you're not familiar
building kickers it's it's like the
thing that puts the picture on your
screen so you have your computer screen
call your monitor and this pretty much
processes all the stuff to shoot images
and stuff on your screen so if you
control this you pretty much can control
your monitor or screen on your computer
so that's why we need this I named mine
V Sivir video card so we won't get mixed
up and now after this let's go ahead and
build our constructor since I named my
class screen for you no obvious reasons
let's go ahead and name public screen
it's not going to take any parameters
and the first thing we're going to want
to do is this now this is probably going
to be the only confusing thing what I'm
about to say in order to use this VC
variable we need to go through something
called the graphics environment and what
this graphics environment does is we're
going to call a method it says get local
graphics environment and it's pretty
much a collection of all your graphics
device objects and this is a really
important for now your understand this
later but let's go ahead and go graphics
environment hopefully I sputter right
env and let's see if I did and set it
equal to I'm going to have to type this
real slow because I can't mess it up
graphics graphics and fireman dot get
yeah there we go thank God for that get
local graphics environment and you can
see if I scroll that over it right there
and make sure you type this now I can
explain
graphics environment env this is pretty
much your environment variable and again
like I said this is all your graphics
device objects not just your screen so
now that we have that we can use that
env object to well we just need that env
object that's all I'm going to tell you
for now so you don't get confused next
we can set this VC object to something
set it equal to E and V or else your
environment
get default screen device now what I
just did is pretty much this when we get
our environment and then we use it to
get access to the get default screen
device we now have access to our
computer screen so now we can take over
this whole entire screen and make
fullscreen games we can you know we can
do whatever we want with the entire
screen so instead of just the window we
now have access to the entire graphics
card and entire monitor on our computer
how cool is that so now that we have
access to it let's go ahead and write a
method to actually change our view to
full screen so let's go ahead and see if
I have time for this public void set
full screen you can actually name your
method whatever you want I'm going to
name mine set full screen and it's going
to take two parameters display mode and
I'm going to name this something like DM
and what the display mode is is it takes
4 parameters - for your resolution which
is X by Y your bit depth which pretty
much means how many colors you can store
and it's a little more than that but
it's pretty much that and your refresh
rate and your refresh rate is how many
times your monitor refreshes itself
although this looks like one solid image
it's actually your monitors are shooting
new pixels about 75 times every second
so ya know that's that so this is what
your display mode is pretty much your
monitor settings and now other than this
it's going to take the parameter J frame
and just name that variable window or
something like that and now we can do
cool stuff to that window what we're
going to be actually doing is building a
window and converting this little window
to full screen so you know first we want
to do a couple stuff to the window we
want to do window dot set undecorated
and we want to set this equal to true we
do not want this window decorated at all
and what decorated means is title bars
at the top and scroll bars on the side
we
want any of those so we want to set
under curator the true which pretty much
gets rid of everything besides just the
image inside the next thing we want to
do is make sure that the camera sizes so
window set resizable right there and we
want to set this equal to false and this
means when we make it full screen is
going to be full screen you're not going
to be able to mess with our size any and
let me check my time right there and now
after this what we can do is go ahead
and actually take the parameter take
that window and convert it to full
screen and here's what we do now that we
have access to our video card or
graphics card and then has control over
the whole window go ahead and type V C
and we can call methods on it one of the
methods is you want to take that
graphics card and set full screen window
now this is a built in method in
whatever we put in this parameters is
going to convert that to full screen so
let's take that window right there and
what this is doing is this it's going to
take that window that we just built and
no matter what size it is it's going to
convert it to a full screen window to
take over your whole monitor no matter
what the size of your monitor is it's
going to set it to full screen and the
next thing we want to have to do after
this is build one other little method if
I have time and actually I don't think
I'm going to so I'm going to have to
tell you guys in the next tutorial but
in the next tutorial I'm going to show
you guys how pretty much you can check
if well you'll see in the next story
what I'm going to do it's a little
lengthy to explain right now but don't
forget to check it out we are well on
our way to setting our window and once
we have this kind of housekeeping stuff
done we can begin getting into the good
stuff so thank you guys for watching and
don't forget I'll see you next tutorial
so don't forget to subscribe and I'll
see that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
