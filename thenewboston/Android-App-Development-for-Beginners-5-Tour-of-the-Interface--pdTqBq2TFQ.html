tutorial and in this video what I'm
going to do is I'm going to give you
guys a real quick overview of the
interface because whenever I first
started out with Android studio it was
all kind of overwhelming and kind of
confused and it just made me feel
uncomfortable not really knowing what
any of this stuff was so what I'm not
going to do is I'm not going to go
through piece by piece and talk to you
guys in detail what everything means
instead as we need the tools that's what
I'm going to be talking to guys about ok
so this is you know the AVD manager and
this is how you use it so instead of
overwhelming you guys giving you you
know the intricate details of what
everything is I just want to give you
guys a real general overview to make you
guys a little bit more comfortable with
interface lit can't talk
alright so of course at the very top
this is simple up here we have the menu
bar pretty much all of our additional
tools and settings is well as some you
know very common stuff we can find in
the menu bar nothing new there now under
it we have a tool bar so all of these
little icons this is actually called the
tool bar right here now as we saw in the
last tutorial what the tool bar is is
basically shortcuts to more commonly use
aspects of the program for example arm
maybe this SDK manager well we can also
get there with tools Android SDK manager
but since we use that quite a bit that's
why they put that in toolbar now if you
ever want to customize your tool bar I
recommend just keeping it the same but
if you ever have a tool that you find
yourself using a lot you can actually
right click in this empty area and click
customize menus in toolbars and then you
can click the little programs that you
either want to you know remove or add
again you click on them and all of your
settings are right here to either add
them or remove from your toolbar pretty
intuitive so that's what that little
chunk of this Android studio is now
underneath this this little thing right
here that looks like I don't know
kind of file directory explanation on um
like steroids or something this is
actually called the navigation bar and
basically what it is is it shows the
path to whatever current file you're
working on so this right here the
navigation bar is pretty much the same
as this thing up here so it's pretty
much a long file path now the cool thing
about this is that like I said it is
pretty much a file path on steroids
because if you ever go to a directory
you can actually click on it and it's
going to show you all the contents of
that directory so pretty sweet and again
it's a file path to whatever current
file you're working on so if you change
your file this is going to change as
well now this main area that I cannot
ignore is the editor window so the
editor windows we're going to spend most
of our time and it's pretty much the
main area to show whatever file you are
currently working on so right now um
we'll talk about this designer later on
it's pretty much as you probably could
have guessed how you lay out all the
widgets and stuff for your interface now
we're also going to be looking at this a
lot which is pretty much the text view
of the file pretty much we're going to
be editing the source code and doing a
bunch of cool stuff but anyways this
main area shows whatever current file
you're working on you probably could
guess that now over here on the left
hand side this is called the project
window now whenever I am developing an
app what I like to do is I like to
change its drop-down from Android to
project so as you can see whenever you
change it your project is going to list
every directory in your entire project
now one of the most important
directories is called app now this is
where all your source code and all your
like main layout files are so if you
just want a real condensed view of all
the important files then you can just
hover down Android and actually keep
that on Android for this tutorial but if
you ever want an overview of your entire
project again you can change that
project but just for these tutorials all
the source code and stuff is in this
Android drop-down so I'll stick with
that
I don't know I think it'll be a little
bit easier I guess alright so we pretty
much cover this whole interface except
for these things on the side these
little bars that say like project
structure all of that crap so first of
all as you can see whenever I click it
it toggles whatever window is on and off
so this is the project window I'm going
to click that it's going to toggle that
visible or I don't want to say it's
invisible but you know visible invisible
oh say that whatever so if you ever feel
that your entire interface it just looks
kind of cluttered and you decide that
you want to hide all of these quick
window bars then go down in the very
bottom left corner and you're going to
see this little square gray icon this is
the toggle either to show or hide all of
these quick window bars so click that
and they're all going to be hidden click
it again show em all I Cho hide show can
do it all day if you want so I'm going
to go ahead and click that again so it
shows them all because that's default
now another thing I want to point out is
if you hover over it it's going to give
you all of those quick windows so I
don't know maybe you're on I don't know
maybe you're on the structure and you
want to get the project again but you're
too lazy to bring your mouse all the way
back up there so you can just go this
click project and it's going to pop up
for you again just two different ways of
doing the same thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
