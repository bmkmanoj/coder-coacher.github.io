video what we're going to do is we're
going to take a look at how search
engines work now before I begin I
actually am going to recommend something
and that is whenever you're working with
SEO and you want to determine the actual
ranking of your website then it's always
a good idea to go to the options and go
to new incognito window or you can just
do control-shift-n and if you guys don't
know what an incognito window is let me
move this so you guys can see it's
basically a special mode in Chrome or
any browser where it doesn't keep your
history or cookies or a lot of the
tracking data and if you guys are
wondering why do I recommend that it's
because whenever you're looking at these
search results you don't want them
personalized to you now I'm going to
tell you guys a story this is actually
pretty funny I used to work with this
guy from la ville and Lao Ville is this
really crappy town next where I live
there was like four people who lived
there and you know there's just nothing
there I think the biggest building is
like two stories tall and he I was
talking to him he's like did you know
that lava was actually really popular
I'm like what be talking about he's like
yeah I was on Google and I typed in ello
and Lau Ville was the first thing that
popped up and I'm just smacking my head
I'm like dude and I had to tell him that
that was pretty much as personalized to
his results because Google knew his
location and he probably searched for
level stuff before whatever it was who
knows but that's what incognito mode
does and also pro tip if you ever are
doing anything on the computer that I
don't know maybe you don't want your
girlfriend to find out about you don't
want that in your browsing history then
you can go to incognito mode as well
okay I don't know why you would ever do
that but whatever anyways back to SEO so
how do search engines work basically
whenever it finds a new website or an
existing website and it just wants to
crawl it again every search engine from
Google to Yahoo to Bing they all have
these special programs and people call
them spiders some people call them BOTS
but essentially what they are
our automated programs that go to a
website and it starts crawling it going
through page by page every single page
that it can find now on these pages it
starts gathering information it gathers
all of the links it looks at some of the
most common keywords and it pretty much
just tries to get a general idea of what
each page is now if you guys are
familiar with HTML I'll give you guys a
really cool tip if you go to page source
and let me just actually let me do this
inspect edit is HTML I'll show you guys
that if you just get rid of all the CSS
right here just delete that and if you
guys don't know what I'm doing don't
really worry about it
so if you remove all the style sheets
then you can see your website kind of
through a BOTS eyes so this is how a
spider or a bot sees your website so
it's not looking at the background color
or that fancy menu you made what's
looking at is all of the links all of
the headers it wants to see what's
bolded what keywords are on there all of
the raw data and we'll take a look at
what one of these things are important
and what ones aren't that important
later on but basically that's what it's
going to do and gather all of this info
so now it crawled all the pages on your
website and it has it and it actually
stores it in a big database and whenever
I say big database I mean like really
big Google's has like multiple buildings
for their data centers so it's not like
you know a couple hard drives so
basically what's going to happen is
whenever someone types in any keyword
like the new Boston it's going to look
at its database and says ok I croute a
bunch of websites what websites are
relevant to this keyword now another
thing I want to point out real quick is
whenever I say keyword I don't just mean
one word whenever you use the term
keyword and SEO lingo it can mean one
word like programming or it can mean a
phrase or a query like how to program
so whenever I say keyword how to program
this entire phrase can be a keyword so I
just want to say that so I don't confuse
you guys alright so so far simple enough
but now we have a question what happens
if let's say a user types in monkeys and
there are 137 million websites that are
relevant to monkeys because we know that
it has all this info and all that stuff
but now what Google's formula and what
Yahoo and Bing formula have to do is
they need to use a bunch of different
variables to determine what is the most
relevant website now these are the
variables that we're going to be taking
a look at in the upcoming videos but
basically there are a lot of different
factors and they're not all weighed
equally so for example it's going to
look at a couple different things and
we'll look at each one of these things
in particular but it's going to look at
the thing like the title right here so
the title of the webpage
maybe I'm just making up a fake scale
like of one 200 maybe this has like a 60
importance maybe if you use the keywords
in the heading then maybe they only have
a 15 maybe if there are a few keywords
like monkeys in just the regular text
then that only may have like a 3 out of
100 importance so we're going to be
taking a look at all of these different
variables right here and what we're
going to do is we're going to be
breaking it down and I'm going to show
you guys the best way where you can
pretty much utilize your time and bump
your search result rankings through the
roof and just a word of warning all of
these search engines Google Yahoo Bing
they don't use the same formula they all
have different formulas and that's why
whenever you type something into Google
you're going to get completely different
results right here then Bing or Yahoo
however the techniques I'm going to be
teaching you guys are going to be good
for every single search engine so yeah
it's going to be pretty cool for now
then guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I'll see you guys next
