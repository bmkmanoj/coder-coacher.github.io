part of my creepy smokey logo tutorial
where in the last tutorial we went over
creating our particle system here which
is like a cloud of smoke going across
this is gonna reveal our logo so this is
all in made in After Effects cs6 and if
you would like to check out the other
previous tutorials check out the new
Boston's YouTube page and you should
just look them up that's that's all
there is to it obviously so let's get
started with a tutorial I'm going to
extend my work area back to where it was
because that's what I like to do I guess
there's no real reason to do it but
we've got our smoke coming across here
and we need to reveal the logo so we're
gonna create a mask on our smokey title
here
and we can do that with probably like a
rounded rectangle too oh I bet
there we go
now let's go to our mask path we're
gonna start at the beginning we're gonna
animate it let's go back to our
selection tool select these two we're
here
I'll start where we can't see anything
now move ahead and try to get this to go
with the smoke here
I'm gonna have to put a couple more
keyframes in there just to make it look
good
I'm gonna use my page up to go back some
frames so I can figure out when the
smoke ends which I'll go up one more
probably there
and on this frame it's basically gone so
I'm just gonna move it all the way now
we can see by pressing going frame by
frame if it's the way we want it to be
and in this section I mean it's it's
coming it's coming in too fast so bring
it back
that's good I have a mouse with some
buttons near the thumb for gaming and
every time I hit one of the numbers on
the button on the mouse it makes that
noise on my computer so sorry if that
ever happens so we have this n mating
across now we're just gonna do the same
thing on to the smoke layer so let's
copy this edit copy and smoke across
edit paste
actually the smoke already had a already
had a mask on it so let's undo that well
does animate the mask that's already on
it let's go to the beginning
I don't want anything to show right now
we can just animate the whole thing
going across
you know do that again and I'm gonna
uphold so go straight across and
let go of my mouse first before I let go
of shift now let's go to the end here
all right this is this is good for the
end move this across
we had it before like this
now let's go in between to make sure
it's showing up correctly like right
here it's too fast let's move it back
it's a very select at all
all right that's good
that's gonna be good for that that one's
a little easier you don't have to be
more as precise with that one so there's
our reveal now though the last thing we
need to do is I added some music on to
give it an effect for some reason when
you when you make like a like a tote a
logo or something like that or some cool
motion graphics it always seems better
with some music added to it it's not
always easy to find music on the
internet that you can use especially if
you're going to be making money off your
YouTube videos so I'm going to add in my
music and then I have to show you where
I got it from so here's my music that I
got in the audio section I'm gonna just
put it on and luckily it lines up
perfectly with with the with the comp
because I already tested it that out
let's go to I'm gonna bring up the
webpage that I'm that I had so this is
where I got it from
incompetent calm and this is the one I
picked with static motion if I go to
more you can see this is a Creative
Commons license and I needed to credit
this guy for it so here's the credits
here hopefully you guys can read it
static motion Kevin MacLeod so that's
good enough hopefully they're happy with
that
so let's I'm gonna put this on full and
I'm going to render it with a ram
preview and then I'm gonna hit pause
because it's gonna take a bit and then
come back when it's fully rendered so
I'll see you in a second okay this is
done rendering so let's check it out
there we go
that's it so
so now you can render it and what I like
to do is make sure you're on your main
layer here and you go to composition or
is it I thought it was a composition and
then click on add to render queue and
the hotkey is ctrl M
and this section right here is where you
can name it so what creepy logo and then
go to your output module down here and
the format that I always like to try use
is you could use avi if you want but I
usually go with a QuickTime then I come
over here to the format options and have
it on Sorenson video 3 which is a pretty
good codec and hit OK
and come down to your auto audio output
check that hit OK now come on we're
gonna render settings this should be
correct just make sure it's at 24 there
and then you have the correct duration
and I ended up changing mine to 10
seconds so we can end this at 10
and that would work okay
see
now all that stuff that looks okay and
then you would come over here to this
button right here make sure this is
checked and hit render and then you can
render out your project and then you
it'll take a little bit when you hear
the thing that means it's done and then
go to your folder that you saved it in
and and view it it should turn out
correct so thank you for staying with me
through the whole tutorial and all the
different parts hopefully you guys
thought this was pretty cool and I'm
looking forward to seeing some of these
on the internet so I'll see you all you
guys later
keep watching the new Boston and keep
checking out the After Effects tutorials
because I'm gonna keep pumping them out
see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
