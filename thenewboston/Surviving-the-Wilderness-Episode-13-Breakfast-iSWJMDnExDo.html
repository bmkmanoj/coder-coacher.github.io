ever spent anywhere just kept raining
all night I think it's a penny thing at
all
so I came back into the forest a little
bit so I try to stay out of the rain a
little more my hoodies soaked so I can't
worry right now it's still a little
chilly but that's how glad we're did
find my hat
there's wedged on the bottom of my bag
actually so that's a plus but that's
about it
I am totally wiped out right now totally
drained physically emotionally
I haven't eaten and I don't even
remember one I'm gonna try and fish
maybe hunt today but if I can't get
anything I'm probably going to leave oh
it's just probably didn't really expect
this would be as hard as it actually is
it's definitely a lot worse than I
thought it was going to be glad I don't
know
I guess we'll see what happens all right
now I'm making a spear and just taking
quite a bit longer than I thought but
it's keeping me occupied so not as soon
as I get this done I'm gonna go fishing
need four prongs on the end I just got
sharpen them and then I'll have myself a
nice little spear to try and catch him
fish with well I decided to stop here
and make a little fire because I was
walking along and I actually was able to
hit with a rock believe it or not and
then I stabbed it with my spear real
quick so it couldn't get away and I'm
gonna clean it but I didn't break my
spear so I'm gonna have to make a new
one which is kind of annoying it took me
like an hour to make this but worth it
so
well I've never cleaned an animal before
so see how this goes oh I think I've
here's to definitely did that them or
broke a bone nope didn't even go in just
broke a bone come on Bessie
well I decided to cook the top half of
the squirrel real quick roasting it up
right now
this reminds me of summers I used to
spend down hanging out my friends
camping usually we wouldn't rush
chipmunks on the fire to be hot to act
or something but your guess it's the
same concept really and delicious
chipmunk good
Wow
OOP top what delicious
good look that's a rib all right
that was delicious now I'm gonna go find
another one or I'm gonna go around the
creek and use my tin can actually wear
that put the I'm gonna try and catch
some crayfish I saw some in there when I
was down there last night I'm gonna cut
the top off this and then I'll put them
in here with water and just boil them in
here should be able to eat them and I
bet they'll be good and I'm gonna
actually think this up now I'm gonna try
and make that into a fish hook too real
quick but uh I'm gonna walk back down to
the creek if I can't find any more
Chipmunks on the way next thing I'll be
doing it is fishing or something</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
