13th Photoshop tutorial and in this
video I want to talk to you guys about
the elliptical marquee tool and I also
want to show you guys a few shortcuts
that you can use whenever you're working
with any selection tool now before I get
to that what I did is I opened up a
picture of my friend Dom right here
actually stole it off of his Twitter so
it looks like Dom just pounded a bottle
of aftershock so he's probably feeling
pretty good right now and actually if
you guys want to know the truth it's
3:30 in the morning and I didn't want to
wake him up so he doesn't even know that
I'm using his picture in this Photoshop
tutorial but he's going to wake up and
you know hopefully he'll be cool that if
not gonna get some angry text in the
morning no big deal so uh here's Dom
right now and the important thing is in
order to use the elliptical marquee tool
it's right by the rectangular one it's a
little one with a little oval with the
dotted lines so go ahead and select that
and of course whenever you start playing
with it at first it's pretty much the
same as the rectangular you got the
normal new selection and you also got
your add subtract and intersect so add
add to that selection so it looks like I
don't know weird pond that's what it
reminds me of what is this selection to
remind you of that's one of those up
tests that they use the test crazy
people but anyways you know getting kind
of sidetracked here your uh wow this is
looking really weird now your add
subtract intersect all that stuff we
already know that from before we don't
need to cover that but what I do want to
talk about and I'm going to hold it on
ctrl D make that D selection is the
first shortcut I want to talk to you
guys about is holding down the shift key
whenever you using this selection tool
or the rectangular selection tool so
unlike before where you can basically
make any shape oval long tall perfect
what you can do is if you hold down the
shift key it automatically snaps to a
perfect circle so if you always are
trying to make a perfect circle and you
know your you know dexterity is just off
by a little bit you can cheat by holding
down the shift key on your keyboard so
just go ahead and release your mouse and
then release your shift and by
and you got a perfectly circle selection
so then we can go ahead and you know do
something like cut that out and cut Dom
out of the image but if you hold ctrl Z
it's going to pop ctrl D we're back to
normal
so after that as you can see whenever I
made that selection and I cut it you
notice that it didn't cut in a nice
crisp line that's because I was messing
around with this before and I changed
this setting right here this is called
feather and what it does is it pretty
much does exactly that
feathers out the edge or some people may
call it a gradient so it doesn't select
a nice crisp circle it actually fades
your selection a little bit now if you
do want a nice crisp circle then you're
going to want to set that feather to
zero what this does is it gives you a
nice hard edge so now let me go ahead
and select this and cut it and check it
out there is your nice hard edge and
that's actually a default what I did is
I actually changed at the 20 before but
well the important thing is that's what
feather is feather gradient tomato
tomahto now another cool thing I want to
tell you guys is how to select the
inverse of a selection the inverse of a
selection what the heck does that mean
well go ahead and make a new selection
and say that we want to arm cut
everything out of the image except you
know Dom's face so what we can do is we
can hold shift and make a perfect circle
around Dom's face right here and just go
ahead and do this okay right there now
like I said we want to keep Dom's face
in here so if you go ahead and cut this
right now well that has the opposite
effect so let's go ahead and step
backward and what we need to do is we
need to select everything except the
selection right here so in order to do
that what we need to do is go to select
inverse now whenever we click this what
it's going to do is it's going to look
at your selection see what's selected
and then say you know what that's what
I'm gonna not select I'm going to select
everything
but that so now even though it looks
like there's a dotted line and this is
still selected what this is actually
saying is you know what all of this
stuff is selected around here so now if
you go ahead and cut it check it out
Dom's face remains and everything
outside it is cut from the image pretty
freakin sweet huh so again that select
inversed
or excuse me inversed what the heck is
that so now let me just go ahead and I
probably mess this up so I'm just going
to go ahead and open it again no worry
at daum there you go so the last thing
that I want to talk to you guys about is
just a real quick shortcut probably
could have talked about this before but
if you have your selection tool and you
just have all your defaults normal new
selection of course look what's going on
whenever I select this it starts
wherever I click and it ends up
basically where my ending cursor is but
some people prefer an alternative type
of selection and how conveniently if you
hold down the alt button think of this
is alternative you see how that connects
in your brain hold down alt on your
keyboard and click and drag and now you
can see your selection is no longer
starting where you clicked and ending up
where you let go but it's moving in a
circle from the center out so if you
want to make a selection and you want
the center of the selections to be Dom's
nose or something
hover over Dom's nose hold down alt on
your keyboard and drag out now however
you make your shape the center is always
going to be Dom's nose so let's go ahead
and just select the inverse of that edit
cut and BAM this is our final beautiful
picture of dahm dahm wasted after
drinking a bottle of aftershock
nonetheless Thank You DOM and I thank
you for everyone else for making this
tutorial possible and yeah that's pretty
much it
I have to go let my dog out to pee
before you poop some poops and pees on
my rug so I think guys for watching and
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
