JavaScript tutorial and in this tutorial
I'm going to teach you guys how to
create your own objects so like I said
before an object is pretty much a
special type of data that has its own
properties and its own methods and today
we're going to be creating an object
that has a couple properties with it we
don't be talking about methods now but
maybe in the future tutorial or
definitely in future tutorial we will so
basically there are a couple of
different ways that we can make our own
objects one of the ways and probably the
easiest way is to use something called a
constructor function and like I said
before an object is burning pretty much
a blueprint so that's what we're going
to be doing in this tutorial so in order
to make our own object what people
typically do is whenever they're making
this blueprint they go ahead and take
the script and they stick it in the head
so let's go ahead and do that
put your script tags in the head and
whenever you're printing stuff out we
try to do that in the body so for now
since we're not printing anything out
let's just go ahead and stick this in
the head so in order to create this
special thing called a constructor
function it looks basically just like
any other function go ahead and tape the
name function just like that and we're
going to be making a blueprint or aka
object for people so go ahead and name
it like person or people or whatever you
want so we have an object called person
now let's go ahead and list some
properties that are going to be
associated with every person we can't
say like um something very specific we
have to list properties that are
associated with every person so every
person in the world has a name and they
have a age you can't look like um
favorite computer because some people
don't even have computers so don't
listen like that make it general like a
name and age so now in your body here is
what we do now this is kind of weird but
this is how they set it up whenever we
want to take a value and assign it to a
person we need to use a special keyword
called this and later on what we're
going to be doing is we're going to be
calling this method and being like Bucky
Roberts 20 for Taylor Swift 20 Bucky's
mom 38 so we're going to be passing it
in information and assigning it to that
object so in order to say alright we
want to work with this current object
you need to give a special keyword
called this I know it's weird but this
is what you have to do and this
basically means is we're working with
the current object why it would ever
work with another another object
I don't know but trust me it's stupid I
understand but it's what you have to do
so this current object's name is
whatever name we pass in there so it's
going to take like Bucky Roberts and
it's going to assign it to the object's
name this is pretty much saying this
whatever information we pass in and
whatever information we want to assign
to the object that's all it does really
so now we have to do with age this
object's age is going to be equal to
whatever the age we tell it to pass in
simple enough sorry are saying all right
this is basically called a constructor
function and it's basically a blueprint
for a function so now we have the
blueprints right here but really don't
have an object they all we have is the
instructions telling us how to make one
so let's go ahead and make a couple
objects right now in order to make a new
object and by the way let me just tell
you guys this I say make a new object
but if you're taking a test for college
or something it's actually called
creating a new instance of an object so
I say it like you know the straight-up
way but the technical term put on your
quiz create a new instance of an object
so you know say that in your teacher
we'll probably you know I don't want to
say get a hard-on or some so in order to
create a new object it's just like
creating a new variable variable and
then you list the name of your object
I'm going to create a Buckey object so
in order to do that go ahead and set it
equal to this
whenever you create a new instance aka
whenever you create an object you have
to use the keyword new this is telling
JavaScript we're about to create a new
object so after this we write what
blueprint do we want to use well since
we're going to be creating a new Buckey
object and we only have one blooper and
obviously it's going to be the person
blueprint so it says all right since
you're using that person blueprint it
takes two pieces of information the
first thing that I need is the name and
the second thing I need is the age okay
let's go ahead and give that to you name
Bucky Roberts age 24
and make sure remember any strings have
to be in quotation marks in any numbers
don't have to be so that is basically
how you create a new object your
object's name
what blueprint you want to use in any
information it needs so let's go ahead
and create another one real quick um var
let's make one for Taylor stood since
she is cute new a course she's a person
too but her name whoa Taylor Swift and I
don't know her age but I'm gonna guess
like 20 or something I don't know who
knows either she was 20 or she is going
to be 20 at one point so good enough so
now we have two objects a Bucky object
and the Taylor object Bucky object now
has two properties its name is Bucky
Roberts and its age is 24 oh well I got
like kennel cough or something and then
we have a Taylor object the Taylor
objects name is taylor swift and the
taylor objects age is 20 so that's
pretty cool we have a blueprint right
here and we actually created the objects
down here but why is this useful
well can we print it out or something oh
yes we can
so remember like I said any time you
want to print something out you should
do so in the body so let's go ahead and
print out this stuff right now document
right so any time just like before in
the last tutorial I told you guys you
want to use in objects properties you
need to list the name of the object and
let's go ahead we have two objects to
choose from Bucky and Taylor let's go
ahead and print out my name first so
let's the name of your object Bucky and
then using a dot separator you've list
the name of its property or variables so
Bucky's name should print out Bucky
Roberts pretty cool so let's go ahead
and see another example if we wanted to
print out Taylor Swift's age we would
write the object Taylor and the property
wall on access is age so let's go ahead
and save this and it should print out 20
just like that so like I said this is
just a better way of organizing data
instead of going you know calling a
function or anything like that to access
Tyler so sage the only thing we need to
do now is this the name of the object
and what property we want to access so
Bucky's name Bucky's age Taylor Swift's
name telesco sage it's a whole lot
easier than creating a bunch of
functions to display all that
information so again to recap one last
time in order to create the blueprint
for an object you pretty much do
something called create a constructor
function and that is the technical name
in order to do that you write what type
of object do you want to be making and
then list the information that it needs
and then say all right with that
information that we're going to pass in
we want to assign it to that object
so Bucky's name is going to be Bucky
Roberts Taylor's age is going to be 20
and then now that we have a blueprint we
can go ahead and make as many objects as
we want I may - in this example but we
can either make 5 10 5000 if we want it
doesn't matter and after that whenever
you want to use any information from an
object you go ahead and write the
object's name and the variable or the
properties associated with it and again
don't forget if you're watching this
tutorial because your teacher confused
you in JavaScript class or something
like that whenever you're creating
objects I say creating objects but the
technical term is creating an instance
of an object in the technical term for
this is called a constructor function so
there you go there's your answers for
your test and that's the basics of how
to create our very own objects so this
is one way we can create objects another
way I'm going to be teaching you that
and maybe because couple stories maybe
the next story I haven't decided yet but
for now that's all you get so thank you
guys for watching don't forget to
