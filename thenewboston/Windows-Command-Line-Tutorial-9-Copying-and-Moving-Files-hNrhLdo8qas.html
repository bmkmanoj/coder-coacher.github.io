video I am going to show you how to copy
and move files so what I did before this
video is I made a couple just quick
sample files I have this one and all it
says is my name is Bucky and I also made
a directory called apples and I put just
three junk files inside and another
directory called bacon so that's my
starting point and again I'm going to be
doing is showing you guys how to move
these around how to copy them so I just
wanted some sample files to work with
the actual content doesn't even matter
so the first thing I just want to show
you guys how to do is just copy a file
so let's say that we wanted to actually
let's go ahead and make a new directory
so make derp and I'll just name it a
test folder so now we have a new test
folder and nothing is inside so let's
say that we wanted to take this file and
copy it inside test folder how do we do
that
well it's actually pretty easy you use
actually let me clear this out use the
key word copy and after you give it two
pieces of information the source which
is essentially what file are you trying
to copy and then where do you want to
move it to so we are trying to copy
Bucky text and where do we want to move
it to test folder so this is the file
and this is where we want to put it and
just hit enter and check it out so again
we're copying it not moving it so we get
this one still and now inside test
folder look at that looking good
so another cool thing that you can
actually do is if you want to take this
file and copy it to let's say let's say
I wanted to copy it to my flash drive I
could do something like this copy you
always write that and what was it Bucky
text II so this is going to copy it to
the root directory of my flash drive now
what I can do is once it's copied I can
actually print out the contents of it so
dir E and again whenever you
use dir in this fashion what it does is
it just prints out the contents of e and
it doesn't actually move your current
working directory so now we can see my
flash drive has all these files from
before and Buckey dot txt so again that
is how you move it within your own drive
and also maybe have a flash drive or
something you want to move it to as well
pretty cool now another thing that I'm
going to recommend is whenever you're
copying files it's a better idea to use
X copy so Windows has the copy function
built in and also X copy so both of
these tools that allow you to copy files
and directories by X copy is a little
bit better because it gives you a few
more features so with X copy what you
can do is you can actually take let's
say we wanted to take apples and copy it
into bacon so X copy apples bacon pretty
cool so now if we go to bacon check it
out
so these files weren't here before but
what it did is it took all the files
from apples and it moved them to bacon
so let's just go ahead and delete what's
inside bacon and all right now another
cool trick that you can do is say that
what you wanted to do is actually take
apples and actually let me do this you
just do this from the command line um
new folder and I'll say inside apples
and I'll make a new file I'll say uh
what I have dot txt alright so check
this out whenever I just try to copy
apples to bacon watch what happens all
right copied all that now let's look and
bacon hmm let's see
we actually tried to copy all of this
stuff but it only appears to copy these
files it didn't get the directory inside
and that is because the
default behavior of xcopy is to only
copy the files so whenever you have sub
directories inside like inside apples
it's going to ignore those however what
we can do since we're using xcopy which
is kind of like an advanced copy is we
can actually tell it to not only copy
all the files but the sub directories as
well how do we do that well just run
that same command again but we give it
the /s this means copy all of the
content from apples into bacon and also
include the sub directories so hit enter
and check it out not only did it copy
sample one two and three it also copied
inside apples pretty cool so again
you're going to be using this /s most of
the time and if you guys ever just want
to look at all the features and all the
different options you can use with xcopy
again forward slash question mark this
is going to give you the help and look
at all the stuff that you can do with it
so this is the forward slash edge copies
directories and subdirectories except
empty ones and that is what we just did
now what if for example let me get rid
of this stuff all right so now bacon is
empty what if not only copying but we
actually wanted to take apples and move
this into bacon so what we could do in
that case is instead of copy or ex copy
we use the keyword move probably
couldn't figure that out so this just
like copy it has two pieces of
information that you need the source or
what are you trying to move and the
destination where are you trying to move
it so we are trying to move apples into
the directory bacon so now let's look at
that and check it out our apples
directory is gone because what we did is
we took it and we moved it into bacon so
again a really simple command
move in
be easy to remember now the less command
I want to teach you guys it's just how
to rename a directory so say that
alright
instead of bacon um you know that's not
really the word we're going for the
filename what we want to do is we
actually want to rename this directory
to I don't know ham or something well I
have to type is rename and to piece of
information what are you trying to
rename bacon what are you trying to
rename it to ham so hit enter and check
it out
it took the directory bacon and renamed
it to ham pretty awesome so I don't know
maybe you work for like a meat company
and you wanna you know rename your bacon
directory to ham boom roasted there you
go but yeah that's how you copy files
move files rename files and directories
and I don't know this is absolutely
fantastic and I'm actually kind of
digging this a green font but for now
ladies and gentlemen that is all you
guys get and I don't even know we're
gonna be talking about in the next video
probably networking or something so I'll
see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
