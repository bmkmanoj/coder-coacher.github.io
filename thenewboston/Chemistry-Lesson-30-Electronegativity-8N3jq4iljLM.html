30th chemistry tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm going to be talking to you
guys about electronegativity sounds
awesome
it is now electronegativity is defined
as the strength an atom has to attract
the bonding pair of electrons to itself
what the heck did I just say basically
it's the force that an atom has to
attract other electrons okay that kind
of makes sense so let's go ahead and
take a look at something like hydrogen
now we already know that every atom
attracts electrons and we know this
because the electron is always whizzing
around the nucleus it doesn't just go
flying off into space it actually is
attracted to the atom now the force of
that attraction we actually give a name
and that is called the electro
negativity of that atom now we give that
a name because depending on which atom
you're talking about the
electronegativity has different values
for example if you have a value of zero
it would mean that it would have no
attraction whatsoever and in that case
the electron would just go whizzing off
into space somewhere however some atoms
have an electronegativity of four like
4.0 now what this means is the
attraction is really strong in that atom
has a very very strong attractive force
to that electron so zero is weak four is
a really strong one and they all range
from somewhere in between now is a
general rule let me go ahead and this is
probably going to be really ugly but let
me go ahead and draw a makeshift
periodic table oh yeah oh that's a
good-looking table right there
wow that's bad but anyways it's a
general rule and I say this look and I
want to emphasize general because there
are plenty of exceptions but as a
general rule the electronegativity of
elements increases from left to right in
other words they're weak on the left
hand side and stronger as you get closer
to the right-hand side and also it
decreases from top to bottom in other
words the
strongest elements are on the top right
and the weakest ones are on the bottom
left so that is why what
electronegativity is I can't talk today
and that's why it's important so
whenever we take a look at something
like let's say our hydrogen bonds we
have a hydrogen that's bonded with
another hydrogen well I know I didn't go
over the exact figures yet but the
electronegativity of hydrogen is 2.1 now
that's the electronegativity of this
hydrogen right here and this one over
here also has 2.1 so that pretty much
means the force that these hydrogen
atoms can pull on these electrons now
since these two different hydrogen atoms
are pulling on these electrons with the
same exact force those electrons are
going to share evenly between this and
this hydrogen and that's what we call
well I won't go over the different types
of bonds but it's called a nonpolar
covalent bond it pretty much means that
your electrons are shared equally
between the two elements however if you
have something like 2.1 and 4.0 then the
electrons would be more attracted to
this element over here and that's where
we're going to be covering in the next
tutorial
depending on the electronegativity of
your atoms the electrons can either be
really attracted to one and not attract
to the other or maybe not attracted to
either of them and we're going to be
going over everything in the next
tutorial I just want to tell you guys
this electronegativity is important not
just to know how attracted the element
is or the atom is to the electron but
it's also useful when determining the
different kinds of bonds that can form
whenever you combine two or more
elements together so that's what you
have to look forward to thank you guys
for watching and I will see you guys in
the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
