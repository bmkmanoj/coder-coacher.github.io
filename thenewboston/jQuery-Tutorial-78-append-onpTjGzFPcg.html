with a video tutorial for the new Boston
in this video we're going to look at
some manipulation of element and we're
going to be looking in particular with
the append function now we're going to
go ahead first of all we're simply going
to create a small script that's going to
append in a particular string of text or
HTML string to a particular element so
let's go ahead and create a paragraph
and give this an ID I'm going to call
this area and then up here I'm going to
create a button so an input type button
with the value append and we'll give
this an ID as well so we can reference
it when we catch the event I'm just
going to call this a button okay so
essentially what we want to happen is
when we click on this button we want to
append something to this area now this
is obviously different to the HTML and
the text functionality in jQuery where
we actually append as opposed to replace
the contents now towards the end of the
tutorial we're going to take a look at
appending to several different elements
at once as well so this is just
appending to this one element P this
paragraph tag which is called area so
before we do anything else let's go
ahead and create a new file which is
going to be our JavaScript file I'm
going to call this append j/s I'm then
going to go ahead and include it into my
page so by typing out our script tags
and this is text forward slash
JavaScript and we obviously need to
include the source which is Jay s /a
pend j s so everything is now set up and
we can go over to appendage a s and
start to work on this now the main thing
that we want to do is catch the click of
this button using an event handler and
then append something to this paragraph
the contents of this paragraph in here
so let's go ahead and first of all setup
the event handler we're going to say
button we're referencing with the hash
box that's the ID of this button and
then we're going to say dot click inside
of here we need to create a function and
then we come down and inside here we can
start to append so every time we click
on this button we want to append some
text to this paragraph or the contents
of this paragraph so we reference the
paragraph as area and we just simply use
dot append and then in here we can type
in something we want to append so I'm
going to choose just one and then a
space afterwards so every time we click
this button this action will be
performed and it will append a one and a
space onto the end so now that we're now
browser let's just go and refresh the
page now when I click append you can see
that one has appeared inside of this
paragraph now when I click it again you
can see that the same thing happens and
we have another one and we can just keep
doing this and it will keep appending
this value to this paragraph now what we
can also do is we can reference this and
actually generally add to an element so
for example if I was to get rid of this
P here and I was to create two or three
of these down the page we could say
perhaps give them the class of para just
go ahead and copy that down there
and we'll give this class a different
name so we'll call it last so these are
the first two paragraphs and this is the
last one what we can then do inside
appendage is is change this accordingly
so we reference a class instead of the
ID of the element so I'm just going to
choose para now what's going to happen
is we're going to append a one on to
this paragraph and this paragraph
however not this last paragraph so let's
just take a look so I'm going to click
append and you can see that we've got
the first paragraph here the second
paragraph here and the last paragraph
which is called last these two have been
called to append this value and
therefore they both have the values
appended each time we press the button
okay so now that we've completed this
example let's take a look at a slightly
more interactive probably not useful but
an interactive example the first thing
I'm going to do is create an input field
and this is going to be type text I'm
going to give this an ID of name and
then I'm going to create a button next
to it and this is going to be called
well this is a type button and the value
of this is just let's say submit ok so
inside here I want to create an ID
attribute and I'm going to call this
button and now what we want to happen is
we want a sentence to be appended to so
for example in this paragraph here which
I'm going to call sentence I'm going to
say your name is and I'm going to leave
this part blank now what we can actually
do is because there's already text
inside of this paragraph when we use
append we're just going to append a name
onto the end of here
so whatever the user types in here and
then when they click the button it will
append it onto the end so we've left a
space just in here ok so let's go ahead
and change this around so we've got
button click we have the same event
handler present we now just need to get
rid of this we're going to create a new
variable called name and we're going to
make this equal to the value of our text
field here which is called
so hash named dot Val okay so now what
we want to do is we want to append this
name onto the end of this sentence so
let's go ahead and reference the
sentence div or paragraph sorry and then
we want to say append name okay so now
let's return to our browser when I go
ahead and type my name in here and click
Submit you can see that that appended on
to the end of that string so it's
extremely useful in this in with regard
to if you wanted to build up data on a
particular line if you wanted your user
to build up specific data one example I
can think of is if you were to create a
calculator and you wanted a string of
text to show the operation that is
currently in progress so for example if
there was a button on the page saying -
and a button saying 3 and a plus symbol
you could say 2 plus 3 and you might
want to just build up a string of the
operation that the user is carrying out
there's there's loads of cases that
you'll probably come across to actually
use the append functionality in jQuery
however this is just a basic example to
get you started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
