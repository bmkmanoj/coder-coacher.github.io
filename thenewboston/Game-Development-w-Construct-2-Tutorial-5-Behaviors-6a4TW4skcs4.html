story I want to teach you guys about
behaviors now what behavior is is pretty
much exactly what you think of it's
pretty much how a certain object will
act or well behave so what you can do is
you can add a different slew of
behaviors to different objects typically
like whenever you have a platform you
could add a platform behavior you can
also add like a solid behavior for a
block so when you jump on it you stay
there but what I want to do is I want to
add some very specific behaviors to
these objects in our games so they act a
very particular way so the first thing I
want to do is well I want to let this
dude move around so I want to do that by
showing you guys had actually add or
edit a behavior so go ahead and click
your player and on the left hand side of
the screen you're going to see the
properties and you're going to see a
little subject section for word
behaviors now it says add or edit
behavior so click this link right here
and whenever you click it you're going
to see all the behaviors on that object
well we didn't add any yet so that's why
this is blank so let's go ahead and add
one now
by clicking on this little add new
behavior icon now as I said the first
thing that I wanna that my dude do is
move around the screen so in order to do
that if we actually scroll down right
here under this movements category we're
going to choose this 8 Direction
movement now what the 8 direction does
is as you can see moves an object up
down left to right in diagonals so once
we click Add now well our object our
dude can do is he can whenever we press
the up-down left-right on our keyboard
he's going to move up down left right
and he can also move at any angle so
like 45 degrees 52 degrees pretty much
any direction you want to so that is how
you make a character move pretty freakin
simple so actually I want to show you
guys something right now so we're going
to run this he's going to move um wow
that's great but you know the
is a some trouble here first of all he's
just moving off the screen we're not
following them and second of all what
what happens when I move to left hand
side um okay he just saw walked out of
the game he wasn't even supposed to do
that just walking into the vastness of
space so let's go ahead and fix those
two issues right now so select your dude
and we need to add a couple more
behaviors so click behaviors again add
now the first problem we can fix is
making the camera follow it so if you
scroll down and I probably shouldn't
even say that we're yeah right here
scroll to it's under general what this
is going to do is the camera is going to
follow your dude so he's always in the
center of the screen so let's go ahead
and add this one and now we have the
problem that he can walk off you know
like right here he just walk off the
edge of our game we obviously don't want
to let that so if we click add new this
one is called to layout right here under
general bound to layout stop an object
from leaving the layout hit add and we
can actually close that and now when I
run this check it out if he goes too far
to the right the camera now follows him
and let's go ahead and try to make him
walk off the game to the left he can't
and someone send me freaking messages
when I'm trying to teach tutorial but
anyways that's what those behaviors do
again we had an eight directional
movement so we can move around using our
up/down left/right arrow keys we added
scroll to so the camera follows him and
bound to layout so now what I want to do
is we need to add some behaviors to the
other objects as well the first one is
the bullet so select your bullet and in
the behaviors link what we're going to
do for this is we're actually going to
add two behaviors the first one is
bullet movement and a bullet movement
pretty much saying we're going to give
you arm one angle to start at and
whenever you are animated just keep
following that path at the exact same
like a bullet so again this bullet is
never going to go you know take a curved
path like this like your player can
whenever it shoots out it's going to go
in a straight line or shoots out like
this it's going to go in a straight line
right here
like a vector so that's the first one
bullet and the other one that I want to
do is also destroy outside layout which
is hey find these they should just have
them in alphabetic order destroy outside
layout now what this does is it
basically says this whenever we shoot
the bullet and it goes outside the game
area then destroy it or just get rid of
it make it disappear now usually it
wouldn't matter and if you're thinking
all right what's the matter if it just
goes into empty space forever well it's
more important to the memory of the game
because whenever you're playing a game
it has to keep track of every object and
if you just are firing a bunch of
bullets and they're going out towards
space and our computer has to remember
that they are in space then it's going
to eat up all your memory so that just
says once it goes outside the game get
rid of it wipe it from the memory and
it's going to make your game run a lot
faster now for the monster this is
actually a pretty cool tip I'll show you
guys right here if you click on their
behavior then what I wanted to do is I
also want to add a bullet movement to
this now you're thinking all right well
that doesn't make sense why when I just
add a directional because he did it
further you're dude well I'm going to
add this because these monsters the way
I'm going to program them they're pretty
much can be like zombies just like
walking in straight lines all the time
so they're not going to be able to like
curve and hit your dude but it's still
going to be fun because there's going to
be a bunch of them they have to avoid so
again these are going to be kind of dumb
they're just going to move in a straight
line
and you know maybe this one will be
moving in a straight line so again
that's a nice little tip whenever you
want to make a game with zombies or
really dumb monsters just put a bullet
movement for their behavior and the only
behavior I want to add for this
explosion is this click on behaviors add
I only want to add this fade now what
this does is it change its opacity which
is pretty much the transparency so
basically what's going to happen if I
close out of that whenever you need to
blow up something like your bullet or a
monster or maybe you can even add that
to your player itself I don't know maybe
want to have your player blow up what's
going to happen is it's going to go from
full opacity and it's going to fade out
and by default when the object is done
fading out it also gets white for memory
so we don't have the same issues that we
do from the bullet going off screen so
that's another cool law can talk cool
reason that I like to fade out behavior
so now whenever you run the game check
it out or bullet I don't know if you
guys saw that but keep an eye on the
bullet and also the monster they go in a
straight line and also our explosion
fades out and at the end of that it gets
deleted from the game wipe from memory
so our game is still running fast so you
know pretty cool game this you know so
far I guess we can go chase those
monsters and those bullets but other
than that not a whole lot to do so in
there in the next couple of videos I'm
well I'm going to be making the game a
whole lot better so thank you guys for
watching and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
