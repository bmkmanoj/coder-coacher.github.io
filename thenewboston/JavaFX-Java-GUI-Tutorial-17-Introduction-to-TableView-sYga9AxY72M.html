video I'm going to show you how to make
a table using Java FX now whenever I say
table think that like a spreadsheet
where you have your data and it's
arranged in rows and columns so if you
ever use a Microsoft Excel or any
spreadsheet program like that you guys
are going to know exactly what I'm
talking about
and actually I know it sounds kind of
complex but a lot of the hard work
JavaFX takes care of it for us so
without further ado let's go ahead and
get started now whenever you're trying
to create a spreadsheet like application
and JavaFX
it's always a good idea to take your
data and stick inside a new class so for
this program I'm just gonna make like a
dummy little spreadsheet app and I'll
say that I have a store and I'm selling
you know whatever products I want to
sell in my store so this will be a class
where I can have all of my products all
of my items whether on a cell you know
corn food bouncy balls computers
whatever so me get rid of that line at
the top because it's annoying
alright now check this out what
properties are associated with my
products well let's see they have a name
they have a price and since I'm running
in the store I probably have more than
one so I'll say that I have laptops
selling for 500 bucks and I have 20 of
them so again we're going to need name
price and quantity or inventory whatever
you want to call it so let's go ahead
and make those properties right now so
string name and I'll make another arm
the price will be double since we'll
need you know decimal places price and
for the last one
the quantity how many items do I have or
to say quantity you can say amounts
inventory whatever so basically these
are the three properties that are
associated with my products now whenever
we make our spreadsheet and you know
just a couple minutes each of these are
going to be a new column so again we're
going to have a spreadsheet we're going
to have a name column a price column and
a quantity column and then we can see
all of our items in one very
nice-looking well-organized spreadsheet
application so that's what we're going
to be doing that's how it's going to be
set up so now let me just go ahead and
add some constructors so we can actually
start setting this bad boy up all right
so I'm going to have two constructors
I'm going to overload them the first one
I'm just going to take all the
properties and give them a default value
so by default whenever we create a
product it's going to have a blank name
let me just copy this because I'm lazy
and for the price we can just set this
equal to zero and same thing for the
quantity so whenever we're creating a
product object it's going to have these
default values now I'm also going to
make another constructor public and what
this is going to do is it's going to
take three parameters the name and
quantity alright so what we can do is we
can either create a blank product and
then sell the properties one by one or
we can just do everything all in one big
shebang so that's why I overloaded it
with this constructor right here and of
course whenever we do that instead of
giving it default values we actually
just set the product equal to whatever
values we pass in price in quantity
all right so now we have the basic
template of our class setup the next
thing you want to do is you want to
insert all of your getters and setters
now the cool thing about using this IDE
is if he just hits alt insert again
that's alt insert on your keyboard you
can choose getter and setter z' and this
is if you just select all of these right
here and hit OK
it creates all of them for you now if
you're not using jetbrains I'm not sure
how to do it on whatever IDE you're
using or you can just type all of this
manually but it is incredibly important
to add these getters and setters now
whenever we use tables in Java FX behind
the scenes it's going to look for these
getters and setters and it's going to
follow this very specific naming
convention it's going to look for a
method with get in lower case or set in
lower case and then directly after it is
the property name so if you guys are
thinking about doing something like get
the name or making your own custom
getters and setters that don't follow
convention do not do that because it'll
break JavaFX whenever you're not using
Java FX 2 whatever the heck you want but
whenever you're making tables they need
to follow this naming convention I
cannot stress it enough all right so
this product class is done we can now
store a bunch of our products and they
can have a name price and quantity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
