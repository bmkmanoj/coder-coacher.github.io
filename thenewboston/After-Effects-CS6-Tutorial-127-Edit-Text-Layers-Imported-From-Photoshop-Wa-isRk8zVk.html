After Effects cs6 tutorial I am buddy
Blackford I'm your host today and I want
to talk to about bringing text layers in
from Photoshop into After Effects and
being able to edit them so first of all
I wanted to show you guys this new
vehicle that's coming out it's a Ferrari
and I want you all to send me one of
these to my address and just PM me for
the address or just send it to Bucky's
house and I'll take it from him and
that's that so I had that for you but
what I did is I created some different
types of text in Photoshop and I'll
bring that up and what I've got here is
I'll close these down first I've got
just regular text that has nothing
applied to it or anything like that now
I've got this text here that I created
and it's on an art and the way I did it
is by clicking on this button up here
and changing the style to an arc so I
use the warp text and then the next one
I have here is text that's on a path and
what I did is I just took the pen tool
and made like a path like this or
whatever and then put my text onto that
so I'm going to enable these and then
what I did is I just saved it as a PSD
so PSD like that and I saved it so I'm
going to come into After Effects here
and import that into my images here file
it import file and I'm going to click on
this arch text here and just going to
import it it could be as footage that's
fine and editable layer styles is what
we want hit OK and then it gives us a
little cop here and then our layers here
so let's double-click on this comp to
bring it out down here and then open it
and we've got our text all that shows up
here so it's all in one area and I'll
show you how to change these into
editable text because right now they're
not you can't do any like pictures or
images so we're going to start out the
one that says not all right here that is
I must have changed it to nothing before
I saved it it did just say not before
but what we're going to do is click on
it right click and we're going to come
up here to convert editable text you can
also find that in the layer if you click
on it click on your layer there and then
go up here to layer you can convert to
editable text also and now it's a text
layer and we can use our text tool to
change it and so that's easy enough now
we've got this text here that was on an
arch or an arc whatever you want to call
it so we want to keep this like how it
is so I want I'm going to come over to
convert to editable text and it's going
to come back down to 9 arch because the
warp text in Photoshop it doesn't keep
the style in after-effects when you
convert it so I mean that doesn't that's
not the way we want to do it so that's
why I created this text on a path here
I wish my path was a little bit more
round but I mean it probably would have
looked better if I use the longer words
but let's convert this to editable text
and now it creates a local path for you
and it stays in the correct style as you
can see and if I can type things
and it works it keeps the style and then
you can also edit your path if you
wanted to so that's pretty cool and if
you are working with something in
Photoshop that's really awesome just
make sure to keep all your text on
different layers in Photoshop
and export it or save it as a PSD and
just import it as a as a dual layers
when you import it that's a pretty much
it for that I don't think there's
anything else to talk about so let's
move on to the next tutorial where we're
going to talk about something else who
knows what it is going to be thanks for
watching this one and have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
