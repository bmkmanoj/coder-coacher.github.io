think and last tutorial in this little
mini series we have right now and it's
going to be a real quick tutorial and
the only thing we have to do is
implement one less method and that's
from the key listener interface and what
we need to do is we need to put first
public void key pressed and we just need
to make a little key so we know when to
exit our program so key event E and
let's just go ahead and put our rights
if e dots get key code set that equal to
method of course is equal to let's just
put key event VK underscore es escape
right there so pretty much if you hit
escape on your keyboard what do you want
to do we need to call stop and remember
this was a method we inherited that
pretty much stops our program so that's
pretty much all we need to do but we
still get a error up here because we
didn't implement key released and key
typed so let's go ahead and implement
them real quick public void key released
and it's going to take key event E and
it's not going to do anything so now
let's just copy this whole thing right
here and we need to implement one more
method to fill up fulfill our promise
and that's going to be key typed and now
we shouldn't get any errors again you
can implement a method and not do
anything with it this pretty much does
nothing and that's what we wanted to do
we only need to do this so if we didn't
do this we would have no way of ending
our program so now with our errors gone
I'm going to run this program and show
you guys what it's doing hopefully and
please guys just don't follow along and
watch my tutorials follow along and type
it as well because since you're not
going to be able to see this it's really
really important the only way you can
understand this is to actually see it so
that's why you guys need to do it so as
it starts out my mouse is in the center
of the screen by default
now I can move my mouse around anyway
and that cursor stays in the middle of
our screen but my background image which
is for tiles it's moving indefinitely
whatever way I move it so I can move it
left I can scroll my mouse left forever
and the tile is just going to move
forever and ever and it's going to be
never-ending and I can move it in any
way up down like this so again that's
how you use the mouse local feature and
that's how in 3d games like Call of Duty
and stuff like that you can look and
scroll your mouse to the left and
instead of looking to left and stopping
when it gets the edge of screen it just
goes in circles and circles and circles
or if you move right you're just guy
goes in circles and circles and keeps
going on forever so this is how we would
do this and when we get into 3d we're
going to be using something very similar
to this and I'm not going to have to
reteach it and also when you're building
2d games you can move your cursor to the
right and have your character run to the
right forever and ever and ever instead
of just moving to the right over here
and one that gets it as your screen stop
it so that's how you can have games that
are bigger than the actual size of your
screen like Super Mario Brothers were if
he runs to the right you get a new piece
of the game and new background new
characters you run into so that's it for
this tutorial hopefully you followed it
and hopefully you are now up and running
the new mouselook feature but I don't
want to keep rambling so I just want to
take some thank you guys for watching
don't forget to check out my next
tutorial it's going to be awesome you
are well on your way and being a
full-fledged game developer so thank you
guys one last time don't forget
subscribe and I'll see you next Oriole</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
