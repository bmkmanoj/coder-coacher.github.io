show you how to install nodejs and set
it up on a Mac it's actually really easy
you can probably figure it out yourself
but let's go ahead and do it
so click install do we want to go ahead
and keep it yes of course that's what
we're trying to do it downloads real
quick so double-click this package that
you just installed in by the way the
website is HTTPS node.js org so make
sure you're on that website alright so
this is just a wizard if you watch my
last tutorial issue probably didn't
because that was for Windows but it's
really easy just click continue ok make
sure you read all that continue do you
agree to it yep and install this all
right so the head is it so let's go
ahead and close out of that and just
like the last tutorial now since it
installed a path variable what we can do
is we can open up our terminal and if
you can't see it then if you go to
finder and just go to applications it's
in one second make sure you guys can see
what's going on all right so fo you go
to your applications inside utilities
you're going to see a program called
terminal now double click that's but I
already have it open so there you go so
from here you can just type node you
spell it correctly Wow node and then
just to test that anything put like
console.log arm you know like tuna so
press ENTER and it says tuna undefined
that's good that's what we want to see
it means that everything is installed
and working correctly so Naomi quit this
terminal closed and check it out
so again we obviously don't want to
develop or write all of our code in that
terminal so what you can use and a lot
of people use is actually this program
right here called sublime text it's a
text editor and it's completely free
again I highly recommend using webstorm
from JetBrains but if you want a free
one then you can just go ahead and
download this it's really easy to
download and install too so
love this and develop them all right
double click this and now if we double
click it to open it check out me all
right are we sure we want to open it all
right don't warn me actually we'll keep
that just in case and open and let me
clean all this up and now we have
sublime so the first thing I want to do
is actually just make a new file and let
me save this as I'm going to store it
right on my desktop I have a directory
called Bucky make sure that you save a
file called app dot J s and just like
before this is our main JavaScript file
or nodejs file that's it's going to look
to first whenever it's running our
node.js applications so again like I
said our main file save it now just to
test everything real quick I'm going to
book console.log and I'll just write
like bacon actually let me put yeah
bacon I think I said tuna before all
right so now make sure I save everything
and now open up our terminal again and
if I go to CD desk top Bucky that's
going to move me into this directory
right here and if we press LS real quick
we can verify that this work right here
lists all of the files in your directory
so we can see that we have one file that
we just created fjs now in order to run
this all we do is type node app dot j s
now we hit enter and check it out it
just logs out or prints out bacon to the
terminal beautiful everything is working
awesome now again if you want to go
ahead and continue using sublime feel
free everything is going to work great
however one more time I'm going to
recommend webstorm that's what I'm going
to be using in the future tutorials but
yeah either way thing guys for watching
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
