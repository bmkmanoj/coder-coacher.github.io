and in this video I'm going to talk to
you guys about momentum in vector
addition because not only can use vector
addition when adding forces together but
you can also use it when adding momentum
together to prove the law of
conservation of momentum it's pretty
cool in as an example I'm going to talk
to you guys about the pool example
because you remember a couple videos ago
I said that whenever you guys were
playing pool then what you need to do
was you needed to hit the eight ball
into a pocket and then whenever you do
that all of the pretty much energy and
momentum gets transferred to the eight
ball from the cue ball well the science
was correct in that one and we figured
out the calculation but it wasn't a
really good realistic example of what
happens because in real life the cue
ball keeps moving a little bit so let me
go ahead and show you guys more
realistic example so say you have your
eight ball right there and of course at
first whenever you hit the cue ball the
eight ball is just standing still that's
the one we want to put into a pocket so
before the collision the eight ball
since it's not moving has momentum of
zero kilograms times meters per second
now the cue ball down here I'll write a
C on it this is the one that's flinging
across the table with a high rate of
speed so we'll just go ahead and make up
a momentum for this and as soon as you
hit the cue ball
we'll say that it has a momentum of 10
kilograms times meter per second now
what it's going to do is it's going to
crash into the eight ball and hopefully
this eight ball goes into you know
whatever pocket you want it to so
whenever this happens if you ever play
pool in real life your cue ball after
the collision it doesn't come to an
automatic stop what happens is it rolls
slowly away and hopefully this eight
ball goes into a pocket like over here
or something so let me go ahead and show
that so this on the left hand side is
before the collision or as soon as you
hit the cue ball now after the collision
it usually looks something like this the
eight ball goes we'll say the pocket
you're aiming for is to the top right
the
eight ball goes flying over here with a
high rate of speed so we'll make a
momentum momentum like eight kilograms
times meter per second and we'll see the
cue ball okay that that sees a little
too big let me draw my ball first the
cue ball goes in this direction and
usually the cue ball ends up slower than
the ball it hit will say that this has a
moment of two kilograms times meter okay
that doesn't look like M meter per
second and let me just symbolize the
collision with this little bang right
here so again what we're doing is we're
hitting the cue ball which had an
initial momentum of 10 kilograms times
meters per second into the eight ball
and a realistic result would be the
eight ball going in this direction at
eight kilograms meter per second in the
cue ball going in this direction at two
kilograms meter per second so how does
this verify the law of conservation of
momentum well it verifies it whenever we
look at vector addition so let's go
ahead and take a look at our initial
vector that is right here and we can
symbolize that by saying it has 10
kilograms per meter per second or times
meter per second so whenever we add up
the two resulting vectors this one in
this one we should end up with the same
thing is this initial vector what the
heck am I talking about
well let me show you guys on another
slide so the eight ball let me draw this
ball again went in this direction with a
momentum of eight kilograms times meter
per second now the cue ball remember
whenever you add vectors you connect
them head to tail would be right there
and it went in this direction with a
momentum of two kilograms times meter
per second now again whenever you're
doing this on graph paper or trying to
figure out these things make sure you
draw these to scale for example this
vector right here would be eight inches
and this vector right here would be 2
inches or centimeters as long as they're
two skate
no it doesn't really matter now again
what we need to do is in order to find
the some of these vectors you take the
tail of the first one and draw a line to
the head of the last one so this right
here would be your resulting vector now
if we went ahead and measure that we
would end up with 10 kilograms times
meter per second now of course I know
that this is not the proper angles and
this of course if we actually measured
it it would not be 10 centimeters or
whatever but that is how you can use
vector addition to add up and prove the
law of conservation of momentum and
again like I said I know that since
eight plus two this is not in a straight
line then it wouldn't actually equal ten
but whenever you're figuring this stuff
out you're going to get different values
than eight and two but the important
thing to remember is you're always going
to end up with this momentum now instead
of just you know adding arrows for fun
what this does like I said is it proves
that the law of conservation of momentum
is valid using vector addition so
basically the total momentum of the two
resulting vectors equals the initial
momentum so there you go so thank you
guys for watching hopefully you
understand now in the next video I'm
going to be taking the gun in the bullet
Prime to a whole nother level so again
thank you guys for watching I'll see you
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
