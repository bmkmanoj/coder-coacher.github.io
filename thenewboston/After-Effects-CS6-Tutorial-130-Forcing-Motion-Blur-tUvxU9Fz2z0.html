name is buddy Blackford and I'm going to
show you a couple ways to force motion
blur on to objects in cs6 so we can do
this to video or we can do this to
pictures or images or anything like that
and there are certain ways to do it and
if you just try to do it the wrong way
it's not gonna work you're gonna be like
what the hell is going on man so I'm
gonna show you the right way to do
things so first we're just going to
bring in a video real quick and let's uh
we're get in I got a I cut it by
accident earlier in a different tutorial
and I haven't fixed it yet but pretty
much this video is just a lying movement
moving forward let me Ram preview this
for you so we don't have to wait for it
to load every two seconds
all right so it's just this now let me
try to add motion blur to this and we
can see what happens I enabled the
switch here which enables it for the cop
and I'm going to enable it for the layer
here and I'll Ram preview and you're
just gonna basically see that nothing
happens I'll change it on and change it
off you see that nothing happens so you
don't got any motion blur in your video
here because it doesn't have any
position keyframes or rotation keyframes
or anything like that to transform it
it's just a video about it scale this
video down a little bit so we can see it
a little more so how are we gonna add
motion blur to this well there is what
we can use it and the effect is called
CC wide time the I type it in here CC
wide and it's under the time section so
I'm gonna use the this section over here
to add my effects and presets so I'm
gonna bring it over here and drag it on
to my layer and now you can see that
some motion blur has been added
and the it adds it a lot to the line
here because it is moving more and to
the stuff in the back
not as much you can adjust the way that
your blur looks by using these forward
steps and backward steps so if I bring
this up you can see he's a lot more
blurred out I'm bringing that back to
one maybe and on crease this one and
this one
Hiba lures you can see that when I was
increasing is blur goes backwards a
little more so just use that to get the
the style that you want I'm gonna change
my preview settings here it's not final
quality I'm gonna put on faster raft so
we can see what's going on a little
faster we don't have to wait around all
the time with the fast track turned down
I can easily scrub and it'll it may not
look the best but I don't have to wait
forever to for it to render and load so
that helps me when I'm doing my
tutorials so the way you can check to
see how this looks with the with the
effect on and with it off is by clicking
on this FX button up here and it'll give
you some look to see how it's working
so there is another way here and that is
an effect called CC force motion blur so
I'm going to type that in here and here
we go it's under the time in the effects
so we'll drag that on top and you can
see as that that brings the motion blur
forward also and we can we have a couple
more samples here we can increase the
sampling which will make it kind of like
the samples in our comp settings under
the Advanced tab like our samples here
and then we've got our shutter angle if
we bring that up higher we can see a lot
more and this goes way up we could bring
this up really high to get a lot of
motion blur if we want so you have a
little more play room with that when
you're using the force motion blur so
this is a decent way to get motion blur
onto video footage that moves so just
like bring it up here and then if I turn
it off you can see how it it kind of
messes with the time and warps the time
a little bit to force a motion blur into
the into the video footage now these
effects can be used on other things like
images too but they don't work the same
way so I'm going to delete this lion out
of here and I'm gonna add in just an
image and it doesn't matter what its of
let's bring this hot dog cat in and I'll
just cut him out real quick so we can
see how this is gonna work out for us
our masks a little bit more so he's
right in the middle all right so we've
got a mask here and I'll just move this
from left to right with the position and
just keyframe it oops
move that keyframe all the way to the
end and I'll move this one across like
this go in the middle here we can see if
we enable motion blur it's going into
motion blur fine well maybe we want to
use the effects instead and the effects
will work with the motion blur already
so what we're gonna do is come to let's
try to add the effects on it first and
I'll show you what happens so let's add
CC for motion blur to it and you can see
nothing happens even with motion blur
enabled or anything like that
nothing's gonna happen no matter how
much I increase this is because the the
effect only works on a composition so
what we're going to need to do is pre
compose this into a composition so we're
going to go to layer and then come to
the bottom to pre compose and just click
on move all attributes into the new
composition hit OK and now if we add CC
force motion blur to it the composition
now we get some motion blur going on
here and you can
that's what the shutter angle and
everything like that just the same now
we can open this up and turn on the
motion blur also here like that go back
to our original comp here and we'll just
throw on the motion blur for that and
these will work with each other if I
turn the native of motion blur on and it
will kind of like work together to
create another kind of motion blur there
so you can use those to tweak each other
and not mess too much with the
composition settings if you don't want
to so maybe you have a couple things in
your content need to have different
types of motion blur use the CC force
motion blur and instead of everything in
your comp settings because this is gonna
affect everything that's in there and
this effect can just uh just pretty much
affect one composition within your
composition so I usually use just the
motion blur in itself but I wanted to
show you the this CC force motion blur
pretty much because it's a decent tool
and when I was using it earlier I was
just trying to put it on to the image
just like I was showing you not how to
do before by just trying to like put it
on top of the original image without
putting it into a composition first and
I was like couldn't figure out what the
hell is going on for like probably like
twenty five minutes and I was like
getting mad and everything like that
side to go look it up and so if you ever
get stuck on something and you don't see
it in like a tutorial because sometimes
can't go over everything just a little
just type it in into Google and look it
up it's easy to find it's fine stuff
like that so thanks for watching this
and hopefully you don't have to struggle
with it at all like I had to for 25
minutes but it's pretty awesome tool see
you guys in the next tutorial and be
sure to thumbs up if you liked it
have a good one everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
