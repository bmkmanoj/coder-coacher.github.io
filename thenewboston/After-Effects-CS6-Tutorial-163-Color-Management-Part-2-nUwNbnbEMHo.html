and doesn't support as many colors and
everything like that
oh yeah perfect drop-kicking the Santa
into the TV Aaron - into the tables it's
awesome so something like this would be
fine - if you're just working on this
video it would be fine to work on it in
like a smaller color space so let's go
back to the project settings so this all
makes sense hopefully this is make gonna
make sense when I get done talking about
it
so we've got our depth here we've got 8
bits per channel which is a low amount
of color depth and we've got 16 which is
in the middle and 32 which is like HD
now so pretty much you want to have the
color settings set on 32 if you're
working with HD footage or really like
camera RAW files or DP X's or red files
which is red is a camera that shoots
very very high quality HD footage
usually maybe like 2k resolution so you
would want to have the depth of high and
if you're just working on some SD you
would want to have it on 16 and really I
wouldn't really recommend having it on 8
bits per channel really too much so
let's put this on 32 and you can have it
on 32 if you want to be safe that's fine
too
now we've got this working space here
and this is where it gets like really
confusing we've got all these different
kinds of working spaces and this is
where it's like you don't I don't really
know what every single one of these mean
but I know which ones to use at certain
times so I'll go over that real quick if
you're using like D
evie video like when you use like a mini
DV tape or something like that which is
usually in standard definition you're
gonna maybe want to use the SD TV NTSC
this one right here or if you were
working in PAL you want to use SD TV pal
so NTSC is usually in like the Americas
and pals and European areas and stuff
like that so whatever your country uses
use that not a lot of people use SD too
much anymore except for maybe like your
local TV station where they don't care
too much about quality and just mainly
want to get out the video to save money
now if we want to work in
high-definition you would want to pick
something like the HDTV rec.709 not even
sure what are you see 709 even stands
for but that's the one that you would
want to pick and for like something
that's going to be displayed on a
webpage you wouldn't want to pick srgb
and then all these numbers so this one
right here srgb I II see six one nine
six six dash two point one right that's
not easy that stuff's not easy to
remember but just remember as the sRGB
that's the and these will help define
the color space and pretty much you
wanna you want to pick which one you
need for what you're intending your
video to actually be on
so remember srgb is web HDTV NTSC or PAL
is for DV or
not anything that's not HD and then HDTV
rec709 is for HDTV now if you're working
with something like DP X's that are
really high high in color and you want
to keep preserve all those colors and
maybe it's going to show up on like a
like on a movie theater screen or
something like that then we want to pick
something with like a lot of resolution
in it and and the best one usually to
pick is this prophoto RGB and that one's
pretty high and I just know that from
reading about it on the internet and I
think in cs5 it was called a codec
prophoto RGB but I'm pretty sure Kodak
went out of business so now it's just
prophoto RGB and that's basically what
professional photo color range is going
to be so that's about working space you
know it's not super critical to have the
working space on but it brings you up to
the next level of making your color
values that much better so just use use
these when you know really know what you
want and what you're doing match them up
if you have if you're working with
something that's got a lot of color in
it then you want to match up your
working space and your depth to be
something that has a lot of color
accepted and it's in its settings pretty
much so that's a little it's it's kind
of hard to explain but hopefully that
made sense to you guys and I'll be doing
tutorials that explain this better later
on and as we go on through you'll
how stuff actually works a little bit
better but this is uh this is the
introduction to this and how to work we
use the working space in depth in your
color settings for your projects
so I'll leave it at that for now and try
not to confuse you guys any much any
much more I hope you guys learned some
things off this one so keep keep
watching for more tutorials about this
kind of stuff and I look forward to
seeing you guys in the next tutorial
which is gonna be awesome so you guys
later have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
