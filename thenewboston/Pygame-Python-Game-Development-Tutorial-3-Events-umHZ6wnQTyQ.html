another PI game tutorial video for the
new boss in from cent Dex what we're
going to be doing in this video is
talking about some of the more logic
based things for PI game as well as some
of the events that we can use so before
the quit we'll put our code here so this
is our first little update and now we're
going to have a very basic what is known
as a game loop so um first what we're
going to do is every every game since we
do our other game didn't really stick
around for very long
every game has to have some sort of
title so we do want to kind of give this
this game some sort of title the first
game I want us to make is a a snake-like
game so the snake game is where you have
you know maybe a small snake at first
and you slides around you control with
your arrow keys and each time he gets an
apple so to speak he gets a little
longer
the snake does and so basically the
objective is the of the game is to not
hit the edges of the screen or don't hit
yourself so you can't run into yourself
so each time you need an apple you a
little longer so obviously eventually
you have to lose the game so we're going
to call our game a slither so to add a
title so the title of the window for
example so like if we look at this
window the title this one is Python
three point four point one PI game video
tutorial blah blah blah blah so in PI
game that's called a caption I'm not
sure why they call that caption but they
do so we're going to say a PI game dot
display dot set underscore caption and
then in here you give a string and
that's a title or I suppose the caption
to the window so we're going to call it
slither so that's our little title here
so now uh we're going to come down here
and we're going to specify a sort of
constant variable if you will and that's
going to be called game
exit and we're going to say game exit
right now equals false and we're going
to create this really simple game loop
but and eventually we'll actually turn
it into a true what's known as a main
loop but for now we'll keep it real
basic and we're going to say Wow
not a game exit
call in and then we're going to specify
the code block that we want to occur
under this while loop so basically this
is asking Wow um why not game exit so
it's basically saying Wow wild game exit
is false okay
so alternatively if you say wow game
exit that would ask wild game exit is
true okay so while not game exit is
asking while it's false what do you want
to do and what we want to do is we're
going to use the built in event handling
in PI game and we're going to say for
event so we're specifying this kind of
temporary variable name in this for loop
so for event in PI game dot event dot
get what do we want to do and for now
I'm just going to show you guys that we
can print the event so you can see all
of the events that are coming out
because it's a lot of events so let's go
ahead and save and run this real quick
and so here's our window you can see our
title is slither in the background here
you can see the events so what I'll try
to do is I'll move this over here and as
you move your mouse in here you see like
all this stuff that's being spammed at
us basically it's giving us the position
of our mouse it's giving us any buttons
that have been pressed and so on so
alternatively we can bring this up here
this and where is slither here is and so
we hold our mouse so I'm not touching it
anymore and I'll hit like kay and you
see how we have key down key up so it's
not just did you press that key it's are
you still pressing it have you pulled it
up and all that so all the keys here so
that's that and so as you can see
there's pretty much all these events and
you didn't have to do any any of this at
all yourself that's really nice that
saves you a lot of coding too
the event handling so really they do the
event sort of event handling but you
decide how you want to actually handle
those events so anyways that is the
beginning of our PI game logic now
there's obviously a lot of other things
that are going to happen but basically
while not game exit and then you're
going to have four event in PI game
event get and then under here you're
going to have all kinds of events that
you might have so in our snake game
we're going to have something like the
arrow keys being pressed we're going to
have I said probably just the arrow keys
and really an exit those are going to be
the only like true events that happen
and then so under here you have your
events in your event handling and then
after your event handling you're going
to have a block of logic basically that
determines okay where is our snake
where's our snake gonna move next is our
snake off the screen so did they die and
ours is our snake catching ourselves
probably touching ourselves I'm immature
and um or did we just run into an apple
right did we eat that Apple that kind of
thing you have that under under that and
that is almost two out most games pretty
much act you've got your event handling
and you've got your your logic and
basically what's going to update the
graphics to the screen so we're going to
carry on with that probably the next one
will be doing a handling of eight like a
quick event for example so we run this
right now
and we bring up this window and we hit
the X nothing happens but you'll see
actually let me bring this up and then
hit the X again you'll see that event
and it says quick right it was a quit
event and it knows that it was a quit
event and also another interesting
things you can hold over and if you pull
off of the screen you actually get
whether or not the window is active or
not and probably in the next video we'll
talk a little bit
more about all of the events that pagan
can basically take in zoo a lot of them
most of time people just use key presses
but you can do a lot of really cool
event handling so we'll cover up cover
those basics in the next video so
anyways thanks for watching stay tuned
for the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
