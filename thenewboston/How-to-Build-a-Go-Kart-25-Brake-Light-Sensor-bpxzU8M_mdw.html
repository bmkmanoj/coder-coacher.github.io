need to hook up the electric to our
master cylinder on brakes now there are
a lot of different reasons why you need
electricity going to brakes first of all
if you ever heard of anti-lock brakes
what they are is pretty much breaks it
pretty much resembles pumping your brake
like a thousand times faster than your
foot can like boo-boo-boo-boo-boo and
whenever you do this then what it does
is it helps to prevent skidding and
stuff so whenever you have anti-lock
brakes you need electric because there's
a solenoids and what it does is it
releases that brake or hydraulic brake
fluid in short little bursts now if you
were working on your car then you're
probably know that but aside from that a
lot of brakes also have these things
called pressure regulators and what
pressure regulators do is they pretty
much make sure that each of the brake
pads that the cylinder is hooked up to
is receiving the same amount of pressure
because of course when you have the same
cylinder controlling your front right
and front left you don't want you know
the front right to receive more pressure
or else you're going to be to the right
when you brake aside from that if you're
working on a huge vehicle like a truck
or something or a car I guess they have
power brakes and what a power brake does
is whenever you're pressing the brake
itself it pretty much just amplifies
this pressure in it pretty much takes
whatever pressure you're doing amplifies
it and then it increases the amount of
power going to brakes but this thing
right here what we're about to hook up
all this is is a little brake indicator
which basically is a sensor that wait
for you to press the brake and once it
does it's going to kick off the sensor
and pretty much complete the circuit and
then if you whenever we install install
the roll bar you can see that there are
little lights on the top pretty much
whenever you hit your brakes and the
brake lights come on that's what this is
very good now with that being said that
was all the information in
a little bit above the lemon right here
usually they have on the cylinder right
here symbols that will tell you which
one of these wires go where so I looked
at it and I notice that these you
probably can't see it on YouTube but the
symbols are actually in Chinese so I
don't know which one goes where to be
completely honest so I guess what I have
to do is pretty much just screw these in
a randomly unless they want to learn
Chinese or something
so I'm just going to go ahead and screw
these in randomly hey I got a 50-50 shot
at this and I just have to remember this
whenever the buggy's complete that if my
brake lights turn on then it means I
guessed right and if they aren't turning
on then I guess I have to reverse them
and whenever you're troubleshooting you
have to remember that as well common
mistake so now go ahead and tighten them
just like that and now this little
pressure-sensitive electric switch in
here can now recognize whenever you're
putting pressure on the brakes and it
says okay aside from you know moving the
fluid through the brake lines it says
okay now I'm going to kick off that
light in the back and brake lights
complete</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
