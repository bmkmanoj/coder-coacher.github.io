47th biology tutorial and in this video
I want to talk to you guys a little bit
more about cell division and also
something called interphase now in your
body your cells are busy doing one of
two things
first of all they could be doing their
normal you know daily routine for
example your stomach cells are breaking
down food your muscle cells are
contracting expanding moving your body
around let's say your brain cells are
sending signals to each other to you
know think communicate so every cell in
your body kind of has a daily routine
that does now when it isn't doing its
daily routine what it's doing is its
busy
dividing pretty much reproducing making
more of itself so the process or cycle
of cells doing their daily job or
dividing is called the cell cycle so the
very basics of the cell cycle are pretty
much two stages dividing or doing its
daily routine now cells actually divide
in one of two ways and of course the
rest of these tutorials are going to be
focused on the division part of the cell
cycle and those I'm changing my color
are mitosis and meiosis now there are a
few differences between mitosis and
meiosis and the first thing I'm gonna do
is talk to you guys about mitosis but
let me go ahead and give you guys a real
quick example of each now most of the
cells in your body and when I say month
most of the cells I mean your skin cells
your muscle cells you know your lung
cells what they what they do is pretty
much whenever they want to divide they
take the parent cell and they split that
parent cell splits in two so you end up
with two cells we'll call them a and B
identical to that original parent cell
so mitosis is pretty much a really
simple understanding of you know
cellular division whenever you think of
cells dividing you probably think of
mitosis it's the first thing that pops
in your head now meiosis this involves
sperm and egg cells of course you know
in human beings and it's the process
where these cells are reproduced or
produced now a thing to know is that
these cells have half of the genetic
information of the parent cell so
basically you know you can't just take a
sperm cell in an egg cell and have all
the information you need for a human
being to develop a sperm cell and in EXO
actually need to come together to form
all of the Jin of the genetic infinite
law can't talk today
the genetic information you need for
that parent so now again like I said I'm
gonna be talking about mitosis first
because I don't want to say that it's
the easier one understand but it's it's
a good starting point Before we jump
into meiosis but before I do that I want
to talk to you guys about interphase now
you know how I said that the cell cycle
was basically a very simple you know
explanation of this would be once cells
are dividing or once cells are busy
doing their daily routine well
interphase is actually what we call the
process when cells are not dividing so
whenever your stomach cell is just busy
you know doing its thing your muscle
cells are just you know not even
thinking about dividing it the nerve
cells in your body are just send
messages to each other not dividing at
all this is called interphase before a
cell is gonna divide it's experiencing
this process called interphase now a
couple things that we want to know is
interphase actually has three sub phases
and it's g1 s and g2 and you think in
our a well this interphase you said is
the process where cells really aren't
doing anything any division so how can I
have three you know sub phases well you
know first of all I didn't make these
phases I would just have interfaces one
phase but let me go ahead and explain g1
s and g2 the g1 phase is basically when
the cell is just growing or functioning
normally so you know you have a little
so when it grows to be a little bit
bigger and let me just go ahead and draw
the nucleus like this so this is
basically the g1 phase when the cell is
you know just growing or functioning
normal
so another cool thing to know is that
some cells remain in the g1 phase
forever some cells in your body actually
never get out of the g1 phase like nerve
cells okay
oh I mean my nerve cells gonna be a
really bad looking uh it's actually not
that bad so this would be you know an
example of a neuron or nerve cell pretty
bad look you know but uh nerve cells for
example whenever you hurt your back
that's why recovery from back injuries
and spinal injuries are so difficult
because the nerve cells in your body
don't reproduce like other cells so
since they don't exit the g1 interphase
stage that's why it's so hard to recover
from those a lot harder than it would be
if you know you scratched your skin or
broke a bone or something so that's what
the g1 phase is the S phase of
interphase is a little bit different now
we'll be talking more about chromatids
and chromosomes later on but it's pretty
much when you're so duplicates its DNA
forming two sister chromatids now again
we talked a little bit about DNA
replication earlier on but I'm gonna be
going over chromosomes and chromatids in
the next tutorial so for right now you
know just remember this is a stage where
a cell duplicates its DNA and it forms
two sister chromatids and if you guys
don't understand what it means then I'm
gonna be talking about that in the next
tutorial because you know it's more than
I would like to cover in this one the g2
face however is actually a little bit
actually it's a lot easier it's
basically after the cell is done
experiencing this S phase of it now it
has two sister chromatids what it does
is it pretty much resumes its growth and
you know it's pretty much getting ready
packing his bags getting ready to
experience cell division so like I said
interphase is not a part of cell
division it's kind of the opposite of
cell division you have two phases in the
in the cell cycle interphase and cell
division interphase is when the cell is
just going around going about its daily
routine and it's cell division we're
gonna be talking about in the upcoming
tutorials
so remember interphase when a cell is
just act
normal not dividing thank you guys for
watching and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
