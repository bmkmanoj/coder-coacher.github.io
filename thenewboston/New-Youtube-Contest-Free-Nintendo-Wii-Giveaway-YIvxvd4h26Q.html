welcome to the next YouTube contest now
the first thing I want to do before I
tell you guys about this contest is
congratulate Caprice 901 for winning the
ipod touch as you can see here we had a
little problem with that contest what
happened was the view counter i said i
would give the ipod touch away at a
hundred thousand views and the view
counter actually stopped at sixty
seventy six thousand so it broke so I
needed the new set of rules or else the
contest would never win so I gave it
away last night at nine o'clock to the
first comment I saw so congratulations
Caprice 901 I think that's your name oh
yeah I've gotten in contact with your
already and I will be mailing you your
free ipod touch tomorrow actually so now
for what you guys been waiting for the
next contest and if you guys haven't
peaked already it is a brand new
nintendo wii let's see if i can get
blurred up a wee so if you guys want to
win this here's what you need to do it's
real easy the first and only criteria
that you need to be eligible for is to
be a subscriber so if you're not
subscribed already just go click that
little yellow box right there or it's
like right there or something and once
you click that you're able to be
eligible for the video or refer to
contests art next once your subscriber
wait until this video hits a hundred
thousand views once this video hits a
hundred thousand views i'm going to look
at a oh sorry got whooping cough i'm
going to look at the video in the most
recent comment i see is the winner so it
probably won't be right at a hundred
thousand it's probably going to be like
it um 105 or 102 that's what the last
ones right but as soon as this video
hits a hundred thousand i'm going to
look as soon as I can so as soon as in
his arms a thousand what you need to do
is subscribe and start commenting
comments in commenting spamming leave as
many comments as you can doesn't matter
what they say but the most recent one i
see when it hits a hundred thousand
views is the winner and that's all you
have to do to win a brand new nintendo
wii so it was the same rules as before
if there are any different rules that i
can think of i'm just going to post them
under the description box so i guess
that's all i have to say again promote
this video wait until hits 100,000 views
look under the description for all the
rules or you can send me a message did
not tell you so congratulations good
luck and have fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
