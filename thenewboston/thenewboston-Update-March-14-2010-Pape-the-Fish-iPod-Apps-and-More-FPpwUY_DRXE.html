you
what is up guys it is Bucky and welcome
to another wonderful update of my
channel um I think I'm going to be doing
this every week now so get used to it
the first update is I got a guitar this
weekend and I already learned three
chords so maybe this will be a little
musical update I haven't decided yet but
um other big news in my life also got a
fish his name is pop a
my sister named him and I think he's the
coolest fishing world sweet little poppy
on other news i also bought an apple
which is a mac I mean and I did this
because I want to start making iPhone
and iPod Touch apps and you actually
need a mac to do this so that's why I
did it I apologize guys if you're not
into max but in the months to come i'm
going to start teaching a language
called objective-c and that's the
language that you need to know in order
to make things on the mac and also if
you want to program on the ipod touch
and make apps so i'm going to take you
from learning nothing to learning how to
create awesome apps on the iphone and
ipod touch in about a month so I already
looked on YouTube for other sorrows and
they all suck I mean they're really bad
so I'm going to give you guys the best
tutorials you guys have ever seen
probably a couple hundred of them so you
guys are in for a treat if you guys want
to learn how to make apps and games on
the ipod and iphone
the song doesn't really rhyme or have
any rhythm but anyways um if you guys
been wondering here's the update for my
head it is healing nicely thank you guys
for caring um also I have two people
working with me right now one of them is
named Cole and he does my dreamweaver
tutorial cs4 and one of them is named
kyle and he's the one who's been doing
all my gameplay for modern warfare 2
mostly and the weeks to come we're going
to be doing probably next week we're
going to be putting up a lot of
battlefield bad company 2 and also some
modern warfare two most likely so uh
just study you guys know what's going on
that isn't me in those tutorials they're
just helping me out but uh if I get you
know come frisky I may put some
battlefield because that game is awesome
Oh sir and lastly um a lot of you guys
messaged me not recently but like over
the course of my entire channel and
you're like how can I help out this
channel or you just leave i can say say
something really nice and say how can I
help and I thought of three ways to
answer your guys's questions the first
one is thru stumbleupon now stumbleupon
is a website it's that has a browser
add-on and what you can do is write web
sites in the higher you rated the more
people come to it so you can even do the
city of a website every room but if you
want to do this go to stumbleupon com
and you download you have to make an
account of course and you download the
tool bar and what this does is it allows
you to rate websites thumbs up or thumbs
down just write my videos the ones you
like even the ones you don't like if you
want a thumbs up and then it'll get more
people to check out my video so if you
do that it'll be huge help to me so
thank you to whoever decides to do that
next is dig di GG com this is a site
where you can submit sites pretty much
submit a link to a cool site or a cool
picture or cool video and then other
people can check it out so if you have
an account on digg i would suggest
either submitting my videos or digging
my video which means like reading it a
thumbs up so you know that would be a
big help too and lastly something really
simple you guys can do if you want I
mean I'm not forcing any guys who do
this but you can set one my videos
whatever one you like say if you like my
job tutorials set one my Jeff tutorials
as the video for your homepage you can
do that on your channel you can set
other people's videos as your feature
video and I'll show you how to do that
or leave a description in the right hand
side or something but uh that's all I
have to talk about really so thank you
guys for watching my channel in another
thing I have like 3,000 more subscribers
ago and then I'm on the most subscribed
list of all time for gurus for gurus gu
r us so I'm so
excited about that I think I might like
42,000 right now and I need to get to
like 45 or 46 thousand to be on the
all-time most subscribed gurus and I'm
going to be so happy once I get there
and it's thanks to you guys so if you
help me out with my channel I will
continue to keep getting more people to
help me keep putting out better quality
and more tutorials and you know keep
having the best and most important free
tutorials I will never charge a thing
for any of my tutorials and as you know
they exceed any other tutorials on
YouTube um so thank you guys for
watching thank you so much for
subscribing and supporting my channel
and I'm gonna practice guitar and
probably not hang out with Poppy go for
a walk or something and uh yeah that's
it so thank you guys again thank you for
subscribing and I will see you next week
maybe next time maybe next month
sometime</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
