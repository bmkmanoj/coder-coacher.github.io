and now that we got the basic styling
done what we can do is we can style
these individual buttons and this is
actually incredibly easy so what we want
to do now is give you some make sure you
guys can see this all right footer menu
li hover and I actually probably could
have just copied that and I will so
basically whenever you're hovering a
button which means that the drop up
appears what you want to do now is we
want to work on the styling of those
individual list items so basically
whenever you hover over it these
individual sections calculator group
chat image editor that's where we're
going to be styling those are the list
items inside the buttons pretty cool huh
so the first thing we want to do is do
some basic make sure they don't look
weird so float none make sure they don't
like you know drift off to the right or
anything background is none and this is
just because we don't want it to inherit
the properties of these list items which
are buttons remember all of these are
floating to the left so in case it
inherits that we don't want that to
happen now for the border as you notice
each of these items right here there's a
little black line separating um you know
calculator from group chat so on and so
forth and to make that little black line
we're going to steal the same effect
that we use for this the first thing we
want to do is we want to set not broader
border okay move my freaking cursor
border equal to none so now they have no
border at all however we do want that
black line so we actually only want a
border on the bottom so for the border
bottom we can just have you know one
pixel solid and who might as well just
use this you can either make it black or
you know whatever color you want so one
pixel solid dark gray or black pretty
much now if I just ran this program like
this
what would happen is these would be very
bunched together and it would pretty
much look like you know text like this
you see how this text on this line in
this line are very close to each other
however on this you have a little
padding above and below it and also to
the left of it you want that because you
don't want your text but it up right up
against the left-hand side so for this
we just add some padding and the padding
for this is 12 pixels 10 pixels 12
pixels 10 pixels and I want to make I
don't want to do the shorthand of this
because if you guys want to adjust you
know maybe you want them to be bunched
together or spread apart more to look
like individual items then go ahead and
adjust your padding accordingly but this
is how I have mine set up I think it
looks pretty good so that is all you
need to style the drop menu for this
program so this programs bun is now
perfectly styled like I said it's
basically remember this programs button
is a list item it's basically an entire
list within a drop menu that's all we're
going to do in the HTML now the next
thing I want to do is I want to style
what we're going to be working on is
we're going to be working on styling
these things right here they drop up for
the account profile in the two column
layout now again like I said it's a
little bit different than this because
what i did is i'm going to show you guys
how to make a one column layout which
you can see right here on account two
column layout so if you want to have two
columns like one right here and one
right here or three column layout where
you have one two three now any thing you
need more than a three common let
three-column layout you might as well go
ahead and make a freakin web page
because you know this right here it's a
navigation menu above everything you
don't want to put a ton of content in
your navigation menu if so you might as
well just stick it in a freaking web
page so three columns max you are not
allowed to make anything more than three
column so what we want to do before we
start styling all the drop ups and
making them appear like this is we just
want to add some
overall basic styling now the very first
thing we want to do is style the links
now the link color we want them to be as
you can see we want them to be kind of a
dark gray so the reason that we want to
do this is because whenever they're gray
and we hover over them we can turn them
to white and it look like the links are
glowing so as you can see make the
default links gray and then when you
hover over them it will look like it's
glowing it and it gives you a really
cool interactive effects so let's go
ahead and add a comment first um drop up
default links so that's where we're
going to be styling right now and this
is actually really easy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
