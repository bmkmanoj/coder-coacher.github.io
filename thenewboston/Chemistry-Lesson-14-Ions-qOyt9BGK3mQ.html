fourteenth chemistry tutorial and in
this tutorial I'm going to be talking to
you guys about something called ions now
ions the definition of it is whenever
you have an element that has a different
number of protons than electrons pretty
weird huh so let's go ahead and take a
look at a quick example let me go ahead
and draw a really simple element of
hydrogen so hydrogen in the nucleus has
a proton which has a positive charge and
typically in Neutron which has a
negative excuse me zero charge or no
charge and also around it in the first
energy level it usually has one electron
now remember that electron has a
negative charge so if we take a look at
this element we have one negative charge
and we have a positive charge and they
are going to cancel each other out so we
say that this hydrogen atom would have
zero charge or in other words some
people call it neutral or no charge they
all mean the same thing however
sometimes chemical reactions can either
take away this electron or they can
cause it to have an additional electron
whenever you have an element that has a
different number of protons than
electrons then look at this it has more
negative charges than positive charges
and we call this this would be a
negatively charged let me write this
down a negatively charged element in
other words in ion so remember atoms
that have different numbers of protons
then electrons are charged particles and
those are called
ions so again the definition of an ion
is a charged particle basically so let
me go ahead and show you a graph from
one of my favorite websites Wikipedia
maybe this will do a little better job
explaining so in this example we have a
typical neutral element hydrogen it has
one proton in here and one electron now
the proton is positively charged and the
electron is negatively charged so
they're going to go ahead and cancel
each other out and that's why it says
that
this one is neutral in other words not
anion it has no charge however if we
took this one this neutral hydrogen and
stripped away the electron then it would
just be one positively charged proton in
there whenever we have an ion that's
positively charged we're basically
saying this element has more protons
than electrons we call those cations
cations one last time
our positively charged elements they
have more protons than electrons the
opposite of that would be something
called
anions anions are negatively charged
elements in other words if you count up
all the electrons there would be greater
than the number of protons so we have
two negative charges right here and only
one positive charge so that is why
overall we have negative one for the
charge and again that's called an anion
and some people remember this because if
you look at an it has n which is
negative in cat I don't know if you
think cats are positive or something I
don't know you can have your own little
silly role to remember that but anions I
always remember because the N is
negative so one last time cations have
more protons than electrons and anions
have more electrons than protons to have
overall negative charge so now that we
understand valence electrons and
isotopes and ions cations anions we can
finally go ahead and move on to the
periodic table and that is going to be
awesome and I have this awesome website
which has the best periodic table on the
internet can't wait to show you guys so
anyways thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe and you have
any questions go ahead to my website the
new Boston comm and there's a forum on
there you can ask me any questions you
want there so for now thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
oh yeah add me on Google+ see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
