slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
talking about infinite loops now you're
not going to be learning any code in
this tutorial I'm just going to be
teaching you about something that is
somewhat common and something that you
need to stay away from when you're
programming so let's go ahead and create
a new project make sure you have
selected console application and we will
just call this infinite loops now we
will go ahead and click OK now let's
zoom in some here okay so basically what
an infinite loop is is it's a loop
that's going to run forever and it's
never going to stop now I'll go ahead
and show you an example of an infinite
loop so we can go ahead and declare a
variable right here dim num1 as integer
and we'll set it equal to 10 now we're
not actually going to use that right now
but I will show you a different example
of a an infinite loop so we'll just type
do and we're just going to loop while
true so basically what this means is
that it's going to loop forever because
it's always true there's no variable
right here there's nothing that could
possibly equal false it's always going
to equal true and by it I don't it's
just there's nothing specified so it's
always going to be true it's going to
loop forever now that might be a little
confusing but it's just for the sake of
an example so just to console dot write
line let's just do on live gamer and now
if we go ahead and run this you can see
that it prints on live game over and
over and over again now you can see that
it doesn't look like there's anything
wrong with my program it's running
actually quite smoothly and fast but
that is all thanks to the dotnet garbage
collector now basically what the dotnet
garbage collector does is it cleans up
old resource
is that you aren't using anymore in your
program and it keeps it running smoothly
and it keeps it from Hawking all of your
computer's resources and it's doing a
very good job of cleaning up all the
stuff left behind by this infinite loop
and it's not going to crash the program
but in languages for example like Java
if you create an infinite loop it's just
going to go ahead and crash your program
almost instantly now let's go ahead and
close out of this and I'll show you a
more real-life example of something that
you might run into when you're
programming so we'll just go ahead and
loop while num 1 is greater than 5 let's
go ahead and take out this comment right
here so that num 1 is actually declared
and if we go ahead and run this you can
see that it loops forever because num 1
is always going to be greater than 5
because we didn't increment num 1 during
the iterations of the do-while loop so
you can see it's just going to run
forever and ever and ever and it's not
going to stop now we can also just take
this statement right here and move it
back up here at the top and it will
still create a an infinite loop and it's
just going to loop forever
so thanks for watching guys you didn't
learn very much programming in this
tutorial actually none at all but this
was something that I really wanted to
cover in a video and it's something that
you'll probably run into quite often and
you probably already have and you didn't
know what was going on so on go ahead
and move on to the next tutorial and
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
