video and on this video I want to touch
real quick on a subject called leading
and lagging strands of DNA now actually
the subject can take like five different
videos but I just want to give you guys
a real basic overview just because if I
skip over it people are probably gonna
you know get mad that I didn't touch on
it so let me go ahead and give you guys
a real skinny on this so basically
whenever your original DNA or your
parent strand unzips the two strands
aren't identical to each other at first
they will be in the future but at first
let's go ahead and take a note of what's
going on remember that we said you know
according to the base pairing rules that
a always pairs with T and C always pairs
with G well this would mean as soon as
they split that we would have our a and
our C over here in our T and our G over
here so basically as soon as this
original parent strand splits we have
two little strands that are
complementary to each other or sometimes
I call them offset but technically
they're called complementary so even
though what's going to end up happening
is this T is gonna go up here with the G
and we already know that T is always
gonna pair with a a and G is always
going to pair with a C so this strand
right here is gonna be just like the
parent and also remember this a and C
over here well this a and C over here
are gonna get paired with another T and
another G so you're like you know what
even though it's splits and they're not
identical at first you're gonna end up
with two strands of DNA identical to the
original string easy enough so what's
really the problem here well for me to
teach it like this it's very easy but
for DNA polymerase it isn't that easy
because and again this is where I want
to mention you know forewarning I could
teach DNA polymerase just this enzyme
for like five different tutorials and
probably not have everything covered so
I just want to give you guys a real
quick overview of whenever DNA
polymerase which was you know the enzyme
that's responsible for laying down that
permanent DNA whenever it lines up the
nucleotides to make
DNA it just can't line them up in any
old fashion needs to line up the
nucleotides in a very specific in
certain way now how this works again is
beyond the scope I suggest you read up
on DNA polymerase if you want to get
more involved but just remember the
overview of DNA polymerase needs the
line up the nucleotides in a certain way
to make DNA so that's why you have one
side that looks different than the other
side because the two strands aren't
identical and this can create some
problems for DNA polymerase so whenever
your original parent strand unzips it's
going to split in two strands obviously
we know that already now the piece
that's going to be one continuous piece
right here is going to be called the
leading strand so le a di and G now if
you were to look at DNA under a
microscope you're gonna see that one
side of the DNA is gonna grow in a
continuous strand this is called the
leading strand and another side of the
DNA is gonna be called the lagging
because unlike the leading strand this
is actually going to grow in chunks or
fragments so again the side that is one
continuous strain is called leading the
side that grows in chunks or fragments
is called lagging now basically what
happens is once the DNA polymerase is
done making these fragments the DNA
ligase right over here that's where I
said that whenever you have breaks it
comes and puts them together with
covalent bonds well that's what it does
it pretty much takes all those chunks
and bonds them together now I know this
is kind of confusing because I drew the
DNA ligase over here and this is the
leading strand but I just drew over
there as a demonstration because I was
running out of room on the right hand
side but actually this DNA ligase enzyme
would be over here you know if this were
a proper diagram and what it would do is
it would be putting together these
pieces or these chunks using covalent
bonds so one last time what happens is
whenever your original parent strand of
DNA splits you have two strands that are
complementary one is the leading strand
that grows in one continuous piece in
the
is the lagging strand and this grows in
chunks or fragments and whenever we have
our fragments the DNA ligase is going to
come with covalent bonds and put them
together so I know this can get kind of
confusing in DNA replication is actually
pretty confusing but pat yourself on the
back because we're done with it for now
we're gonna move on to something you
know a little more easier to understand
something you guys for watching and by
the way before I let you go I want to
mention that if you don't really
understand DNA polymerase and exactly
what I talked about in this tutorial
don't really worry about it because you
can understand the rest of cell division
perfectly without it this gets into more
the more advanced stuff we really didn't
need to make this tutorial but now you
have extra knowledge congratulations
so anyways I'm rambling I'm gonna go
grab some hot pockets I'll see you guys
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
