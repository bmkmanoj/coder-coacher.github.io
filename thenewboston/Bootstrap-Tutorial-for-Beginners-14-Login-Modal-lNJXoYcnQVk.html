to tell you that I watched X mashina
or X Moschino last night whatever it's
called and uh was not as good as I
expected I heard really good things
about it but um I don't know kind of
boring for me but whatever moving on in
this video I'm gonna make an even better
AI a pop-up window so yeah not as a
smart is the one in the window but hey
we're getting there alright so I know
you guys are thinking whenever you hear
pop-up windows oh I hate pop-up windows
because I hate writing JavaScript I
don't know why I thought you talk like
that but hey I do too now the cool thing
about bootstrap is whenever you make
these modal's and that's just what they
call a pop-up window so you know if I
say one I actually mean the other the
cool thing about it is it's all packaged
together and we don't have to write any
JavaScript at all so in this example
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna have a
regular web page with a button on it and
whenever these are clicks that button
it's just gonna have a pop-up here that
you know they can use like is a login
form or you know whatever pop-up you
want so it's going to be sounds like a
lot of work but you know it's actually
pretty easy so I'll say like a login the
demo just has a title and let me just go
ahead and add the button on our main
site and that's it so the button will of
course say it's type button and let's
say like a login say open login window
and also on this button we need to add a
couple more attributes to it the first
one is just for look so button which
makes it look like a button and button
success that just makes it green um in
the next one two more data toggle this
says that we're using it to toggle on a
model or modal well however the heck you
pronounce it that just means that we're
going to use it to open up a pop-up
window that's it now the other thing we
need is data target so we can actually
have a bunch of different modal's on our
website
and this is how it knows okay what model
are you trying to open so if we have
like five different ones we'll give the
one we're looking for pop-up window and
of course since we need to target it by
ID at that little hash or number sign
right in front of the name so now we
actually have to make that modal so div
and this is the easy part so that was
actually the hard part believe it or not
even though that was incredibly easy so
we're going to make a div and it's just
going to be a modal which means we're
making a pop-up window
now just say add some cool fade class to
it so it doesn't just pop up it kind of
looks like it's fading in and we also
need to give it the ID of pop-up window
so you can actually give it an ID of
anything you want you can give it an ID
of a tunafish just make sure that your
target is targeting this window so it
knows which one to pop up now inside
here the first thing we're going to do
is we're going to make a class model
dialog I don't know why I like some of
this stuff pops up like um like bun
success but some of this other stuff
doesn't it's kind of I don't know gets
me confused sometimes drag is this thing
gonna pop up this time or not
alright so the first thing we need is
this div right here I say first but you
know what's this like the a thing we did
and this just means a dialogue is
another word for a pop-up I don't know
why they have so many different names or
you can call it modal a dialog or a
pop-up get your crap together bootstrap
but whatevs
alright next div inside here we're
saying that we actually want to put some
content in this pop-up now a cool thing
that we can do later on is if we use the
class moral content then we can actually
add a couple different pieces a header a
body and a footer so instead of just you
know having a bunch of crap spewed
inside our pop-up window we can actually
break it up into a nice organized
structure so let me actually add three
comments so we can build the
later on so we'll build the header first
and this will just be the top we usually
put the title in here and maybe a close
button on the side so the user can press
X and close out of it now in the body is
where your main crap is so like the
input where the user can type basically
the form and this last one will just be
the footer for the button so it will
just be a say submit or login whatever
you want your button to say so for the
header the class for this is model
header model modal model modal what one
is it I don't know alright so the header
the second one is going to be the body
and this last one is going to be the
footer now inside here you pretty much
just stick on crap inside like you would
expect nothing really bootstrap you're
tough to figure out so the first thing
I'm going to do is actually add a close
button so if the user accidentally
clicks the button by accent they can
click a little X to close out of it so
button and inside here I'm going to
write in per sign x um : so this x just
means X so like your I guess they have
it so if you're like timesing numbers
together or multiplying numbers but
that's how you get an X in the user
knows when everybody click X means close
now the type of this is a button and
also the class close that actually is a
bootstrap class and data dismiss motto
so I guess there was kind of bootstrap
II stuff in here I lied but what this is
saying is we're making a button style it
like a close button and also whenever
the user clicks it dismiss in other
words get rid of this pop-up window
alright now the next thing we need to do
is just build embarrassing embarrassing
all right a really basic form and this
is just going to have I'm not going to
really make it do anything just going to
put it so we have something to look at
real quick so the role for this
it's form and whenever you add form
elements what you do is you add them
inside the div and I'll just put class
form group so what you put inside a form
group is any single element like a text
area an input field a checkbox may be a
radial buttons group whatever but that's
all you do
make sure you surround it with a form
group so bootstrap knows how to handle
it so for this I'm just going to make
type email I'll say like email and
password so class form control and place
holder it'll just say email now a
placeholder if you don't know you can
style your forms in two different ways
you can either have a label on the left
hand side and then just your input on
the right or you can have some light
grey text inside your form
so since I'm too lazy to make a label on
the Left I'm just going to add you know
a little indicator bit of text inside
that input so now I can just copy this
since I'm lazy what am I trying to copy
here what are you doing Bucky alright so
form group and that'd be good so this
one we password so whenever you make it
a type password it just shows those
little asterisks or dots and doesn't
actually display their password in plain
text this is a form control and we'll
just write password in here all right so
that's the body not off you know I don't
really feel like doing anything else to
it keep this really simple and the last
thing we need to do is just make a login
button
so button login and we'll just say like
a class what was our first one success
so say that this is primary so whenever
you see the word success it means green
whenever you see primary it means blue
you can override these by default but I
kind of like the default colors and
we'll make a blum blum block button
block to make the tomahto whatever
don't judge me all right
and uh yeah that's it so let's go ahead
and run this and that is not running it
that's my profile and check it out art
so this is our original button and
whenever we click it our modal pops up
and I forgot to add up look in h3 or h2
and class model title and I'll just put
like a login she let me change that h3
got a thing for h3 s not sure why but I
do
and you see that that didn't have the
title that's just what I did right there
so now we have model title
this was the little dismiss Times button
I was talking about and you see that we
have a bit of placeholder text right
here instead of like a little label on
the left-hand side and since I added it
a block styling to this button right
here it doesn't appear as a small button
block means pretty much sure you like a
block take up the entire width and yeah
there you go so user can type in their
email password close out of here or they
can do whatever they want login and boom
they're golden so that's how you make
pop-up windows aka models aka whatever
the heck they feel like own them this
week thanks for watching see you next
