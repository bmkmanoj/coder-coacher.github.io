video and in this tutorial what I want
to do is I want to show you guys how to
create a really basic app so we're not
going to be talking about anything in
detail really but what I want to do like
I said is I just want to show you guys a
quick tour of the interface show you
guys how to set up a really basic
project and then later on when we talk
about everything in detail you won't be
confused and you'll be able to follow
along really easy so pop open Xcode and
the first thing that we need to do is we
need to create a new Xcode project
so whatever iOS app you're making
whether it's for the iPhone the iPod
Touch or the iPad you always want to
create a new Xcode project so click that
and let me read just my windows so you
guys can see it and by the way this
screen recorder on a Mac I can't tell
where my borders are because whenever I
am using the software on Windows it has
a nice little green outline so hopefully
you guys can see this because if this is
out of you and I have to record this
tutorial again I'm probably going to
dropkick my computer so anyways the
first thing we have to do is we need to
choose a template for the project so on
the left hand side we can see okay do we
want I oh s or OS 10 and this is okay do
you want to make software for the iOS or
just your desktop just the Mac well of
course this is Oreo series is for iPhone
iPad development so click I oh s and
we're just making a really basic app a
really basic application so now we have
to choose okay what's the overall
structure what's the overall navigation
for it and later on when we talk about
the different types of navigation this
is going to make a lot more sense but
for right now we just want to create a
single view application and this is just
a really basic app with one screen
nothing fancy so that's what we're going
to be doing and if we click Next
right now what it says is okay so that's
what you want to do so give me some
details about it the first thing is the
product name which is essentially the
name of your app so I'm just going to
name my
like sample you guys hear that so I got
a little oh now that I trying to get you
guys to hear it's not making any noise
but my chair is randomly like squeaking
it's kind of annoying me have to spray
with some wd-40 or something later
alright so your app name is just
whatever you want to name it of course
if you're actually making an app to put
in the App Store you're going to want to
name it something not idiotic like
sample but for right now sample will be
fine now the organization is pretty much
the name of your company or just your
name if you're making an app under your
personal arm company or whatever so
whenever you put this in the App Store
it's going to say like sample by the new
boss then whatever so that's what that
is
now your organization identifier is
usually your website and reverse domain
notation and this is just standard
practice among app developers so my
website is the new Boston comm so
whenever I want to identify myself in my
organization I'm going to use comm dot
the new Boston it kind of looks weird at
first but I don't know that's what you
do so why do you do this well whenever I
put this app in the App Store this is
probably going to be like a really
popular the greatest app ever made
however there are already a bunch of
apps named sample well what if I change
this name to photo editor well there's
probably already like a thousand photo
editors in the App Store but there's
only one comm dot the New Boston sample
so it's just a way that Apple and the
App Store can identify your app from
everyone else's and uh yeah that's a
quick little tutorial on that now it
says ok what language are you going to
use well objective-c that is the old
language we want to stick with Swift the
programming language of iOS future and
for devices I'm just going to go with
iPhone for right now if you guys are
like you know what it probably better if
you just choose Universal because you
know
it sounds like able to run on every
device well Universal involves a little
bit more code to make it compatible with
every device so right now just starting
out just choose iPhone it will be really
simple and along with this core data
make sure that is not checked and this
is kind of detailed later on I'll
explain it later when we get into more
detail stuff right now we're only
worried about the basic stuff so hit
next and okay where do you want to save
this project now it doesn't really
matter where you save it doesn't need be
in any special directory or anything so
you can put it anywhere on your computer
I already have a folder called iOS
projects that I'm going to be storing
all my projects in and another thing I
want to make sure is make sure that you
have this unchecked now later on I'm
going to be talking to you about source
control and version control and how to
use git in SVN but for right now it's an
extra step that we don't really need so
uncheck that we won't have to worry
about it and click create</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
