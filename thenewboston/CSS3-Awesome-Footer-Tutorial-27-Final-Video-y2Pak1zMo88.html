going to display when you hover over it
so if you wrote tuna baby when you hover
it over it it would say tuna baby
however we want some cool little you
know the users icon in their name and
also a little blurb of what they did to
display so this is how you do that again
it only takes three HTML tags very
simple and let me show you guys how to
style this so instead of tuna baby the
first thing we want is the users icon so
as you can see I just have a default
profile picture so that's what we're
gonna be making right now so of course
the image and the source would equal
like default profile dot you know JPEG
or something now for the style we need
to style this individually in I do this
because I didn't add a class for this
but you guys can if you want to because
this is gonna be different for
everyone's website the first thing we
want to do is float it to the left now
we do this because if you notice we
don't want the picture to display and
then the text the display underneath it
we want it to display to the left of the
text so this is how we do that float it
to the left then the next thing we want
to do is set the width of the image now
by default the profile pictures on my
website are like 250 pixels wide and of
course that's really frickin wide so we
only want to set the width to like you
know 24
oh great got the hiccups great time like
24 pixels and the last thing we want to
do is we want to add a margin right of
about 5 pixels and you want to make sure
to do this because if you don't the text
for example the names Emily may Lisa
spits in John matters are going to be
butted right up against the picture and
it's gonna look really weird so if you
add a margin right of 5 pixels then it
gives it a little bit of padding I don't
want to say padding because that's
something else but it gives it a little
space now that is the only thing we need
to do with the users little image the
next thing we need to do is display the
user's name
so we actually put that in a div and
this is how I style my div I'll just put
the user's name like Emily May I think
that's what I called her
now the div style for this is just
display inline and that make sure again
that's not a block level element the
color for mine is my favorite color
CC zero zero zero zero that's that cool
red and the last thing is
font-weight:bold so that makes the
user's name dark red and also make sure
that it displays to the right hand side
instead of under the picture whenever
you do display inline and now all you
need to do is write something like Emily
may liked your image or will say likes
your post and for you post you could
write something like my name is Bucky
this is a post whatever and what this
would do is it would just add the text
across from Emily may like your post
what is your favorite book of all time
now clearly we have three different ones
of these and I can just go ahead and
copy and paste at three different times
but if I do that then I wouldn't get
that line separating Emily Mae Emily
Mae's notification from Lisa's
notification from John in order to Det
to do that I order Wow take a deep
breath Bucky come the Frick down and get
this done because it's the last video
you can do it we're talking to yourself
you're recording a video okay you need a
horizontal rule or basically a
horizontal line now to do this in
between each of these people which have
an image in a little notification right
now you need a horizontal rule and the
style for this is it going to be border
none' now I want to show you guys how to
do this because this is a thing that
bothered me for a long time because it's
kind of hard to figure out if you're
just working with horizontal rules
your browser gives them all a default
border and it's really annoying because
it's really dumb looking in my opinion
so the first thing you want to do is you
want to set the border to none
what this makes is essentially an
invisible horizontal rule so why would
you want an invisible horizontal rule
because then you can control it easier
than messing around with the default
values so once it's invisible say border
bottom is the only thing that we want to
work with so it's gonna be one pixel
solid 7 7 7 7 7 7 so now we have a 1
pixel solid horizontal line that
separates each of these users so now
what you want to do is just copy this
for each notification and again you
would do this in a PHP depending on how
many notifications you have or whatever
language that you're working with but
for right now I just want to show you
guys that this is how you create
multiple notifications and also I like
whenever I'm developing this that I
don't like the horizontal rule on the
last one because you know if you have
three items then you only need two rules
but um some people like on the very last
one but make sure in your code that you
get rid of the horizontal rule if you
have the same taste as me on your last
notification blur so again this is how
you create the notification section make
sure it's outside your other unordered
list and each of the images is its own
list item and if you want a special
notification that makes text up here
whenever you hover over it or the user
hovers over it then add the span in
between the link and that will make you
one of the greatest web developers of
all time so thank you guys for watching
and don't forget check out this pretty
much if you want any of the source code
then go ahead and download it link below
tnb forum comm also check out the new
awesome open-source social network that
I'm developing buckey's room comm is
going to be amazing it's a social
network that we're all working on
and building together as a sweet
community and well thank you guys for
watching thank you for watching my
videos don't forget to subscribe and I
