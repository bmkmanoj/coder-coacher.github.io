biology tutorial and in this video I
want to talk to you guys about the
endoplasmic reticulum and that actually
is a very long word to write and also to
spell so from now on I'm just going to
call it the ER and if you're like Bucky
you're just lazy that's not going to
help me remember it at all actually
biologists refer to is the ER a lot for
the reasons that I just told you guys
it's long to spell and say so let's go
ahead and talk about what exactly is the
ER well the ER is basically a series of
canals that connects the nucleus to the
cytoplasm so let's go ahead and draw the
cell sweet-looking cell as usual and
here's the nucleus right here looks like
a loaf of bread no big deal and let me
just go ahead and Oh might as well just
label the cytoplasm so and we'll go
ahead and draw the ER is this color
right here so it looks something like
this
okay that's some nice looking and a
plasmic reticulum right there and I'm
actually going to draw another thing in
another color and I'll explain to you
guys what this is later on alright so
there's some ER for you and on part of
the ER we have these dots now these dots
are actually ribosomes and I'll explain
you guys the difference of why there are
ibis owns on some part and why there are
not ribosomes on the other part in just
a second alright so what color do I want
to write with and this color looks
pretty good alright so as you can see
this entire thing right here is the
entire endoplasmic reticulum but there
are clearly two different parts there
are parts that are covered in ribosomes
and this is called the rough endoplasmic
reticulum or rough ER and this other
part that obviously isn't covered in
ribosomes is called the smooth
er now let's go ahead and talk a little
bit about the different types of er
rough ER and smooth ER first of all the
part well I already told you guys that
the part without this part right here is
a smooth ER so remember I'm going to be
talking about this part right now the
rough ER and basically we already know
that revs ohms on the rough ER just like
any other ribosomes they make proteins
but they just don't make any proteins
the proteins that are made on the rough
ER always end up in either your cell
membrane so maybe there's a protein
right here protein right there or
outside yourself and they just don't
chill outside yourself what I mean to
whenever they end up outside the cell I
mean they get sent to other parts of
your body they go through your
bloodstream into wherever they're needed
in your body so here's a protein here's
a protein and they always come from the
rough ER so remember one more time
whenever a protein gets made on the
rough ER it ends up either in your cell
membrane or to other parts of the body
now I say that because you also have
other ribosomes in your cell and I guess
I'm drawing my ribosomes in blue now
some ribosomes are stuck on the rough ER
that's actually why it's called the
rough ER and some ribosomes are
free-floating around your cytoplasm so
free-floating here here in here now
whenever you have a ribosome that's free
floating in your cytoplasm they of
course make proteins too but they make
the proteins that are used inside
yourself because every cell needs to use
proteins for a variety of different
reasons so they make of these proteins
right here so remember we already know
that ribosomes are involved in the
creation of proteins the ribosomes on
the rough ER make proteins for your cell
membrane and for other parts of your
body and the proteins that are made that
your cell uses are made by free-floating
ribosomes the ones that just float
around your cell and aren't stuck to the
rough ER simple enough now let's go
ahead and talk about the smooth ER this
part the part of the ER that isn't
covered in ribosomes
well the smooth ER is basically
responsible it helps in the creation of
lipids which we just know that's a nice
name for fats kind of like we have
overweight but you know it's really fat
no matter if you want to cut not to
sound meter anything but they also
assist not you know overweight people
but the smoothie are also assists in the
creation and storage of steroids so
again a much different test in the rough
ER the smooth ER is responsible for the
creation of fat and also the creation
and storage of steroids now proteins and
the fats that are made in the ER the
entire ER I'm not just talking about one
anymore what happens when they're done
is they get packaged up into something
called transport vesicles so transport
vesicles so the proteins which I guess
are white and the lipids I'll go ahead
and draw those white to whenever they're
created they get packaged up into these
transport vesicles and I'll draw them is
yellow go ahead and label those and what
happens after that is they get carried
from the ER to something called the
Golgi apparatus now the Golgi apparatus
is a whole nother organelle that we're
going to be talking about in the next
soro but I just want to explain to you
guys that this is what happens whenever
proteins and fats are done being created
so just remember that the ER the
endoplasmic reticulum is like a
warehouse or you can kind of think of it
as a manufacturing plant because it's
job is to first of all create proteins
and lipids so it creates something and
then it ships them out to something
called the Golgi apparatus and we're
going to be talking about that in the
next video but for now thank you guys
for watching and I'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
