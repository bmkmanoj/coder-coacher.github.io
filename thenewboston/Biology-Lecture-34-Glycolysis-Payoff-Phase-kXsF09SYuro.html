tutorial in glycolysis and this is
harder we're gonna be finishing it up
going through steps 7 to 10 10 is of
course the last step in glycolysis and
the good thing is these are actually
pretty simple steps unlike you know step
number 6 which is pretty confusing so
let's go ahead and start with step 7 and
remember whenever we left off in the
last tutorial we left off with a
molecule called C 3 H 4 o 4 P 2 now in
this step we use another enzyme again I
don't really need to draw these enzymes
or you may have to remember the enzymes
for a test or something but just
remember that all of the reactions in
this process happen through an enzyme so
even though I may not draw it sometimes
there's always enzymes that work here so
in step number seven it's no different
we use an enzyme and this enzyme is
called phospho glyceryl kinase and what
this does is it takes this molecule
right here and it plucks off a phosphate
from it and adds it to a D P now this
ADP is just a molecule that's floating
around the cell ADP and remember
whenever we add a phosphate from this
molecule to a DP whenever we add a
phosphate to ADP which is two phosphates
we end up with a T P
now remember ATP is what we use for
energy in the cell so this is the very
first step where we generate in a teepee
so finally we started making some energy
here in step number seven took us long
enough but we finally started doing them
so remember that since I'm showing this
chemical reaction we produce one ATP but
actually we have two of these molecules
remember so we're actually producing a
net value of two a tee pees now also
remember that whenever we went over
steps one through three in the first
glycolysis video we invested to a tee
pees in steps one two three just to get
the process of glycolysis going and now
in step number set
and we created two atps with these two
molecules so right now we pretty much
broke even we're a net value of zero
because we invested two to get it going
and we just created two so pretty much
the energy that we invested in the first
three steps has been paid back so any
energy that we make from this point
forward is total profit I guess you
could say so let's go ahead to step
number eight and see if we create any
energy yet so step eight
come on energy let's see what happens so
in step number eight you use the enzyme
phospho glycerol mutase and I'm not
gonna draw the enzyme well you know what
it's gonna bother me if I don't just
reinforce the idea that use an enzyme
for everything so this enzyme is pretty
much making this crap happen and what he
does is he pretty much is gonna move a
phosphate around your molecule so right
now remember we have two three carbon
molecules we have a carbon and it's
linked to another carbon and it's linked
to another carbon and we also have a
phosphate that's linked to this third
carbon right here now what this enzyme
is gonna do is it's gonna move it from
let me pick a color here this is where
we started this is where the phosphate
was originally and it's gonna move it to
here let me draw another diagram so of
course the main backbone of a molecule
carbon carbon carbon someone sexed in me
carbon carbon carbon doesn't change our
backbones of carbons don't change this
enzyme is just gonna move it to the
second carbon instead so moves it from
the third carbon to the second carbon so
again just to reinforce the idea what
the enzyme basically does is it takes
this phosphate and moves it up here
pretty much changes your structure
around a little bit so step eight very
easy the enzyme called phospho glycerol
mutase moves your phosphate from the
third carbon to the second one simple
enough now again what we're hoping to
get is some ATP's out of that but we
didn't generate any energy yet so let's
go ahead and go to step nine and see if
we can finally get some energies out of
this
so in step number nine you use another
enzyme and just you know in case you
guys were wondering the name of these
enzymes if you guys are you know need to
know this for your test this is called
enolase en Ola se and what this enzyme
does is it removes a water molecule from
the molecule that we started with and
let me go ahead and write this out so
right now remember we are at the
molecule C 3 H 504 p1 and what we're
about to do is I said this enzyme
removes a water molecule so minus an HDL
molecule and as you can see whenever you
remove a water molecule from this right
here we're going to end up with C 3 H 3
my letters a little neater H 3 o 3 P 1
so of course we removed two hydrogen's
so we have three right here and also one
oxygen so that's why we have oh three in
our final product at up to this point is
C 3 H 3 o 3 P 1 but remember just to
recap one last time that even though I'm
drawn this chemical reaction once
remember that we actually have two
molecules of this right now
since everything is happening twice now
this molecule that we actually have to
of up to this point is called P E P it
actually is a longer word a type of acid
but whenever we can
you know abbreviate something in biology
take full advantage of this so now
remember we have two molecules of this p
e P awesome but what the heck we still
aren't getting any freaking energy here
so now we have to go to step 10 and let
me draw this a little bit neater step 10
and step 10 is our last freaking step of
glycolysis so if we don't get any energy
here I'm gonna be pretty freakin peed
off so what we do in this step is we use
an enzyme of course in this enzyme in
case you guys were wondering it's called
pyruvate kinase and that's what it does
or excuse me that's not what it does
that's just the name of it it transfers
a phosphate from PEP to ADP and we
finally get our a teepee created so
remember right now we have the molecule
PEP in the formula for this is C 3 H 3 o
3 P 1 and what this enzyme is going to
do is it's going to transfer a phosphate
this one right here and it's going to
give it to an ADP so it gives it to a D
P and whenever this happens we end up
with of course an ATP this is what it
creates creates an ATP and it also
creates since you you know you no longer
have your phosphate C 3 H 4 o 3 and I
just want to stress this because I
should have said before but I know this
is kind of confusing what we're doing
right here is for pretty much this
enzymes going to get rid of this
phosphate and give it to ADP creating
ATP so we no longer have this phosphate
and you may think that you may be left
with C 3 H 3 o 3 but we're left with C 3
H 4 o 3 whenever you see that my
hydrogen count and my oxygen counts are
a little bit weird it's just because of
the way that they're bonded or whenever
you release a phosphate group your
hydrogen's in oxygen maybe bond a little
bit differently but I didn't want to
specify every single bond because that's
not really important for the scope of
this tutorial the scope of this tutorial
in glycolysis isn't about your hydrogens
and oxygens it's mainly about your
carbons in your phosphates so it's about
creating energy turning ADP and ATP and
also those nad crap that we're going to
be talking about later on but again
don't really focus on the hydrogen and
oxygen counts right now because we want
to cover the main topics because even
though hydrogen is gained as the
phosphate was lost we're not really
concentrating on that and I should have
said that a long time before but step
number 10 this is what you need to know
the enzyme called pyruvate kinase
transfers a phosphate from this molecule
right here from the
ep2 a DP creating a teepee now remember
we were at zero we were broke even so
far but since this actually occurs twice
we are now gaining to a teepee so
throughout your entire process of
glycolysis we ended up positive to a
teepee pretty freakin sweet that was a
good deal gained some energy that we can
use whenever we were you know you know
playing xbox or eating hot boxes or
something
so remember step 10 is when we finally
gained two ATP don't worry about the
hydrogens and oxygens that much they're
just worried about the bonds that's why
they changed a little bit but for now
thank you guys for watching think guys
