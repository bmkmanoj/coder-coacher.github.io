and in this video I'm only showing you
guys how to style this white border
around certain images and I'm also gonna
be showing you guys how to float this
image left so you can put text on the
right hand side and this is actually
without the use of multiple columns like
this so if you want to put a picture in
text in the same column but make them
appear side-by-side we're gonna be
learning how to do that and last but not
least I want to show you guys how to
make this black box as a background now
typically the text in these drop menus
is white and as you can see the entire
drop up menu the background right here
is semi-transparent and that looks
really good for this hardwood background
whenever you you know you pop it up but
certain times you have a lighter or
perhaps maybe you have a private
messenger or chatroom that you want to
use this feature on and the background
is white actually the chatroom that I'm
building for my website it pops up over
the white background so whenever you
have this white text even though this
background a semi dark and transparent
this white text is really difficult to
read whenever you don't have you know a
darker background so that's why this
black background is really useful and
I'm going to show you guys how to do
that so let's go ahead and get started
the first thing is of course the white
border so my class is are just called
white border and this is very simple
stuff right here one pixel solid white
BAM boom roasted so the next thing I
want to do is I want to show you guys
how to float the image to the left now
you guys can probably guess um you know
the beginning stages of this footer
whenever an image has the class image
left first the part that you guys could
probably guess float left now in
addition to that what I like to do is I
actually like to add a margin to the
right hand side only and as you can see
if I don't do this then this text Bucky
Roberts and readmore which is actually a
link to my
file it would be butted up right against
the image so let's go ahead and add
margin right let's say 10 pixels and the
last thing I want to do is I actually
like to style the width of this image
right here so the width equals 40 pixels
and of course you guys may change this
if you use you know pictures in your
footer but for mine
I thought 40 pixels look pretty good if
you have it too small then you can't
even you know tell that it's a profile
picture it looks like a little hit of
acid or something so anyways you know
not that I ever seen anything like that
now the last thing I want to show you
guys how to do is a style this black box
and by the way here's the cool thing
whenever I was making the group chat or
actually my developers were I designed
it and they are coding at all I have
certain sections like the buddy list or
the main text area that is okay to
display in just white text and other
sections need the black background so
it's actually cool to have it mix and
match and it actually looks pretty cool
when you have your entire pop-up or drop
menu in one color and then certain
sections with a darker background makes
it stand out a little bit more so footer
black box now the first thing I want to
do is set the background now here's
another thing to point out whenever
we're working with backgrounds let's say
I set the background to zero zero zero
zero point four alright so what I did is
I pretty much made this 40 percent
opacity right so that means that
whenever we're looking at this that this
black background is going to be 40
percent opacity right well actually
that's wrong because the black
background which is 40 percent opacity
right here is actually stacked on top of
this right here which is our Lee already
I don't know like 20 percent opacity
whatever we made it so just remember
that in your calculations that this is
not going to be 40 percent pass
it's gonna be closer to like fifty or
sixty percent opacity so a lot of people
you know they always try to code
everything and it always turns out
darker than they anticipated and that's
because they forgot to add the
background opacity as well so the next
thing I want to do is just add a padding
of five pixels just because the text
looks a little bit better and also a
margin bottom five pixels and last but
not least a border radius of five pixels
now with the border radius if you guys
don't know what that is it pretty much
means I don't even know if you guys can
see on the YouTube video but the
curviness so it's not just a square box
it's like a rounded rectangle now if
you're doing this in Google Chrome what
you should be this is going to be fine
but excuse me
if you're doing this in Opera or Firefox
you may want to do do like Moz or WebKit
border radius and uh well lookup border
radius online and you'll see the other
types well this is compatible with
google chrome and that's what I use so
you know if you guys want to tweak it
later go ahead
bye anyways thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
