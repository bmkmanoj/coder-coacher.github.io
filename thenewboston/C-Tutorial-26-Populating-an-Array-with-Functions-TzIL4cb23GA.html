tutorial and in this tutorial we teach
you guys how to build a function that
allows the user to input their own
elements in the array or populate the
array is some people like to call it so
let's go ahead and make an int function
and I'm going to name my pop you late if
I could spell it and it's going to take
some parameters a double array in case
they enter decimal points actually let's
name my array one I don't like name
itself array for some reason int number
and this is going to be the number of
elements in the array so now that we got
our function header let's go ahead and
make the function body the first thing
we need is a variable for when the input
numbers so let's go double input and now
we just need a counting variable in I
and now let's just go make a for loop to
loop through the array so for then but I
said it would 0 and then put 1 I is less
than number since this is the number of
elements in the array don't want to go
outside that I plus plus so inside our
for loop what are we going to have there
we go
come on space take me an hour to get my
spaces right let me move this up a
little bit in the meantime so now in our
for loop what do you want to have well
let's just have a little prompt C out
umm there's my darn spaces again enter
value for item and then we will put I
plus 1 so let's go I plus 1 put that in
parenthesis just be sure and why are we
adding plus 1 because the index of array
0 is actually the first item so just
make it readable then I will go ahead
and end that line and now what we need
to do is whatever they input well let's
go ahead and just put sin input so
whatever the inputs going to be stored
in the very
input so now we want to take that
variable and pass it into the array so
array 1 actually array 1 and put I since
it's just going to loop through just
like it's a spitting out an array and
you want to set this equal to input so
then whatever they input the first time
it's going to be stored in the first
index of the array it's going to loop
through whatever they input the second
time it's going to be stored in the
second index of array and it's going to
go on and on until it gets to the end of
array which you didn't tell you how many
yeah
so they're actually going to have to
input a bunch of numbers and then just
return something like I we won't use
that but we need to do something and
next we need to prototype this of course
so copy/paste clear semicolon prototype
it and now we need to call it so the
first thing we need is an array so put
double on Bucky and let's just make it 5
you can actually make it whatever you
want and set it equal to empty array
since they're going to be populating it
we don't need to save let's the work now
we need a caller function populate and
call Bucky and 5 since there are 5
elements right there
now if we go ahead and run this right
now we're going to be able to as long as
I don't got any errors which I probably
do to input a bunch of numbers in the
array and it's going to populate the
array so enter value for item 123 and
it's gonna go all the way to 5 56 and
the 4 for 4 and now it does nothing so
what we want to do is um we already
populated our array so Bucky
now has the values in each index but it
would be useful if we had another
function just to spit out on what we
already did so we know that you know
let's put the good use and not just
total waste of time so let's go ahead
and make a function to spit out all our
data just for looks so I'll name it spit
and of course um double this is same as
for array
spell that right array1 square brackets
and int number and now in your function
body what are we going to do for this
I'll show you around my header right
double ray one looks good to me
well we're just going to have a basic
for loop this is going to be easier even
easier than the last one in I equals 0 I
move my cursor out of the way when as
long as I is less than number and I'm
going to semicolon and just a iterated
through looking good looking good so now
this is going to go through the array
and let's just cut C out um the value of
item sure you get your spaces I plus 1
is in make sure you make sure you put
spaces on either side of that is array 1
and then put your I so this is going to
loop through the array and it says the
value of item 1 and it's going to give
you the 1 and then it says the value of
item 2 and then it's going to give you 2
so that's all we need for this function
see how easy that was
so let's go ahead and prototype this by
copying the header copy and then go
ahead and just pasting it and the
semicolon and now that oh you guys
didn't even see that did you well there
it is right there and now all we have to
do is call it so once we populate it oh
let's just go ahead and spit Bucky 5 so
now that we populated our array all we
have to do is spit it out so let's go
ahead and compile and run that and come
on no whammy no whammy I got an error
because I didn't have a semicolon but
BAM semicolon now look at it compile and
run come on
big money big money BAM that's what I'm
talking about enter value for one twenty
three fifty four fifty six six and seven
and then it says the value of item one
is twenty three the valuable item two is
fifty four on and on and we could even
simplify that even more by putting an
end line right there so now once you do
this one more time promise this is the
last time unless I just type something
wrong really quick um let's put four
five six seven eight
there we go BAM wow that is a beautiful
program value item one is for as you can
see one four to five don't need to read
them all free you can probably read them
yourself but that is the basics of how
to use a function let me see let me get
it back how you use a function to
populate an array right here and then
how you use another function just to
spit out all your answers after you
populate it and again don't forget the
prototype up here and don't forget to
call your functions obviously so that is
your quick tutorial the main thing I
wanted to show you guys is how to
populate an array so all that other
stuff was just a little bonus so thank
you guys for watching uh make sure
please subscribe to my channel if you
want to get all my latest videos and
once you did you're ready to move on to
the next video so again thank you guys
and I'll see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
