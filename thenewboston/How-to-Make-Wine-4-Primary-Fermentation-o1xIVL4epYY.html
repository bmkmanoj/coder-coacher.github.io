begun the yeast is actually converting
that sugar into alcohol right now
however it takes some time it takes
about five to seven days for the primary
fermentation to get done to complete so
our job is basically let the yeast work
and we also need to be responsible for
keeping all of the germs and bacteria
out of our wine so go ahead and grab
your sanitizer lid stick it on make sure
it's nice and tight just going to do
this for like 34 seconds just kidding
now as you guys probably noticed there's
a little hole in the lid of our bucket
this is so we can stick the airlock in
now let me go ahead and stick the
airlock in and then I'll explain you
guys how it works so what you want to do
is you actually want to fill your
airlock up to the line now know if you
guys can see this on the YouTube videos
but there are little increments you can
feel them on the airlock that say the
maximum amount of level go ahead and
fill your sanitizer up to this level and
stick it in the top of your fermenter
now like I said during the fermentation
process the yeast is converting the
sugar to alcohol which we want in our
wine in carbon dioxide which is
basically just a by-product that we
don't want so we need to allow pretty
much the germs to stay out in the
bacteria to stay out while we allow the
carbon dioxide that gets created inside
to escape so that's what this does
whenever gas gets created instead of
building up in the bucket and then
blowing up eventually
what does is it escapes this through the
series of tubing and you guys are going
to start to see little bubbles coming
out and that's the carbon dioxide
escaping and basically the alcohol is
going to stay in the game
is going to escape without blowing up
our container and the bacteria and germs
are going to stay out so now what we
need to do is we need to let this sit
for five to seven days and then we can
go ahead and move on to the next step of
winemaking so take the bucket and set it
in a room where no one's going to
disturb it and it's actually pretty
important to make sure that the
temperature of the room is between 72
and 75 degrees Fahrenheit if it's too
cold or too hot the fermentation process
may take a little bit slower so that's
where we're going to do and another
thing it may take 24 to 48 hours and
start seeing bubbles so if you don't see
them right away don't freak out but
eventually after a couple days you're
going to start to see bubbles coming
from here that's a good sign and like I
said the fermentation process takes
about five to seven days so for now
thank you guys for watching and I'll see
you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
