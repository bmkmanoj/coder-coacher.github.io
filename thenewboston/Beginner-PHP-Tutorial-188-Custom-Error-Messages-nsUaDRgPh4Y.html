and this is another video for the new
Boston now we've already looked at our
custom server and database exceptions
now what we're going to be looking about
is coming into our extended classes here
but taking some information and
outputting some useful information so
what we've done is we've created errors
in route and a database so I've changed
route to Alex and what that's done is if
we refresh and we're saying could not
connect a server and if we if we are
changing a database and appending or one
on we're saying Canucks
select database now what I want to do is
give them a more specific error so I
want to say what line it's on and what
file it is from so again this may be a
useless example but you can understand
then the concept of everything so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to delete
this and we are just going to echo out a
custom error message depending on our
server server exception and database
exception I'm going to be changing these
functions names names in a bit when
we've redefined them so up here at the
moment we've got nothing within our
brackets but if I pull these down we can
start to define custom functions inside
or methods rather because obviously in
object-oriented programming which is
this is part of we are looking at
methods we're calling the methods so
what we can say is we can say public
function we can say show a specific
and again we're going to create a block
inside this as well so here is going to
be our error message so what this is
going to do is it's going to echo out in
fact it's going to return and what we
want to return is the first of all the
line number that we find the error on
and then the file itself that we're
actually in which is going to be
index.php so we want to return this we
use this it's not a defined variable
that I've defined anywhere this just
means this in general here this and
we're going to say get line okay get
line so we can make it look a bit more
user friendly error on on line something
so this line here and then we're going
to say append on some more text in this
get file so now what our error is going
to read is error on line and we're
appending on the line that this has been
this error has been thrown on so error
also thrown well to make it make a bit
more sense
so error thrown on line something in
this file okay so let's just test that
and then we'll create another one for
the database exception as well so at the
moment we if we refresh it looks like
we're connected apps that you find so we
need to change this remember here this
currently says get message and that's a
echoing out this message here so let's
delete these and we'll create purposely
create a server error we'll see what
happens nothing oh yeah okay so it's
because um we want this function show
specific we want to take that from our
exception that we're thrown so we're
going to say show specific okay so
now let's refresh
okay so we are showing that an error has
been thrown on line 21 in and then we
echo the file name out so a custom error
message where the exception has been
thrown is successful so it reads error
thrown in line something in so let's
just double check everything I know the
file name is fine because we can see
that here we're working with index.php
even though it wasn't previously shown
with area so wherever thrown on line 21
let's go and have a look to see where
the error has been thrown so the throw
new server exception is on this line
here and you can see that down here in
the corner it's line 21
so we're successfully showing the right
information so now what we can do is do
the same thing for database exception we
can create a public function show
specific and we can do exactly the same
thing so it can return error thrown on
line and then we say this get line okay
so remember this is a this.get line here
and this get file here is a method
within exception however because we're
extending this we're actually putting it
into use in our server exception which
we've them which we've called ourselves
or named ourselves rather so this get
line and then we append on in and then
we append on to that this get file
okay so now that should do exactly the
same thing
let's return this to route so we don't
don't throw an error for that I mean
remember we need to change this to show
specific
okay so let's change our database
information so we throw an error for
this refresh and now it says oh we've
missed out a little space there let's
pop a space in there to make it neat so
we've got error thrown on line 25 in the
same file obviously so let's go to line
25 and check where the error has been
thrown so the exception has been thrown
mother it's this line here which is
database exception so you've probably
guessed that the line that is thrown er
is 25 so you can see but that by
extending our exception class we can
create our own methods inside to use
data from our exception class there's
much more than this you go on the PHP
manual you'll be able to find a lot more
methods inside and properties you can
take from from this exception class and
put it into your own and then we've
thrown our exceptions ourself using
catch twice while we're throwing twice
so that's how you're going to extend our
exception out your exception class and
how you're going to catch multiple upset
exceptions with your own custom error
