this tutorial what I want to do is I
want to show you guys how to add
collision detection really simple
collision detection so let me run this
real quick so before we made a couple
objects and they fell down but now
they're going way down into no-man's
land what we want to say is you know
what actually treat the edge of your
iPhone or iPad as the boundary so
whenever you hit the bottom you bounce
off it like normal instead of just you
know passing through it and I'll also
show you guys had to change the
bounciness or elasticity so you can
either make those squares is bouncy as
you want or you can make them not bounce
at all but uh yeah whatever you want so
the only behavior we added right now is
gravity the other ones that we're gonna
add are gonna look really similar to
this so let's add collision detection
which is pretty much recognized in the
bottom or the boundaries of your iPhone
screen so I'll just make the parameter
called boundaries and you want to set
this equal to uij collision behavior now
this we can actually just copy these
items so collision behavior means
recognize when you're touching something
when you're coming in contact with
another object now for the items of
course we can just copy these because
those are the items we want to use those
are only items we have actually now if
you take that boundaries property which
is the collision behavior you can call
the method called translate translates
reference bounds into boundary in other
words it gets look at this the reference
view is just the self view what does
that mean the reference is just the
entire screen whether it's your iPhone
screen or iPad whatever so instead of
saying okay we're gonna give you the
left and the right in the bottom in the
top and you have to calculate a whole
bunch of stuff if you just say translate
the reference bounce which is that
screen into the boundary it's gonna say
okay as your boundary just use the edges
of the screen
it's really incredibly simple and uh
yeah it's a pretty cool way to do stuff
and you just need to set this equal to
true to I don't know kind of verified or
whatever so after this of course these
behaviors are just set up we're just
setting this them up right now but in
order to actually add them to our
project or screen we need to call the
animator and we need to add a behavior
in whatever that behaviors name was so
the collision detection behavior was
name boundaries so let's paste that in
there and now check out what happens
whenever we run it pretty sweet so now
they recognized not only the bottom but
if we were to take these and try to bump
them up against the sides or the top
they would recognize their boundaries
based on this reference view which is
the entire screen itself so pretty sweet
we now have some really simple collision
detection now another thing that I want
to do is show you guys real quick how to
change the bounciness of them because as
you guys can see whenever you run this
okay they bounce a little bit they have
some default bounce or elasticity but
let's say we wanted to have them bounce
a little bit more maybe we were saying
making an app called like rubber blocks
I don't know that's pretty dumb but
whatever
so elasticity I think I might have
actually spelled that right all right so
I'll just say I'll just name this one
bounce and this is UI dynamic item
behavior and again we're just going to
copy these these are the objects that we
want to apply the behavior to now the
only property that we need to apply
bounce is elasticity now the value of
this is just going to be how strong or
how weak your bounce is so I'll just
give it point five for now which is kind
of average I think so this changes the
elasticity and of course anytime we want
to actually apply this behavior to our
animator add behavior in it is called
bounce
so again just setting it up setting up
all the parameters and adding it to our
game or whatever it is so now I don't
even know if you guys can tell on my
screen recorder since the framerate rate
is kind of weird but if you did notice
they did bounce a lot more than that
default so there you go
so now you understand the basics of
pretty much using uikit dynamics what
you have to do is you need to create an
animator object which is an instance of
UI dynamic animator and this object
allows you to pretty much apply physics
like like animations to objects and then
you have to set up the different
behaviors the different animations you
want to do and then add them to the
animator simple enough easy wheezy
cheesy
alright so um in the next tutorial I
think what I'm gonna do is we're gonna
start using user interaction in other
words whenever I run this right now it
just animates and I can just sit back
and watch it but what if I actually want
to interact with these what if I want to
touch it
move it around swipe my finger and it
goes in some direction I mean all games
use some kind of user interaction so
we're gonna be learning that in next
video it's gonna be sweet I'll see you
then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
