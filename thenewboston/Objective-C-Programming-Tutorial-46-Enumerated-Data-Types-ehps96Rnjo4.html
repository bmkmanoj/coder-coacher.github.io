welcome to your 46 objective-c tutorial
and in this story we're gonna be talking
about something called enumerated data
types
now WTH is an enumerated data type well
I'll tell ya and an enumerated data type
is a data type just like int or char but
the difference is that you create this
yourself and you know how it has values
that you can assign like 1 32 64 well
when you make your own data type you
give it a set number of values and only
these values can be assigned variables
so let's go ahead and let me show you
the syntax for this and give you guys a
quick example so say we wanted to make a
data type to only store the days of the
week and we want to Saturday and Sunday
because you know way too many days a
week so in order to do this go ahead and
type en um enum weird I know and then
name your data type day and then in
curly braces put all the options that
you can assign the variables so Monday
Tuesday Wednesday oppa H for Thursday
since already Tuesday and Friday so now
any variable that you create from this
data type can only accept the values M
twhf if you try to assign a number or s
or X or a tunafish it will get an error
message so let's go ahead and create a
variable from this data type enum today
just like int or char this is your data
type and now you write the name of the
variable say we want to set oops
enum day that's the data type and today
is the variable kind of got ahead of
myself there I guess I'm just a little
bit excited so so now you can set any of
these five values equal to today so
let's set it equal to W since today is
Wednesday so now we can go ahead and you
know use just just like a regular
variable but the cool thing about this
is I mean I won't even show you a
demonstration for this because I'm going
to be typing one later on the cool thing
is
you can take numerical values integers
and set them equal to these as well so
for example set M equal to one you can
do this and now you can use one and M
pretty much interchangeably and even
better thing about this is whenever you
set one of them equal to a number each
sequential or very values after that
automatically get assigned the next
integer so if we said this one equal to
one Tuesday would automatically be equal
to Wednesday be equal to three four five
if M was equal to six for some odd
reason then this would be equal to seven
a nine ten and why this is useful well I
was going to show you in this tutorial
but I'm running out of time I just
noticed I mean not yet but if I type
this program I want to show you I
definitely won't have enough time so in
the next tutorial if any of the seems
confusing that I'm gonna be clearing
everything up and showing you an awesome
program of why this is useful and it's
going to become crystal clear to you and
trust me if you watch the next tutorial
in ten minutes you're gonna be an
enumerated data type kuroh so thank you
for watching this story I know it may be
confusing but trust me I'm gonna clear
everything up and write the coolest
program in the next tutorial so if you
want the source code I'll post it in my
forum I'll link it below thank you for
watching and don't forget to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
