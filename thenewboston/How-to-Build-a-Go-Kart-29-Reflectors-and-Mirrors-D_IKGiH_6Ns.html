how to install your rear reflectors and
also the mirrors in front of your
go-kart now even if you're not going to
register this and write it on the road
it's always a good idea that have
reflectors because when it gets darker
whenever you're riding with friends it's
going to be easier for them to see you
and of course not crashing you so
installing reflector is really easy you
pretty much just mounted on the back
there just a couple things you have to
remember first of all if you noticed
there's only one bolt coming out of this
reflector but there are two holes right
here now the reason for that is because
whenever you mount your reflector you
don't want it to spin whenever you're
riding around hitting bumps so what they
did is they put a little nub let me see
VD see that a little nub in there
flector your bolt goes in the one hole
in your little nub goes into another
hole and whenever you put both of those
lined up then there's no way that your
reflector can spin or move around so
there you go
your reflector is now mounted do the
same thing on the other side and guys
make sure not to tighten these too hard
because these will crack probably easier
than anything on your go-kart so snug
enough where they're not going to fall
off but these are really easy to crack
so just watch out for that alright guys
now that your reflectors are mounted I
want to show you guys how to mount the
mirror although there's my camera in the
frontier go-kart so whenever you get a
mirror you think okay just bolt that
baby on there easy enough but then you
stick it on and you start spinning or
not and if you notice the bolt in the
nut both spin so you're like what the
heck's going on why can't this tighten
and what you actually need to do is I'm
going to show you guys right here
because I don't know if I can get a good
camera angle there's a piece on your
mirror what you need to do is you need
to take that off and that's what that
lets you access top of the bowl now this
bolt right here should probably got this
up before is actually one that you need
an allen wrench for so let me guys show
you the top of this if I can take it
apart real quick so there's the bolt
right there as you can see and actually
it fits into an outer inch as I said so
go ahead and grab your Eleanore inches
because your
need them now what this does again is
you put it through the brace on your
mirror and not only when you're
installing it that this is how you do it
but anytime you need to tighten your
mirror for example if it's like too
loose and flopping around then this is
how you access it so let me go ahead and
install this baby and then we'll be good
to go so first thing you need to do is
remove the plug from your mirror and
then go ahead and mount it and now go
ahead and stick your bolt through and
you'll see it pop through the bottom now
just hand tighten the nut on the bolt
right now and line is strict a little
bit so hopefully I can get it there we
are now take your allen wrench stick it
in the head of the bolt and tighten this
baby up now what you want to do before
you tighten this completely all the way
is you want to get a general idea of
where you want the mirror to be
positioned so go ahead and I'm not going
to take guys through that because
obviously you probably know how to
position mirrors go ahead and send the
driver seat or where the driver seat is
going to be adjust this and then you can
finish tightening the nut and when it's
nice and tight as you can see this
mirror isn't moving anywhere so now the
last thing you need to do is put your
little cover on a little plug would
everyone call it check it out it's good
to go do the exact same thing for the
mirror on the other side and then your
mirrors are installed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
