video I want to start talking to you
guys about how to set up a cloud server
and I want to do this because a cloud
servers are becoming really popular and
B whenever you're first starting to
learn about networking and servers and
how to set them up it's probably not a
good idea to just go out and buy you
know like a three hundred dollar server
start plugging things into it and you
know you might mess something up so
whenever you're just practicing getting
used to setting up a server it's always
a good idea to get one of these online
and you know just play around with this
so that's what I'm going to be doing and
there's a bunch of different companies
that allow you to buy cloud servers
Amazon is probably the most popular but
I like this one digitalocean
it's really simple and they're
incredibly cheap as well you can have a
web server for an entire month for like
five bucks so if you guys know any other
cool companies then you know share them
in the comments below but for now this
is the one I use whenever I'm first like
setting up a project so this is what you
do whenever you find a site login with
setup your account you know have a
username and password and then you're
going to get a screen like this now in
digitalocean
they call their cloud servers droplets
so don't let that confuse though a
droplet is just a cloud server so a lot
of people will be infused you know
trying to set up a server and they're
just giving me raindrops well it's the
same thing so I'm going to hit create
droplet alright so the first option that
we have to fill out is a host name for
our droplet now I just want to point out
that this is not the name of your
website you don't fill out like ww2 New
Boston comm this is just a name that you
are going to see in no one else just so
if you have a bunch of different
droplets then you can identify them so
I'm just going to name this holy
caps-lock droplet
zero one so it doesn't matter if your
website's you know bacon com youtube.com
you can name this anything you want so
you know a lot of people are like good I
know my domain name yet doesn't doesn't
matter we'll set that up later so after
this you're pretty much saying okay
I want to build a cloud server with this
configuration hold on a freaking
motorcycles driving by alright so since
this is a simple demonstration I'm just
going to go with the cheapest one five
bucks a month less than a penny an hour
so 512 is the RAM it has one CPU this
the SSD is the hard drive and this down
here a thousand gigabyte transfer that's
the amount of bandwidth that can go
through my server a month so that's good
for now I don't think I'm going to be
using more than that just for these
tutorials and after this select a region
is someone mowing their lawn someone
really mowing their lawn right now I
swear as soon as I start filming start
people start driving by mowing their
lawns having parades out front of my
house alright so for now just select the
one closest to your house I live in New
York so I'm just going to select New
York and again that's just where you
want the server to be set up now for the
available settings
I'm not going to choose any this is just
going to be a really bare-bones project
just a demonstration and for the image
this is saying what do you want
pre-installed on your server whenever we
set it up for you for the first time now
for the distributions these are just the
different operating systems the core
operating systems that you can have now
a Mbutu is just a flavor of Linux and
right now I'm using a boon to version
14.04 64-bit actually want to bump this
down to 32-bit so I'm going to be using
Ubuntu 14.04 32-bit now the reason for
this is because remember this is just a
little test server and it only has like
512 yeah 512 for ram so I don't have
that much memory in 64-bit operating
systems
some of the processes and services on
there they consume quite a bit of ram of
memory so yeah that's my explanation
behind that now for applications if you
know that I don't know maybe you're
setting this up for some company and you
know that they're developing their
website in no
would or like PHP if it's PHP then you
want to use a lamp since for Linux
Apache MySQL in PHP but for now like I
said I'm just going to stick with the
core basics and then we're going to be
setting everything up manually so
snapshots is if you took any snapshots
before my backups in destroyed droplets
these are all if you had droplets before
and you want to you know make a copy of
those or whatever but for right now
that's good now whenever we connect to
our server
remember this server is inside our house
it's somewhere in New York probably in
New York City so we have to connect to
it we're going to be doing this through
a service called SSH this stands for
secure show now I highly recommend doing
this instead of you know just
traditional FTP because it's a lot more
secure so what you can do is you can set
it up right now and I'm going to be
showing you guys in the next video how
to set up SSH but what you can do is you
can set it up in insert your keys I'm
going to be talking to you guys about
what they are but I actually had some
trouble doing it this way so instead I'm
just going to create the droplet right
now I'm going to be showing you guys how
to set up the key later so yeah there
you go it takes a couple seconds and it
takes 60 seconds and then your server is
set up and then after about five minutes
you're going to receive an email and
that email is going to have the IP
address of your server and also the
login information so you can actually
connect to it so once this is done
setting up I'm going to wait for the
email and then once I receive that I'll
start the next video so I'll see you
then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
