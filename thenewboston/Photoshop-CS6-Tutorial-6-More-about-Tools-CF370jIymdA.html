I won't be able to use it on this one
because it's not rasterizer okay and
let's do it now I can work on it
Islanders I'll explain what all that
stuff means another point while we're
not when we're doing something with
rasterizing in a later tutorial
so like there's these like little spots
here and I don't want them to be there I
just click on them with the Spot Healing
Brush and I'll make them try to blend in
with the background and let go away like
that for example so these are for
editing photos and I'll have to teach
you what the other ones mean later on so
what we got over to the next is this is
our brush tool
we got brush pencil mixer brush color
and color replacement tool the hotkeys
for these are B so I've just got my
brush tool and I had my color selected
it's just gonna paint kind of kind of
like in Microsoft Paint and stuff I
almost drew something bad by accident
mm-hm
so that's a your brush tool and just so
you know the brush tools hotkey is B if
I just press B while I'm out here like
drawing or whatever and I press B it's
going to switch to the pencil tool it's
a capital B actually so it'll be shift B
to switch and you can see my cursor is
switching so
we've got those tools there then
Beneatha we have our our history brush
tool and our art history brush tool and
teach you about those later
so more photo editing tools we've got
our clone stamp and our pattern stamp
tool and I'll have to get into those
later also we've got our eraser our
magic eraser and our background eraser
tool and this one so I mean you can just
erase things and our background is a
white background if I take turn that off
you can see it goes back to the
transparent so that's what the eraser
tool does it just erases whatever's
there and to the right here we've got
our paint bucket tool which fills in
solid color and then we have our
gradient tool which is kind of like the
paint bucket tool but doesn't do a solid
color does a gradient color but you
could make it to a solid color if you
wanted to but there's might as well just
use the paint bucket tool for that now
beneath that we have our Dodge burn and
sponge tool and these are used for
adding like burns and and things like
that into your photos so if I use this
Dodge tool and I do it on this girl's
arm admit this is making it making her
arm like way lighter as you can see
and if I use like the burn tool I'll
probably make a darker yep so that has
made her arm darker so left of that we
have the blur and sharpen tools and I'm
sure you guys know what a blur is it'll
just blur out the area and the sharpen
will make it a less blurry and then we
got our smudge which will smear around
everything like this and now you can see
her watch is now smeared and we willing
got a couple more left so try to speed
through these we've got our different
selection tools here we've got our path
selection tool and our direct selection
tool and I'll have to get into those
more when I talk about paths and here
we've got our pen tool this is what it's
going to start on to is like a image of
an old looking pen and then our
different pen editing tools here to the
right of that we have our text tools
horizontal vertical and then we got a
horizontal mask type and vertical mask
type and all you need to do it just
click and start typing and you have
different types of different text in
there and below the text tool we've got
our line tools and our sheet tools so
it's going to start off on this
rectangle most likely and with this you
can draw like a rectangle that has a
fill inside of it already
same with your polygon tools and then
you have a custom shape tool that where
you can draw your own shape and
everything like that or add in other
shapes now we've got our hand tool right
here which is used for just moving stuff
around and our rotate tool and then to
the right of this we have our zoom in
and zoom out tool so if you press
if you press on your mouse button and
move left or right on your left mouse
button excuse me move left to right and
it'll zoom in like that or you can zoom
in incrementally by pressing the left
mouse button to zoom in and then or hold
alt to change it to zoom out so that's
how you use the zoom tool and then um
below this here we have our different
color selections so we've got our
foreground color and then our background
colors and then we can switch these out
using this arrow right here so you can
switch these different colors that
you're using and then this button here
switches them to black and white so the
default foreground and background colors
this button here is the Edit in quick
mask mode I'll go over that one later
and this is the change screen mode so I
can change it to standard screen which
is what it should be at for everybody
else full screen and then full screen
like totally full screen with everything
full screen mode panels are hidden that
can be accessed but on the sides of
screen by pressing tab so we already
went over that in the last tutorial so
that was a long a little bit of a long
tutorial I just wanted to remind you
that the actual every single one of
these tools has an options menu up above
and anytime I click on it the options
menus are going to change and you can
there's a whole bunch of different
things you can do with these different
options so all these tools are very
versatile and pretty awesome so
Photoshop is a very in-depth program so
it'll probably take a little while to
get through everything
you just got to learn the basics of it
first and then after you learn the
basics and how to approach different
problems and everything like that you
can basically come through and master
the finer points and learn how to make
some really cool things so thanks for
watching this tutorial and I look
forward to seeing you guys in the next
tutorial we'll look over like how to
like create new documents and things
like that so see you guys at that one
have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
