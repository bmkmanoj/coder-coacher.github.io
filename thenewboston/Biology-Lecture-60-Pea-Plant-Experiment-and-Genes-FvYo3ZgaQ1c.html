biology lesson and in this video I want
to start talking about Mendel's
experiments or specifically the results
of those experiments so remember that
whenever we breathe something studying
genetics the original parents are called
the p1 generation now their offspring
are called the f1 generation or their
kids I guess you could say and the
second generation of offspring or their
grandkids is called the f2 generation so
now that we got the naming conventions
done let's go ahead and talk about one
of the first experiments that Mendel
performed what he did is he took a pure
breeding tall pea plant and remember
whenever we have a pure breeding tall
pea plant and if we bred it against
another pure breeding tall pea plant our
offspring 100% of them would all be tall
pea plants however what he did is he
took a tall pea plant any bred it with a
pure breeding short pea plant and we of
course know if you take two short pure
breeding pea plants you would have all
100% short pea plants so what he
expected fine or what most people would
expect to find is that the offspring
would basically be an average of these
so since this one is tall in this one is
short due to blending inheritance or the
common belief of inheritance at the time
people expected the offspring of the f1
generation to be of average height
however whenever he mated them the
results of the offspring were that all
of the offspring no matter how many he
mated they were all tall so that's kind
of weird because this is the first
finding he bred a purebred tall pea
plant with a purebred short pea plant
and no matter how many he bred 100% of
the offspring were tall that's kind of
weird and he wasn't really expecting
this so clearly this was the first
evidence that the blending theory of
blending inheritance was false so what
he did after this is he took the pea
plants from the f1 generation and he
made them with each other so basically
he took all of these right here and he
started mating them with each other in
results he found we're actually really
surprising and really interesting now
this of course was f2 generation and
what he found here is that the f2
generation had tall and short people
ants but they had a ratio of about three
to one so for every three there is one
short one so this was kind of weird
because there was a trait that appeared
in the p1 generation and it kind of
skipped the generation and showed up
again in the f2 generation so that was
one of the most interesting findings and
this will led to many different theories
of why this happens and we'll talk about
this later on but before I continue
giving you guys you know the details of
why this happens remember that the f2
generation has tall to short of a ratio
of 3 to 1
so just to recap one last time whenever
he took let me change my color right
here whenever he took a pure-breeding
tall pea plant and bred it with a pure
breeding short pea plant the first
generation was 100% tall pea plants kind
of weird and then he took these and bred
them all with each other and whenever
these are bred with each other they form
about in if you say you're gonna breed
about 400 300 of those would be tall and
100 of those would be short
now what biologists eventually concluded
is that traits in every single organism
are determined by something called genes
and we already know what genes are part
of your DNA and the genes are passed
from your parents of course to the
offspring not the band offspring the
kids so basically whenever this happens
every living thing is going to get two
copies of a gene one from the mom and
one from the dead so right now inside
your body you have two genes and then
we'll say that I don't know let's talk
about your hair color so you yes I'm
talking about you who's watching this
video you have two genes in your body
for hair color right now one is from
your mom and we'll say that maybe your
gene looks like that and another one is
from your dad
now some genes as we saw
the previous slide can hide the effects
of other genes so basically if your mom
was saying that you have or no brown
hair and your dad was saying that you
have I don't know like black hair and
you end up with brown hair what we call
this gene right here is the dominant
gene because it dominates over the other
gene and we call this one recessive so
basically some genes can dominate over
the other ones or hide the effects so
basically if you inherited both these
genes right here and you have brown hair
that would mean that your brown gene
dominated over your black one so the
moms gene would be dominant in your
dad's gene or the gene that you
inherited from your dad would be
recessive and another thing that we
found to be true over years of studying
genes and inheritance and this was one
of the main beliefs that they believed
in eighteen hundreds that we proved
wasn't true is that genes and traits
don't blend with each other at all
you either have characteristics or the
traits from one gene or another but they
don't blend together in any way so
basically to sum everything up you have
two copies of every gene and whenever
you have kids you're only going to pass
one of each gene into your offspring so
basically in this example right here say
this is you and you have the gene for
brown hair and black hair even though
black is recessive well you can still
pass the black gene or the brown gene of
haircolor on to your offspring the only
thing is you don't pass both of them
why don't you well because your kids
also need two genes so what they're
gonna end up doing is they're gonna get
one from you know your girlfriend or
whoever you meet with and one from you
so that's another key feature to take
away in every living organism they have
two genes but whenever you create
offspring or babies you only pass one of
your gene on to your offspring and this
happens by chance in the process of
meiosis and crossing over and we already
talked about that so basically that is
basically what Mendel found and we'll
talk about why some traits if I could
find that slide again appeared in
f2 generation but not in the f1
generation in the next tutorial so thank
you for watching don't forget to follow
me on Twitter and I will see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
