different things different objects here
are in different 3d space the best way
to move a camera is to parent it to a
null object and a null object is just a
layer that has no properties so I'm
going to go to layer new null object and
I like to put a rate below my camera and
I'm going to parent it to parent the
camera to the null object so whatever
whenever the camera moves or whenever
the null object moves the camera moves
and it's going to move based on the
anchor point of the null object which is
this point right here so usually when
you create a null object it's going to
be in the center so that is pretty
helpful so if I rotate the null object
here after making it 3d you can see how
it is in shows the things everything in
3d now if I do I can do the same thing
with position I move up and down the
y-axis you can see how things are in 3d
one of the ways people can tell is by
something called parallax and with that
what that is is when something is in the
back it's going to move slower than when
something is in the front because it's
farther away from the camera so when I
move up and down and on the y-axis
parallax is going to cause the text to
move faster than the object in the back
as you can see there by that
now when you have a camera here the the
render is going to come out of your
camera out of the view of the camera so
this is the camera view this is what's
going to be rendered not anything from
the top view just from what you can see
infra in the camera another another
object that you can use within in 3d is
a light so we can come up here to layer
new light and these are really work in
3d pretty decently and I'll go over
these different points or go over these
different properties at a different time
and hit OK to add this light in and now
you can see that this light is affecting
this 3d layer this gives it more this
can give it more of a 3d look and you
can just move it around and if you want
to rotate it you can rotate there's a
different types of lights new light and
if we go to like a spotlight here okay
you can see that it makes like a light
that's a spotlight and you can you can
rotate it around and everything like
that yeah like that
that's just you can make cool looking 3d
scenes with all this stuff I'll delete
those now remember when I was talking
about backgrounds and how you want to
lock them and not make them 3d layers so
I'm gonna unlock it real quick I'm gonna
make the background a 3d layer now the
background is right here in in the
center we know that because of the red
color there so it's going to cover up
the object we had and that was back here
so if I move the camera backwards now
you can see that the background is
shrinking now it's not a complete
background anymore
it's just all this extra space is gonna
render out as black so the way to do
that is to not make your background a 3d
layer you can and I always lock it so
you don't do something like this and
move your background around the scene
lock it and that's pretty much the
basics of setting up a 3d scene and how
to tell that you're in 3d and use your
views and everything to navigate around
3d so we'll get into more of advanced
effects and I'll explain everything a
little better in later tutorials so we
can be professionals at using 3d scenes
it's one of the main things that After
Effects is known for and other programs
can't really do as well so let's end the
tutorial now I look forward to seeing
you guys in the next ones</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
