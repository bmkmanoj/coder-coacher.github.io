tutorial and flash today we're going to
be creating our first actual animation
so to be able to animate our image we
first need to understand this thing
called the timeline and the timeline is
made up of a bunch of these tiny little
rectangles each one of them is called a
frame now while each frame represents is
a slightly different image and then when
you play each frame after one another it
creates the image of an animation or
movement now there are two different
types of frames a keyframe and key
frames are any frame that you can draw
in or just regular blank frames and what
these blank frames are or just
placeholders that flash uses to fill
automatically based on what your key
frames are so you draw in key frames and
flash uses the blank frames
automatically to fill in now here's how
you make a keyframe and you can tell if
one your frames is a keyframe because it
has a little circle in it this means
keyframe if it doesn't have a circle
it's called just a regular frame so to
make a keyframe click on any frame and
right click it and type insert keyframe
on the drop down list so click that and
now you can see that your frame has a
circle in it so once it's a keyframe we
can now draw on the stage so go ahead
and pick a shape I'll pick the rectangle
and draw any image as you can see we now
have a shape in our key frame this is
going to be our first frame
now go ahead to another section on the
timeline say go to 10 and enter another
keyframe so now this is our tenth frame
and since we're making an image to
change from one to 10 we want to move it
slightly to show check so now here's
image one in keyframe one and here's our
image in keyframe 10 so now if we go
ahead and play this image and you can do
this two way two ways go control down to
play or a faster way is a simply press
Enter you can go ahead and see that our
image is kind of hopping from one side
to the next now there's two ways that
you can animate your image the first way
is do it frame by frame so for instance
you can go click right here and then you
can Millie and then on the next frame
you can more on next frame little more
or there's easier way and the easier way
is called tweening and what tweening
does is tell flash to automatically fill
in the blanks to create a motion and
there are two types of tweens a shape
tween which lets you
between objects that are edible or also
change objects that are shapes or motion
tweens so anytime you don't want a tween
in a straight line you want to pick a
motion tween but for now we'll use a
shape tween and here's how you create a
shape tween click anywhere between your
two keyframes on the timeline and go
down here to tween and press shape as
you can see we now have a green arrow
pointing to the first keyframe the
second keyframe this tells flesh
automatically create frames so we can
animate our objects from keyframe the
keyframe now as you see when we test the
movie flash automatically created frames
to fill in the blanks to create the
effect of emotion in our image and you
can also do this when you don't want to
use a shame same image and you want a
more for your image so let's go ahead
and delete these keyframes and this is
how you do that any time you want to
remove frames frames or any you want to
delete right click it and click remove
frames and then let's go ahead and
insert a keyframe by right-clicking and
insert a keyframe and frame number one
now let's create a basic shape sure and
then let's go to another frame later
down on our timeline and insert another
keyframe so we can draw in it but
instead of a square we want to make this
one a circle
I gmail a circle in frame 20 and a
square and frame one now if we apply a
shape tween look what happens flash
automatically tweens your object to
morph into the shape of the latter
object or later one as you can see flash
automatically created frames in the
middle which allows you not having to
create key frame frame by frame and this
is how you use the shape tween to move a
single object to another place or to
morph and objects into another one and
these are some pretty basic tweens that
you can use to animate your animation
and then the next subject will be
talking more about some more animation
techniques and of course you can go to
my website the New Boston calm if you
missed anything I talked about today and
I'll give you a step-by-step tutorial
thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
