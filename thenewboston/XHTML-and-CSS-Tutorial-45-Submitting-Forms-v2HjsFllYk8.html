tutorial and before I start I want to
say that today March 13 2011 Duke has
just beaten UNC 75 to 58 so if you're a
Duke fan congratulations if you're a UNC
fan I'm sorry if you're watching this
video like two years later then this is
history
what do you care so anyways let's go
ahead and get to the tutorial it's time
for me to stop talking about basketball
and let's go ahead and say we're making
a forum right here the perfect forum and
now it's time to add why is this so my
screen looks like a doll for some reason
shouldn't it be brighter if this
tutorial looks like not as bright as the
other ones then uh let me know because
it looks that way to me
but anyways let's go ahead and give them
a place to enter their username and we
will do this with like input and type
equals text and name equals username and
go ahead and put an ending - right there
and my mom's texting with me let's see
what she said mama
who she's talking me about my cousin who
is this is another thing that's going on
right now there's an earthquake in Japan
recently and my cousin was telling her
about it so anyways that's what my mom
and my cousin were talking about now we
can continue okay so copy and paste and
now this one can be password and
password is really easy to just change
the type to password and the name to
pass or anything you want so now we have
this on our screen right here okay save
this and refresh it a username and
password so say the user fills out their
username and password but now they're
done and now the user wants to submit
their information to the website well
how can we have the user submit their
information to the website so that the
website can you know do whatever wants
with it stored in a database or make a
user account or whatever well in order
to have the user submit the data they
need the last well this is the last
input type I'm going to tell you about
and this is called submit now whenever
we make the type submit this appears
whoa that's definitely not how you do it
kind of getting ahead of myself here
type equals submit whenever we have a
submit button on the screen then I just
gave it away it makes a button appear on
the screen and what is that button say
on it well actually you have another
attribute here called value and whatever
you type in the value is what appears on
the button so now we're going to have
two fields a user and a password field
in this input type cement this means
make a submit button and what do you
want to sound it submit with explanation
point at the end so go ahead and save
this and refresh and check it out we now
can enter a user name and password and
they hit submit but now when they hit
submit nothing happens and that is
because I didn't tell you about this one
little thing first of all we don't know
any computer programming yet so I'm not
going to be getting it type talk to you
guys about that but in your opening form
tag you need two attributes by default
to tell you truth I can't even remember
if I went over this before
we're not but I don't think I have so
here you go later on when you learn how
to program in like PHP or something
you're going to have something called an
action and your action is basically
saying this whenever the user hits emits
hits the submit button what do you want
to do with all that data well typically
you have another file somewhere and then
this file is responsible for processing
this data the file is typically a small
computer program and say this program
would take their username and password
and store it in a database so the file
might be called something like do
something I'm just giving you guys an
example but you would write the file
name in right here and aside from this
attribute you also have something called
a method now a method has two possible
values get GE T or post and by the way
if you want to shut this tutorial off
right now then go ahead because this is
you know kind of advanced stuff they
don't have to worry about right now but
you're going to have to come back to it
sometime anyways it has two different
types of method get' impost and this is
basically the way your browser sends
data to a to the action so get basically
if you want to bookmark pages you know
what I'm not going to tell you this has
nothing to do with XHTML or CSS is more
like PHP so anyways just go ahead and
put post remember post is more secure
always use post there that's that's all
I'm going to cover so anyways that is
how you make a submit button even though
all we can do is you know click it right
now and nothing happens see it says what
page not found because it tried to go to
do something that file and you know
nothing happened because I didn't even
make that file but anyways that's what
happens that's the core basics behind
creating a Smith pond so later when we
learn JavaScript or PHP we can actually
do something with this information but
for now I'm sorry that's all you guys
get so all you Duke fans go enjoy go
celebrate
all you UNC fans go cry in a corner and
uh wait for next year so yeah that's it
thank you guys for watching and I'll see
you in the next oral</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
