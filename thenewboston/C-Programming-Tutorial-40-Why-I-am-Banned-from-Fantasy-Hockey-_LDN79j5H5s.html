video I'm going to be teaching you guys
a program that is pretty much the reason
why I got kicked off of a fantasy hockey
website and if you don't know what
fantasy hockey is then I'll explain it
in like two seconds it's pretty much um
a game that you can play on the computer
and you can actually bet money for it a
lot of people do that's what I was doing
and what you do is whatever players are
playing in a hockey game that night you
pick whatever players you're going to
think are going to do the best score the
most goals and whoever picks whatever
players correctly and they do score the
most goals then they win the money so
what people usually do is they look at
last year stats for that player but this
can kind of be deceiving because some
players score a lot of goals just
because they played in a lot of games it
doesn't mean they're a real good player
in another example is sometimes a really
good player gets injured so maybe they
didn't score a lot of goals that year
but you know that they're really good so
instead of just looking at the total
amount of goals they scored it's really
good to see how many goals they scored
per game so I'll show you guys how to
calculate that right now and we're going
to use something called parallel arrays
and if you guys don't really understand
how a fantasy hockey works or anything
like that it's going to be real simple
to follow along you guys are going to
probably want to play by the end of this
tutorial so we're going to be creating a
couple of rays and looping through them
all at the same time so let's go ahead
and make count variable and what we're
going to do is we're going to make our
first array of players now say that
we're only you want to test five players
right now but usually this is like 500
or everyone in the entire NHL or
whatever it is so I'll just put the
players number right here so there's a
player with the jersey sixty or excuse
me 58 66 68 71 and eighty-seven Sidney
Crosby awesome player except Milken my
favorite but anyways let's focus here
Bucky alright so the next array I want
to output is
how many goals they scored in total that
season so again five and in curly
brackets
I'll put know something like 26 39 25 29
and 31 so this is basically saying is
the player 58 scored 26 goals on 71
scored 29 goals so on and so forth so
all of these arrays are related so now
we just need a couple more things now
that we see how the arrays are related
so int games played and set this equal
to and the values don't really matter
here as long as you have five values in
there I'm going to set this equal to 30
30 28 we'll say that there's 30 games in
a season so a couple of players played
in all the games and of course this
player only played in 28 in this player
he got hurt so he could only play in 26
so I actually need three more variables
double or one of the other ones I need
is an array called PPG and this is
points per game so again this is how
many goals they scored but it doesn't
tell you who's the best because we want
to find out how many goals did they
score per game so for example oh let's
look at something so this guy he played
in 30 games but he scored 39 goals so
it's better than this guy who scored or
excuse me played in 30 games but he only
scored 26 goals so again this guy would
be better and you guys are going to see
real easy later on what I'm talking
about so um the last thing that we need
is a float and this is going to store
the best pretty much the best players
points per game and we'll just set this
equal to zero point zero right now and
the last thing we need is int best
player so I know that those are a lot of
variables in arrays but it actually only
takes like three or four lines of real
code aside from the loop to figure
everything out so now I'm just going to
create a basic forward loop and again
the idea of this for loop is to loop
through all of these players one by one
and calculate their points per game
average very simple stuff so for the
counter variable just by I work zucchini
I equals 0 to start PI I is less than 5
and I plus plus so this is going to loop
through five times like I said one for
each player so in order to calculate the
points per game see right now this is
empty and that actually should be a 5 in
there see right now this is a float
array that can hold five different
floats and it's going to hold the points
per game for each player
so we'll put PPG and i and just like
before i want to show you guys how to
are manually type stuff in well you can
also do it algorithmically so of course
the points per game is goals of that
player and each player is i over the
game's played for that player now check
this out um real quick the points per
game is pretty much a statistic and any
statistic we want to make sure to
include the decimal point it's a flow
however goals of course you can't score
half a goal and you can't play in half a
game
well maybe you can if you get injured
but not in this case so what we want to
do is since we're looking for a float
right here we need to typecast these
intz into floats so that's what I'm a
case scenario where typecasting does
come in handy so even though these are
intz on the right-hand side we want to
treat them as floats so that way
whenever we do this arithmetic we get
our answer points per game in a float
and a nice decimal so the next thing I
want to do is just print out something
on the screen so I'm going to loop
through five times in
I'm pretty much going to print the
player stats on each row so it looks
like a real pretty looking table so
again
um the first thing I'm going to print
out is their number so percent the tab
I'll print out the the number the goals
the game is played in the points per
game so percent T actually can do this
percent the percent the percent D and
the last one is the float so that's why
I wanted to do percent F and we'll just
display to two decimal places and
remember each player is on a new line so
kick it on a new line and now you have
to say okay well this is the format what
exactly do you want me to print out well
the first one is just the player so this
is going to print out their jersey
number the second one what did I want to
do I'll go ahead and print out their
goals how many goals they scored that
season the third one is games played and
the last one is what we just calculated
points per game and this is pretty much
the value that we're looking for the
player with the best points per game as
you know is the one that we want so
right now we can actually just do
something like this if we run this baby
right now and we get an error because
why n is because this goal is supposed
to be goals all right now try this again
and check it out so this is what we have
right now the player 58 scored 26 goals
in 30 games so he had an average of 0.87
goals per game the player is 66 he is
what he looks like the best because he
scored 39 goals in 30 games 1.3 points
per game um this guy down here
87 pretty good too he scored 31 goals
not anywhere near the most but he only
did it
he only it only took him 26 games to do
it so that's why his stats are so high
so we could actually just finish this
right now and say ok find the one with a
high
points per game at 66 easy enough
however the problem with this is
whenever you're doing this for an entire
league whether it's a soccer a football
league or a hockey league looking
through all that data can be kind of
painstaking so what I like to do is add
a really simple conditioner right here
that just at the end it just tells you
who the best player is and this is
actually really easy to do
so of course we get the best player
based on their points per game so we'll
say that if points per game for whatever
player you're currently looping through
is greater than the best points per game
and again this is going to say okay the
first time we'll say that the first
player is the best sense by default it's
zero and then every other time so right
now on the first loop on 58 is the best
on the second loop it's going to say 66
is the best and he's going to remain the
best as long as no one beats Mount so as
long as no player is better than um the
current player with a high score I guess
a good call and the logic that we use to
do that is this should probably talk
this out before I start talking and the
best player which we store it right
there is equal to player I where you at
player I and I actually I just finish
this program real quick and then I'll
explain you guys what this last line
does printf and I'll kick this to a new
line too and put the best player is
percent d new line and of course we're
going to store the best player in this
and let me print it out and then I'll
talk you guys through it so right now it
pretty much not only calculated the
players points per game which is awesome
but it also automatically just gave us
the best player at the end so we don't
have to you know look through 500 pieces
of data manually now we already know
what this forward loop does or
here I just explained it but the reason
that we get the best player at the end
is because it always stores the guy with
the highest score until it gets
overridden so this is the player you're
looping through and this condition is
only going to be true if they're better
than the current and best points per
game player so if they are then we say
okay the best points per game is now
this points per game which would mean
that the best player is that player
again both I which in this case would be
0 1 pretty freakin sweet so that is how
you check for the best player and he
gets stored in this variable until you
decide to print them out at the end so
if you guys don't quite understand how
fantasy hockey works then at least you
understand how to loop through and these
are called parallel arrays they're
pretty much arrays that you can use in
parallel with each other for example
every player has goals games played in
points per game and well whenever you're
making something like a spreadsheet or
something like that you're going to use
these a lot so uh well that's actually
all I have for you for now I don't want
to blow your brain up so I'm gonna go
you know cheat at fantasy hockey a
little more if you wanted to I welcome
you um if you want to add some more
columns then Adam post them on my forum
so I can check them out I'd love to see
them but for now then guys for watching
and a smile you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
