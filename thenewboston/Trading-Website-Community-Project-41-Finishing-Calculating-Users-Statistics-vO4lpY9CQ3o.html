variable call it a result and set it
equal to my SQL underscore query now is
the query let me set everything up what
we wanted to do is select and it really
doesn't matter what we select but I'm
just going to go ahead and select item
number because we're we really only are
worried about how many rows this query
returns so we can really return any
piece of debt it doesn't really matter
same number of rows whatever from items
available where owner ID is equal to and
that is where user is so if I was user
11 it would say we're only owner ID is
equal to 11 which would give me all of
my items available now it returns all of
my items available but I don't want the
items that are available or for trading
yet I only want the items that are
pending review so now we add that clause
and the status of the item equals
pending so again in your items available
table you can have several different
items with different statuses one of
them can be you know trade completed one
of them could be pending review one of
them could be active when it's you know
ready to trade and people can offer it
but now I only want to return pending so
that's why I'm doing that so now what is
the goal of this function well what we
want to do is return a number that can
basically go right after this so of
course if I had one item pending then I
would want to return the number one
between parentheses if I had 0 items
pending for example I have zero active
items right now so we don't want to
return anything so keep that in mind we
don't want to return a 0 in between
parentheses we don't want to return
anything at all so the only time we want
to return these parenthesis is if you
have a number greater than 0 remember
them so we'll write that in if
if my SQL in in order to get the number
of rows put num rows and well your guys
are going to see what's going on in
second so what it's going to do is it's
going to get that a copy that the number
of rows that this result returns now if
it's equal to zero then that means you
have no items pending so we don't want
it to say anything else however for this
function to be complete it needs to
return something so what we are going to
do is we're going to return a string
either way in this case just go ahead
and return an empty string like that so
then your function you know says okay I
return something so I'm not going to
give you a message but it returns
nothing so that's what it's going to
display else now hopefully I don't know
i don't want to say hopefully but if we
have some items pending such as three
items what we want to do is we want to
return those two parentheses with the
number three in between it so go ahead
and write return except in this case go
ahead and write double quotation marks
now the first thing we want to do is we
want to turn return those parentheses so
go ahead and put an opening parenthesis
right here and the closing parenthesis
right here now in between these two
parentheses we want to append a string
aka the number so of course whenever
you're joining things insurance in PHP
use the little dots which pretty much
means of course like I just said append
to a string now what do we want to
append well we want to append the number
of rows it returned oh look how
convenient this is right here we already
got that baby right there so return
however many number of rows right there
now of course this can't be zero because
if it was zero it would have returned
nothing so the only time you're
returning a number
in between parentheses is if you have
number 1 or greater so this is basically
the same exact code that we're going to
use the calculate active items completed
trades so for example if we wanted to
calculate active items we would say okay
select item number from items available
where owner ID equals user and status
equals active so that's how easy it is
to pretty much calculate the statistics
for anything just go ahead and write the
table name right here in your criteria
after your where clause and again like I
said go ahead and save this and even
though i'm not going to walk you guys
through the rest of the functions that's
basically how you do it so i'm going to
give you guys like 10 other functions if
you guys don't understand then just
leave me a comment in the forum so
anyways thank you guys for watching and
we're going to subscribe and I'll see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
