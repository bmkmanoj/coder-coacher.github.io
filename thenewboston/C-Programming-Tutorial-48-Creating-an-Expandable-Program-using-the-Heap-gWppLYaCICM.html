bursting with knowledge about the heap
let's go ahead and actually make an
expandable application utilizing the
heat because I mean that was the goal of
all his crap what wasn't it so what I'm
going to be doing is I'm going to be
making a program where I don't know will
say that the user can enter a bunch of
numbers and average them together
however we're going to be doing it a
little bit differently than we have
before because before we can just be
like I don't know create an array with
like ten numbers well in this program
we're going to allow the user to enter
exactly how many numbers they want to
average together and this would be
awesome again this is just going to be a
really simple concept but this is good
for if you have a bunch of students into
college or employees for a company you
can use this and expand it to pretty
much make any program you want so we
need a couple counters int I and how
many this this is just going to be the
counter variable and this how many is um
how many items you want to store like um
students employees tomato tomahto and
now we just need some stuff for to
calculate the average so total float
average is just set this to 0.04 right
now I'm going to be changing that and
from this last tutorial actually
tutorials I guess I should say int
points array now the first thing we can
do is pretty much give them a prompt to
be like alright um I guess we'll just
like average I don't know whatever
number so how many numbers do you want
to average and yes we don't need
anything else so kick that to a new line
and now we need a way to scan it in so
scanf but I keep hitting D the heck
% D and of course um whatever they enter
we're going to store in this variable
how many so this is just a regular
integer so we need that ampersand how
many so now we got how many numbers they
wanted average store it in that variable
we can move on so what we need to do now
is say okay go to the heap and create an
array that's this big
so they if they if they entered 5 create
an array that's five elements long that
can store five integers in this case so
we'll put points array already did it
for us
sweet equals what are we storing well we
are storing intz so typecast this
to int because we need to do that
whenever we allocate memory and then
malloc and the first thing remember is
how many of these items you want to
store in in the last story we just wrote
five but now the user actually entered
that value manually and then multiply
this by the size of however big it
integer is on your computer so again if
the user enters 5 and I is 4 bytes long
it's going to say ok this is 4 bytes
multiply it by 5 so we have 20 bytes
then go ahead and reserve 20 bytes of
memory so we can store a bunch of stuff
in this point array so now this points
array is just like a normal array we can
use point 0 I might as well type that
out so what the it's not what I'm trying
to there we go so now we can use stuff
like point 0 points 1 points 2 we can
just treat this is a normal array
however it's a lot cooler because um the
user kind of helped in creating it and
it's expandable so pretty sweet let's go
ahead and do something else now
so printf so now that we have space to
store a bunch of numbers we can just
give them a little prompt and be like
well enter them pause
explanation let them really know that we
really wanted to enter them so the next
thing I want to do is this now that they
pretty much have that little prompt
we're just going to loop through and
allow them to enter um five different
numbers so four and this is where that
counter variable comes in so I is it
actually what the heck am i doing I'm
just thinking about star crunches to be
honest because they are delicious and I
have them stuck in my teeth
because I just ate about 40 of them so I
is less than how many and I plus plus
you know what actually been programming
a Python for the last couple I don't
know the last couple of days and in
Python you don't use any semicolons and
you don't even use these little curly
brackets it's really weird
so that's why I'm like okay how do you
program C again I don't know thud ooh I
forgot so alright so anyways we need a
way for these to scan in a bunch of
different numbers so percent D and again
this is going to run five different
times and store it in points array
aye-aye-aye
alright so after this what they're going
to do is they're pretty much going to
enter a number and you're going to store
in points array 0 1 2 3 4
until our array is completely populated
with however many numbers they chose to
enter so of course just a calculate the
average we need the total or sum of
those numbers so points array I pretty
much for each loop whatever number they
enter add it to a total and this is just
so we can figure out the average later
on which we will do right now so now
that we have an array this is the easy
stuff first of all set this equal to
type has the flow total
and put this I guess what might as well
add some space actually I'm just going
to copy this because I'm too lazy to
type two freakin characters and how many
now remember both of these variables
total and how many were integers so the
average is a float so we need to
typecast those the floats and of course
in order to figure out the average
something you take the total amount by
however many items and boom there you
have it so printf will just put
something like average is % F and
average so pretty free well I almost saw
curse there and proper shine through
that for you too so pretty freakin sweet
and hopefully I don't have any bugs here
all right dude how many numbers you want
to average let's just enter five numbers
says well enter them hasta que take it
easy there all right so what are these
like points up with like 21 28 62 87 and
for this guy sucks so hit enter it says
the average is 56 point zero zero zero
so if you ever want to know what the
average of all these numbers were there
you go and if you want to learn how to
make an expandable program using the
heap with all of the knowledge that we
ever learned then you also got that at
this tutorial as well and by the way in
order to get a job programming see the
heap is one of the things that you
definitely need to know arm like the
back of your hand so watch these last
couple tutorials learn it if you have
any questions ask me on my forum and in
the next tutorial I'm going to be
talking to you guys about structures so
there's a lot more to the heap but I
just wanted to show you guys the basics
and now we can move on to something and
to tell you truth is a lot easier than
all this graphs so next story structures
see there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
