incredible physics tutorial and in this
lesson I want to talk to you guys about
some acceleration equations specifically
the equation of distance traveling
because unless it's oriole we're talking
about tuna cans falling from buildings
and I told you guys that acceleration
stays the same but speed increases but I
never told you guys how far that tuna
can traveled from top of the building so
I want to show you guys the formula of
how to calculate distance traveled so
distance traveled would you say it's d
let me change my pen size here okay so
distance traveled is equal to the
original velocity and I'll write this V
with a subscript of O times time now the
time is the time passed so if that tuna
can fell for three seconds you would put
three right here if it fell for 16
seconds T would be equal to 16 so on and
so forth now you take that and you add
it to one half acceleration now whenever
we calculate acceleration or distance
traveled of things falling the
acceleration like I said is always 9.8
meters per second squared so just
remember that this is always going to be
nine point eight times time past squared
so let's say I know this is indeed a
confusing equation but let me go ahead
and give an example and hopefully I can
clear things up so let's calculate how
far the tuna can traveled after falling
for one second so after one second what
was the distance and whenever I say how
far I mean the distance from the top of
the building so let's go ahead and solve
this baby distance equals original
velocity so what was the original
velocity of that tuna cam well it was
zero it started out not moving at all it
just started out in our hands now
basically the time passed it really
doesn't matter because check this out
whenever you have time
even though it was after one second
anything new times by zero is going to
be zero
so whenever the original velocity is
zero this part of the equation is always
equal to zero so we can go ahead and
multiply this by one and go ahead and
put that in a little bit neater
parenthesis but the fact of the matter
is this is always going to be zero
whenever your original velocity is zero
so now what we need to do is we need to
add one-half acceleration now
acceleration of gravity is always 9.8
and I'll just throw that into
parentheses and time passed squared so
the time passed is 1 and I'm going to
square that so if you go ahead and
figure all this out it's basically this
one squared is 1 so it's basically 1/2
times 9.8 so the distance traveled of
that tune can is equal to 1/2 times 9.8
so the distance traveled after 1 second
is 4.9 and if we go ahead and throw in
all our units we end up with meters so
just remember that whenever you drop the
tunic and from the top of a building
after one second it'll be four point
nine meters away from you pretty cool
huh so let's go ahead and take a look at
another example let's say that we wanted
to calculate the distance how far was it
away from you after two seconds so let's
go ahead and write our equation again
and I'm going to show you guys one more
example and then hopefully I pound this
concept through your head so the
original velocity times time plus 1/2 my
plus signs and T's kind of look similar
but this is a T this is a plus sign one
half acceleration time squared so the
distance traveled away from you and I'll
just go ahead and write this two seconds
distance equals question mark so let's
go ahead and calculate current some
numbers so basically what I say after
two seconds so the original velocity is
still zero and we can go ahead and times
that by the time pass which is two but
this is going to give a zero nonetheless
so that basically all cancels out don't
even worry about that that's zero what
we would do want to do is add one-half
acceleration which is nine point eight
times time squared now this time what we
do is we have two squared + 2 squared
equals four so the distance traveled
after two seconds equals one-half times
nine point eight times nine point eight
times four why because 2 squared is 4 so
if we go ahead and calculate that baby
just like that I think we end up with
nineteen point six meters let me double
check it times four six yep nineteen
point six meters so again if you are
standing on the top of the building and
you drop a tuna can and it follows for
two seconds after two seconds that tuna
cannon is going to be nineteen point six
meters away from you so after one second
after one second of falling
it is going to be what I say for point
nine four point nine meters and after
two seconds it's going to be nineteen
point six meters now there you go that's
how you calculate the distance traveled
whenever you have these pieces of the
puzzle right here now what I want you
guys to do for homework is calculate
after eight seconds if your building was
that tall how far with the tuna can be
away from you and the first person to
come up with the correct answer is the
winner so leave a comment on this video
with your answer and we'll see who the
smartest youtuber is out there so I
think you guys for watching don't forget
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
