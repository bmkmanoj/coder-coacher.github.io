tutorial that I'm making for the New
Boston and in this tutorial we're going
to learn more about methods so all
you're going to need for this tutorial
is the button and once you have it on
your form just go ahead and double click
on it alright so in the previous
tutorial we learned how to create a
method so we will just type Lloyd then
we were just going to name for our
method I'm just going to call it in my
method and then we also learned about
parameters and passing them through to
our block of code so we were just put
empty parameter right there empty
parentheses if you didn't need the user
to input any data and then right inside
these two curly braces is the code block
so whenever the user calls this method
all the code inside of here will be
executed so we were to just go up here
and type my method then once we call
this method right here all the code
inside of these two curly braces would
be executed all right and then if we had
the user passed through a parameter such
as a string I was call it name then up
here the user would have to pass through
a string so we just pass through Adam
and now what it would do right here is
just set this string called name equal
to Adam and then we can use this
variable inside of this code blocker
here all right so that's just a quick
overview of the previous tutorial and in
the previous tutorial I told you you're
going to be learning about this in the
next tutorial so basically what this is
right here is it's the return type so
this method right here
currently armed doesn't hold the value
of anything since its return type right
here is void and void just basically
mean that this method doesn't represent
anything so if we were to just call my
method right here and we have to pass
through a string so if I just pass
through Adam now my method doesn't
represent anything so we can't set this
equal to anything well let's say we
wanted this to represent a string what
we'd have to do right here is change
this void to string so now basically
what this does is my method represents a
string and now to tell it what string
it's going
represent we're to stamp the type return
right here and then the string that you
wanted to represent and we're just going
to have it represent the string that is
passed through so we're just going to
say return name so basically what's
going to happen here is we just pass
through name through this method then if
that's the string called name equal to
Adam then I just returns Adam sense name
is equal to Adam and now that we
returned this name right here my method
is equal to Adam so now what we could do
right here is just display in a message
box this method and we should just get
Adam and it's just to make sure that
this works here and we can just put this
inside of here because this represents a
string as indicated by the return type
all right so let's just go ahead and
make sure that this works - just get
Adam yeah perfect sorry and you could
just return something static we don't
have to make it be what the user passes
through right here so you could just say
return hello and then we would just get
hello inside of a message box sense what
it does or hears it is calls this method
and this method remember represents a
string and then it just sets my method
equal to hello and then it just displays
that inside of a message box so we
should just get hello yep perfect
and usually methods are used for
calculations so the return type is
usually int but it doesn't have to be so
we could say um interfere and now this
method represents an integer so now what
we'd have to do right here is just
return a number so this return 6 so now
my method represents an integer and
since this represents an integer right
here
we're just have to say dot to shrink
convert it into a string so that we can
display it inside of a message box so
now inside of our message box we should
just get 6 yep perfect and you can make
the return type for a method anything
you want so if we wanted to make it be a
bool or an object you could do that so
if you just made it a Google right here
and then we can dis return true so now
basically what it's doing it is setting
the return
for my method to be cool and then we're
just returning true so my method
represents true so in a message box we
should just get true because it converts
my method which is true into a string
and we should just get true a message
box yep
perfect all right so that's pretty much
it for this tutorial on methods so see
you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
