to your 25th draft tutorial intermediate
Jeff tutorial and in this tutorial we
are finally going to be finishing
hopefully if I don't get a up on another
topic and run out of time but my plan
for this tutorial is to finally finish
up our program of sliding a slider and
changing the size of a oval so in the
lesson surah what we did is we built
that little thing called a slider on the
screen so right now it's just chillin
there we can slide it back and forth it
has ticks marks on it it looks nice but
it doesn't really have any functionality
so in order to have functionality and
actually make it do something useful we
need to add a listener to it now what a
listener is is it's a little tiny
program that sits on your slider and I
don't mean like sits on it like you can
see it but it's built into your slider
so when you actually slide it and move
it it actually says RA I'm supposed to
be doing something in the case of our
program changing the diameter of our
circle so in order to do that on what we
need to do is every object has a
different type of listener and every
object has a different type of event
that registers this one is state changed
so and you know enough of me talking
let's just go ahead and start typing in
order to add a listener for a slider you
put add change listener and this is the
type of listener that you use now go
ahead and put a colon after that and
this argument is going to take a whole
bunch of crap in this so go ahead and
give yourself some room and that's
probably enough right here so inside
your argument for your listener go ahead
and write new change listener let me
make sure I spell there right close
enough and now what this is is this a
method that's going to take stuff in
here as well so you actually have to
type in a bunch of stuff before you even
get to the actual
coding so inside your change listener
this means when something changed what
do you want to do well we need one more
method in here public void state change
and this is a built-in method in Java so
if you're saying alright when are we
going to be building this we aren't
gonna it's already built for us sorry
the parameter is change event and just
name it
e now what E is is it's an event how can
I put this any time you change your
slider and by change I mean move an
event occurs and any time an event
occurs a piece of code is going to run
and we're saying all right what piece of
code is going to run well whatever we
type in here so we already set this
program up perfectly to say re whenever
we change our slider we want to get
whatever value that slider is it
currently and we want you to pass it in
for it's a new diameter and if this
diameter is valid then we want you to
change a circle to that size of the
diameter so we already set up every
method we just have to column just put
my panel dot set D and remember set D
let me click let me try find it what set
D does is is going to change the
diameter and repaint circle so if we're
saying R a so what exactly what value
are we going to pass it in well the
value we're gonna pass it in is slider
dot get value and what this is going to
do is it's going to look on your slider
and according to where you slid the
little slider what value that it's
sitting it currently it's going to pass
that value in to set diameter and that
is what it's going to paint on your
screen so if you're confused then just
look at it for like two seconds um so
pretty much we get value from the slider
we pass it in to set D and it paints on
screen simple enough so now what we need
to do is
is make sure we have our of our brackets
and outside of your call to add change
listener but inside your constructor
once you're done doing everything we now
need to add everything to the window so
we build a bunch of stuff or programmed
it now we actually need to put it on the
window just for looks and I'm going to
be putting in of course in order to do
that you just use the add method so just
put add and it takes two parameters add
slider first and border layout south and
let me just yeah let me just copy that
because I'm lazy don't want to have to
type anything copy/paste so we added the
slider now we want to add my panel which
is pretty much the background and the
circle so now with those three things we
added everything and we want this to
appear in the center so now that we
added the slider at the bottom which is
south and the panel which consists of
the circle in the background and the
center we're ready to go to our main
window call everything get a set up so
just go to your main class and by main
class I mean whatever class has your
main method and you first need to create
a window object so the window I'll name
mine W set equal to new the window and
remember this didn't take any arguments
in the constructor so now what we need
to do is set now that we have a window
object we can take care of some
necessary things W set default close
operation and you definitely need to do
this J frame dot exit on closed
there we go and you need to do this
because if you don't have this whenever
you try to exit your program and click X
it won't exit unless you have this why
they set that up this way too I'm not
sure talk to someone else not me so now
that we have that we can set size for
our window so put w dot set size and
this is pretty much all preference
completely up to you I'm going to set
mine let's see two thirty by two eighty
that should fit nicely on make sure it
fits in this little tutorial box but if
you guys are just building this on your
own you might want a bigger might not I
don't know and the last thing we need to
do is make sure the window is visible so
W dot set visible and you pass it in
Abilene and we want it true so this
pretty much just make sure the window
pops up on your screen if you set
visible to false then it would be just
be hidden somewhere
aka totally worthless so let's go ahead
and run this and see if we didn't get
any errors which probably did nope and
look at our beautiful program that we
just built as you see by default it
starts out at ten and we have tick marks
every 10 from 0 to 100 and when we slide
it our circle goes from 0 to 200 in
diameter and it can't go less than 200
or excuse me can't go more than 200
can't go less than 0 so that is an
amazing program look at the beauty of it
I think I'm going to take the source
code mail it off to Microsoft and see if
they'll accept me is a read programming
manager for building circles you guys
can do whatever you want but that's what
I'm going to do so thank you for
watching this tutorial don't forget to
subscribe and I don't know what I'm
going to be teaching next but it's going
to be awesome so one last time thank you
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
