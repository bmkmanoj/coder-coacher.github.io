angles formed by intersecting lines
there's three types of angles we're
going to talk about today first are the
corresponding angles and there are
angles that occur in the same place so
the angle on this line that corresponds
which like we're going to talk about
angle one first so the angle on this
line that corresponds to this angle is
angle five because they happen in the
same place on each line the angle that
corresponds to angle 2 is angle 6 so
angle 1 and angle 5 are a pair angle 2
and angle 6 are a pair angle 3 and angle
7 are a pair and angle for an angle 8 or
a pair so the alternate interior angles
occur on the inside of these two lines
and when you draw them they draw a Z so
if I want you this is an alternate
interior angle with
this angle see how these two angles
because we want the angle that's on the
inside of these two and on the inside of
these two so when I rare you look for
alternate interior angles you look
frizzy so angle 3 and angle 6 are
alternate interior angles and angle 4
and angle 5 are alternate interior
angles because they're alternate because
ones on this side and ones on this side
and their interior because they're on
the interior of these two lines so
alternate exterior angles so if we start
with this one because it's on the
outside there's no other line right if
there were a line right here it wouldn't
be an exterior angle so we start with
this one and we want alternate so we
want it on the other side and it needs
to be down here because it needs to be
on the other side of these two so these
two are alternate exterior angles and 2
and 7 or alternate exterior angles so we
have these lines and we're gonna find
named two pairs of alternate interior
angles so these are the ones that make
the Z so we're gonna just any two you
want so first we're going to start with
this line right here we're gonna go down
and across so that means that this angle
and this angle are alternate
now alternate interior angles and we're
going to do the same thing on this side
8 and 11 but if you look angles 6 an
angle 9 are also alternate interior
angles and number angle 7 and angle 12
but they only asked us for two so named
four pairs of corresponding angles so
corresponding angles are just angles
that happen in the same place so if I
start on this top left angle this angle
corresponds to this angle on this line
so angle 1 and angle 9 this angle now
this this doesn't mean that they're
congruent these are just the angles that
correspond to one another so angle 2 and
angle 10 angle 3 and angle 11 angle 4
and angle 12 now one more kind of angle
to do which is the alternate exterior
angles so we want one angle that's on
this side of what's on this side of this
line we want an exterior angle so we're
going to start with one we want an angle
that's on this side and that's an
alternate angle so angle 1 and angle 14
we do the same
thing we get angle three in eleven you
these ones don't really form a special
shape but this is just so you can see
which angles match up so the reason we
went over these today is so that in the
next lesson we can talk about
corresponding angle is formed by
parallel lines</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
