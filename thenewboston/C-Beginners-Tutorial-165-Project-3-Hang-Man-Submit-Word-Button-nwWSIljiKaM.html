tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial we're going
to finish working on our hangman project
so really all the way I've left to do is
handle them user submits a word so we're
just going to go ahead and double click
on the submit word button right here
alright so the first thing that we're
going to want to do is check to see if
the word that the user submitted is
correct so we're going to say here text
box choose text and text box to is this
text box right here next to this and
that word button and we're going to
check to see if that text box is text is
equal to word that we generated and if
it is we're just going to have a message
box show telling the user that they've
won so let's say or a year you have one
and then we're just going to want to
make the title of this message box can
you Congrats so congrats and then we're
just going to want to call the reset
game method so that the user have a
chance to play again so we're just going
to say use that game right here and now
the game will be reset and they can
display again alright and now we're just
going to want to handle if the user gets
it wrong so it's can see right here else
so if text box twos text isn't a random
word then we're going to tell them that
they have guessed wrong or isn't it's a
message box show word that you guess is
wrong and then we're just going to want
to make the title of this message box
key sorry alright and now we're just
going to want to draw the next body part
so similar to what we did when you use
your guess the letter or just going to
cast the amount variable as a body part
so I'm just going to say draw a body
part right here and then we're just
going to put body parts and parentheses
before the amount variable you basically
just turn it into a body part and then
we're just going to want to increment
amount by one after all that is done so
that the next body part that is drawn
will be the next body part in the series
in the enumeration and we're also going
to want to check to see if the user has
lost so if it's already drawn all the
body parts relevant they're up they've
lost so we can just go ahead and copy
this code up here so we don't have to
rewrite it so basically what this will
do is just check to see if ammount
equals 9 and if amount equals 9 then
that means that all the body parts have
been drawn and then we're just going to
have a message box show saying that they
have lost and we're going to tell them
what the word was and then we're just
going to want to reset the game so that
they have a chance to play again all
right so that's pretty much all there is
to making this program so let's just go
ahead and test it out and see if it
works
so now let's just go ahead and guess a
letter guess eh nope it's not in there
so as you can see it'll add it to that
mislabel right there and it'll draw it
into our panel or draw the head pain
from the hang post we guess another
letter like you'll see if that's in
there and if he is in there it'll put in
the correct place in the word we try to
guess a word like see if it's below it
obviously isn't even the right place but
let's just guess anyways sorry they
guess the word that you've guessed is
wrong and as you can see it will just
draw the next body part and yeah we're
all good to go now if we submit a lot
another letter
like why nope wrong and then it shows up
down there and I'll draw another body
part so I guess our game is finished so
that's it for this tutorial so see you
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
