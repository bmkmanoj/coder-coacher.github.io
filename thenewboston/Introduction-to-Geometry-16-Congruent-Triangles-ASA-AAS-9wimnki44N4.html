lesson of congruent triangles and this
time we're gonna learn about
angle side angle and angle angle side
which are two other methods of proving
triangles are congruent so for the first
one angle sine angle we know that two
angles and the included side of one
chart of one triangle are congruent to
the corresponding parts of another
triangle so for these ones I know that
this angle and this angle are congruent
I know this angle in this angle are
congruent and since I know that this
side which falls between these two
angles is congruent in this side which
falls between these two angles I can say
therefore triangle a is congruent to
triangle B by angle side angle we always
want to give a reason as to why they're
congruent so angle angle side is the
fourth one we're going to learn so we
know that two angles and the non
included the non included side of one
triangle are congruent to the
corresponding parts of another triangle
so I know that this is congruent to this
this is congruent to this and that this
ain't this side which does not fall
between these two angles because that
would be angle side angle on this side
which does not fall between these two
angles are congruent
therefore triangle a is congruent to
triangle B by angle and
little side so now that we know two more
ways to prove triangles are congruent
we're gonna see what's going on with
these triangles right here so for the
first one I know that this angle is
congruent to this angle this angle is
congruent to this angle and this side is
congruent to this side well to know if
we're gonna use angle side angle or
angle angle side the thing that really
matters is which sides are which sides
are congruent since this side is
included between these two angles and
this side is also included between these
two angles we know that we're going to
use angle side angle because we have an
angle and a side and an angle congruent
to an angle a side and an angle so
therefore when I call this a and this B
triangle a is congruent to triangle B by
angle side angle now we have this one we
know these two angles are congruent and
this angle is congruent to this angle
well we don't know that any sides are
congruent but since this these two
triangles share this side right here we
can say that it's congruent to itself so
we have an angle an on included side and
another angle congruent to an angle an
on included side and another angle so
therefore call this C and this is D
triangle C is congruent to triangle T
by angle-angle-side and we have one more
so this triangle is congruent to this
triangle this angle is congruent to this
angle and they share this side so since
this side falls between the two
congruent angles we're gonna use angle
side angle and we can say that triangle
E is congruent to triangle F by angle
side angle so next lesson we're going to
learn about the last way to prove
triangles are congruent so make sure you
