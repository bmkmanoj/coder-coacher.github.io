your 10th physics lecture and in this
lecture what I want to do is I want to
talk about Newton's laws of motion
specifically his first law but before I
do that I have to tell you guys a story
I just got home from going out to eat
with my mom and when I was at the little
I don't even know what it was not a cafe
but I was at the restaurant and I
overheard some girl talking to her
boyfriend and this is actually a
question that she asked them she goes
what part of the cow does the meatloaf
come from meatloaf can you believe that
that's what she actually said but
anyways we're not here to talk about
meatloaf girl we are here to learn some
physics so in this tutorial like I said
I want to talk to you about Newton's
first law now this was a dude that lived
long ago and he came up with a bunch of
laws but maybe his most famous was his
first law this is also known as the law
of mass and inertia and of course it
says in object motion tends to stay in
motion but the full law is this actually
there are a bunch of different
variations but this is the most popular
version an object at rest tends to stay
at rest and an object in motion tends to
stay in motion at a constant speed
unless acted upon by an outside force
what the heck what did I just say it's
basically this in you know that was the
terminology they probably used long ago
but nowadays it's like this if you have
an object in it sitting there not moving
it's going to keep not moving until you
go up and kick it or something
likewise if you have an object in motion
like a space shuttle or something
and it's moving and you know five
hundred miles an hour it's going to keep
moving if five hundred miles an hour
unless acted upon by an outside force
aka a meat-eor or maybe the force of
gravity so that's basically what it
means why we have to you know define
this it seems common sense to me but
this will dude decided to put a couple
laws on it so now we are stuck here
having to learn them
another thing that physicists decide to
do is they wanted to add some
terminology or vocabulary because this
wasn't just you
see to understand enough they had to
make it confusing a little bit they said
all objects have something called
inertia now inertia is the property of
matter that causes it to resist change
in motion so it's basically the property
that keeps things standing still or
keeps things moving so one of the
factors that you need to take into
account whenever you're calculating
inertia is mass so therefore mass and
inertia are related therefore even
furthermore the more mass in object has
the more inertia it has so let me go
ahead and show you guys an example say
you had a big refrigerator that was 70
kilograms and you had a smaller mini
fridge that was only thirty kilograms so
according to Newton since refrigerator a
has more mass than refrigerator B it
therefore has more inertia so therefore
it was more likely to resist change in
motion so if you had to decide whether
you wanted to move a or B up the stairs
you obviously would choose B because why
well obviously because it's smaller in
weighs less but the technical physics
definition is because refrigerator B has
less mass and therefore less inertia
therefore according to Newton's first
law of mass inertia it would be you know
easier to move so on and so forth you
get the point so let me go ahead and
show you guys one more example before I
let you guys go and that is the famous
this actually isn't famous this I'm
probably the first one to ever do this
example but say you have two balls
traveling at the same speed two huge
balls go ahead bring on the jokes so you
have one that's 80 kilograms and you
have a smaller ball that's only let's
say actually they almost look the same
size that's only
20 kilograms and they're both traveling
whipping through the air we same exact
speed well even though these are both
bowling balls let's say in they're
traveling at the same exact speed the 80
kilogram bowling ball would be harder to
stop than the 20 kilogram bowling ball
why because the 80 kilogram bowling ball
has more mass therefore more inertia
therefore it's more resistant to change
in motion so just remember that I know
this is kind of obvious stuff obviously
the heavier something is but Newton made
all these laws and therefore we as
students need to learn them all or else
you know you can't get your degree or
you're going to fail your test so thank
you new in for all that stuff so anyways
I'm going to go ahead and probably make
a meatloaf right now you guys watch this
video again and once you grasp this
knowledge of Newton's first law I'll see
in the next video where we're going to
be talking about Newton's other laws</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
