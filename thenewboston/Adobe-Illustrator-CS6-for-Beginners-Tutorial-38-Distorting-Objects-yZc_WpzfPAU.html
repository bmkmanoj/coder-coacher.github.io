Illustrator cs6 tutorial my name is
buddy today we're gonna be learning how
to distort objects or in other words in
Illustrator terms we're gonna learn how
to reshape objects with envelopes and
envelopes are objects that you can use
to reshape other objects you can't you
can't reshape graphs guides or linked
objects but you can reshape like regular
objects just to keep it that in mind
there's built in like pre-made or pre
shaped envelopes or you can use like a
grid to warp your shape and I'm going to
show you how to do these now so go ahead
make a shape take your selection tool
and select your object it can be one or
more objects then we're gonna go to
object to the object menu up here we're
going to go to envelope distort and the
first one we're going to click on is
make with warp and these use a preset
Warped shape so if we see the style here
we've got a bunch of different kind of
things arc and then arches and a bunch
of different other things that we've got
going on here so I'll just stick with
arc for now we can either do it a
vertical or a horizontal arc and if you
want to see what these all do click on
this preview here and then that's what
the arc is gonna do here's a vertical
it's going that way instead you can
check some other things out and you can
get some cool looking shapes made out of
these all right we'll just stick with
arc for now now we've got the next thing
which is Bend and this is how much it's
gonna actually Bend the warp and then
you can go negative to go the other way
or positive to even and go higher up to
even bend it even more so that's
depends on you then we got some
distortion here you can go ahead with
mess with this to get different effects
and get more perspective on it and
everything
here's a vertical distortion
it's almost honest a different plane now
it's like kind of making a 3d so keep
those in mind so those are your
different warps and then you hit OK when
you're done and it'll apply this effect
here to your object I'm gonna hit cancel
going to object again we're gonna go to
FL of the story and this time we're
gonna make with mesh and we're gonna
have an envelope mesh it says up here
we've got four rows and four columns and
that's the default
I hit preview and you can see how many
there are and you can use you can
increase these to get more rows or
columns it's up to you what you want to
use I think I'm gonna do add one more so
I can get some more points in here and I
want the points like at each section so
I'm just gonna hit OK now what I can do
is grab some of these points
oops and go ahead and select the
envelope or the mesh tool over here
which is you and you know you have it
when you go over top of your mesh and
you've got a square box with a little
plus sign so you can click on an anchor
point here and start dragging and it's
gonna start moving the mesh around and
this is how you
distort this free form in your own way
kinda now I made my own kind of mesh if
I click on a point and hit delete it's
gonna delete that point out I hit
control Z it's gonna bring it back if
you want to add a point you just click
and it'll add like an entire row almost
so you can just click anywhere and it'll
add more lines going vertically and
horizontally so that's how you use the
that mesh tool there now let's go ahead
and check out the options so I'm going
to click out of this and as you can see
I can still hover over and the mesh is
still there in case you ever want to use
it again but we're going to go into the
options so click the object menu and
we're gonna go to envelope distort and
we're gonna go to envelope options the
first section here uses rasters and
we're going to pretty much skip this
because that's when we're gonna use like
JPEGs or something like that way to mesh
those and we can go over that at another
time this section we're gonna come to is
fidelity and fidelity is pretty much how
much you want the object to fit the
envelope mold so the higher up you go
the more it's gonna fit the lower you go
the less it's gonna fit the mold couples
sections that we got down here this
store appearance and that's going to
distort the appearance attributes along
with the object shape this to the second
one we got down here distort linear
gradient fills and that's going to
distort linear gradients along with the
object shape and then pattern fills and
that's going to distort patterns and
then you can always select preview to
check check out what's going on as of
right now it's grayed out and most of
the time it's gonna be grayed out on
this so
you just go ahead and check those out
sometime not too much going on but it's
always good to know the options so you
can have more control over what you're
doing so that's gonna be it for this now
you know how to use a mesh to be able to
warp your objects and you can use warp
envelopes to also warp your objects to
get a new cool looking new cool looking
objects I guess so thanks a lot for
watching if you liked it go ahead and
hit the like button and I'll see you
guys in the next tutorial it's gonna be
awesome
see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
