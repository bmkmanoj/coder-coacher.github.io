video I'm gonna be testing out my brand
new shotgun microphone my as then SG m1x
and like I said this is a shotgun
microphone and if any guys don't know
what a shotgun microphone is it's an
external microphone they hook up to your
camcorder and anytime you hook up an
external microphone to your camcorder
you're supposed to get better quality
than the one built in and what's special
about shotgun microphone is like shotgun
you know how sprays out in one direction
this only captures sound from the
direction that it's pointing in so right
in front of it so this is great for
interviews and people talk in and stuff
like that so aside from that I'm going
to be testing at two different settings
I don't know if you guys can see but
there are now you can but there are two
different settings on here one is for
normal conditions and one is a low-pass
filter and this is to cut out any sound
in the background not all of it but cuts
out like your air conditioner and maybe
if your computer's humming it's supposed
to cut that out so we're going to be
going over those so aside from different
settings the last thing you guys
probably need to know about shotgun
microphones is there's two main
different types there's ones with
phantom power which means it's powered
by a camcorder battery and there's one
that powered by the battery inside this
one has a battery inside I like that
system a little better because it
doesn't drain your camcorder battery
these are easy to replace your camcorder
battery is a pain to charge so I
recommend getting one with built-in
batteries so it doesn't suck the life
out of your camcorder so to hook it up
here's what you need to do this has an
XLR plug which most professional
camcorders do and you need an XLR cable
male and female so go ahead and push
this in and you'll hear a click right
like that
and you need to plug this end in your
camcorder and I'm going to be doing that
right now and look at this comes with a
neat little bag so um before I do that I
just want to say that the audio you're
hearing right now is from my built-in
camcorder nothing special on
just a regular microphone that comes
with a camcorder so the next thing that
you're gonna be hearing from me is from
the shotgun mic so tell me guy tell me
what you think is better all right guys
this is the audio from the s GM 1 X 2 as
then microphone now I have pretty much
all the default settings and if you're
using Canon XH a1 this here's what you
want to do set the output channel with
channel 1 channel 1 this means you have
one microphone but you're gonna output
it to both channels now you're gonna set
your channel 1 input 2 XLR microphone
that means um well it's obvious you're
using your XLR microphone instead of
your onboard mic and for your XLR
channel you're gonna want to set this to
channel 1 channel 2 now when you finally
output it instead of outputting the only
one channel which this would be like it
would only listen on one side of your
headphones or a one speaker on your
computer set it to channel 1 channel 2
and that sets that one microphone
recording on both channel so you get the
full sound
so again output channel 1 channel 1 um
channel 1 input XLR mic and XLR core
channel channel 1 channel 2 so next i'm
gonna be switching on a low-pass filter
and this should cut out any of the
background noise or if I have any
humming from my computer or something so
let me know what you guys think alright
guys so now the low-pass filter from my
as then sgm 1x is on so if this was a
little different than the last one maybe
you can't notice because I don't really
have a lot of noise in my room but tell
me guys what you guys thinks is the best
sound I've set up pull on my blog um the
first vote was for the first audio you
heard onboard the onboard microphone
that came with the camcorder the second
vote will be for the regular external
mic with no filters and it's the last
one these you're hearing right now
that's jam 1 next with the Lopez field
they're supposed to cut out the low
sound so I'm gonna set up a vote in
whatever you guys vote is how I'm going
to be recording audio in the future so I
think guys for watching my test and I
hope to see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
