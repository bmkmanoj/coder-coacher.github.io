video tutorial and in this video before
we actually start typing a bunch of crap
on the screen we need to understand
exactly how a computer program works so
let me explain that right now every
computer program is made up of these
things called
functions now the job of the function is
just to tell your computer to do
something so again a computer program is
pretty much built of several of these
functions usually this one only has one
but let me go ahead and give you guys an
example say that we want to make a
program that will watch a YouTube video
for us so the first function would be
take your mouse and move it to this
Google Chrome icon second function click
third function click on videos fourth
function play a video or something so
again as you can see a computer program
is made up of these pieces called
functions now right here this one right
here is actually a very basic function
that's necessary for all C programs and
I'll tell you guys about the different
pieces of this right now just so we
actually have an idea of what we're
looking at so pretty much whenever
you've run a program the computer is
automatically going to look for a
function called main so you need to have
this function no matter what now your
function starts and stops at this curly
brackets that's why that's how it knows
what code goes in your function so every
line in between here is part of this
main function so let's take a look at
these lines right now so every single
line is just a piece of instruction to
tell your function what to do and also
you probably want to take note of every
line ends with a semicolon that's how it
knows to end this piece of instruction
and go to the next line so the first
thing our program does whenever it
starts is run main and then it says ok
well what's in main what do you want me
to do well the first thing is print text
out on the screen and I'll tell you guys
more about how this works later on but
this is pretty much the line that prints
text out on the screen and that's why
whenever you run
program we see it says hello world so
that's what that line does right here
now it has one other line and says
return zero and for now um that's just
kind of like the background of what's
going on why um how can I explain this
how your program and functions work they
need to return something and it just
says okay if you return zero it means
this function ran correctly sometimes if
you have a return one or something that
means an error but basically if you
return zero to main it means that your
program is running
a-okay so that's what that line does
talk about more more on that later now
the only other pieces we don't
understand yet are these lines right
here
these include lines are basically saying
this see whenever you have whenever you
have a C program the C language comes
with a bunch of built-in functions by
default so this function right here um
allows you to print crap out on the
screen like this however we need to tell
our program to include those files so we
can get those basic on default functions
so right here we're basically saying
include a bunch of built-in um crap that
we can use in a program this is our main
function
the very first um piece that runs and
the only important piece of instruction
right now is printing textile on the
screen so that's basically what's going
on behind the all behind the scenes and
another thing I want to mention is this
blank lines and indents and whitespace
it doesn't matter to your computer
program it's just for making your code
more readable so if you want to put
enter a bunch of times if you think
that's more readable if you want to
press tab and put this way over there it
doesn't matter it's just for clean that
up a little bit it's just for um the
person the developer whatever is the
easiest to see so again whitespace blank
lines indents don't really matter arm
again every single computer program is
made up of func law cantock functions
which pretty much do something and every
single function is made up of lines of
instruction to tell that function
exactly what to do so now that we
understand how a very basic computer
program works in the next tutorial we're
actually going to begin our hands dirty
and starting to actually code but for
now then guys for watching don't forget
to subscribe it and I'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
