After Effects cs6 tutorial
I'm your host a buddy Blackbird and
today I want to start putting our keyed
footage onto a background to try to
composite it into another scene so what
compositing basically means is putting
your green screen footage or anything
else into a scene and making it look
like it's actually supposed to be in
there so there's a bunch of steps that
we got to do to do this correctly and
there's things that make it harder for
you and there's things that'll make it
easier for you the first step that I
like to are that like makes it hard or
easy on you is the amount and type of a
lighting and where it's coming from so
if you get a scene and there isn't
there's like a certain light source
coming from maybe like the top left and
it's like obvious and then you have your
green screen footage where the light
source is coming from the opposite side
it's gonna be pretty hard to make it
look completely like it's in the scene
so you want to make sure when you when
you're filming if you have if you have
the option to actually control this to
send to match up the lighting so that
will help you composite first the second
thing is to use the highest amount of
resolution that you can this will make
your footage look better it'll make it
easier to key and everything like that
so that's the second part and then the
third part is try to get the best key
that you can so when I keyed my key to
my footage here
I used key light and I messed around
with all these different settings and I
added a choker so there's not much spill
or anything I'll take this off there's
not much spill or anything going on but
when it's over top of the scene it just
doesn't look right
these two have different colors they
basically aren't in the same color space
and it just looks like someone
green-screen something on top of another
thing so well I want to go over today
after that is there's a couple more
methods to help you blend in your
footage even more into the background
blurring the edges helps a little bit I
mean you don't want to blur the out
of them because it'll just look like a
blurry thing and that doesn't look real
and then there is something called a
light wrap and that will actually help
with your edges also so in real life the
light from the scene wraps around like
the actual object so remember when we're
trying to get the the spill of the green
screen
off of like the hand and the gun and
everything that's because the green
light reflected off and kind of like
wrapped on to the actual scene here on
to the actual hand and gun so it's going
to be the same thing that'll happen when
we're in like if it's this is in the
background so we could add like a light
wrap around here now the clouds and the
Sun are what's going to make the light
come off to the object so we're gonna
create a light wrap and I'm gonna show
you how so what we're gonna do is
duplicate our footage twice control D
onto our footage and I'll hide this
toggle switches and modes and I'm gonna
shy the lair and turn my shy button on
so we can hide that because that was the
first one that I did to make sure it was
working pretty nicely so we've got these
two footages here and we can name them
if we want
rap one and then we can name the other
one rat fuller so we're gonna end up
blurring one of these obviously so let's
go to this rat blur and we're gonna put
in an effect on it
twirl these down called Gaussian blur GA
u s and Gaussian blur will come on and I
like this blur it's a pretty decent blur
it's more advanced of a blur than just a
simple blur or fast blur I mean so let's
bring this up to a decent amount let's
try five and that blurred it pretty
decently now let's turn on our other one
here we got our wrap one and our rat
blur so we're gonna come down to our
toggle switches and modes and we're
going to set the mode of the Trackman
here to alpha inverted Matt and it's
going to give you this outline here and
because it was blurred it gives you this
outline now some of it is going to turn
a black because of the gun and this
won't give you that nice of a light wrap
because it's black and black isn't a
good light so what we're gonna need to
do is add some more light to this so
we're gonna pre compose these two layers
so right click on it and come over here
to pre compose when you have both of
your layers selected we're going to name
this light wrap I'm gonna hit OK
now we go into what's open up the
composition by double-clicking on it and
this is what we have for light rap here
now remember the black is going to suck
so we don't want black to be our light
rap so let's create a new adjustment
layer and this adjustment layer is just
going to contain the hue and saturation
effect so let's add that we're gonna go
to color correction hue / saturation now
pretty much for this one all we really
need to do is increase the lightness
there we go now we now we're starting to
get some light edges on around the
outside now we can go back into our
actual composition and we see how that's
working there let's turn on our other
gun the one that we are just going to be
using and we need to set the mode here
to something that will lighten it up a
little maybe add and then use your ID
tool to see how it effects it and back
off and it looks like there's a little
too much the you can see there's a lot
of light coming on see yeah a little too
much
but it's we're getting there so let's go
back into our light rap here we can
either decrease the amount of blur to
make it so that there's not as much
light wrapping around or decrease the
lightness here I'll decrease the
lightness let's see what that does
we can also change the blending mode now
some of them will be brighter than the
others let's try screen and we edit
screen and I changed it to screen and
now that looks a lot better might be
able to let me try to change this back
to 30 and see what it looks like screen
yeah that still has to be a change moved
down to about we hit it on 22 I think so
there we go so that's how you create a
light wrap and that'll help put this
into your scene a lot better and in
what's a let's basically look at this on
and off with the wrap on and the wrap
off this is off and then this is on now
if you want to you can try to colorize
the wrap and maybe make it a little
yellowish white to like catch some of
this cornfield on there or whatever you
would like so we can also maybe
desaturate this a little see where we
good okay with the desaturation
something like that maybe
and that way in like the areas where
it's brown and black it'll be a little
more like grayish whitish color instead
of brown so that's a good way to blend
this in a little bit more and then
there's other steps you take to blend in
the colors so we've got this footage
blended in and blurred in now we can
check out the colors so let's stop the
tutorial here and we'll continue on
about compositing into our footage into
backgrounds so see you guys later and
look forward to you on the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
