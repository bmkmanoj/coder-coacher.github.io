this video I am going to be covering
some so communication basically cell
communication is how cells talk to each
other it's how they get to know each
other
it's how they figure out what each other
wants all that good kind of stuff a more
formal definition of cellular
communication is the process in which
cells detect and respond to signals in
the extracellular environment this is
how multicellular organisms coordinate
cellular activities and cell signals can
be either incoming or outgoing but the
basic premise is these signals are going
to affect the confirmation or the shape
of a receptor protein on the outside of
a cell or the inside of a cell wherever
the signal is supposed to go anyways
this changes the shape of this receptor
and it's going to lead to a response
inside or outside the cell normally
inside though there are several
different types of signaling you've got
direct intracellular signaling which is
where cell junctions or little gaps like
cells are stuck close together and there
little gaps in between their membranes
that kind of connect their cytoplasm
together but anyways these cell
junctions allow signaling molecules to
pass from one cell to another
you've got contact dependence ingoing
which is where some molecules are going
to be bound to the surface of cells and
they serve as other signals or signals
to other cells that come along and come
in contact with these cells
you've got autocrine signaling which is
where cells secrete signaling molecules
that can bind either to themselves or
neighboring cells of the same type
you got paracrine signaling where these
signals diffuse locally and act on
neighboring cells but it doesn't affect
the cell that's actually secreting said
signal you've got in the Curan signaling
which is where signals normally in the
form of hormones are going to travel
longer distances and they usually last a
longer time and then you've got
pheromones which are signals that are
released into the environment and they
you are going to act on a different
individual so I drew a little picture
for all of you that are visual learners
direct signaling you can see right here
you've got your gap junctions this is
the cell the secreting the signal and it
can travel directly from cell to cell
depending on which cell needs contact
you've got your little signal right here
and your next cell has the receptor
right here and they're just gonna come
in contact with each other and then the
signal is going to happen autocrine
you've got your secreting cell right
here and your secreting cell also has
receptors for the signal that is being
secreted and then it can affect some of
the cells around it that also have the
receptors Peregrin is just like almost
just like autocrine except for you don't
have the receptors on the secreting cell
and in the Korean I forgot to write that
in I'm sorry but this is endocrine
signaling you got your cell over here
it's going to secrete a signal signal is
going to travel through the bloodstream
to its target cell which is way over
here this is a different cell but you
see your target cell has the receptors
on it to pick up the signal there
endocrine and for you there are going to
be three different stages of cell
signaling first you have receptor
activation this is when the signal binds
to the receptor from there you've got
what's called signal transduction which
and activated receptor induces the
signal transduction pathway and this is
a this is going how I am going to
explain the signal transduction pathway
if you've ever seen Tom and Jerry or
anything like that
you've got Jerry is up here the mouse
pushing off this little bowling ball
this bowling ball is going to roll down
some kind of incline like a like a
gutter or something like that so the
bowling ball is rolling it's rolling
it's going to hit this little seesaw
thing right here which has a tasty
I on the end of it well as soon as this
bowling ball lands on the seesaw Tom
who's standing right over here somewhere
it's gonna get this tasty pie to the
face that's basically what a signal
transduction pathway is but after the
signal transduction pathway you've got
the cellular response so tom is just
taking this tasty pie to the face now
he's going to have a response the
cellular response can have several
different forms sometimes you can alter
the activity of enzymes you can alter
some structures of proteins or you can
change gene expressions things like that
but anyways I'm going to stop with this
video in the next video I am going to
cover the types of cell surface or spots
there are receptors
sounds like tons of fun right it's not
that bad but that's all I have for this
