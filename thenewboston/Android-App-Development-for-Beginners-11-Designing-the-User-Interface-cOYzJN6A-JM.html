video I want to start talking about
designing the user interface it's one of
the more fun and also one of the more
easier to understand topics and actually
what I decided to do is instead of
working anymore with this I actually
want to start a brand new project so to
close out of this click file close
project and actually if you just close
out of Android studio like you want to
start a new project so you just close
out of the entire thing and then you
open it back up again then what it's
going to do is it would just open up
that project again so if you ever want
to get back to this window you would
have to click file close project so if
you're trying to do that and that's why
well I just explained it for you so from
here what I want to do is click start a
new Android studio project and you can
actually name this anything you want
since we're just going to be like um I
don't know not doing anything real
important to it I'm going to name mine
hand blaster because why not and all
these should be good from last time
click Next this is still good we're
still making something for the phone now
instead of like last time where we chose
blank activity what this would do is it
wouldn't make that one default blank
screen but I want to show you guys how
to add activities manually so instead of
this choose add no activity so when you
click finish what's going to happen is
it's going to load up and you're pretty
much going to have an empty completely
empty um project I mean it's going to
have those core files but check it out
alright so when it's done setting up
this is what you get now obviously if we
click on project on the left hand side
we can see that it does indeed have some
files created for us but definitely no
activities or screens anywhere and well
our app would be pretty stinkin useless
if the user didn't have any screen to
look at so let's go ahead and do that
first so make sure you're in Android
view you can actually look at project
view if you want but I'm going to be an
Android view and in your app expand that
and go to Java expand that as well now
remember this is where we're going to be
building that
if you remember from last time this is
actually where that file was so now if
you right-click it and select new scroll
down to activity and we'll just choose
blank activity so again once we're
looking at this screen what this is is
basically if we click blank activity
whenever we're setting up our project
then this is where we would be but
that's how you do it manually and also
whenever you add additional um
activities to whatever projects were
working on in the future that's how you
do that so remember it now for right now
this example is only going to have one
activity so I really don't need to give
anything like a name because not really
going to get disorganized with one
activity however since this is the only
activity it's very important that you
choose this launcher activity now
remember the launcher activity is the
very first screen that whenever Android
is trying to open your app it's going to
look for this so without it if you don't
if you have a bunch of activities and
none of them are the launcher activity
and your apps not going to open
correctly so since this is our only
activity we need to make it the launcher
activity aka the starting point so as
soon as you create an activity while
Android studio is going to do is it's
going to create those two files for us
make sure this looks nice and pretty for
you guys alright so of course you
remember that main activity that Java
the brains behind it and the interface
no need to discuss everything we got
because you guys already know what all
that means so one other thing I want to
point out is you're like okay wait a
minute there was one more thing you said
that all of my activities had to be
taken care of in the manifest so let me
just look at the manifest and we'll
probably have to do something here open
this and oh check it out
Android studio actually took care of all
of that for us whenever we just created
that new activity again in the manifest
this is where all your activities have
to be declared it did everything for us
pretty stinking awesome that is all
so another reason I love Android studio
so just close out of that and we can
continue with the good stuff so over in
activity underscore main.xml the first
thing I want to do is delete this little
thing right here this textview so just
go ahead select it like before and just
delete it now just for this example um
this is just to demonstrate a few things
so I'll say that I'm building the very
first page to the best social network
ever the new boston.com not like I'm
biased or anything I mean it's not even
like it's mine so if remember but
anyways so what we need are a couple
things the first thing is this large
text alright so that's a little bit
easier to read I'm just going to
organize everything before I start
customizing any of these widgets so drag
in large texts and we'll say that this
says um like sign-in or login so this
will be the login screen
so under this of course we need to
little input areas for the user to enter
their login information in email and a
password so first let's get that email
scroll down it's actually under text
fields so click that if it's not
expanded in for email just drag that
over and we can tell when it's aligned
with the middle because of this little
green line so drop that right there
alright looks pretty good now under here
we'll have a password field so drag that
and drop it somewhere under there looks
good now of course if I was actually
designing this then what I would do is I
would have to make a little text area
here that says email and password but
for right now just demonstrating some
stuff this is well you know simple
enough now of course after they're done
typing in their information they need
some button to click on so if we scroll
way back up it has is a way back up it's
like two inches away but we're gonna
select this button and drag it right
underneath here and we'll actually align
this in the dead center of your app by
using those little alignment things
and all right looking pretty good
so what I want to do now is I actually
want to change the text on this right
here and also on the button so again
this is a login screen so if I hop over
actually I'll change one this way so
select this large text text view element
if we scroll down to a property called
text then what we can see is okay right
now it's set the large text that's the
text that displays what we actually want
to do is click on this and we'll change
it to something like sign in and hit
enter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
