to show you how to set up Mongo to use
with the JetBrains
IDE so I know a lot of you guys have
webstorm I'm actually going to be using
IntelliJ for these tutorials since I
already had it installed on my computer
but the process is pretty much the same
no matter what JetBrains IDE you have so
the first thing that you need to do is
you need to install the Mongo plugin so
go to file settings and under your
plugins
it's called Mongo plugin how creative
so I actually already have it installed
but you guys are going to see an install
button again I have an uninstall button
because I already have it installed so
click the install button it's going to
install and after it does I believe that
I believe you need to restart your IDE
so close out of it restart it and once
you do you're going to have this panel
right here called Mongo Explorer so
click this and from here you're going to
want to adjust the settings so it's that
little wrench button with a little gear
click this and right now what we need to
do is we need to give it a path to the
Mongo executable and if you guys watched
my last tutorial then you guys already
know where this is so you can either
type it in or click this little three
little dots and that's going to open up
a little Explorer so it's in the hard
drive program files Mongo DB server bin
server 3.0 bin in Mongo exe so hit OK
you can actually test it at that little
green check mark it says everything is
working good this executable is fine
so after this we need to set up a server
configuration so click this plus button
right here and it already has default
port and location setup so the only
thing we need to do is give it a label
so this is pretty much just an
identifier so you can if you have
multiple configurations
you can identify you know the different
ones I'm just going to name this
localhost keep things real simple and
hit okay so we now have a configuration
looking good yeah apply and okay so as
you can see we now have a localhost
right there from here we can actually
right click this and choose well before
we do that we actually need to start the
server so in your command line if you
just type Mongo D and hit enter our
Mongo D database is now running so now
what we can do is go back in Japanese
right click connect the server and once
we do we're going to see this right here
so if you click this and click this
button right there it's going to open up
your Mongo shell in other words you know
in the last tutorial when I showed you
guys how to run Mongo the little command
line program and you can type your
commands well this is pretty much the
same thing just a little cooler version
so again just like before you can type
DB and to run you actually just click
this green button and it says local and
this is where we're going to be typing
all of our commands and the reason I
like this as well is because you can
actually type multi-line commands and it
doesn't execute after every single line
you can choose when you want to run it
so it's a lot easier if you guys don't
have this IDE well you probably won't
even be watching this tutorial you
probably would have quit long time ago
but if you don't have it and you're just
watching this in front I highly
recommend getting webstorm is a really
awesome IID so now you got everything
set up in the next video we're going to
start learning some Mongo commands it's
going to be awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
