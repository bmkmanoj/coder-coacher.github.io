tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial when you
continue working on our reader class now
in the previous tutorial I told you that
you had to finish all of these so make
sure that you have a method for reading
a UN 16 and 32 a UN 32 64 and a UN 64
alright so in this tutorial we're going
to create a method for reading bytes so
just gonna see right here public body
array white and we're just gonna have
user pass through the amount of bytes
that they want read so just gonna say
int amount alright and then we're going
to call the binary reader method 3 bytes
so we're just gonna say right here byte
array buffer equal BR dot read bytes go
up here to the read bytes method all
right read bytes and we just want to
read the amount of bytes that the user
wants to read all right now the funny
thing is about the revite smething is
that it will actually read in big endian
so it will read in the correct way it's
a little read from left to right so we
only want it to reverse this if it's
little onion so we're going to say right
here
if byte order equal to i order dot
little endian then we just want to
reverse this fighter ape called popper
right here so we're gonna stay array dot
first that um fight array which is
buffer alright and then only if it's a
little endian it will reverse the byte
array and then we just want to return
that fighter it called buffer so return
a buffer alright and now we're all set
we have everything that we need for
reading numbers and like I said in the
previous tutorial you're gonna want to
make sure you have comments on all of
you like summary telling me user like
what this method does like what ask read
a spike is tell no it's a signed by like
we're read the file and stuff like that
all right so two things that we're going
to do now is create a closed method and
the close method will basically just
close the binary reader so that the user
can use the file for a different
operation or in a different stream or
something like that so we're just can
see right here public void closed and
then we're just going to say BR dot
close all right so that's pretty easy
that's all I really need inside of this
closed method or a year and the next
thing we're going to want to do is
create a method to change the byte order
so that the user will be able to change
the order of the bytes or like how
they're read so we're going to go right
here and create a public void or
changing the by order since there's
nothing to return the user doesn't
really need any information about this
method so then we're just makes a change
like order and then we're just going to
have the user pass through the byte
order that they want it to change
somebody to say byte order and I'm just
going to call this Bo or byte order all
right and then I'm just gonna say it
hereby order so the byte order inside of
this class right here and we're going to
want to make sure it's accessing the one
inside of this class and not the base
class so I'm going to say this top byte
order equals Bo
so the tight order that the user passes
through this method so let's say the
byte order was currently I don't know
little-endian
and the user wants to change it to big
onion because they have one number that
they're trying to read that must be read
big-endian so they can just change the
bike order to big endian then I'll read
it as big endian that if they wanted to
they could call this method back again
and change it back to little endian if
after that they had to have more numbers
that they needed to read in
little-endian
all right so that's really all that
we're going to be doing in this tutorial
in the next tutorial we're going to be
getting into reading strings and
characters and all that good stuff so
see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
