your 6 tutorial and robotics and
electronics now in this tutorial I'm
going to talk to you guys about
something called a resistor now what
other resistor does is pretty much limit
the flow or resists electric current and
this is useful because any it prevents
waste or prevents you from wasting
electricity on parts you don't need to
send it to and now what also allows you
to deliver like specific amounts of
electricity to the parts you need so
there are a couple things let me show
you guys what the resistor looks like
actually I got two right here I don't
know if you can see them or not if I put
my hand there you go that's how small
they are see there's my finger now so
that's how small they're so they're
really small and that brings me to the
first thing I want to talk about when
you're looking for resistors there's a
couple things you want to look for the
first thing is size now there are a
bunch of different sizes but the three
probably most common are half watt
resistors quarter watt resistors and
something called a surface mount
resistor now a half mount resistor I
mean a half watt resistor excuse me or
what I just showed you right here and
believe it or not these are the biggest
resistors of the three and these are
probably the biggest resistors in size
that we're going to be working with so
for these tutorials I recommend you get
a half watt resistors quarter watt
resistors are a little bit smaller but
for the purpose of showing you these
tutorials I chose half watt resistors
and if just don't ever get surface mount
resistors unless I tell you to because
they're a whole different thing
and you won't be able to use them at all
so remember when you're buying resistors
to follow along with me make sure to get
half watt resistors that's a sizable
quarter watt smaller surface-mount
totally different thing the next thing
you're going to come across when you're
buying resistors is something called
tolerance
now what tolerance is is pretty much the
company's margin of error now most
resistors I think at least the ones I've
seen they have a 5% tolerance and what
this pretty much means like I said
margin of error if you have a 100 ohm
resistor and remember resistance is
measured in ohms this means that the
company says is a hundred ohms but it
could be anywhere between 105 and 95
ohms so 5 percent tolerance means it can
be anywhere 5 or 5 percent greater five
percent less or anywhere in between so
that's what tolerance means just the
kind of margin of error it tolerates and
of course there are more precise
tolerances like there 1 percent
tolerance but we don't need it for this
tutorial our robots not going to know
the difference and also the more precise
you get obviously the more money it
costs to buy resistors so pretty much in
summary on most parts or pretty much
every part I can think of right now in
our robot it needs these resistors
because um the month how am I going to
say this many of the parts of a robot
weren't exactly designed to take the
full force of a 9-volt battery so that's
why they made a resistors these are
extremely cheap probably the cheapest
part of your they're like pennies each
so go ahead and pick up some calf wha a
5 percent tolerance resistors and in the
next tutorial I'm going to be showing
you guys how to actually test these
resistors and make sure they're working
with the multimeter so don't forget to
buy our resistors and make sure to check
out the next tutorial where we will be
testing these with a multimeter so make
sure to subscribe thanks for watching
and I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
