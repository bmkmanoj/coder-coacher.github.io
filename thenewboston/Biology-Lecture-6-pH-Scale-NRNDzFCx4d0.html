to your sixth biology tutorial and in
this tutorial I want to talk to you guys
about the pH scale now what the pH scale
is is it's basically a system of
classifying how acidic or how basic a
solution is and the scale actually goes
from 0 to 14 and I know that it's really
odd numbering system 0 to 14 and if a
solution is acidic it's going to fall in
the range of 0 to 7 so all acids are
going to be here and all bases are going
to be here now the most basic solutions
are going to be at 14 and the most
acidic solutions are going to be right
at 0 so for example hydrochloric acid is
going to be the most acidic solution
possible at 0 and the most basic
solution would be something like sodium
hydroxide so na o H and something that
would be completely neutral would be of
course we learned in the last tutorial
water h2o so of course what we can see
is whenever I say neutral I mean that
it's not an acid or a base you drop it
in water nothing happens it has the
exact same number of hydrogen and
hydroxide ions unlike the case where if
you would drop hydrochloric acid or
sodium hydroxide in water it would of
course give off some ions bad things
would happen so another thing that I
want to do is I want to show you guys
some common solutions and where they
fall on the pH scale so battery acid has
a pH of 1 battery acid and what this
pretty much means is whenever a solution
is more acidic or closer to zero the
more hydrogen ions it releases so if we
were to compare battery acid in
hydrochloric acid what happened is if we
were to take both these solutions and
test the acidity we would find out that
hydrochloric acid would release more
hydrogen ions therefore making it more
acidic than battery acid
now something
is kind of basic that is more common
than sodium hydroxide would be something
like baking soda so if we were to test
baking soda that only has a ph of nine
of course it's pretty basic but not as
basic as sodium hydroxide we would find
that sodium hydroxide releases more Oh H
negative which is hydroxide in
comparison to baking soda so basically
that is what the pH scale is again seven
is neutral 14 means the solution is
really basic or releases a lot of
hydroxide ions and whenever we're
talking about the acidity the more
hydrogen ions it releases the more
acidic the solution is and just some I
don't know random bits of information
and organisms in people if your blood
becomes too acidic and that means if the
pH drops too low it can develop a
condition called I'll just write down
acidosis and I guess the opposite of
that is if your blood becomes too basic
or if the pH is too high it can develop
let me go ahead and spell the circuit
alkalosis or a colossus whatever you
want to call it actually there's
probably a proper way to say it but I
think it's a colonist or wait a minute I
knew how to say this at one point I I'm
not even going to try to do it now cuz
I'm going to freakin butcher it but
anyways the concept of this tutorial
what you need to take away is that with
the P that's what the pH scale is a
system of classifying how acidic or
basic a solution is the more acidic the
lower the number the more basic the
higher the number up to 14 and a
perfectly neutral solution would be 7</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
