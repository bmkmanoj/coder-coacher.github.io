your third Android development tutorial
and in this tutorial now that we have
Eclipse downloaded we need to custom
configure it just for developing Android
apps so we're gonna be doing two things
in this story first thing is we're gonna
be setting up our ADT in our ATT is our
Android development tools now when we
set this up whenever we create an
Android app this is going to create the
base files and the basic structure of
our app so we don't have to do it so
that's pretty cool that's why were sent
up to ADT the next thing we're gonna be
doing actually let's just do that first
now that don't want to confuse you guys
so in order to set up your Android
development tools and again this is the
thing that creates the base files and
the basic structure for your application
you need to do this go ahead to help
once you open eclipse of course and go
ahead to install new software now once
you click that you see this box opens
right here and we're gonna want to do
after that is click add and this is
gonna allow you to add vacations of word
softwares and it's pretty much gonna
download it for you so just go ahead and
name it anything you want let's name it
Android ADT or Android development tools
whatever you prefer I'll leave that up
to you and in the location let me see if
I can get this right I have it written
down right next to me go ahead and type
this exactly and by the way what I'll do
is um I'll copy this link and put it in
my youtube description so if you look
under this video it's right there for
you but anyways if you're just following
along right now here's what you got to
do go ahead and type HTTP colon
backslash backslash or front slash
whatever the heck it is DL - SSL dot you
go comm slash Android / Eclipse there we
go
I know I typed it right because I
already have it downloaded and that's
why it says duplicate location for me
but for you it should not say duplicate
location because you don't have a
download
yeah well you should be able to do is
hit okay right here and once you hit
okay it's gonna take you to another box
now again since I have this downloaded I
can't show you but once you're in the
other box go ahead and check the box
next to developer tools and then you
need you know just go ahead and press
accept finish and then it's gonna ask
you to restart eclipse and just go ahead
and restart it because you know saying
before the changes taking effect in the
route sorry yeah yeah yeah basically
once you hit okay just to remember to
check the box next to the developer
tools everything else is gonna be self
explanatory so anyways like I said I
already have this downloaded so that's
why it says duplicate location for me
but it won't for you so now with that
said and done now your Android developer
tools are set up properly so the next
thing I was talking to you guys about
earlier is the next thing the next part
of this story is we need to set the
location okay oh I just ate a meatball
sub and like meatballs are flying around
out of my mouth pretty gross my name is
now that we saw the ADT we need to set
the location of the SDK now remember
from the last couple of tutorials we
already downloaded the SDK but now all
we have to do is tell eclipse where it
is because eclipse juanny
wants to use it but it doesn't know
we're on our computer it's stored so we
got give a little hint and in order to
do that here's what we got to do go to
start computer and then go to your main
hard drive right here now wherever you
download your SDK it's gonna be in
either your Program Files or your
program files x 86 mine are in my
Program Files x 86 but yours might being
a Program Files yeah I just say it the
same thing twice I think I did anyways
go ahead and click that and in one of
these folders you're gonna see another
folder called Android go ahead and
double click that and your Android SDK
is right in here so go ahead and double
click this folder and you see a bunch of
folders cart add-ons Docs platform
platform tools just go ahead and
right-click any of those and click
properties and this is going to give you
that path
that we're looking for so go ahead and
just to be consistent with me go ahead
and right-click your add-ons properties
and uh you see if I can grab this there
we go go ahead and copy that it should
start with your hard drive in end with
android sdk windows so if you got the
path that says that now you know that
you're in the right place so go ahead
and X out of that X out of that and go
ahead and open up eclipse so now that we
have that path copied we need to tell
eclipse this is where our SDK is stored
on our computer and in order to do that
what we need to do is once you have
eclipse open go to this window drop down
menu right here and go to preferences
and once you're in Prevage it
preferences what the heck
can you guess what wanted to go to yep
Android right here so again like I said
I already set mine up but what you need
to do is go ahead and paste that in your
SDK SDK location right there and as you
can see mine's already pasted in there
and go ahead and hit OK and once you hit
OK everything's gonna be set up just
like that this is how we tell Eclipse
where our Android SDK is so anyways
that's what you have to do in order to
configure Eclipse and once you follow
this tutorial Eclipse is configured and
ready to go
so congratulations we are one step
closer to developing sweet Android
applications so anyways thank you guys
for watching don't forget subscribe and
I'll see you guys next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
