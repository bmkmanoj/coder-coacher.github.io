tutorial and in this story I'm going to
show you guys how to get a range of
constants now this is going to be about
eight times easier than the last
tutorial so you know just suck it up pay
attention and I try to make it
interesting for you
so essentially we need a range of
constants and we only have three right
here it's not going to be very exciting
first of all and what kind of range can
we give a three so let's add a couple
more of my ex-girlfriends to list
I had one girlfriend named Nicole and
let's find a description word for her
she was Italian and I dated her when I
was I know probably like 13 so I'm going
to put 13 and don't want that semicolon
and my next girlfriend after this I
would have to say is candy this is when
I moved to my new school she was my
first girlfriend and let's say she was
um let's put this nice she was different
and um let's see how I was in eighth
grade so what's that 14 maybe I'm wrong
but you know we don't have time to think
we just have time to do and let's see
after candy go in ninth grade but you
know what's the fun in that there's this
girl named Erin I had a huge crush on
but I never went out of there but you
know what I'm going to add her to my
list because I wish I went out with her
so I'm going to put I wish because you
know she's like the one that got away
and I had to be like sixteen by the time
I had a crush on her for a long time
what could have been Oh anyways so now I
have a longer list of constants right
here so what we can do now is go back in
our main method right here and we'll
just keep this one right here this is
what we did in last tutorial but let's
see let's go ahead and make a new line
under this for loop I mean we might as
well keep this for a little it's not
hurting anything and in case you're just
joining us this for loop pretty much
printed out a list of all the constants
so let's go ahead and just print out a
line so we can separate this for loop
from our other for loop so system out
this post system right system out print
line and let's just go ahead and print
something like um new line new line whoa
whoa whoa what's going on up in here
alright let's just put and now for the
range the hit caps ox
embarrassin constants so now we've
pretty much got this for loop right here
and we just got a line saying and now
for the range of constants so well we
just want to be able to see it easier so
now let's get to the meat of the
tutorial and this is an enhanced for
loop to go through the range instead of
the entire thing so the first thing that
we're going to need to do is at the
beginning of our class before our class
we need to import something we need to
import the enum set class so Java dot
util the enum E and um se T and what
this is going to do is it's going to
allow us to use a built-in method called
range - well you'll see what it does
later I mean especially learn right just
C so let's go ahead and build our
enhanced for-loop now just like last
time it's going to take two parameters
the first one is what you want to name
your things I'm just going to name those
people what you want name your objects
now the second one is that method now we
could just plug a regular array in here
but we want to have a range of the array
we
to start it let's say Kelsey and we want
it to end it candy so I mean we can
start and end anywhere so whenever like
I said before Java automatically gives
you an array of constants in the order
that you did them in but in order to get
just a specific set out of there
arranged what you need to do is this e
num set period range and the range is
the method and it takes two parameters
from is the first one so let's just go
ahead and write tuna which is the class
Kelsey and what's going to do is look in
tune class and find this first constant
Kelsey and that's going to be your
starting point and for - lets just put
tuna dot candy and let's just go ahead
and show so now we have Kelsey to candy
and everything included that's what that
does it gives you a whole new array so
now once we have that we can pretty much
just copy what we have up here copy
thank you for that and we'll paste it
out here and so now instead of an entire
array which was two new values we have a
specific set in the array which goes
from all the constants from Kelsey to
candy so now let me run this and see
what we got that makes no I won't expand
it
what's the fun of that so now we have
our first array right here that has all
the information Bucky - Erin that was
the entire array and then we says our
line and then we goes i and now for the
range of constants and we cut out Kelsey
Julia and Nicole and candy so using our
enum set class and the method in that
called range we were able to provide it
with two arguments we wanted to start
and where we wanted to end and this
entire thing right here it gave us a new
array so instead of looping through the
old array we're able to loop through
this new and improved array to get only
a specific set of data
so that is your quick tutorial on my
former love life and also on how to loop
through a specific range of an array
using this range method right here and
again don't forget to import this class
or else you're not going to be able to
use it so thank you guys for watching
now you know all about enumerations
constants and how to loop the room and
all and whatnot I know how exciting
right so in the next tutorial I don't
know where we're going to talk about but
I promise it's going to be awesome so
you might want to subscribe just a
little hint so thank you for watching
and I will see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
