tutorial and in this video actually the
first thing I want you guys to do in
this tutorial is go to your kitchen and
grab a huge bucket of popcorn and then
after that go to your bedroom and grab
the most comfortable blanket you can
possibly find and then come back because
once you have both those things you're
ready to hear the story probably the
greatest story ever told this story is
called the life of an activity so you
know if you're an Android developer this
might be a pretty interesting story
definitely pretty useful it starts out
like this every activity that you ever
create is going to be a subclass of the
special class that we didn't see yet
called the activity class so out there
somewhere there's this activity class in
every activity that you create we're
going to inherit from now remember
whenever we inherit from something we
get all of the cool methods from that
class now if you're looking at this and
you're like ok I can clearly see that
main activity extends actionbar activity
in extends just means inherit of course
you guys know so this is actually a
subclass of action bar activity but you
said that every activity that I create
is going to inherit from this activity
class well even though you can't see it
directly right here this action bar
activity is inheriting from another
class in that class is inheriting from
activity so this main activity that we
just created is like fourth generation
of the awesome activity class but I just
want to mention that because if you guys
are looking at all these methods you're
not ok where did all these methods come
from that I'm overriding well well they
came from that activity class and all
this classes is it's pretty much a basic
template that gives us a bunch of cool
functions that we could use on whatever
activities are great so that's the
purpose of that so since we have all
these cool functions let's talk about
what they are and why we need them well
every activity that you create it goes
through a certain lifecycle now the
first thing that happens is it calls
this method called encore
so whenever the user first starts your
app for the very first time and your
activity is born it gets created now in
this activity what you typically do is
you set the layout of course that makes
sense the very first thing you want to
do is give the user a nice interface set
up to look at now just a real quick
overview and I'm going to talk to you
guys about this in detail in just a
second but eventually whenever they
close out of your app it's going to call
other methods like ondestroy
so whenever your app just or excuse me
whenever your activity is about to get
destroyed or died um what you might want
to do is do things like save their data
for them so if they I don't know are
playing the game or something you might
want to save all of their settings so
they can have it the next time they open
your app so basically what I'm trying to
say is each activity that you create
it's going to go through many different
stages in its life or many different
states as it's more commonly referred to
so in this tutorial that's what I'm
going to be doing talking about every
single state and the details of each so
the first thing that you actually
probably want to do is start your
emulator because I know they kind of
take a long time to boot up and we're
actually going to be tweaking some of
this code and changing some things so
yeah go ahead and do that now another
thing I want to mention is this I'm
going to be talking to you guys through
each stage of your activities life and
instead of just me explaining it and
talking through I figured it would be a
better idea to actually print something
out on the screen every time the state
of your activity changed so what we can
do is we can actually import this cool
class and this is another tip you guys
are learn like two things in this
tutorial bonus information um alright so
if you go to Android that you tell dots
log
what this is is pretty much a package
that lets us print out log information
in all we're going to do is we're going
to print out something on the bottom of
screen that says like um your activity
is being created or something so that's
all we're doing alright so once we have
that imported
go above all your methods and we're
going to make a new we scroll down here
we're going to make a new private static
final string variable not King string
and I'm just going to name this tag and
it's good convention to name it tag just
because I'm in the documentation for
this this is just what you do and you
guys are going to see what this does in
a second well I probably should talk you
guys through this so the purpose of this
tutorial is talk to you guys about the
different states of your activity now by
default your emulator is going to be
sending out a bunch of different
messages pretty much when any event
happens and there's a lot of crap that
happens on your phone but we are only
interested in these messages regarding
States
so just to filter out um the important
messages we're going to make a special
tag and stick it on each activity it's
going to be cold buckey's message you
can actually name this anything you want
because it's just like a unique
identifier say only print out these log
messages and not all the other crap that
we don't care about alright so once we
have that what I want you to do is go
down to our create right here and I'll
show you guys how to add one of these
log messages so if you go log dot I what
you can do is you can throw in two
parameters right here the first
parameter is your tag so this is just
Bucky's message and this is just for
filtering out on the important ones
later on now after this is what do you
want to print out on the screen and I'll
just actually print out the state of
this activity so again that's all these
three lines of code do right here
they're actually really helpful whenever
you're trying to do built to bug
something in your Android development
