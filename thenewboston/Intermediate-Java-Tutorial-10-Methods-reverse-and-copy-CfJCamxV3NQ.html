welcome to your tenth intermediate draft
tutorial and in this tutorial we're
going to be going over some more
collection methods specifically for a
list so let's uh quit talking go ahead
and get started
as you can see go ahead and just import
everything from the Java util class
because we're going to need a bunch of
stuff for it
so might as well just go ahead and
import everything and the first thing
we're going to do is I'll comment this
out for you is we want to create in rate
and then we want to convert to list so
go ahead and leave a comment create in
array and convert to list BAM game time
so now we need to pretty much create an
array you can create it with any data
type you want I'm just going to use
characters because it's really easy to
show in this example so go ahead and
type character and I'm going to name my
array array because I feel like it and
just set it equal to any number of
characters it doesn't really matter I'm
going to set mine equal to P W and n so
spells pone kind of so alright so now we
have an array of three characters so
we're good to go and now since we're
going to be performing methods in the
collections class we need to make a list
so go ahead and make a list and of
course we want to put character since we
want to cast that and you can name your
list anything you want I'm just going to
name mine l because I'm too lazy to type
anything longer than that and what we
need to do as you learned in the last
story or maybe a couple tutorials ago
the easiest way to convert an array to a
list is just go ahead and put arrays
from the arrays class and there's method
called as lists look at our desired type
in the forest and then as your parameter
you put what array do you want to
convert to a list well let's go ahead
and convert that array we just made
named ray into a list now after this we
want just a little display of what we
did so go ahead and put system.out.print
line and you can just print on pretty
much anything you want I'm just going to
go ahead and put list is put a call
space and now we're going to write
output and as your parameter you want to
output that list and you see we get an
error message right here because we
didn't create the method output yet it's
not a built-in method so we're going to
be creating this later on so we're going
to get an error as we're programming it
but when we're done with this tutorial
outside of the main method right here
we're going to be creating another
method to fulfill this requirement so
now that we're done in this little chunk
code what we need to do first is as
promised call methods from the
collections class and as you know when
you call methods from the collections
class they also apply to list because
list inherits everything for method
I mean collections so let's go ahead and
leave another comment and put reversed
and prints out to the list and make sure
you have a couple typos in there because
you know just looks cool and from here
we can go ahead and put collections dot
reverse and this is the very first
collections method I'm going to tell you
what this method does is pretty much
take any collection and reverse it so go
ahead and pass in L since remember L is
a list in a list as a collection so
that's why we're able to do this and
what this does is it alters the list by
reversing everything so let's go ahead
and system.out.print line and just go
ahead and add a little comment be like
after reverse doesn't matter if we type
that right or not and now we just need
to go ahead and output elegan but unlike
before we're just in normal order it's
now going to be reversed if we coded it
right so now we have um what we did is
we created an array and then we
converted it to a list right here
and right here we took that list and
reversed everything so all right this is
pretty cool but what else can we do to a
list well if we ever need a copy of a
list I'm going to show you guys the
easiest way to do this the easiest way
probably is to make an array of the
exact same size
create that array or excuse me convert
that array to a list so now you have an
empty list that's the same size as the
original and you can call a method
called copy which pretty much takes
everything from the first list and puts
it in your new list they just created
so now they're pretty much the exact
same list and you have two copies so now
that I told you how to do it let's go
ahead and put the code down so we're
going to create a new array and a new
list and from here just name it
character I'll name it new array for new
array and just go ahead and sequel equal
to new character and for your parameters
put three since there's three characters
we're going to be passing in now let me
H my eye and that felt good so list and
of course we're going to be just
creating a same as before character data
and what am I going to name this one I
will name it list copy how original is
that so let's set this equal to array
dot as list same as before and instead
of putting what do we do put less time
right in here what we want to do is take
this new array that we just made the new
array and now if views this is a list so
now what we're pretty much going to be
working with is just list copy right
here and what this is is a copy of the
same list as before or excuse me it's
pretty much a blank list with three
elements in it so now what we want to do
is copy the contents of list into list
copy easy enough so let's go ahead and
add a comment copy constants of lists
into list copy and make sure you spell
that wrong because it looks cool and
what you can do from here is collections
dot copy and copy is built-in method so
that's why we don't have to create the
method ourselves and it's a method in
the collections class and now you see by
default you get two parameters if you're
using eclipse and that's a destination
and sort
the destination is where you want to
copy it to and we just have this blank
list called list copy so that's what
we're going to leave this is what we're
going to be populating the list copy and
it says all right the source is where
you want to get data from well we
already have this list that's populated
in named El and I already have stuff in
it so let's go ahead and as our source
put el in essence what this does is it
takes everything from el and it puts it
into list copy and I'm actually running
out of time for this tutorial so I'm
going to finish up in the next tutorial
but for now I just want to thank you
guys for watching don't forget to
