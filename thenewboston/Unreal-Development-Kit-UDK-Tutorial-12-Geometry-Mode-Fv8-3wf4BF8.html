tutorial and in this is oral I want to
talk to you guys about something called
geometry mode now before I explain you
guys what geometry mode is and how we
can access it let me tell you guys the
goal of this story say we're building
this house right here and you know this
house is looking pretty good but it's
all square and it doesn't really have a
lot of flavor it's pretty boring and
bland so what I decided that we should
do is we should definitely expand the
length of this porch because look how
small this porch is right now I
definitely want it a little longer and
also I want to change the shape of it a
little bit so the first thing that we
need to do is say I want to double the
length of this porch well I need to do
is first figure out how long this porch
is so if I go up in my front view and
hold my mouse wheel I can measure the
length of the porch and I can see that
is 320 units long so just take a note of
that ready down somewhere if you need to
whenever we're working in geometry mode
later on we need to add 320 to it so now
let's hop into geometry mode and before
I even do that I'm gonna tell you guys
whenever you're working with geometry
mode it might be helpful to work in this
brush wireframe mode so by default we're
in this unlit mode I'm gonna hop over to
brush wireframe mode and it allows me to
see my geometry a little bit better so
in order to access geometry mode go
ahead and hit this button right here
geometry mode by default we're in camera
mode but we want to work in geometry
mode so go ahead and hit that and you
know that you're in geometry mode
because your geometry tools window pops
up makes sense
so what geometry mode is is this it
allows you to work with the different
aspects of your shape instead of your
shape as a whole now what do I mean by
that every polygon or every shape that
we make in 3d consists of a couple parts
the first thing it consists of is these
points these points right here I'll
carve vertex and by the way let me say
this before I even continue the correct
term for one of these points is a vertex
the correct term for multiple vertex is
vertices but I convert exes
may make me sound stupid but I'm gonna
call them vertexes anyways even though I
know they're called vertices it just
makes it my life a whole lot easier
so pretty much vertex is are these
points in space now aside from these
vertexes we have an additional thing and
that's this if you can see it might be a
little hard to see right now but see
this orange line I selected that is
called the edge of a shape now the edge
is bit pretty much the line between two
vertexes or vertices so we have a vertex
and an edge which is pretty much the
line that connects two vertices and also
if we select right here in the middle
this is a face now the face is pretty
much the surface the big area on your
polygon so with those terms defined
we're ready to move on and actually
start learning something useful so what
I want to do in this tutorial is I'm
gonna select this face right here
because this is the face I'm gonna be
expanding so in order to expand this
section of our polygon in geometry mode
with this face selected let me zoom in a
little bit might be a little easier to
see with this face selected go ahead and
hit extrude now extrude pretty much
means add length to this polygon so I
already have it set up to add 320 but
you guys might be like 16 by default or
something if it is just go ahead and add
320 to it and then go ahead and hit
apply now as you can see what that did
is it took that shape right there and
added basically a new segment a new
polygon to it and that new polygon was
320 length units whatever they all right
I don't want to say pixels I don't know
if they're pixels but 320 units
nonetheless so now we're saying are a
job number one accomplished successfully
so let me go ahead and shrink this and
get it out of the way because it's kind
of annoying me and let me scroll out in
my perspective view and you're saying
alright Bucky you told me before that we
wanted to do two things we wanted to add
length to this and we also wanted to
change the shape so in order to change
the shape let me go ahead and
my top view I'm gonna scroll out a
little bit and what I'm gonna do is what
I want to do is you know how this is
kind of square right here I want to kind
of give it a beveled edge so you know
just give it a little more flavor design
so in order to do that go ahead and in
your top view select this vertex right
here now since we're looking at it in
bird's eye view kind of top-down
airplane view it doesn't know if we want
to select this one or the one underneath
it so what the UDK does is it selects
every single vertex that's directly
underneath this so if I go ahead and
look in my perspective view let me go
ahead and zoom really in here check it
out whenever I select one of these
vertexes it selects both of them since
they're directly on top of each other if
I only want to select one foam I could
do that in this view but since we're
working in the top view go ahead and
select them both and now what I want to
do is I wanted to jump over to my
translation mode and whenever I'm in my
translation mode I can actually move
these vertexes around so go ahead and
scroll in and I'm just gonna head go
ahead and move mine to a nice 45 degree
angle and I think right there is where I
want to be so if I deselect this I can
see that it cuts nicely across 45
degrees and if I go ahead and zoom out
over my perspective mode you can see
that this gives my porch a little more
flavor it's definitely a little more
exciting than you know just a plain
straight corner so now what I want to do
is I wanted to do the exact same thing
with this vertex over here so go ahead
and select this and let me scroll out in
my perspective mode might be a little
easier to see and like I said I want to
do the exact same thing right here so go
ahead and in your top mode translation
mode of course go ahead and move this
till we get a nice 45 degree angle right
here as well
and if we zoom in we can see that it
indeed cuts at a 90 nice 45 degree angle
so now you can see my house is looking a
lot more interesting than before we have
a nice expanded porch
and we have these at a nice angle so now
with that being said we can go ahead and
jump out of geometry mode and hop over
to unlit mode and you're saying alright
we just built this awesome porch hit on
lit mode and it disappeared well the
reason for that is because remember I
said anytime you update your geometry
you need to explicitly rebuild your
geometry so once you rebuild your
geometry you're gonna see that nice
porch expansion so that is the basics of
geometry mode again with camera mode
it lets you - it allows you to work with
shapes as a whole basically but anytime
you want to edit the nitty-gritty
vertexes edges faces of a polygon or
shape you need to hop over in geometry
mode in geometry mode allows you to
change the geometry of an object so
that's all I want to talk to you guys
about in this story in the next couple
tutorials I'm gonna be adding some doors
some windows building of the porch up
adding a roof gonna be doing a whole
bunch of stuff but for now that's all
you guys get so thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribing I'll
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
