tutorial that I'm making for the New
Boston and in this tutorial we're going
to continue working on our reader class
and really all that we're going to be
doing here is just reading different
data types so let's just jump right into
it here the first data type that we're
going to be reading is a byte so we're
just gonna say public byte if you want
to return a byte that is read and I'm
just going to call this method we're
really quite since that's what we're
going to be doing so we fight all right
and all we're gonna have it do is just
read about you at the current position
and then return it so you're a key
return BRE button all right so you're
probably thinking well this is stupid
why are we even creating a reader class
if we're just using the binary readers
class and it's returning whatever reads
well you're partially right for this
method we don't really have to do
anything but for all the other methods
that we're going to be doing for all the
other data types that we're going to be
reading for a signed by or all the
integers and stuff
we're gonna have to change how the
method works and what it does it's going
to be different than the binary reader
class all right so what you're gonna
probably want to do here is just give a
nice summary of what this method
actually does now I'm not going to do
that out for every method but one thing
that you're going to Ramon to remember
is whenever it reads a value it advances
the current position by one so if the
current position of the binary reader
right now is like 100 and it read
another bite it would be 101 all right
and you should probably say that in your
summer all right so the next data type
that we're going to be reading is
assigned by E or an ass right so we're
just gonna say public a spike or a
signed byte and then we're just going to
call this method read a spike since that
work that's what we're going to be doing
reading assigned value at the current
position and then we're just going to
say return yard read byte alright well
we can't just say VRE twice since this
will just return a regular bite we
actually have to turn it into a sign
byte and we're just going to cast it as
a sign bite so we're just gonna say s
bug right there and I'll just convert
the byte that it returns the regular
byte that it returns
into a sign bite all right and like I
said you're just gonna want to probably
have a summary of what this method
actually does okay now we're going to
want to get into reading the integers so
the person to do that type that we're
going to be reading is an N 16 or a
short so we're just going to say public
short since we're going to be reading an
N 16 and short and N 16 are the same and
then we're just going to call this
method agreed in 16 and we're need not
going to need easier to pass through any
parameters so we're just gonna leave
that blank
alright so we're just going to stay
right here short my short equals be our
read and then an in 16 and remember the
binary reader default eread integers in
little-endian so inside of the file if
there was an in 16 or a short right
there that was just like 78 65 or
something it would read 65 78 and that's
not what we want so since its default we
big endian we're gonna want to check to
see if the byte order is big endian and
if it is we're going to want to reverse
it so let's say right here that it read
this value as an N 16 so it would have
read 65 78 since a default you reads it
in little-endian and what we're going to
want I'm going to do is reverse it so it
will actually read 78 65 so we're just
going to say right here while you are a
Bock equals bit converter god get bytes
and that would be from that short right
there so I my short and then we're just
going to want to reverse this array so
we're just going to say array reverse
and there was no one to reverse that
buck right there that buffer and then
we're going to want to say my short
equals fit converter to and then in 16
so it's going to convert this byte array
buffer back into an age 16 so so we're
just going to want to put buff in here
and then if the second parameter is the
index and the fight area that we want it
to start
reading XR converting it and now just be
zero alright so basically what this does
right here is it converts this short
right here into a buggy race so now this
poly array reads 65 78 and basically we
wanted to reverse that by array so that
now it reads 78 65 and now we're just
converting that bike all right back into
short so now this player Asia or this
short should read 78 65 so just the way
it should be in big endian but we only
want it to reverse it if the way that
the user wants to read it there is big
endian so we're going to say get white
border equals by order got big endian
then we're going to do this well
otherwise this leave it be does it
deepali reads it in little-endian and
then we're just going to want to return
that short right there so turn my short
alright and then you're gonna want to do
this for all the integers and I'm not
going to go through every single one of
them because it's just a matter of
changing on the pipes so if we were to
do read UN 16 right here we just say
read you win 16 you sure you short my
you short now we're just gonna want to
read a you went 16 instead of a regular
in 16 we have to change all these to my
you sure and they have to convert it
into a UN 16 so it's great basically
just changing everything that has to do
with the data type in to the different
ones so we just change everything that
had to do with an N 16 into au and 16
and unsigned 8 16 and you're going to
want to do that for in 16 in 32 and 64
in the next tutorial I'll have those all
done so you should too
alright so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
