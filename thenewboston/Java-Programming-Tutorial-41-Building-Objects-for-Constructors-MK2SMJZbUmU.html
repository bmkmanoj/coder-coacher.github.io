to toriel and in this story as promised
I'm going to be building a four
different objects and these objects are
going to use this tuning class and
depending on how much information they
have them they're going to use a
different constructor for each one so
let's go ahead and do that right now so
let's get some spacing right there so
you can see it good adjust my headphone
and bam I'm good to go so in order to
make objects let's go ahead and name
this tuna object and we'll set this one
equal to new tuna and this isn't going
to take any arguments at all so if we go
look in our tuna class right here and
you know that it has no arguments
because nothing's in here we look at
which one of these constructors has no
arguments well this one has our this one
has a our in a minute that's two numbers
this one has three numbers but this one
right here has no arguments right here
so what it's going to do is insert three
arguments and call this constructor
again so then it's going to go down here
where this one takes zero zero zero it's
going to set the time to zero zero zero
and then set the hour to zero in meant
to zero and seconds to zero so now that
we have that let's go ahead and build
some more objects but this time let's
give them different parameters or
different arguments so let's go ahead
and copy this and paste paste paste and
one name is tune object two three and
four and we'll give this one to an
object two we'll give it one parameter
we'll give it an hour of five we'll give
to an object three two parameters we'll
give that an hour five and a minute of
13 and we'll give to an object for an
hour of five minute 13 and seconds of
like 43 or something so for example this
one right here it has two arguments so
it's going to look at this constructor
right here is this constructor good for
me no this has zero arguments and I got
two so I'm not using you what about can
the
this constructor good for me well I got
two numbers and this one only lets me
insert one so I ain't using you what
about this one well this has three and I
only got two so I don't think so
oh man the last one's just right I got
to you got to let's use a baby so that
pretty much what happens with these
objects that's what's going on right now
but now that we got these objects let's
go ahead and actually use them and so
let's just go ahead and print out the
time so system.out.print f we'll just do
a simple print format and again this
takes two arguments the first argument
is how you want to format it and I want
to format it and since we're going to be
using on this right here public string
to military this returns a string so we
probably want to put a percent string
with a new line right there and actually
new line goes this way I believe that
would have been embarrassing and so this
one returns a string so now we can use
our tuna object and then put something
like two military with no arguments and
what this is going to do is is going to
return our tuna object with no arguments
right here so let's go ahead and your
might as well do the other ones right
now while we got this nice and copied
this is tuna object two three and four
now let me run this and make sure I
don't have any errors and hopefully it
runs right and bam look at this now the
first one was object
it was just tuna object and we didn't
enter any parameters the second one we
entered a five for the hour and it
filled in zero for the rest the second
one we entered a five for hour and 13
per minute and it filled in the rest of
the zero and this last one tuna object
for it filled in all of them for us or
actually we did ourselves so let me see
if I can position this row
since my screen recorders messing up
again and now let me go through one of
these and show you guys exactly what it
does not dud by the heck did I say that
so anyways let's just pick one that you
can understand easy
and how about tune object 3 right here
we made an object that had two
parameters right here five and 13 so
went to tuna where it creates everything
and it went to our constructors and it
says alright which one of these
constructors has two arguments this one
has two arguments right here so I'm
going to use this one this one has 0 1
and 3 so I'm going to use this one that
has two well what it did was plugged in
what was our numbers 5 and 13 they used
the 5 for our the 13 per minute and they
used the default of 0 and it called this
constructor again but this time it used
its 3 new numbers so whenever you use
the 3 numbers it it uses this
constructor right here and what this
constructor does is set time it caused
the set time method so now it says all
right I'm going to send you to the set
time method so let's scroll down and see
what the set time method tells us to do
well it tells us to do three more
methods right here set our was pretty
much checking those between 0 and 24
which it was it was 15 I mean 5 set
minute check to between 0 and 60 which
it was and set second that was that zero
plugged in for us arm that we didn't
have to do anything for that so then we
said alright we're good there so then
when we finally called on the two
military method what did it do well
would pretty much just said our a we
want to use this method for that object
right here so what we're going to do is
get that hour which was 5 get that
minute which was 13 get that second
which was 0 by default and I'm just
going to return them all to you and a
nice pretty looking string format right
here so that is why whenever we called
this to military it just outputted the
drink right down here 5:13 zero so that
is of course a very complicated way but
again you need to know it on how you can
use overloaded constructors to let me
scroll down here to make a bunch of
different instructors based on how much
information you enter and in that
example I just told you since we enter
two I pick this constructor and that is
how you can pretty much use different
objects with different amounts of
information in it so um this will be
clear when would be when pretty much
we're building more programs and this
was just an example so it might be a
little fuzzy right now but you'll
understand eventually in the next couple
tutorials so thank you guys for watching
hopefully you understand at least the
basics of overloaded constructors and
how they are useful when creating
objects with different argument links so
again thank you guys for watching don't
forget subscribe to my channel and I
will see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
