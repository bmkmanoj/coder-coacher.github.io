to your tenth computer networking
tutorial and in this tutorial I want to
talk to guys about protocols now a
protocol is actually one of the most
important concepts in all of computer
networking but I just don't want to go
ahead and give you guys a definition
because that's what my teacher did to me
they just went ahead and they gave me
the definition and I was like ah what
the heck you talking about and it's very
confusing so in order for me to teach us
I think what I'm going to do is I'm
first going to talk to you guys about
not a computer protocol or not a
networking protocol but just an everyday
protocol that to human beings you know
kind of a human being
protocol so then we can relate that to
computer networking and I don't know I
just think it's a pretty cool example
plus I want to talk to guys about how
guys pick up girls and you know it's a
lot more interesting than computer
networking so what I want to do is I
want to show you guys how guys which
will be on the left in blue pick up
girls on the right so let me go ahead
and use what's a good color green here
we go so this is a typical exchange
whenever you want to let's say get a
girl's number the guy says something
like hey says it to the girl and the
girl responds with hello says it back to
the guy and then the guy of course will
say can I get your number come he maybe
can I get your number
you mean he may say it like that I don't
know and the girl would in exchange say
you know whatever number 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
that's actually my telephone number so
if you want to call it go ahead
sucka so let's go ahead and look at what
the heck just happened here this like I
said is a typical protocol among human
beings so basically what the exchange is
is a couple basic exchanges back and
forth but even though this is
very simple basic exchange there are a
couple rules that you know make this
communication or make this conversation
possible now whenever I say what kind of
rules are there in this conversation I
don't see any rules well first of all
you notice that only one person is
talking at a time
they aren't talking at the same time if
the girl said you know hello and the guy
said hey at the same time they wouldn't
be able to hear each other and if the
guy said you know can I get your number
and she was saying hello of course no
one will be able to hear each other or
understand each other so only one person
talks at a time that's one of the rules
now another rule is whenever the guy
talks a response from the girl is
expected so if the guy says hey in the
girl doesn't say anything or just stares
at them he's going to be like uh truer
you know that wouldn't be a conversation
that communication would not work out so
there's two rules even in this very
basic conversation and the last row I
want to talk about is whenever the guy
sends a message a specific response from
the girl is expected now whenever the
guy says hey for example you're
expecting a girl to say hey hello hi how
you doing those are the typical
responses that make this conversation
successful so if the guy was to say hey
and the girl was to say bacon you know
that wouldn't be a successful
communication that would be very
confusing for both parties and you know
that would not be you know like I said
it would just be really weird
so without following these basic rules
one one person talks at a time to when a
guy talks a response from the girl is
expected and three specific messages
receive specific responses that's what
makes communication possible with human
beings and also that's what makes
communication possible between computers
and even though I guys you know I didn't
talk to you guys about why this applies
to computers I just want to go ahead and
give you guys a quick example of what a
protocol is again
definition of a protocol in both you
know human being and computer networking
is it's basically convention or
expectations or basically if you want to
put it in a real simple you know
terminology protocols are the rules for
communication</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
