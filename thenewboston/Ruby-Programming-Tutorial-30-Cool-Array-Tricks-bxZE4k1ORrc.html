hopefully the last tutorial that I want
to talk about concerning arrays now in
this lesson I actually just want to
teach you guys about a lot of cool
tricks that you can do using arrays so
the first thing that we need is of
course in a couple a couple arrays
examples I'm going to make two arrays
one is called boys and one is called
girls now boys is going to be Bucky um
Tony and I'll just add one more Tommy so
now as you can see Bucky Tony and Tommy
and the boys race and the girls array is
going to be just think of some girls
names Lisa it's a nice name
Jenny and let's get the dirty one like
skank you got to throw her in there make
things interesting so basically we have
two arrays right now each have three
people in them boys has Bucky Tony Tommy
and girls has Lisa Ginny and skanky
she's my favorite so what I want to show
you guys is this in addition to all the
ways that we can create arrays like this
or this there is an alternative and
awesome way that we can create an array
we can basically combined old arrays to
form new arrays so let's go ahead and
make a new array called people and say
that we want people to have all of these
people Bucky Tony Tommy Lisa Jenny
skanky well what we could do is we can
go ahead and type them all in
individually or we can just do this boys
plus girls now this is going to do is
it's going to take all the elements from
the boys and girls array and it's going
to throw into a new array called people
so go ahead and hit enter and check it
out people array now has Bucky Tony
Tommy Lisa Jenny and skanky awesome huh
so that is one way that we can create an
array basically take old arrays and take
all the elements and throw into a new
array called people now in addition to
that we can also kind of do the opposite
as well say we had this people array and
we wanted to
I don't know remove the boys from it so
let's go ahead and make an array called
no boys and we'll set this equal to
you people - boys not always boys just
like that so check it out remember the
people array was all six people so now
what we're doing is saying okay take all
the elements that you had in boys and
subtract them from people basically so
you're only left with the girls now go
ahead and hit enter and check it out the
no boys is basically all the people -
the boys
so only Lisa Jenni and skanky dangit
skanky so those are basically weird ways
that we could use math along with arrays
remember this it's not actually adding
the arrays themselves but more of the
elements so there you go there you have
it and what I want to finish up with is
this the last thing I want to tell you
guys about is how to check if certain
items are in your array now in order to
do this you use something called the
include method so it's basically I don't
even know if I told you guys
oh yeah the if statement so let's go
ahead and print something out on the
screen like yep
that person is included now let's go
ahead and add if statement if girls dot
include now after include go ahead and
write a question mark now after the
question mark this is when you pass in
your parameter and the parameter is just
a person's name like Lisa so check it
out we pretty much saying okay print
something out on the screen if girls
include Lisa pretty much if ELISA is
included in this girl's array then go
ahead and print out yep that person is
included so we're going to go ahead and
hit enter and remember Lisa is indeed in
the girls array so check it out it says
that person is included but what if we
had a girl that wasn't included and what
if her name have to be Cathy well Cathy
isn't in that list so now once we hit
enter that code doesn't run we just get
back nothing so I know I told you guys
that that was the last thing but um I
guess I might as well finish off this
because I only have like two other
things to teach you
let's go ahead and take a look at that
people were
lucky Tony Tommy Lisa Jenny and skanky
now I'm this is like some really quick
things I want to teach you guys in order
to access the first and last items in
your Ray just go ahead and write the
name of your array and then first which
is Bucky and in order to access the last
item instead of first can you guys guess
what I'm going to write hello last so
this these properties basically take the
first items in the last items in your
array and they pretty much output them
to you now another cool thing that you
can do is say you wanted to access the
first two people or the first four
people well the first four people in
this array are Bucky
Tony Tommy and Lisa so if we wanted that
instead of just writing first we would
add a parameter to first which is four
now this is pretty much saying that we
want the first four people in our array
Bucky Tony Tommy and Lisa pretty cool
huh
now the last thing I want I know this is
a lot of information but I promise this
is the last thing if I'm lying I'm not
lying guys it's the truth but I'm going
to show you guys how to reverse an array
go ahead and make an array real quick
called bacon one two three four five how
exciting I know so now the bacon array
has five elements in it one two three
four and five now in order to reverse an
array this is probably the easiest thing
I ever taught taught you guys go ahead
and just print it out on screen bacon
dot reverse basically anytime you want
to reverse an array type the name of
your array and add reverse onto it and
check it out it just prints out well it
should Wow what's going on with my dump
thing okay let's try that again
bacon one two three four five bacon
reverse five four three two one
what the heck happened up here I don't
know that's kind of crazy freaking me
out some ghost letters right there or
ghost numbers but anyways um actually
you know what run this code and tell me
guys if you get this too and if so then
yeah something weirds going on but no
one always think you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
