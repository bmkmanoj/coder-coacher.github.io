seventh iphone development tutorial and
in this tutorial we're going to be
creating this project right here what
you see it has five different objects on
the screen and I guess it's like a
little login box you know I really
didn't give it too much functionality I
just want to show you guys how to add
some more stuff on the screen and you
know how to work with the user
interaction some more so we really
drilling that point so what I did is I
added an image at the top will be
learning how to do that added two labels
we already learn how to do that and as
you can see i also added two empty text
fields with you know it has default
values in there so whenever we click and
enter username we were able to enter
some text like this pretty cool and
whenever you click and password wherever
to enter our secret password and it pops
up is a secure password so you know a
start to a pretty cool program maybe
I'll open a bank after this you know our
options are limitless so go ahead and
quit this in the first thing that we're
going to want to do is of course open
Xcode now let's go ahead and make a
brand new project let's go ahead and
make a view based application choose and
i will name this bank accounts because
we are building a secret bank account
and go ahead and save this now check it
out the first thing that we're going to
want to do is import that sweet image i
had i should have named it bank account
or something instead of the new boston
but you know oh well so go ahead and eat
expand your resources file and i
actually went ahead and mine is in my
downloads file and it is called Bucky
picked up ping and by the way my picture
is 250 x 70 pixels tall 250 x 70 if you
want to get the same dimensions as me by
anyways go ahead and take whatever
picture you're using make sure it's a
ping and drag it over in your resources
drop it and then go ahead exit out a
finder and make sure you make a copy and
add and now check this out look at that
sweet image i mean i'm getting better
with my images every single tutorial so
now if you can remember this image
appears the top but we also had some
other option
on screen we had two labels on the left
hand side and also to number fields or
text fields on the right hand side so
you're thinking re what exactly do we
need to add those outlet things for well
whatever we're going to be hammer
handling user interaction with are we
going to be handling any user
interaction with this picture nope all
they can do is look at it what about the
labels to the left and right that's a
name and password nope those are just
for looking at two what about those two
text fields you're saying all right well
maybe I mean you type stuff in we'll
check this out anytime you want to
access the data in the text field you
need to add an outlet to it so what
we're going to be doing is creating two
outlets one for each text field the name
in the password so go ahead and in your
classes I mean we already learned how to
add outlets so you should be pretty
familiar with this what we need to do is
click user interface text field and go
ahead and make sure text is capitalized
text field and go ahead and name your
first text field you can name a name or
yours your name and again these are
pretty much the outlets we're going to
be building so after this go ahead and
add another one and this is going to be
oops excuse me password there we go
that's a bit better so again just like
the last Orioles we're going to do now
is add properties to those so go ahead
and property and retain so we can retain
the variable and non-atomic and I be
outlet so it can be actually treated as
your outlet now go ahead UI text field
name again we've learned all about this
in the last three tutorials maybe so go
ahead and just copy this and for this
one put password so now that they are
declared as properties we can go ahead
and in our implementation first of all
get rid of all this crap all those
comments right there go ahead and get
rid of every comment if you want to so
anyways
we have two properties we can go ahead
and synthesize these to automatically
create the setter and getter methods so
synthesized name and you also want to
synthesize password and remember don't
forget also from molesta torial since we
are retaining these objects and they're
not just regular data types they're not
just floats or in search ours what we
need to do is on our void deallocate
since we actually have those objects
when we're done using them we need to
release them so named release and also
password release so you want to know the
cool thing we're actually done typing
all the code that we need in this
tutorial so in the next tutorial what
I'm going to be doing is we're going to
be building everything in the interface
builder and connecting all the outlets
to the buttons and I'm also going to
show you some really cool settings to
make your interface builder experience a
whole lot easier and I you know a whole
lot better so definitely check out the
next tutorial we are done typing code
for now and yeah I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
