Photoshop cs6 tutorial my name is buddy
Blackford today we're gonna be going
over arranging shape layers now when you
arrange shape layers you're able to
change the shape position and the
stacking order on the layer you're able
to distribute them horizontally or
vertically and a couple other things as
well as I'll show you
so let's might as well get started so
let's select our shape layer or our
shape tool here let's make sure that
it's on shape up here and then I'm gonna
check my settings real quick I want to
have it new layers good and then just
check all these I don't want fixed sizes
just gonna do a constrained right now
all right so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna
make it a circle and then I'm going to
change this to subtract and then I'm
gonna go ahead to my custom shape tool
just to make it a little more
interesting and I already have the cat
selected and I'm gonna draw my custom
shape on here and as you can see it's in
there now what about what I want to do
here is I want to have these in the
center so that the Kent is in the center
of this circle kind of like a little
silhouette kind of looking thing so what
I'm gonna do is go down here to my
selection tool here and I want to make
sure I'm on the path selection tool the
black arrow go ahead and select your cat
and then go ahead and select the circle
and go up here to the middle option here
where it is the path alignment options
and you can see that we are now able to
select from a bunch of these so make
sure that on line to canvas is on first
because we're gonna align it this in the
center of the canvas so let's go to
horizontal centers it's going to align
them horizontally and then we can go to
vertical centers and now they're both
aligned vertically and horizontally in
the center and now we've got what we
wanted I can show you some other things
if we go to left edges it's going to
align it to the left edge of the canvas
now I'm gonna deselect these and bring
them over here or something like that
now if I want the cat to line up to the
left edge of the circle here I can do
that as well so select these select both
of them go to your options up here and
hit align to selection now when I go to
on line go to left edges the cat is
going to align to the left edge of the
circle so whatever is the farthest to
the left is what the other things are
going on on line two
so if I had the cat all the way to the
left the circle would have moved to the
left I'll demonstrate that real quick
all right and the way that you uh select
them does not matter so let's go to left
edges and you can see that works right
there so that's how your alignment works
is going on there and another thing that
I wanted to show you was that you could
distribute your edges are your shapes
out evenly which is really helpful so
let me delete these out let's go to our
rectangle tool here and let's go to our
options let's go to fixed size we'll do
20 by 100 and that's gonna make us some
20 by 100 rectangles so just click click
and drag and just put these wherever
just make like four or five of them or
something like that now go ahead to your
selection tool and let's select these
well first we first we should just merge
all these or shapes
okay now we can select these merging
them puts them all into one layer that
way we can use our arrange tools and
then we'll go to we can distribute by
width and we contribute by height let's
go to distribute width actually let's
Center these first Center and I didn't
want to do that damn control-z alright
now we can go to distribute by width and
it's gonna distribute them out evenly
amongst each other and now I can if I
move them around they'll all be evenly
spaced from each other so which is
pretty nice
and vertical so that's how you arrange
things in that's how you arrange shapes
and paths in Photoshop when you're
they're all on one layer now another
thing that I wanted to talk about was
the align edges option when you have
that on pretty much what it does is it
aligns all the shape layers to an
internal pixel grid within Photoshop and
then ensures sharp outlines so you
basically just want to have that on all
the time when you're working as a web
designer or working on other web things
that you can see that this will help out
a lot and if you take it off and try to
put things into design they're not gonna
look as nice and sharp on the edges
that's gonna look bad so make sure you
break basically always have that on the
next thing I want to go over is the
bringing the shapes to the front and
back you're all you're able to use these
arrangement settings to adjust the
stacking order of the shapes now if I
did something like this and I like
brought them on top of each other and
they were doing like some subtracting
and things like that from each other
let's do that and then subtract if I go
ahead and select this one and I want to
send it to let's say if I bring it
forward if I bring it forward you can
see that now it's subtracting it out of
the shape instead of subtracting
everything else subtracting out of it so
that's how you can use your alignment
options to change the way things are
going on in your shapes so that's all I
wanted to go over with the shape layers
and how to arrange them so now you know
how to do that and you have a better
grasp of working with the shape layers
so thanks for watching the tutorial I
look forward to see you guys the next
one have a good one everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
