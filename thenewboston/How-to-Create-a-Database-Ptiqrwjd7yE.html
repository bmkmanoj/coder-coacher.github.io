series tutorial hopefully you guys got
WAMP installed you got a my sequel PHP
and Apache up and running on your local
machine and you've tested out your your
your local hosts and it runs in your
browser hopefully you can do things like
just type in localhost and that's all
you have to do to to get this page to
pop up in this tutorial I'm going to
show you guys how to create a user
inside of my sequel database I'm also
going to show you how to connect to that
my sequel database using PHP so let's
get started inside of phpMyAdmin you you
can actually get to it a few ways you
can get to it from the local host index
page that was installed in your WAMP
installation you can get to it by
clicking on PHP my admin or you can also
get to it by clicking on this little
icon down here on your on this what's
the name of it this little bar down here
you click on PHP myadmin right here so
there's a couple ways you can get to the
PHP myadmin but anyway what I have done
is I have created a a new database it's
as easy as right here in the main page
you just click on create here we go in
this little panel and you type in
whatever your name is you can see that I
have created one called New Boston over
here to the left so all I did was type
in New Boston you can type it in with a
capital B or not or you can name it
whatever you want to name it and then
you click create so I'm gonna say the
new Boston just so you guys can see me
do it look lick on create and you can
see there we have a blank database with
no tables that's what the 0 is for right
here we have no tables in our database
as you can see
that says that right there and one
important thing that we wanted to
whenever we create a new database is
give it some privileges you want to
create some users you see that there are
already some here and that I've also
created a user called Cole for the local
host I'm gonna run you through what you
have to do here to create your own user
it's very simple so we're gonna click on
add a new user and let's give it a name
of New Boston I'm gonna say local so the
local host is the host and I'm gonna
gonna live dangerously today and I'm
gonna click on generate for password
it's gonna generate this crazy password
that I could never remember so I'm just
gonna copy that for a later use and
you'll see why in a minute and right
here we have global privileges usually
you don't want to give a rare user like
super you don't want to give them super
or
C because if you did give them super
they would be it they would have full
control over everything so I'm just
gonna say check all I'm gonna uncheck
super for now I'm doing this because you
don't want to give a regular database
user super alright so we've done that
we've generated a password we've made a
username and now we're gonna click go
okay and it pops up with a few a few
things here it's asking about database
specific privileges and we're gonna
leave all those checked for now and
we're just gonna click go there we go
alright so now we have created our our
user you can see
he is right there I'm gonna click on
this and go check grant and then say go
there we go all right so now we've
created our user and we have created a
new database I'm going to show you guys
how to connect that inside my sequel and
I've already already done this so I'm
gonna show you how to edit this code
right here to connect to your database
but first I'm going to show you what
happens if we have an error and I'm
gonna tell you what these means what
these these things inside the quotes
mean you could probably guess that the
logo host is where your database is
located if you wanted to if you have a
databases it's somewhere else you could
say something like you know like
wherever your database is located
whatever server is located on you can
change that to reflect the correct
location but since we have our my sequel
installed on a local machine we're just
gonna keep using localhost and I'm gonna
change this to new Boston and that this
the second thing that comes in after
this comma in between these quotations
is the username and then the next thing
is that crazy password that we generated
so like I said I'm gonna run this with
the air so you guys can see what this is
actually meant it's actually catching
this says if the connection if the
connection is valid and you kill it and
if you guys don't know any PHP you're
pretty sure that Bucky did some PHP
tutorials earlier if you go back in time
you can check some of those out
but I'm gonna go under the assumption
that you guys already have a little bit
of PHP knowledge so I'm gonna delete
this password right here I'm gonna save
it I'm gonna go here I'm gonna say
localhost
it's called form handler dot PHP and you
can see that this did exactly what we're
expecting it says the access is denied
for user New Boston because there is no
password not using a password so let's
go back inside Dreamweaver I'm gonna
paste that password back in I'm gonna
click Save and now I expect to see
nothing when I reload that because
everything is working so now that we
have everything set up we have our
database set up we have a PHP file
inside of our www root you can see that
this form handler dot PHP script was
saved inside of our localhost inside of
the WWE folder inside of the WIMP folder
inside of the c drive so whenever you go
to our localhost / formular PHP we have
everything running without any errors
and now we are ready to move on to
actually handling some forms so
hopefully you guys got through this
tutorial and everything made sense you
made some users you made a database in
the next tutorial we're gonna make some
tables to store our data and then we are
going to actually handle a form so I
will see you guys in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
