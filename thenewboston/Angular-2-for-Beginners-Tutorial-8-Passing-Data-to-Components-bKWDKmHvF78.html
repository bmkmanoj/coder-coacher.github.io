we did is we took this playlist and we
added it to our main app component
however now we kind of have a problem so
we have a bunch of videos and buy a
bunch I mean two videos right here on
our main app component and we need to
figure out how to send these videos to
our playlist because our playlist is a
component that actually is going to
display all of these videos so how do we
get these videos and pass them to this
component well what we do is we actually
use a new type of binding called
attribute binding and it's basically how
you can send data from one component to
another so in your template and this is
my template for my main app what you can
do is in between square braces name your
attribute anything you want I'm just
going to name it videos now what you do
from here is you set it equal to this
videos list right here so whenever you
do this now playlist has a new videos
attribute so this is how you send data
out from your app component to the
playlist component that's it so from
here what we need to do in our playlist
component is we need to say hey we have
some incoming data we need to handle it
and this is only one simple line of code
so right now this playlist it doesn't
know that it's going to have any
incoming data it doesn't know it's going
to have a list of videos whatever so in
order to be able to handle that you need
to specify its inputs so inputs are just
a way of saying hey we're going to have
some info coming in well what are you
going to have just a new attribute named
videos so now in your playlist component
that HTML you can just use this videos
array just like you would using you know
a regular variable so that's it so again
it's a two-part process whenever you
want to pass data from one component to
another component we are making a new
attribute
and we're binding the value of it to
this attribute right here so you send it
out from one component and then you
accept it from another component that's
it now for this example what I'm going
to do is I'm just going to make a quick
table and for each of these items
I'll just display is a new row so it'll
be really kind of stupid but whatever so
I'm going to make a table and I'll just
say the class equals table and I'll
actually do this this is a little bit
cooler so table hover and this is
actually a bootstrap class and it just
is whenever you're hovering over a row
then it lights up and on I just think
it's a little bit cooler so now I'm just
going to make a table heading and this
is just going to have all right so I'll
say the ID in this table I'm going to
list the ID the title in the description
I don't think it's really important to
you know put that video code we're gonna
use that video code later on because
later on what I'm going to have happen
is whenever the user clicks one of these
rows then the video pops up in place but
right now let's just go ahead and worry
about creating this table so I have the
tea head and for the body of this this
is where I want to pretty much list each
individual video so instead of just
having this text what I'm going to have
happen is this so you know that I said
that whenever we are just displaying
some basic variable we can just use this
type of binding right here but we can't
really do that in this case because we
aren't just displaying one thing this is
actually an array or in other words
multiple videos so instead of just
writing something that's going to
display one time we need to make a loop
so what this is going to do is it's
going to loop through all of the items
in our array each video and for each one
is going to create a new table row so
how do we do this using
Euler well use a special directive ng4
so in other words wherever you see this
tag it's going to count whatever I here
let me finish this might be a little bit
easier to see all right so what this is
going to do is this it's going to look
at videos all of the videos in again
these are just our array of videos and
for each one it's just going to treat
each video as a V so just like before
whenever we print it out main heading
what we can do is let's say we want to
print out the video ID we just use V
which is each end of it individual video
ID and so let me tighten that up a bit
mate all right so I'm going to print out
their ID in the first column and then
the videos title and then it's
description get out here mate all right
so again one last time whenever you have
an array or list or just a bunch of
items that you want to loop through you
can use ng4 so this is going to loop
through each video and for each one it's
going to create a new row so if there
were ten videos it would create ten rows
yadda yadda tomato tomahto so check this
out now that we have everything working
properly instead of just that little hey
a playlist is going to go here we now
have this component so this table is an
entirely separate component and for each
item in our array check it out it made a
brand new row and you know how I talked
about table hover then that's all this
is whenever your mouse is over it then
it just I don't even know if you guys
can see that on youtube but it has a
nice light gray background so pretty
sweet that is the basics of passing data
from one component to another and in the
next video what I'm going to do is I'm
going to show you guys how to make this
so whenever we click one of these rows
the actual video is going to pop up on
your here and start playing it's going
to be sweet I will see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
