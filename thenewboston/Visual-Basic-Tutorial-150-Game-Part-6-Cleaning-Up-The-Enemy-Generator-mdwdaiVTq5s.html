slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're gonna
continue working on the game so let's go
ahead and come into form 1 DB and you
can see when they click button spawn it
generates a random character now this
could cause some problems that are all
based on the method that we used so
let's go ahead and make another sub
called generate enemy and we'll go ahead
and bring this down here and we will
copy this right here so we need to copy
everything and paste it inside here now
we are going to get an error right here
so let's just go ahead and add and
select and so now what we need to do is
let's just go ahead and take these and
copy them and we'll paste them under
generate enemy so let's go ahead and get
rid of everything in here and whenever
they spawn it will just call generate
enemy so this this way we can reuse code
and generate enemies whenever we need so
let's go ahead and use recursion so if
the picture is not already a zombie so
if we don't already have a zombie then
let's go ahead and create one so we'll
cut this right here then we will create
a zombie and change the picture and if
it already is a zombie
so if picture picture enemy dot image
that equals the zombie because we use
not right here if it does equal that
let's go ahead and call generate enemy
so this will just start over from the
beginning and they will generate a
random number so let's go ahead and go
through and do that for each one of
these cases
so we will cut this so if it's not the
villain then create a villain and if we
already already have a villain in there
then we can generate the enemy now by
doing this what we can do what we do is
we make it so that it will generate a
different type of enemy each time and
that we will not get the same enemy two
times in a row so if the picture is not
already a jack and then go ahead and
create a dragon and we need to call
generate enemy now let's come up here
and see here looks like everything's
good so let's go ahead and run this now
you guys may be wondering why I didn't
just do this in one of the previous
tutorials it's because I like to show
you problems that you might run into and
how you can come up with ideas to fix
them and hopefully this will give you
guys examples of what to do and how to
fix problems I've had some people on my
youtube channel tell me that they like
it when I do that so I just decided to
do it with these tutorials
so here's our game we've got the default
character that it that's on there right
now we will run generate an enemy when
the form unloads because this isn't
really an enemy object that has been
created it's just the picture so we
could spawn an enemy we could spawn a
dragon spawn a villain a dragon zombie
dragon zombie villain dragon looks like
we're getting a couple of the same in a
row but that doesn't matter because it
seemed it seems to be working good and
it's more random than it was before
so let's go ahead come into four Mondavi
be the designer for it we'll double
click on form one so that we can open up
the form one load event
okay so whenever the forum unloads what
we want to do is generate an enemy okay
so now that we've got that that out of
the way let's go ahead and come over to
game GUI we'll right-click and we'll add
a class now I'll make this a little bit
smaller and we will call the class pop I
will go ahead and add it so here's our
class Popeye now let's go ahead and make
some variables so we'll do public shared
and we'll go ahead and call it name as
string and we will set it equal to
Popeye so let's go ahead and make it so
that Popeye cannot be edited so we will
just make it constant and it looks like
if we need if we wanted to be constant
we cannot make it shared so every time
we create an instance of Popeye it will
create a new instance of name so let's
go ahead and create another variable so
private int health as integer and we'll
set that equal to 100 now let's go ahead
and create an ArrayList so public
read-only
and we will just call it attacks as
string and we'll just set it equal to
punch kick and let's just do anchor
throw so now that we have the three
different attacks we can use let's come
down here and we will create a sub that
will attack so public sub attack and
then we will by ref enemy health as
integer so whenever he attacks let's go
ahead and generate a random number</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
