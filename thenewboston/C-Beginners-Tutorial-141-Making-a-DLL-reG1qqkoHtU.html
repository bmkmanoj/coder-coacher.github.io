tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to create your own
DLL and DLL is short for dynamic link
library and basically what you do the
DLL if you put all namespaces you can
create it inside of your DLL and then
you can give that DLL to someone else
and then they can access it and they can
add it to either the visual basic or
c-sharp application and then they can
use all the namespaces inside of your
DLL so you should have classics from
there structs or interfaces or whatever
and an advantage to using a DLL is
people won't be able to see your code
and they won't be able to edit your code
also it's much easier to transport than
having to give people multiple class
files so in order to create your own DLL
you just want to go up to new project
and select class library and then you
just don't want to name it to anything
you would like I'm just going to call my
DLL well you should probably name it
something relevant to what your deal I
will actually have in it and then once
you're satisfied with the name just go
ahead and click OK alright so as you can
see you just have a new class file and
inside of our class file we just have a
namespace and a class now if you're
going to have multiple namespaces which
I suggest you do if you're having a
larger project then just have one
namespace and then inside of that
namespace put the other namespaces that
you're going to be using so if you just
say like my DLL like in your project and
then inside of there like split it up
into other namespaces so you want to
have a namespace for clients clients and
then instead of our client namespace I
just have like a class multiplying and
this just makes it much more organized
and inside of our client class right
here I'm going to put a couple
properties one for clients name and
another for a client's age and I'm just
going to make it so whoever is using
this class will be able to read and
write these properties
all right so once you have everything
all set up just go ahead and go up to
safe and then you're just gonna want to
save your DLL call anything I'm just
going to call it might be ll but right
now
then click Save once you've done that
just go up to debug build the solution
and then start debugging and you'll get
an error but that's okay this was just
created a DLL alright so once you've got
everything set up and debugged and build
go over to another some sharp
application right click on the
references and click add reference and
then you can see your dll in your folder
and in order to get to it you're going
to go to the Visual Studio 2010 folder
which should be in the documents and go
to projects your DLL select your DLL
folder then go up to bin then debug and
inside of there you should just see your
DLL and then just click OK and we'll add
it to the references see it's right
there so now in order to use everything
inside of our DLL we're just going to go
to the code of our application and say
using and then the namespace that we
call this so to be my vol that should
pop up right there and now after it
since we have a namespace inside of my
DLL we can put a dot and you should see
that clients right there so now that we
put dot clients we should have access to
this client class right here alright so
now we can just create new client C and
equal to a new client and then we can
just save seed name people whatever yeah
now have access to this client class so
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
on creating your own DLL so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
