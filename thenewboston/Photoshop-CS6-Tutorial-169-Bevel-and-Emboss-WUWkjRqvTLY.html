we're going to be talking about working
with the bevel and emboss layer style in
Photoshop cs6 and my name is buddy
Blackford if you haven't figured that
out by now so what a bevel and emboss
does is it kind of makes the layer look
3d and it gives it an illusion of 3d by
using some shadows and contour and stuff
like that so let's go ahead and get in
there go ahead and either make a text
layer or shape layer these are the
easiest to work with for a bevel and
emboss so go ahead and add your bevel
and emboss and you can see already that
let me let me move this piece over
cancel this out real quick move the
piece over like this so we can see our
options alright there we go
now you can see already that we've got
the illusion of 3d now um there are a
couple other properties of bevel and
emboss that I'm going to need to go over
we've got our contour here and texture
but let's start off by going over these
kind of things over here these
properties so we've got our style and
the styles
we've got outer bevel we've got inner
bevel emboss pillow emboss at stroke and
boss and just click on those to see the
different types of the differences
between these so you can see that inner
bevel is uh the most like 3d ish and
then we've got our technique here and
we've got a couple of different
techniques for each style so we got
smooth
we got chisel hard you can see like that
looks like it's been like a router has
been taken to it then we've got chisel
soft and you can see the difference
there it looks like someone took a bad
router to it
I can't jump it all over me and truly
climbing up my leg and stuff like that
all right
um so leave it too smooth for now we've
got a depth here and that goes from 1 to
1000 and higher depth values increase
the intensity of the bevel so if I go
like this you can see that there's a lot
more bevel going on and it doesn't
increase it a whole lot but you've got a
lot of numbers in between so you got a
lot of fine-tuning that you can do so
now we've got our direction here and
basically you pick up or down and that
just either that reverses the highlights
the next thing we've got here is our
size and that goes from 0 to 250 and you
can see how that affects it basically
how far in the bevel goes and how large
it is and then we've got soften here and
that goes from 0 to 16 and that gives us
softness to the edge of the bevel kind
of like blurs it so use that depending
on what you're you doing let's go down
here to this shading section now shading
goes we've got the angle here and now
the cat is climbing on the computer ok
now he's off alright so now we've got
our angle here and the angle goes from 0
to 360 and there it determines the angle
of the light source so if I move it
around you can see it armed you have a
depth like you can go closer to the
middle of the circle or you can come
farther out and you can see how that
differently affects the bevel and emboss
there we've got the use global light
which affects everything that you bevel
emboss in your document and then we've
got an altitude here now the altitude
goes from 0 to 90 degrees and it
determines the height of the light
source basically in relationship to this
image so if I increase that to maybe
something like 75 you can see the
differences so that's 75 and this is 15
so when I have it at 75 that the shadows
aren't is dark and they're more like
around the whole entire thing when I do
is 16 it basically has them the shadows
are harder and there are more specific
spots and the angle and the altitude can
both be adjusted at the same time by
dragging on this little circle here and
you can see the differences so when you
move in towards the center
that's the altitude when you move around
the circle that's the angle so let's
keep on going we've got gloves gloss
contour and that basically does the
brightness so if I click on these
different ones you can see the different
brightnesses and how they are different
within the image
I usually just stick with the first one
then into a leas here gives you a some
smoothness to the to the image here
we've got highlight mode we've got state
basically like blending mode so we've
got screen for the highlights usually
when you're doing the highlights either
want to choose lighten screen color
dodds linear dodge or light color and
these are all lightening properties are
lightening blending modes and then when
you are down here to the shadow modes
you want to use either darken multiply
color burn linear burn or darker color
because these are the darkening blending
modes we've got our opacity for each one
and then we've got our different colors
here for our for our lights so you can
see that there's a reddish a reddish
tint going on here instead of yet
instead of white and then if I change
this here to red you can see that
instead of black it's now like a purpley
color and since they're blended in with
a blending mode they are it's blending
in with the blue so it's not going to be
red it's going to be purplish because
red
in blue makes purple so there's a let's
put it all the way down to black you do
you want to go with like an off lack all
right so there's that
then um let's keep on going down Oh
weird that that was it for that no but
now we've got our couple other things
over here contour if I click on that it
basically just redistributes the
brightness levels so if I unclick it and
click on it it you can see like it's
just getting distributed a little
differently so either pick that or not
pick that depending on your likings
and then texture here we'll just add a
texture element to it on our contour as
well if you click on the actual word
contour you get your different contours
let me take the texture off and you can
experiment with different types of
contours with this curve here if you
would like to and you can add points to
the curve it's just like the curves that
curves affect up here the colour
correction for curves and then we've got
our range slider and you can see how
that affects it's more smooth when you
have it up higher not as smooth when you
have it down lower alright and then we
go to texture and this gives you the
ability to add a pattern so there's how
that works
snapped origin will Center it up then
we've got our scale to either make the
pattern larger or zoom in and zoom out
of it we've got our depth and that
affects the edges I'm gonna invert it
and then there's also linked with layer
and if I uncheck that basically it just
links with the layer you can just leave
that checked if you want to but that's
all the stuff for bevel and emboss and
there was a lot of different properties
but we went over them all so hopefully
you know you're a master with the bevel
and emboss you can make things look more
realist
or 3d if you need to so I pretty much
like this one it's a nice thing to bring
out some more character into your image
and the same as with drop shadow you
don't want to over use this in your
image you don't want to try to make
everything look 3d using a bevel and
emboss because ultimately it's not like
real 3d if you need to use a whole
project and there's a lot of 3d stuff in
it then you're going to want to either
use shapes or use an actual 3d modeling
program so that's it for this and
hopefully you guys are pros at this now
and on the next tutorial we're going to
be going over let's see what we're going
to go over color overlay so see you guys
in that one and I look forward to seeing
you guys there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
