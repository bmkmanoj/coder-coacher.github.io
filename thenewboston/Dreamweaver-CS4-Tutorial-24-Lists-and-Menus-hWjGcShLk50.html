checkboxes and radio buttons and those
two options are great for getting a
small amount of user input as far as as
far as options go you can use you can
use checkboxes to select multiple items
you can use radio buttons to select one
item but both of those they take up
space and if you have more than four or
five options they can very quickly crowd
your webpage so to solve that problem we
use what is called a list menu and we
create list menus because say for
example whenever you go to sign up for a
certain service or something on the web
a lot of times they'll ask you what
country you're from or something like
that and whenever you you go to select
what country are from you you'll click
on the drop-down menu and you'll see a
list of all the countries in the world
and that is a great example of when a
drop-down list menu should be used so in
this tutorial I'm going to show you how
to create that using Dreamweaver it's a
very similar process to the checkboxes
and radio buttons with that little a
little tiny difference so go over here
to our insert group and click on list
menu and I'm gonna give it a name of
months because I'm going to create a
list menu that has each month in the
year once you do that you go down here
in the properties inspector and you
refresh and you click inside anywhere
inside the select tag and you'll see a
few options here and the one we're
interested in right now is list values
this is very similar to the radio
buttons in the checkboxes it looks
exactly the same as far as entering the
values and the labels goes so I'm going
to
quickly abbreviate the names of the
months and give them a value of the
number that corresponds to that month
all right there we go now what this is
going to do once I press okay is it's
gonna add some options inside of our
select tab and an option is exactly what
it sounds like it's an option that is
inside of our list menu once once we
select it and it drops down inside of
our option tags we have the actual the
label and here we have our value which
is what's going to be submitted to the
handler whenever it is finished whenever
you click Submit so we're gonna run this
and see what it looks like and that is
exactly what you thought you would see
another option with the the list menu is
you can go down here and you can turn it
into a list instead of a menu so you
click on list and you can allow the user
to select multiple options so I'm going
to save that and run Firefox now you can
see that if you hold down control you
can select multiple multiple options
there so if you think about it the the
list menu is really it's it's a lot like
the radio buttons and the checkboxes
combined because inside of the list mini
you have the option to use it as a menu
and you can just select one just like
radio buttons or you can use it as a
list and allow multiple and then you can
select as many as you want just like a
check just like a text box so now that
we've seen
the different ways to handle user user
input we're gonna in the next tutorial
go through a few other different form
items and then we're going to use spry
elements to validate our forms so make
sure to continue watching because
there's definitely a lot more to be
learned about forms would just touch the
surface of what can be done with forms
so stay tuned there's a lot of mortals
there's a lot more cool stuff to come
and don't forget to subscribe and thanks
for watching
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
