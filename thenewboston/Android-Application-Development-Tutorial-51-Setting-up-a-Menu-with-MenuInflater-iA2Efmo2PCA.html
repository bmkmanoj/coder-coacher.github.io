Android tutorial for the new boss in get
with me Travis what we're going to do in
this tutorial is basically set up a menu
for for a menu class for the most part
so what I want you guys to do first is
right click on your resource folder and
we're going to add a new folder to this
that's going to hold all of our menus
that we will create which will prod just
be one yet make sure you select the
resource folder and an all lowercase
type menu hit finish and then in our
menu class we're going to add an XML
file to this so we're going to go
Android XML file or you can go to other
Android and then Android XML file and
this is just the same way we set up
layout and generally our layout would be
clicked but now as you can see the menu
is clicked so it kind of knows what
we're doing and then we're just going to
say a cool menu something like that
underscore menu dot XML again all
lowercase and then you'll save yourself
some headaches now what we're going to
do is just click over into the actual
XML code instead of our layout like that
and within our menu as before we'd see
like linear layout here but now it knows
that it's a menu as well so we're going
to set up some items within our menu as
you do the open or greater than sign you
can see it takes a group or an item
we're going to set up some items first
thing we want to Adam have is a title so
instead of saying text equals it's
actually title when we're working with
menus we're going to say about us
something like that
then we also need to say Android ID and
we set this up just like every other
time at plus ID forward slash and then
about us is what we're going to refer to
our ideas then just to show you guys
some other stuff we can say Android and
then for example numeric shortcut if
they have a keyboard on their phone they
could push press like number one two
three or whatever we set this equal to
such as one
if they press the number one when our
menu is inflated it's going to select
this item and also as well you can do
Android alphabetic shortcut equal like
to a which would be about us it click
this menu as well so that's enough stuff
within this menu or this item for the
most part so we're just going to copy
that
and create one more item and we're going
to call this one preferences
and then for the ID we're going to say
preferences and then just change I'm
just going to delete these because I
don't really care about those for the
most part my phone doesn't have a
keyboard just touchscreen so my my mouse
keeps dying on me so I can't really
select stuff as well alright so there we
go
got our two items set up just exit out
of there
and as you can see we have our menu
called cool menu now I want you guys to
open up the menu class that we set up
hence as you guys noticed in the last
tutorial haven't really thought through
this whole tutorial series that much
because I was getting that air and for
this one we're kind of going to get it
air as well but it's not going to be a
big deal
and I'm also going to minimize all of
these methods within here and our
variables and you can do that right here
by these buttons next to our blocks of
code and just minimize it and minimize
our oncreate method minimize our on list
item click method and it kind of cleans
up a code so they're still there
obviously so you can you know maximize
and minimize then we're just going to go
within this bracket here and we're going
to right-click we're going to go down to
source again override implement methods
and not under it's not under a list
activity it's under a regular activity
we have a method called on options what
is it on create options menu let's look
yeah that's right here sorry on create
options menu and that's where we're
going to set up our menu for the most
part as you can see it takes a menu
variable within his parameters and this
is where I said I kind of wasn't
thinking the most part wasn't thinking
through and so basically all it does is
it defines a menu variable called menu
lower case as you can see it has some
the Android dot view so it's kind of
more specific because if we didn't
that for example like this what it be
referring to is this class that we set
up called menu which is not what we want
so we probably should have labeled this
class something different like my menu
or something because there's an actual
class called menu from the Android SDK
so thankfully it kind of imports that
for us as well it's going to know it's
talking about the SDK menu class not our
menu class and then it's going to set
this variable menu that we can work with
but we aren't going to really worry
about that now what I want you guys to
do is this is pretty important for now
so delete this return for this first
line of code that most likely got
imported delete that otherwise we're
gonna get in air and I'm just going to
leave it there to show you guys because
a lot of times people like watch the
tutorials and they get an error and they
don't know where they messed up so I'll
show you up to you guys one more time
that we need to delete that we're going
to set up within our bracket is
something called a menu inflator and
this is going to inflate our menu for
the most part so we're gonna say menu
inflator we're gonna say blow-up I don't
know something like that
again we have to import our menu
inflator class so we can use its suite
methods and we're just going to use a
method called get menu inflator so let's
get menu inflator this will kind of just
be it method that we can use so we can
say blow up dot inflate which is a
method from the menu class or menu
inflator class and as you can see it
takes a resource menu item and also a
menu item as well so a resource menu
item is what we just set up in that menu
class so we're going to say our menu for
into the menu for folder and our
resources and then cool menu and we're
good for our first parameter again our
second parameter gave us some data we're
going to use that data that gives us and
they label that data menu all lowercase
so that's what we're using there and
basically all we have to do now is get
rid of that error because again if you
guys aren't paying attention this is
where we fix this so just delete the
turn and then down below we're going to
say return true and then semicolon and
basically we have our menu inflator
working I'll show you what that looks
like as we run the program or run the
application again yeah I press should
not called this class menu when we
started but no biggie so now when we hit
our menu item right here it pops up a
little menu for us with two menu items
and these menu items don't do anything
that's we're going to set up in the next
tutorial if you click on but that's all
that does so there we go I'll catch you
guys in the next tutorial have a good
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
