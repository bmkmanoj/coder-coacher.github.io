and flash today I'm going to be teaching
you guys about layers now what layers
are is a way to better organize your
pieces of your animation so if you had a
huge animation with a bunch of different
images on it you might want to organize
them into layers and today I'm going to
teach you how to do that as you can see
we have one layer right now and that's
what we've been working with before so
let's go ahead and create the simple
animation I'll make it a just a red
rectangle and I'm just going to make it
moving by using a shape tween as you can
see we have this red rectangle moving
from left to right with the use of a
shape tween now if we wanted another
object say to move from the right-handed
screen to the left side making this in
the same layer would be a pain in the
butt so here's what you would do right
click layer number one and click insert
layer as you can see on your timeline it
automatically inserts a new layer now go
ahead and click the first keyframe for
layer number two in let's insert another
shape let's make a blue circle just so
we got some contrast and you can see the
difference
so in this layer we're going to want to
make another insight screen and let's
enter a key frame in the 30th frame and
let's move this object level green and
of course i'll insert a basic shape
tween as you can see now when we play
our image our layers now move in two
different directions now this would be a
kneeler nearly impossible to do with one
layer and that's why when you have
different pieces of your animation you
want to separate them into layers now
let's say you're working on layer number
two and you didn't want to see this red
rectangle I thought it was annoying or
in the way or whatever here's what you
can do under layer number one which is
this you can always hide it and there's
I at top that says show or hide layers
just click the little dot until I X pops
up right here and your layer is now
invisible and anytime you want to pop it
back up just click the X again and that
reappears now this lock right here is to
lock layers say you're working on this
or another layer and you knew your if
you kept it up you're going to
accidentally erase it or something to
make sure you don't change it at all no
matter what click this what this does is
lock it and anytime you're editing it
this layer that your it's locked is not
affected you can apply this as many
layers as you want now anytime you're
editing layers any layer that has a lock
on it is
unaffected by the edits and you always
can unlock it by clicking lock now
another thing I want to talk to you guys
about is rearranging your layers as you
see when we click enter the blue circle
moves over the red square or rectangle
this is because if you see right here in
our timeline the blue layer number two
which is a circle appears on top of
layer number one and this appears so
that the red of blue I mean the blue
circle is appearing over the red
rectangle and if you want to change that
all you need to do is click them as you
can see Larry number two is now under
layer number one and as you can see when
we play it in the timeline the blue
circle now appears under layer number
one and this is the easy way you can
rearrange layers and two other things I
want to talk to you guys about is delete
a layer simply right-click it and pick
delete layer to rename a layer simply
double-click the name and you can rename
it anything you want and the last thing
I want to talk to you guys about is when
you have a bunch of layers so let me
just create a bunch of layers say you
had 30 layers in your animation was huge
you probably want to organize them in a
folder and that's what this little some
symbol is right next to the garbage can
just click it
and anything you want to put in your
folder drop it in and drop it in and as
you can see you can contract or expand
this by clicking the arrow sign this is
how to organize a bunch of your layers
in folder now now that we learn how to
use layers a couple of different things
we can do to our layers and how how to
organize them we're going to be learning
next about some pretty enhanced drunks
and how to make some sweet graphics so
if you didn't actually catch everything
I went over today I'm going to be
covering it all on my website the New
Boston calm and I'll give you a written
step-by-step instruction on everything
we talked about so you can better follow
along thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
