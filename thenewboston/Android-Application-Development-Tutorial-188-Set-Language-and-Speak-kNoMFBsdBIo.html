all right that's good to hear
a welcome to your 188 they enjoyed
tutorial for the new Boston where we're
going to hopefully finish up this text
voice activity what we're going to do
within our initialization of our
text-to-speech instance here we're going
to set the language that what you want
it to speak in and right here this
should be status just for reference it's
passing in the status and that status
refers to either being a successful or
it not working so what we're going to do
is going to say if status is not equal
to text to speech dot err then we're
going to set up the language that we
want it to to speak in so what we're
going to do is just say text-to-speech
dot set language and we're going to set
this to locale dot US or you know
whatever language there we go
so pretty simple you guys can probably
see those other choices we have like
China China and all that other good
stuff so uh and there we go we basically
set up our language that we want our
text-to-speech to speak in and you know
that's good so now what we have to do is
set up our on click method again our
button when it clicks we want to read
one of these choices up here we have
three choices so what we want us to do
is pick a random string out of our array
up there called text so we're going to
do is we're going to say random R is
equal to new random pretty familiar and
then what we're going to do a door in
ports and then we're just going to say
string we're going to call this random
set this equal to our text array up
there so we're going to say text and
then basically which position so we have
position 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 but we all obviously
just want to random position so
just going to say our dot next int and
we're going to pass in three because we
have three options whoa so there we go
or we could again just say our like text
array dot length that we kind of got
familiar with in OpenGL so that's kind
of the choices that you can use to get a
rant or that's just one option you can
use to get a random text or random
string and then all we're going to do is
we're going to say okay text to speech
how about you talk so we're going to say
speak and it takes you know three
parameters the text so we're going to
refer to our random text that we just
set up the cue mode and what we're going
to do here is we're going to say if
anything else is talking at the moment
we want it to shut up for the most part
and so it can hear this new speech that
it's going to give and it's going to be
a great speech so we're just going to
say text to speech dot cue whoops ah man
way too tired here cue flush and that's
just again going to stop whatever's been
talking it's going to start a new speech
and for a third parameter we're just
going to set equal to null and there we
go we pretty much are done let's just
check this out see if it works and again
hopefully it works on the emulator so
let's go down here to our text voice
that's up gangstas what that sound like
what's up gangsters you smell you smell
nice up gangstas you smell I have a
price on Travis hmm that's legit all
right well you guys get the concepts and
I'll catch you guys in the next tutorial
hope you enjoyed it and see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
