welcome to another After Effects cs6
tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and I just
got back from yesterday's festivities
which we had a beer Olympics and for
some reason I don't even have a hangover
anything so I decided to make a bunch of
tutorials and by the way my team got
second place and we ended up having to
forfeit to the first-place team because
my teammates won passed out in the field
and the other one was too blacked-out to
even like play but I was good
well whatever so let's get on with this
and we're gonna I'm gonna show you
another keen technique called color
range so let's get started on that come
I have my video footage here which is
just let me take my let me hide my mask
real quick and show you what's going on
so we'll go to none and it's just this
gun on top of a green screen background
and the green screen is a cloth you can
see the different folds and everything
in it from it being a cloth so let's use
this stuff kind of to our advantage and
start and use our color range so when
you're making when you're going to keep
something out and it's moving around
usually want to make a mask around the
area and this is called a garbage mask
or a garbage mat you might hear people
call out call it and what it does
basically is oops wrong way what it does
is lowers the amount of keying or lowers
the amount of background that you
actually need to key out so like if the
let me go back to none if this side you
can kind of tell that down here it's not
the same well-lit as it is right here in
the center so this green down here is
darker than this green up here but we
don't need to worry about that because
we don't need to worry about keying this
out because the gun never actually goes
over there so just I mean pay attention
to where your footage is going and use
your garbage man to move it
you can also animate your garbage man if
you need to but I didn't need to in this
situation so let's start keying let's go
up to let me put the mask back on and
let's come up here to effect make sure
you have your layer selected and we're
going to go to keying we're gonna go to
color range and you can use these
droppers here to add colors to your
color range so let me select like the
screen and it starts taking away more of
the color you can use this plus button
here to add more of the shades of green
if you would like so I can come down
here and add more and I see we've got
some things going on here so well we can
change the color spaces and stuff like
that
to try it again
I got a click on the plus button instead
so keep on trying to take out some
greens
and we see all this like extra dots and
everything like that and it's probably
annoying to just like kind of like try
to select all these every time so what
we're gonna do is mess with our
fuzziness here and we're gonna turn it
up so we can try to get some of that
stuff out of there if you go too far you
start like taking out transparency out
of your image so you can see your alpha
here and what it looks like so this is
probably a good time remember you can
always use your spill suppressor to take
out the green hint or green tint at the
end and change it to like a black color
so underneath the fuzziness in the color
space we've got our different our ranges
here and if we mess with those you can
see the effect that they have this one
looks like it's taken out some of the
yellows that's the minimums and here's
the max and if you ever look at your
preview over here you can see how the
output gets affected this is the alpha
that's being created
we've got more like kind of our green
green C going on here if you go too far
you can always go back up to the
negative dropper and just start like
pulling out some of some of the colors
but I mean it gets problem that probably
gets annoying after a while so I'm just
gonna ctrl Z so just tweak your
different settings to get what you want
we got not even how far back no I don't
want it I just wanna undo undo a bunch
of things there we go so now we're back
to what we were at so let's throw on our
spill suppressor here and just type in
spill suppressor on the in the effects
and presets is in the keying section we
can zoom in here and get this this all
this green and that looks like it got a
pretty decently and move your suppressor
up or down on depending on what you need
to do so there you go that's a that's
how you use the color range it's like it
can tweak this a little more so is
there's not so much black around the
spill suppressor I mean look you try to
let me turn the spill suppressor off
real quick you can try to add some more
this color around the edge in there we
want to take out that you see I got too
close and it started taking away color
out of the hand so I should back up
until it uh there we go need to do it a
few times it looks like to undo make it
undo so let's try to add this green
well if you have more time you can go in
and like take out different things now
and this is good if you have like
different colors in your background for
some reason or the luminance is really
high so like I said if there's a really
bright spot and then there's a really
dark spot and your color key isn't
getting it fully you can combine these
two techniques and the spill suppressor
to get some nice good color key no I'm
not gonna mess with this too much I mean
it takes a while to just come in and
like fix everything up and get it all
nice and neat but you have the idea of
how this effect works and how to use it
now let's check out our outfit real
quick and see what's going on here and
it looks like our alpha is not full not
fully an alpha some of the colors have
been taken out and we didn't we didn't
really want that so I made another
tutorial before and I'll try to pull it
up real quick and I'm just gonna bring
that over to this side tutorial 87
fixing transparency in alpha mattes and
I would go over how to fix something
like this and just go to that one it is
again tutorial 87 in the cs6 series so
thanks for watching this one you've got
the idea of how to use the color range
and now you can use that in place with a
color key and a spill suppressor here
see what that looks like with that on
and the spill suppressor here to get a
nice key going on there so thanks for
watching this one have a good day
