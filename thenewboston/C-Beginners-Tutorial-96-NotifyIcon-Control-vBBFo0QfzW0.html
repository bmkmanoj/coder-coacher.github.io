vitorio that I'm making for the New
Boston and in this tutorial i'm going to
be showing you how do you notify icon
control and basically the notify icon
control will allow us to have a balloon
tip message show from the system tray
and the system tray is this right down
here so all you're going to need for
this tutorial is a button and a notify
icon so the scroll of your tool box and
drag a notify icon over to form the
first thing that we're gonna have to do
is select an icon for our notify icon
and basically this will just be the
image that he notified icon balloon tip
will come out up so like if you were to
have a good'n kick show from visual
studio right here then then the balloon
tip would pop out of this image review
so we're going to need to provide an
image for it and i'm just going to use
this image it doesn't really matter what
you use but it has to be an ICO format
and you can find ICO format or icon
images at icon finder calm so once
you've your icon selected let's go ahead
and double click on button 1 right here
in order to show our balloons if message
just need to notify icon 1 show blue
tick and the first parameter that it
falls for is a timeout in integers in an
integer and basically this is set right
here the time period in milliseconds of
leadership tip should display so
basically however long the boobs if will
be displayed in milliseconds and we want
it to be displayed for one second so
we're going to form 1000 here then
thousand milliseconds or one whole
second we're also going to create a
title or a tooltip I'm going to make it
say come on title
we're also going to need to have text
inside of our with it unless we make it
say my text right now
we'll make it something different later
on and we're also going to be an icon
for tooltip I'm just gonna make it say
info because there's no there's no error
so now let me be bug here you click this
button we should get a notify icon or a
balloon tip from our system tray right
here
yep and as you can see it's from the
icon that we selected now these are
commonly used when you're hiding your
application so if you hid your
application and then you just wanted to
let you know that your application is
still running you've used the notify
icon to do that so in order to hide your
application you just want to do this
because this will refer to form one so
whatever class you're in and then we're
going to do dot hi and the hide method
will basically just hide the form from
users and we're just going to let them
know that it's still running
so we can change it to still running and
let's change this to your app to still
running all right so now maybe bug here
and click this fun this form should be
hidden and we should get a notify icon
or balloon tick telling us so I'm
telling us that the application is still
running we have it stored on now in
order to have the application come back
or so you can view it again we're just
going to create an event for when
someone double puts on a lunatic so it's
going to go down here select our notify
icon go over to events go down to Mouse
double click there it's going to save
this duh show so now when someone double
clicks on the balloon tip the
application should be shown once again
it will now go
yes this would go back to saikhan yep
shows up so that's pretty much it for
this tutorial
so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
