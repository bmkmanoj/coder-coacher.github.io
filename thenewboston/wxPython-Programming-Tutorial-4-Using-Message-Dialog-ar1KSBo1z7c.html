tutorial and this is going to be a real
quick tutorial on how to get input from
the user
now all these frames and windows are
nice and all but eventually we're going
to need to get some input from the user
if it you want to actually make this a
useful program in one way or another and
there are a bunch of different ways to
do that
but in this tutorial I'm going to be
showing you how to use something called
a message dialog and these are those
boxes that pop up be like do you want to
continue yes/no or do you greet terms
yes okay whatever
let me just show you pretty much what
I'm talking about
first make variable or object and set it
equal to WX message dialog and make sure
to put a period in between there as
usual message Di al dialog now this is
going to take some parameters the first
parameter is the parent and I'm just
going to put none because I don't want
to have parent I can put panel if I want
but uhm anyway it's not important the
next parameter is what you want the
question or statement be so I'm going to
make this a yes or no check box so I'm
going to say do I have the best
tuts aka tutorials so after this and
let's put a question mark right there so
this is the question in our check box
after this the parameter it takes after
this is the title of the box actually
it's just name it title because I'm
running out of room on my tutorial and
the last tutorial that it's going to
take in this uh or excuse me less
parameter it's going to take in this
tutorial is the style so let's go ahead
and put WX yes and caps underscore not
plus no since this is going to be yes no
checkbox so we have it doesn't have any
parent here's the question here's the
title and you're going to have the
options of yes or no so in our next line
what we want to do is take whatever they
checked either yes or no and
store is variable so we can use it so
this is right answer I'm going to name
an answer you can name yours whatever as
usual box or whatever your object is
show em OD al and I don't even know how
to say it but what show modal is or
model whatever is the value of this yes
or no so if you check yes it's going to
be yes no it's going to check now and if
I remember correctly which I probably
don't instead of storing the text yes or
no I think it's going to store integer
probably like 0 or 1 or negative 1 or 1
or negative 1 or 0 1 of those but
anyways that's a story for another day
but anyways it's going to be stored in
the variable answer if we didn't have a
variable to store the information then a
wife and get it but anyways when you're
done that you want to get rid of your
box so just write destroyed and this
will end your box oh well plain and
simple so let's go ahead and run this
program and let's see if I got it right
do I have the best
tuts again remember the titles up here
let's see if we can get it BAM
so we made a message dialog this is what
this whole entire thing is first to take
the that's not important do I have the
best Tut's that pops up is the question
the title pops up is the title and the
CS no pops up is a yes/no so whatever I
click either yes is going to be stored
and this is from last tutorial if I
click yes then answer is going to be
equal to yes if I click no answer is
going to be equal to no and once that
variables stored then the box destroys
itself so another thing that you might
want is and again we're going to be
going over these styles in probably a
couple of tutorials from now but it's
just an okay check box and let's just
say um go on or something like that it
wouldn't be a question since you just
have okay now once you run it
and it says go on you just have a plain
old okay no options no yes or no so go
ahead and click that and then you can
move on so that's how you make a basic
message dialog it's called in again you
can use your styles in your last
parameter have okay or yes/no if you
have a yes/no it's often useful to use
this variable to store the value of
whatever they checked so you know what
they checked so thank you for watching
in the next tutorial I'll be showing you
some other ways to get input from the
user but again thank you for watching
don't forget subscribe and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
