this is actually our last story on
mutable strings for now and what I did
if you couldn't tell from the old story
is I deleted everything except one week
or I did our dog mute and I actually set
mu equal to dog you know just like
before I'm printing it out so I only
have so far on our console is hot dog I
thought you said pumpkin a mutable
string so pretty cool so now with that
being said I can begin teaching in new
stuff now the first thing I want to
teach you to do is I mean we already
learned how to create a mutable shirring
from unmute string but what if you just
want to create a mutable shirt from
nothing just set it equal to you know
anything well anytime you want to just
you know create a plain old mutable
shrink just go ahead and put mute and
just go put set string and then you just
set it equal to whatever you want
pretty easy so let's go ahead and type
in like I am a new string mofo Mogo
muggle I am a new string mofo
so yeah that's it's looking pretty good
and so now we got a new string so now
let's go ahead and print this out and
let's see if this runs so here's an old
string hot dog today's a pumpkin and now
I'm a new string mofo you know it's a
little harsh but you know kid gets the
point across so what can we do after
this well the one thing I want to teach
you guys is how to replace a range of
characters so say instead of I'm a new
string mofo just be Ike I'm a new mother
or something so let's go ahead and call
the method mute place characters and
arrange to look at that and ennis make
range in our range is let's see 0 1 2 3
4 5 6
10:11 all right so our coordinates are
11 12 and remember it's where you want
to start and how many you're on a
replace and further replace with string
is what do you want to replace it with
so let's just go ahead and put mother
that looks good nice and simple
so now there what it did is it took the
string mofos and it replaced it with
mother and let's put explanation point
because you know I'm a new mother this
is a big moment in our lives it was the
biggest moment in my life at least I
gave birth to my kid for my first time
anyways it's building around this to see
what we got so now instead of I'm a new
string mofo says I'm a new mother see
it's a little less harsh and a little
more inspirational and that's what I'm
trying to do inspire you guys so the
last thing I'm gonna do is inspire you
guys to show you how to replace old
characters with new characters sorry
saying Ari we already learned how to
replace characters and arrange but we
want our computer program to
automatically sift through I mean we
don't want to have to figure out the
range every time we want our computer
program to be able to sift through any
string we give it search for the first
instance of mother and replace it with
something else like baby seal or
something like that so this kind of gets
rid of the fact that we have to sift
through and find 11 12 keep counting
every time so check this out and you'll
see what I'm talking about the first
thing we have to do is NS string create
a new string object and this is going to
store the old stuff that we want to
replace and we want to replace mother
make sure I spelled them both right or
else it won't work and string go ahead
and make a new object and yeah I'm gonna
name it new and now here is gonna store
what we want to replace it with an hour
and place mother with baby seal you
don't have to name it old and new I'm
just making it simple so I can show you
guys so and
range the range just like that and this
is gonna store the range but check this
out you don't have to actually calculate
the range by hand although you could all
you have to do is this and your mu your
mutable shrink book range of string and
then go ahead and as a parameter pass in
old and it will automatically calculate
the range for this how awesome is that
that's one of the coolest thing we
learned so far so this automatically
gives us the range where old is and it
stores it in the range so we don't have
to count anymore and figure out these
coordinates it figures that out for us
so now all I have to do now that we have
that range in all the information we
need go ahead and call this method so
iron your mutable string you want to
replace characters in a range and now
you have to give it what range in case
you have a bunch of them the range that
it calculated for us and it says all
right what do you want to replace it
with and all we want to do is take that
old character that was in that range and
we want to replace it with a new so
pretty much says replace characters in
the older range with the new range which
was baby seal pretty cool so now that's
all we have to do now I go ahead copy
and print this stuff out and run it and
hopefully this worked yep check it out
it was I am a new mother and now it says
I'm a new baby seal so what it did is it
automatically calculated the mother what
the range of this was automatically took
it out automatically replaced it
everything's going on automatically here
what do we even do in program this stuff
for forever visions happened
automatically ah see now I'm out of
breath and I'm gonna go get my inhaler
and take a break maybe take a nap
because that was a long story we had a
lot to learn so I'm gonna comment in
this and make it easier to understand
and I'm gonna go ahead and post it in
the link below if you want to go get it
so I think you guys for watching don't
forget subscribe and yeah
make sure check out the next tutorial is
going to be awesome
trust me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
