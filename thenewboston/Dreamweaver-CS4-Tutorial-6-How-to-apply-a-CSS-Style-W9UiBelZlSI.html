going to show you how to create and
apply a cascading style sheet to a
Dreamweaver HTML document so open up
your HTML document inside of Dreamweaver
and you're gonna click on format and
then go to CSS Styles say new here we
have the selector type just Canobie
class ID or tag you'll usually use the
class or an ID the class can apply it to
any HTML element and anyone use the ID
basically whenever you're just using it
on one so I'm going to create a style
that applies to only the body tag and
it's going to make the background black
so I'm gonna click on ID and say body
background as the name and then I'm
going to click on new style sheet
because we want to create an external
cascading style sheet say ok and I
created one earlier that was called CSS
but I'm gonna name a new one and we're
gonna call it news
so as you see it it took this
information that we gave it and turn it
into a link tag inside of the header in
your HTML file and it linked it to new
CSS CSS and it popped up with the
definition for the body background ID
that we just created so I'm going to
click on background as you can see
there's a lot of options here to
completely customize exactly what is
inside that body tag but for here we're
gonna make the background color black
and we're gonna make the text Carolina
blue actually anymore that one there we
go
alright so you gonna clean out here and
everything should turn black once we
apply this style so you click inside the
body and you see here in your properties
inspector you should have the class we
refresh this well attach the stylesheet
okay Oh
let's do this oh you know what we need
to save the page that's why it's there
we go
Oh any living ID I'm sorry there we go
now we type inside of the body and it
should be blue dudx
there we go and that is how you create a
cascading style sheet and so I have
dreamweaver thanks for watching and
