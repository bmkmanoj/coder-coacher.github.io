Effects cs6 tutorial I'm host buddy
Blackford and in this tutorial we're
going to be learning about making motion
paths in 3d so yesterday it was about 80
degrees out and about 180 in my room
today it's like 20 degrees out and like
negative 20 in my room so I mean mother
nature is just like messing with me and
I'm hot and I'm cold and that just
reminded me of the Katy Perry song that
I don't want to sing but me and Bucky
went out and grilled some steaks
yesterday it was a good day
and the steaks were like 1 inch thick
rib eyes that were good so let's uh
mainly just get on with the tutorial I
just wanted to give you like an update
on him because you guys keep on asking
where he is so that's just a quick
update you guys will see him in a little
while he's working on his new website so
let's get on with the tutorial so making
a motion path in 3d is similar to making
a motion path in not in 2d except for
there's another axis you need to worry
about which is the Z that's this blue
one right here now I'm going to switch
to my selection tool and to work
efficiently while you're in 3d mode
you're going to want to remember to use
the hotkeys for your for your tools the
selection tool is V and then for the
hand tool I just use my middle mouse
button and then you're going to want to
switch to the unified camera tool which
is C and they're right next to each
other so that is pretty convenient you
can just put your fingers on the C and V
tool and then if you ever need to rotate
that's W which is up at the top and
you'll learn to move around easily with
those personally I put my fingers
my index finger on the F key because it
has a little stub on it and then I
remember where the the tools are just
like I'm typing without looking at the
keyboard so if you learn how to type
without looking at the keyboard is
really helpful in using your hotkeys so
let's get on with the actual moving of
the motion path real quick so I'm going
to set a keyframe I'm going to have my
position open I'm going to set a
keyframe on the first frame and right
now I'm in my custom view and I'm going
to want to move him back and around the
view so let's move up a second and then
we'll move him around and then I got to
move him back and then I'm going to move
up a few more seconds and just want to
make like a simple arch
now as you can see in the custom view
it's kind of hard to figure out what the
heck I'm doing can you even tell what's
going on really you can kind of see that
he moves back a lot but I'm not getting
any good fine-tuning so let me switch to
my camera and look this is not what I
wanted at all now I wanted to show you
how not to do it first which was using
your custom view in my previous
tutorials about using the views we
learned that when you're using 3d space
you want to use your 4 views here now I
have main camera top front active camera
main camera and active camera right now
are the same so I'm going to switch this
one by right-clicking and I'm going to
switch it to right and I'm going to
switch these around to what I like I'm
going to switch this one to custom view
and this one here to top so we can see
that this guy has bent this guy's
rotated I click on here he's been
rotated and this is the motion path he
wants now what I wanted to do was just
make a simple arch where he moves back
he was backwards it goes up and then
comes back down now that should be
should be easy in in our in our stop and
right views these are views which go
down in axis are just called
orthographic views you can you only see
them on an axis and you can't rotate
around so let's delete our keyframes
here
and in our custom view we couldn't tell
that he was rotated because of the way
we had our camera so let's go back to
our main camera here and rotate him to
what we want him to be to be at I need
to click on the rotation tool here there
we go now he is at forty four so he's at
the position that I want now oops so now
I can press P to bring up my position
and then start animating so I'm going to
hit my V key so I can click so I can use
my selection tool to start animating and
this is the main camera I'm going to use
the top view here I'm going to move him
back oh I got to move ahead a couple
keyframes let's move them back and then
to the right
now I'm going to use my right view here
to move them up and I'm going to keep
them in view using this main camera here
now I mean you can't really tell how
well I did that in this custom view so
that's why I'm trying to teach you guys
how to use these orthographic views
let's move a little bit more and then I
can use this to move him back down to
where he was and I can switch I can
switch to this view and then we can look
and see how he works now and that's
pretty much the way I wanted it I wanted
to show you in the beginning how not to
do it which is by using the custom view
but you can use the custom view to look
around and see what's going on you don't
want to animate in the custom view
sometimes you can get good at it and end
up animating in it but that's for people
that are more advanced and really have
an idea of what's going on and their
scene that's that's the end of the
tutorial there's I'm not going to go
over how to animate position or anything
like that there's a tutorial about that
in the earlier sections it's one of the
first tutorials in the cs6 series that
I'm doing and just use those to figure
out how to animate things so that's the
end there's pretty much nothing out so I
wanted to go over let's end the tutorial
here thanks for watching I look forward
to seeing you at the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
