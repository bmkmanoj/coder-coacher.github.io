24th biology video and in this video I
want to talk to you guys about life so
somes
now lysosomes are special vesicles
they're actually made by the Golgi
apparatus and the job of these is
basically to clean up your cell now by
clean up your so I mean get rid of all
of the harmful stuff in your cell so
you're left with only the things that
your cell needs so let me go ahead and
draw so here's the nucleus right here
good-looking nucleus and might as well
draw some ER to give you guys a context
of where everything is some pretty
good-looking he are draw some smooth ER
oh nice and some smooth kind of looks
like a tapeworm no big deal
and let me just go ahead and draw the
Golgi apparatus I'll draw it is blue Wow
that is that's a really bad looking
Golgi apparatus okay so there's a closi
apparatus right there and now let me go
ahead and dry you guys what a lysosome
would look like so lysosomes would
pretty much be these things right here
these vesicles that are just floating
around your cell you actually have a lot
of them in your cell
so just go ahead and label these
lysosomes right here in here
now inside your life somes are digestive
enzymes and what these enzymes do is
they break up crap that's harmful to the
cell so say we had something harmful
right here in harmful right here maybe
it was just a molecule that your cell
didn't need or maybe it was a molecule
that might be hurting an organelle well
what these lysosomes would do is they
would surround this molecule right here
and begin to break it up into smaller
pieces now once it's broken up into
smaller pieces then the cell is either
going to use those pieces to build
something else or it's just going to
spit them out of the cell so basically
lysosomes break up stuff that's harmful
to your cell and aside from that they
also help remove dead organelles so say
that we have an organelle I don't know
I'll just say this er right here well
say that something happened to the ER
causes it to die what these lysosomes
would do is that would go and surround
this
and start breaking it up into smaller
pieces now whenever this is broken up of
course just like the harmful molecules
it's going to be broken up into proteins
and other molecules and the pieces the
proteins and other molecules they're
going to be used to a make a new
organelle make a new ER or be just be
spat out and then the cell would die but
nonetheless lysosomes that's what they
do they're kind of like garbageman they
break down the garbage so the cell can
either throw them away or recycle them
in the case of you know maybe it wants a
new organelle it would have to do that
so remember one last time whenever you
have a harmful material lysosomes break
it down and spit it out or whenever you
break down the organelle maybe it died
for some reason your cell can recycle
those pieces and make a new organelle so
that's what a lysosome is thank you guys
for watching and I'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
