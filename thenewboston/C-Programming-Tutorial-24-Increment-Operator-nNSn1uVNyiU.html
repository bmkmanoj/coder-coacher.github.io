tutorial I want to show you guys about
this cool little bit of code called the
increment operator now what this is is
it's a really quick and efficient way to
either add one or subtract one from a
variable and we'll see later on why this
is actually not even useful but like
pretty much necessary so let's just go
ahead and make a quick little variable
right now and actually I don't want
named it X that's boring let's name it
tuna because I love tuna and it sounded
kind of weird over those two I don't
know whatever
so anyways we'll just go ahead and print
it out on the screen printf do love tuna
though and since this is % d and will
queue to a new line so we print out tuna
right now and of course it prints out 20
on the screen nothing that exciting
about that so the cool thing I want to
talk to you guys about is this operator
and what it is is it's basically a
symbol that you add or right after your
variable name so type in your variable
name my case tuna and add two little
plus signs now what this is going to do
is it's pretty much going to say okay
I'm going to add one to your variable so
increase its value by one so now tuna is
equal to 21 so if I copy and print it
out now check it out it was 20 that's
why I printed this out and then added 1
and it print out the new value now you
can also do this with - - of course this
takes away one or subtracts one from
your variable so let me close this and
run it again and that's why you got 19
now another thing that I want to point
out and that confuses a lot of people is
this if I just showed you guys this
example and I put that increment
operator before tuna and I ran this your
guys here Mike okay 24:21 so it really
doesn't matter if you have it before or
after the variable because it adds one
what the heck I never even Oh same guys
text me again
freaking one every time he wants to eat
cracker
cracker boat shut up with bagels with my
stupid cat alright so right now you may
be thinking are it doesn't matter if you
have this before or after tuna it adds
one to it tomato tomahto
but actually even though um it looked
the same right now there is a huge
difference and I'll show you guys an
example and once you guys see this
everything is begun going to become
crystal clear so let's go ahead and make
three variables in a equals setting what
anything you want set mine equal to five
be equal to ten and let's just like go
ahead and multiply these numbers
together so restore that value and
answer and right now it's equal to zero
but we'll change that later on so let's
just do something stupid like take
answer and set it equal to what would it
do first
plus plus a and remember that's the
increment operator so it's going to add
a 1 to the value of a which would become
6 and multiply it by B we'll just keep
be the same and now I just want to show
you guys the answer on the screen and
we'll just put the answer percent de and
we'll bump to a new line so that's
pretty much going to say okay a times B
print it out on the screen
easy enough simple stuff and you
actually probably need answer right
there if you want to print something out
and now what I want to do is I actually
want to copy all of this and I want to
do the exact same thing again but just
changing a few things now the first
thing I want to mention is this the
reason I copy this first line as well is
because I want to reset our variables
back to normal because right now we
added 1 to a so that's going to become 6
6 well excuse me
so reset that back to 5 and also answer
is going to go from 0 to whatever this
is
so reset that back to 0 so we can
calculate it again and also whenever
you're resetting on your variables
values make sure that you get rid of
that in T word that is only for you only
need to say that
one time just to tell C on what type of
data you're going to store in that
variable you don't need it again um it
already knows that we're storing ants so
get rid of it so right now these pretty
much print out the exact same thing so
what I wanted to demonstrate is what
happens when you have those plus signs
called the increment operator on the
right hand side instead of the left so
run this bad boy and check it out
even though we use that same increment
operator and even though we use the same
equation one time we got sixty and one
time we got fifty so what the heck is
going on why did that do that because we
know that this plus plus sign as we saw
before it just adds one it turned that
twenty into twenty-one so why we getting
different answers well the reason is
because whenever you use the plus sign
on the left it works a little bit
differently than on the right
whenever you use it on the left it
changes the value of a before it runs
this equation so you can kind of think
of this is that add 1/2 a here so it
adds one to a before it changes the
equation and then this becomes six right
now so that's why we got 60 now whenever
you have it after the a it pretty much
runs the equation with the current value
which is five and then it changes the
value after it so if we were to print
out a after this it would be six
so just remember um that's basically
what's going on when you have it on the
left hand side it said okay change the
value of a before you do anything else
when you have a after it it says okay do
the equation run this line of code and
then change a after so that is why we
give these little differences and you
know even though it's just a small
detail to take care of when you're
talking about 60 and 50 that can be you
know a difference between like 60 pounds
of gold and 50 pounds of gold is a big
mistake so if you're
programming then that's another thing
you want to keep an eye out for so
hopefully you guys understand I know
it's like two little symbols and I spent
a lot of time on it but I'm going to
show you guys why this is incredibly
useful in the future and well thank you
guys for watching and see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
