Blackford here with another Photoshop
cs6 tutorial and in this tutorial I'm
just going to go over saving a document
and how to do it properly and going over
a little bit of stuff about that that
way we're all on the same page and
nothing gets corrupted or anything like
that so it's may seem easy so this
tutorial might be pretty short so we'll
see and let's get on with it so I've
just got this um I've just got this set
of layers here which is a wooden
background picture and text on top of it
and I just want to save that so I'm
going to come up here to file and the
first thing I'm going to go to is save
as and when I navigate to where I want
to save my stuff and I should probably
make a new folder called Photoshop if I
can spell Photoshop documents or
something like that you want to make
sure that all your stuff is organized
and I'll just save this as get so now I
just type in my file name now you can
change the different types of format
that you have here now Photoshop gives
you tons of formats that you can use
we've got P Photoshop document which
will open up this entire document inside
of Photoshop so you can work on and get
work on it again and that is a PSD we've
got large document format which is a PSP
which is pretty much do the same thing
then we've done all these other kinds
and I encourage you to just take it do a
google search on different image formats
so you can become more familiar with
these different formats
now I'm T I'm just going to teach
Photoshop in these tutorials up so I'm
not going to really go over too much in
the go over too much about the different
image formats because honestly you might
not even use all of them
the main ones that you do probably use
though are the JPEG right here the PNG
and I use Targa's when I'm using video
and then there's TIFF here and tip is uh
pretty useful with Photoshop layers it
contains the layers within the actual
file format which is pretty nice so that
we've got all those I'm going to save
this as a Photoshop document so a PSD
and so I can work on it later
now we have a few other options down
here so I'll go over these now as a copy
if I check that it stays a copy of the
file while keeping the current file on
your desktop the Alpha channels saves or
removes outs of alpha channels from the
image layers maintains all your layers
so all this stuff over here on the right
and pretty much F its if it's unchecked
or you can't click click it then that
means either all your layers are
flattened or you just have one layer or
something like that so that's that if
you have notes created within your
Photoshop document you can click on the
notes to save the notes with them and
the spot colors it saves or removes the
spot channel information for the image
and I'll have to go over that later with
you guys I've noticed that when I'm
going over these different basic panels
that we need to use they have a lot of
advanced checkboxes or drop-down menus
and stuff like that so just bear with as
we go through and just keep keep the
pretty much the important information
like basically we're just going over how
to save so keep the important
information in the back your hat are in
the front and then
and then the back year brain keep like
not as important information yet in like
the back your head so just a little
advice there I guess on how to like use
these tutorials a little properly so
we've got our color profile down here
and I haven't gone over these yet I when
I was making my After Effects tutorials
I almost ended with these ones color
profiles they're pretty they're kind of
advanced so we'll be getting into those
later in the tutorials like way later
probably
so then down here we've got an option to
save a thumbnail which is checked and I
can't uncheck it so that's you can set
up a preference where you're able to
uncheck or check this and I'll have to
show you guys that later on and use
lower case extension just makes the file
extension lower case so dot PSD won't be
in capital letters it'll be in lowercase
letters I mean I'm not why that's such a
huge deal but maybe some people really
care about that who knows so then what
we have when you have all your stuff
checked just click Save and then
Photoshop will go ahead and save this
for you and we've got the maximize
compatibility that shows up here this
shows up when you save as a PSD or PSB
and this allows you to use this with
maximum compatibility in other programs
such as maybe you want to bring it in to
illustrate Adobe Illustrator or Adobe
After Effects or something like that
it's going to maximize the compatibility
with those programs so that's really
nice and you pretty much always want to
have that checked
you can check do don't show again that's
how often you want to have matte
- compatibility checked so just hit okay
and there you're properly saved - now so
that's how you properly save took a six
minutes to explain it but that's fine so
I will see you guys in the next tutorial
where looks like we can start getting a
little bit more we're going to start
we're going to keep going into the
different panels and stuff like that and
how do you swallow shop a little better
but soon enough we'll be getting into
actually working with photos and images
and design and everything just got to
know the basics first and how to use the
interface so thanks for watching see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
