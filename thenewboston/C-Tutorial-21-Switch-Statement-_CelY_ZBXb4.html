tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
to be teaching guys how to make a simple
switch statement now what a switch
statement is is pretty much just like a
if-else if-else statement but it's a lot
easier to organize them a lot easier to
work with and read so let's go ahead and
create a basic program that I can show
you guys how to use a switch statement
the first thing I want to do is declare
an integer variable typing in X the next
thing I want to do is ask the user a
question so I'm going to ask how many
legs do you have
and then line and after that I'm going
to have the user input some data on the
screen and whatever they input it's
going to be stored in the variable X you
should learn all this from last time so
I'm not going to go over it again next
let's get to the fun stuff the new stuff
the switch statement
the syntax for your switch statement is
switch and in the test condition you're
going to say what variable you want to
test we want to test the variable X now
after we tell C++ what variable we want
to test we've got to give it a bunch of
different options or cases the first
thing we need to do is make our first
case so the syntax for that is case now
you give it an option in the case that
they enter one enter a colon we want you
to execute this bit of code see out um
let's say if they enter one you are a
pirate because I can't think of any
other thing with one leg right now so
and then end that line and then after
you're done outputting your code on the
screen you want to add a something
called a break statement now what a
break statement is going to let you do
and you're going to see this later on if
you find what your case is in the very
first time then there's no reason to go
through the rest of the options
especially if you have like a hundred
different options
so what break statement says is alright
we found our answer we don't need to go
through the rest of the options because
they're obviously not true so just end
the code right now and go on to the rest
of your program so again what c++ is
doing right now is this it's going to
say all right we want to look for X and
the case that it's equal to one execute
this code and now in the case that is
equal to do two to excuse me we want you
to output on the screen um you are human
in line and this is a way where you can
give C++ a bunch of different options
and it's pretty much a lot easier than
use an if-else if-else let me move this
up so you can see and so what c++ again
just to reiterate it pretty much goes
through all these options until it finds
one that's that matches X and once it
does it executes the code right below it
so again if you're asking are it what if
it runs through all the options and it
still didn't find what I was looking for
that's when you need to do something
that's equivalent to else statement it's
kind of like your last resort it's
called a default and what a default is
is when none of these match this is the
code it runs so if it's default in you
didn't enter one or two you entered some
huge number it's going to say I don't
know what you are and then I want you to
end that line so let me show you guys
how this program works and again you
don't need a break at the end of your
default statement since it's already at
the end so it already knows that you're
going to be done executing the code so
let's go ahead compile and run this
program and hopefully I don't have any
errors and I don't how many legs do you
have um let's say one you are pirate
pressing the key to exit execute
compiling in
and let me show you guys what the
default statement looks like I want to
ask how many legs do you have I'm going
to enter 14 and that says I don't know
what you are press any key to exit so
again the basics of a switch statement
you're going to say what variable do you
want to evaluate in your test condition
and after your case you're going to give
all the options of that variable such as
the option 1 or 2 and then after your
options you're going to give it what
code you want to execute and don't
forget the break and again if it runs
through all of these options and it
still didn't find what it was looking
for it's going to go to the default
statement so if you are learn your
if-else if-else statement last time you
can see that this is a ton easier way to
store information and to sort through
data and choices so study this practice
making a simple switch statement I'm
going to be posting all this code on my
website the new Boston comm so if you
want the source code go there and just
snatch it from me so again thank you for
watching I hope you learned something
and I'll see you next next door</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
