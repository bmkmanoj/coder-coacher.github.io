docks Vito reprogram the heavy mech it's
tearing process Kwang apart they did
want to get to veto first get your squat
in to cover and all over the loading bay
doors will take cover by the doors
Sheppard you take point crowd
that max got heavy armor plating those
quarians never stood a chance this is
gonna be one tough son of a bitch to
take down
ah
this is valuable monsters coming back
mex will protect safe from swarms after
hurt no monsters no swans no no no no
Fedor no Vito not here swans can't find
monsters coming have to hide nobody's
gonna hurt you anymore I don't think you
can hear you commander tide have to hide
next
you're human what did you hide how come
they didn't find you who didn't find us
but the monsters the swarms they took
everyone why didn't they call it a fight
back need or what happened you don't
know you didn't see but I see everything
looks like security footage he must have
pasted it together manually what the
hell is that
my god I think it's a collector that's
some kind of alien there are species
from somewhere beyond the Omega for
relay only a few people have ever seen
one in person they usually work through
intermediaries like slavers or hired
mercenaries if they're involved with the
Reapers somehow it could explain what
happened to the colonies the collectors
have advanced technology they could have
a weapon that disables an entire
settlement at once a secret Schwartz no
one can hide the seekers find you freath
you then the monsters take you away
what happened next the monsters took the
people onto the ship and then they left
this ship flew away but they'll be back
for me no one escapes I think that's
probably all we're getting out of him
commander we appreciate what you told us
you were very helpful I studied them the
monsters the swarms I recorded them with
my omni-tool lots of readings
electromagnetic dark energy we need to
get this data to the elusive men grab
the Quarren and call the shuttle to come
pick us up what we thought is injured he
needs treatment not an interrogation we
won't hurt him we just need to see if he
knows anything else he'll be returned
unharmed your people tried to betray us
once already if we give him to you will
never get the Intel we need Peraza was
an idiot and he and his men paid for it
you're welcome to take vetoes omni-tool
data but please just let me take him
he's traumatized and he needs medical
care tally will give us the omni-tool
data and take him to the flotilla</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
