probably going to be real short because
I just want to show you guys how to make
a few improvements I actually don't even
know like what to call this video
probably but uh we're just going to be
tweaking the game to making things a
little bit better the first of all is as
you saw before keep an eye on the speed
of the bullet and speed of the monster
right here by default they're both going
the same speed and we all know that
monsters usually don't travel is at the
same rate is a bullet so let's go ahead
and I want to show you guys how to tweak
the speed of each so let's go ahead and
slow down the monster first so select
your monster object in in your behaviors
you see that bullet behavior that we get
it has a bunch of default values the
speed being 400 and what this actually
means is every second it moves 400
pixels so these aren't like miles per
hour they're pixels per second so a good
speed for this monster for right now is
80 so right now whenever we click that
the monster will now move at 80 pixels
per second and the bullet to me it
looked like it was going a little slow
so let's go ahead and change this from
400 to 600 and hit enter so how the
bullets go in 600 pixel a second the
monsters go in 80 more realistic now
another thing I want to do is I want to
change the fade speed of this explosion
so right now the fade out time is 1
which means one second
and that looked like it was going a
little slow especially since we're going
to be shooting a bunch of stuff and
they're going to be explosions happening
everywhere we don't want our explosion
take a real long time so I'm going to
change that from one it's a point five
hit enter so now our explosion happens a
little faster in half a second and
another quick thing I want to do is I'm
going to show you guys how to make
multiple monsters now there is a right
way to do this and there's a wrong way
the right way is to create instances or
excuse me I can't even say that
instances of this exact monster object
so if you hold ctrl on your keyboard and
click and
drag this you can just do it again make
about like six and doesn't matter if you
click keeping the same one or click the
original one alright so we have six
right there you can have like anywhere
from five to ten it really doesn't
matter but the reason that you want to
do this the click and drag method is
because like I said it creates an
instance of this first monster object so
what's the benefit of having an instance
of this what the heck is in instance
well it pretty much means that you're
making a copy of this however it's a
little bit different because whenever
you make a copy of this you're not just
copying the graphic you actually are
copying all the behaviors as well so
that means once you change this behavior
it's going to change all of these and
also it means that when you create them
you don't have to apply that remember we
had that bullet behavior which is their
movement we don't have to apply it to
every individual one because that would
take forever as you can see no matter
what one we click on they still have the
same common behaviors so again that's
why you want to click and drag that way
because it makes it a lot more efficient
and well then you don't you know waste
all your time doing the same stuff over
and over again because that's why we
even have the software in the first
place so now if we run it not a lot it's
going to change but our bullets going to
be gone a little faster as you can see
these monsters are now going a little
slower and I don't know if you notice
that explosion but it took half a second
like who would notice between half a
second a second but it did so anyways
now that we got pretty much all of our
objects perfect speed you know um
instances of each other we're good to go
in the next video I'm going to be
teaching guys about events which is one
of well it's definitely incredibly
important if you want a game that's any
fun at all to play
so thank you guys for watching and I'll
see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
