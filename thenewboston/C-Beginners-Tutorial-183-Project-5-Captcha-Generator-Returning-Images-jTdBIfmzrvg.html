c-sharp tutorial that I'm making for the
new Boston and in this tutorial we're
going to continue working on our caption
generator and in this tutorial basically
what we're going to be doing is having
this method actually return images
because right now it just returns null
and it just draws the CAPTCHA into
Faneuil 1 and what we actually want to
do is make it so this will return a
bunch of images or a bunch of CAPTCHAs
and then we can just meet through all
those images that it returns and then
save them to a folder but right now
we're just going to have this actually
return images well before we can do that
you can't just actually create the
graphics from panel 1 because there's no
way to convert graphics into an image
since graphics are just used to draw
they're not actually representing an
image or anything like that so what
we're gonna have to do right here is
create a new image or a bitmap and then
draw the graphics into that image so let
me say bitmap a bitmap equals a new
bitmap and we want this image to be the
exact same size as our panel so we're
going to create it from the side of the
panel so we're gonna say the width of
this bitmap is the same as the panel to
it we're going to say panel 1 width and
then we're gonna say the height of this
bitmap or this image the same fight at
our panel sort of look like Anil ones
height right there alright so now that
we have our bitmap created Rexach is
going to draw all of our CAPTCHAs into
this image right here so we're just
gonna say graphics G equals graphics dot
from image and we want it to be from our
bitmap image that we just created so now
whenever we draw a CAPTCHA it will be
drawn into this bitmap image alright so
now that we have a way to store image
let's split and to display it we can
just set panel ones background image to
that bitmap image that we draw into let
me save ten'll ones background image
equals bitmap for that bitmap do if
you're on two so one we debug it should
be the same as before you have to just
create the CAPTCHA
and yep they're all different all right
perfect so now that we know that we have
a way to store our images let's actually
store them into an array and then return
that array so we basically just wanted
to loop through all this code the same
amount of times that the user wants us
to create images since this code will
just create an image so we're going to
say right here for int Z equals zero now
we're gonna say while he less than the
amount and then we're just an increment
Z so it'll actually three only the
amount of images that we want it to all
right so now it just loops through this
code the same amount of times that the
user wants to create images so if user
has this create by minute five images
it'll just loot these code five times
but right now it just returns the doll
at the bottom what we actually wanted to
do is create an image and then store it
into an array so we're going to go up
here and create a new image array just
going to call it images and set it equal
to a new image array and how do we know
what size is going to be well we know
how many images that we're going to
create and we only need to store those
images inside of our image array so we
can just make our imagery the same
length as the amount of images that the
user wants to create so let me just put
amount inside of here and we now have an
image right that is the same length as
the amount of images that the user wants
to create all right and then each each
time it loops through here we're just
going to store the image or the CAPTCHA
that it generates inside of this imagery
right here so we're just gonna say
images 0
all we store a few different spot equals
that bitmap that we generate or that
CAPTCHA that we generate all right so
now we actually need to just return this
image right here at the bottom or to see
right here returned images so now we
will do store or create five images and
we can say right here for each
image I in that generated CAPTCHAs
method works and I'm a message box show
so that we know that it created a lot of
images were at least five so should get
a message box that shows hello five
times all right so it's just the bug
here and make sure that it works start
we get one two three four five perfect
alright so that's it for this tutorial
so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
