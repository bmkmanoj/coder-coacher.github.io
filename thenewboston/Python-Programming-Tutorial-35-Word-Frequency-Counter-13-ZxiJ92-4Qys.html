in this video what I want to do is I
want to show you guys how to make a word
counter and what this is basically going
to do is it's going to go through a web
page and you can actually use it even if
you have like a text file or I don't
know any document but I'm just going to
show you guys how to crawl a web page
get all the words on there and what it's
going to do is it's going to show you
guys how frequently each word is used
now search engines actually do this a
lot in arm maybe you have an ad network
that you're building and you want to
display ads that are relevant to the
content on the web pages so not only is
this really interesting but it's useful
in a lot of situations as well so what
we're going to be doing is we're going
to import requests and of course we need
this for whenever we connect to URL and
get information from it pretty much to
download information from a web page
we're going to request that information
not just the mandate you know got to be
nice about it and the next thing we're
going to do is import beautifulsoup
remember whenever you want to scrape or
um pick out certain pieces of the web
page and I'll show you guys what I'm
talking about right here so the reason
that we just don't want to crawl every
single word on this web page is because
some of the words like likes comments
likes comments they appear all the time
but they aren't really relevant on this
web page the only relevant words that
I'm looking for is pretty much these
links right here so we can ignore all
the words like posted September all the
crap we don't need and beautiful soups
going to allow us to do that and the
last thing we need is import operator
and that's arm whenever we make the
final word count we're going to have a
dictionary we're going to have the words
like I don't know programmer status and
those are going to be the keys and the
values are going to be how many times
they occurred so it's going to say
something like arm like programming 18
times by two times something like that
so now let's go ahead and get started so
the first thing we need to do
is obviously make a function and I'm
going to be breaking up this program
into three functions the first function
is just going to create a list of every
single word on here so that's what I'm
doing first and I'll explain you guys
the other functions when we get to them
but oh my oh my I put in PI but since
this is our starting point what I want
to do is just name it start why the heck
not and pass it in a URL so actually
what I can do
actually I'll call that later don't want
to really worry about it now all right
so the first thing we need to do is we
need to create a blank list so word list
and then just set this equal to blank
list and eventually what we're going to
be doing is arm getting all the source
code from the website and picking out
word by word and throwing it in that
list so to connect the web page of
course requests get and get pretty much
means all right what do you want to get
information from well whatever URL we
pass in which is essentially going to be
this URL and again like I said you can
pretty much do this for any web page but
I just don't want to like go to
Craigslist or something or else I'm
going to get the email bag of Bucky you
can't do that to our web page and then
I'm going to sue me so I'll just do it
to my own for now if you guys want to
crawl my web page that's fine I give you
permission just don't like abuse it or
anything all right so what this is going
to do is it's going to connect to that
URL or that web page and this means
pretty much just use it as plain text
don't like I'll pull it as any weird
encrypted binary data or anything like
that so now that we have pretty much all
the source code from the web page what
we're looking at is pretty much this all
of that crap now of course whenever we
use beautifulsoup
we need to convert that to a soup object
so take that source code that you just
grabbed and throw in here and now your
soup
object is something that you can
actually work with so what I want to do
is I would want to do this and come on
capslock so right now we're looking at
all this crap and of course we don't
just want to crawl all this or else
we're going to get weird keywords like
div class you know IMG we don't care
about that what we care about is only
the text and these links right here so
let's go ahead and inspect this and see
what property is unique to these links
and if I scroll up you guys are going to
see so of course whenever I highlight
this this is the link that we're looking
for so it says okay this href changes so
we can't really use that the class
however if we edit this all of these
links or all the important content has a
class of index single listing titles so
let's go ahead and grab that I just cut
it or you can copy it whatever and what
I want to do is write this for post text
this is just a variable that because
it's a text from each post and soup find
all now find all remember you says okay
we're going to go through all that
source code what are you looking for
well first of all it was a link so it
was a and the next thing it needs is it
pretty much says okay now I'm going to
look at all the links now what property
do you want me to look for well only
grab the links with the class of index
single listing titles so now essentially
what we have is all of these links right
here however we have one problem what we
have is actually the entire like all of
it so we have href we have this part we
have this part and we have the content
that we need now if we only want to pull
out this good content you know kind of
like stealing the cream
from the milk we need to do this so the
content which is basically what we're
looking for is equal to post text string
so that's going to do is it's going to
go through your entire source code pull
out all of the important links and treat
them as post text now post text string
pretty much means only get the text
that's inside here don't even worry
about this HTML crap so this is pretty
much how you remove HTML from some of
them probably could have just said that
but who cares so now we have all the
good stuff
however we have one more problem and I
know this is kind of a lot of
information but it's important so right
now we have a bunch of sentences and we
don't want the entire sentences for each
one we just want the words so we we
don't want arm all of this in a variable
we want to break it up into Ben and then
stuck here all day and those are
individual words because that's that's
what this program does so in order to do
that we need one more variable and I'll
just name it words it's set to equal to
content dot lower split actually this
one is lower to now the reason so well
I'll explain what this does so content
is basically the entire sentence so what
we want to do first is the lower case
everything in that sentence and that's
just because some people start a
sentence with like I and some people
aren't using proper grammar or I don't
know what's something in here like maybe
they're talking about this guy Richard
Feynman I've no idea who that is
but not everyone capitalizes things in
the exact same way so we want to do just
to make sure everything is consistent
and we don't get any duplicate results
it's just lower case everything and
split basically splits up your string
based on spaces so it basically takes a
sentence and splits it up into words so
that's why I have each
word now in this variable so now we can
look through it for each word in words
what do I want to do well now that we
have the individual words we can just
add it to our main word list so word
list and of course whenever you want to
add something use append and of course
what are we appending or what are we
adding to the list we're adding each
word so now actually I'll print this out
real quick print each word all right
so now if I run this check it out and
nothing happens because I actually need
to call this at some point in time so
that's the function that I want to call
and I want to call for this URL all
right so now give me some space and run
this check it out what we did is we
connect it to that website and we got
the source code we broke it up in the
sentences or the good stuff and then we
broke those sentences up into words and
we now have a list of all of the words
on the website however if we look
closely at this we have a couple
problems first of all we have symbols
that we don't need like this okay has
three dots after it this thing this
isn't even word that's just a smiley
face but I mean I followed our
instructions that's what we told it to
do and there's some other stuff here
that's weird like debatable has a some
symbols after it so we need to clean
that up so what we're going to be doing
is we're going to be cleaning up all
this stuff in the next tutorial and I'm
going to show you guys how to make a
proper nicely perfectly working word
counter so that's what we have to look
forward to I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
