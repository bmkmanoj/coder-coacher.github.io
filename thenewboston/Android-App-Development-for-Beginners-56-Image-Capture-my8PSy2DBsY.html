video and in this tutorial what I want
to do is I want to show you guys how to
access the camera and we're just going
to be building a simple app for this
demonstration and it's going to have a
button right down here and whenever you
click it it's going to launch your
camera and then whenever you take a
picture of something it's going to
display right there so pretty sweet and
before I begin I want to mention that I
did start a brand new project and also
make sure that you're using API 18 or
higher because there's one little
package that we're going to use to make
sure that your device has a camera and
it will still work if you're using like
um one of the older api's but it will
give you this weird warning message so
in order just to avoid it let's go ahead
and switch the api 18 or anything higher
you can even use a lollipop and it'll be
fine so in your main or excuse me your
activity main not main activity it's
kind of confusing main activity activity
main tomato tomato whatever whatever all
right so let's go ahead and get rid of
this textview first now the first thing
that we need is that button so go ahead
and grab this button and drag it
somewhere not in the middle somewhere on
the bottom like that
now let me myself a little more ruin to
work so the first thing we needed to do
is we need to give this an ID and how
about Bucky's button and why is my
computer making weird noises huh sounds
like my cooling thing hopefully I can ah
if you guys can hear that I apologize
it's really annoying alright so anyways
get kind of sidetracked here and we'll
just change the text on this to take
photo so the user actually knows what's
going to happen whenever they click it
now of course just so this can actually
do something well add a method on click
and we'll say launch camera so that's
essentially what this is going to do
whenever you click it it's going to
launch the camera app and allow the user
to take a picture now after they take
the picture we want to display it right
up top here so what we need in order to
display is an image
view so if you go down under widgets and
add image view you can drag it anywhere
right around here it's good for now one
second my computer's being really loud
alright so apparently it's my cooling
systems making stupid noises it does
that like every like once a week it just
starts making a really dumb noises so
yeah hopefully I can edit out that sound
but I have to deal with it right now
alright so you see how this image view
is 0 0 it pretty much has no size right
now that's because there isn't an image
in it in our layout is set the wrap
content so it's pretty much going to
wrap around whenever we stick an image
in there it's pretty much going to fit
whatever the content is aka the image
but for right now just so we have
something to I don't know look at let's
go down and add minimum height and we'll
say like 300 DP and then we'll give it a
minimum width of 300 DP - all right so
now what I want to do is move that up a
little bit so if I go way up
I can go layout margin and change the
margin top to like 50 DP see if that
works
alright looks good enough so the other
thing that we need to do the one last
thing is this we need to give this an ID
so if we go to ID image view will work
but out a rather name it Bucky's image
view alright so now we got an area that
can display image now we have a button
that whenever we click it it calls
launch camera so before we hop over and
start coding this let's go ahead and in
the manifest we need to set up one
permission and that's of course the
permission to add the camera so if you
go uses feature
and your name in the name of this is
Android hardware dot camera not scammer
- just camera and another thing is
Android required set this equal to true
so now we pretty much are saying okay we
want to use the camera on the user's
device whenever they install this app so
that's all we have to do in the manifest
so close out of this and hop into your
mainactivity.java and we can start
coding this thing and I am back I just
had to put my computer to sleep and then
wake it up real quick because for some
stupid reason whenever it starts making
noise if you put it to sleep and then
wake it up it stops so I probably need a
new computer but whatever alright so all
my imports that I'm going to use are
right here so pause the video take a
second to copy those and after you do
that we can actually get rid of these
less to menu methods won't be needing
those now the first thing I want to do
is just set up some variables and the
first one is static final int request
I spell everything correctly hopefully
and set this one so what this constant
is is it's basically a way to identify
your intent and if you have a bunch of
different intents then you can set an
identifier along with each one but the
only intent that we have is we intend to
open up the camera and eventually take a
picture so again this isn't really
important you can just pass in one if
you want but it's proper just to set it
to a constant so the next thing is I
need a reference to image view right
here since we're going to be using it
and a few methods and I'll just name it
Bucky's image view because that was the
name in activity main so now on create
as soon as we create this what do we
want to do what the first thing we need
is a reference to that button now we're
only going to be using it in this method
so I'm just going to create the entire
thing right here now of course you
already know how to do all this
find view by Rd r dot ID dot Bucky's
button and we also need to do the same
thing for that image view so set this
equal to image view which is of course
that area we where we could display the
image find view by ID our de ID dot
Bucky's image view all right so that was
the easy stuff now the first thing we
need to do is before we can take a
picture we want to check if the user
actually has a camera because if we're
trying to call a bunch of intents
dealing with the camera in their device
maybe it's a really old one or just
maybe um you know not a high-end one and
they don't have a camera it's going to
cause some problems so I'm gonna say
disable the button if the user has no
camera or something not the sewer user
so again we're going to check for a
camera and if they don't have one then
we're just going to disable this button
so they can't click it and watch the
camera obviously</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
