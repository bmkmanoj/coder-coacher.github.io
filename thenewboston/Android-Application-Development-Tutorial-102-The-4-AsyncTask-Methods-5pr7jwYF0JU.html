second Android tutorial for the new boss
in we're going to learn more about the
async task and what methods that can use
and when they get called for the most
part so first before we get too confused
let's kind of move these brackets down
you guys want to have two brackets here
and then we're going to set up some more
methods again within this load some
stuff class now let's just kind of go
and order how it's going to read it and
which methods are going to get called
when we use that execute again here's
where most of meat is for for this class
where we load the data and return
something but we also want to be able to
receive it whatever it's returning and
kind of maybe want to set up some
variables so the first thing that we're
going to do is we're going to say
protected data protected void on pre
execute and again we can refer to
whatever is being passed in like a
string F something like that and within
this method we can this is going to get
called first for the most part so we can
set up some variables if we want the
most part we don't need to for this
class but just to show you guys maybe
leave a comment example setting up
variables some for setting up something
and we get that F or that string and we
can just set that equal to whatever and
there we go
this won't really do anything for the
most part so it doesn't really matter
and another method we can call is to get
that progress again we have an integer
that we can refer to and so if we have a
progress method that kind of displays
some kind of a loading bar or something
like that we want to access the progress
method so what we're going to say here
is we're gonna say we're in say again
protected
void
you
on progress update and it's going to
take an integer
and we're going to call this integer
array I'm sorry and we've worked with
arrays before you know it's like that we
call them in or pass them in you just
want to say dot dot dot that's basically
the same thing as an array for the most
part we're going to set this integer
array equal to like progress or
something like that is the name and then
again we can I don't know if I'm going
to go through a progress bar or not I
might if I do it'll probably in the next
tutorial but then after that we're going
to say also one last statement that gets
called after everything is completed
after we call a return method whether it
be our string that actually loaded or
this null one the last method is going
to be called protected or it's going to
be protected void on post X cubed and
we're just going to say string as well
because again we're returning a string
here so we're going to say string result
which we're going to rename again
basically what we're either going to get
a return null or if everything worked
right we're going to return that string
that we loaded called collected and once
it once we call this return it's going
to you know execute this method called
onpostexecute and we're going to get
whatever that return was so since we're
returning a string we're going to work
with that we're going to call it result
and now we can set up our our textview
within here our textview was called data
results or data result was it and we can
just say dot results maybe dot set text
and then we can set it equal to our
result which again will be whatever we
return so let me format everything and
those are the four methods that you can
use with this async task class again pre
execute doing background
which we are familiar with and progress
update and also a post execute where we
actually change our our text view so
let's run it make sure everything works
guys and we're probably good to go with
with this tutorial again I'm not for
sure if I want to do progress update
maybe I will you know something a little
bit new that you guys might like so I'll
probably do that in the next tutorial
let's make sure everything works so
we're going to say internal data and
just like a test text something like
that we're going to save it and if we
hit the load button yeah there we go we
have our test text there so thanks for
watching guys and I'll catch you in the
next tutorial have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
