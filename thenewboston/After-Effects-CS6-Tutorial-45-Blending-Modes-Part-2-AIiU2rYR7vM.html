color burns darken the image by using
the color information from the layer on
top - I think increases the contrast of
the layer underneath so I mean the the
white layer the white part doesn't have
any effect while the black part has like
a full blackout effect there and classic
color burn is about the same thing you
you use these when I mean you want to
get a dark more darker image then I've
done if you want multiply then if you
multiply so you would use the color
burns the next one up is called linear
burn and that one usually looks pretty
cool the linear burn darkens the image
by using the color information of the
layer on top to decrease the brightness
of the layer on the bottom so that's how
that one works and you can see how it
works it's full black down here and not
all the way gone with a full one full
white up here the next one is a darker
color and I'm not really too sure how
this one works so I don't often use it
but that's how this is what you can see
how it looks it looks like when there's
a dark image over I mean when there's
like a light image over a dark image it
like completely blasts out the white and
when there's dark on the image or video
below it blasts out what's ever on top
as you can see there
so let's head over to the lighter ones
the first one we'll start with is ad so
with ad the both the images color values
are added together and it clips off at
the full white there so when you have a
dark image put it on top it looks pretty
cool in it the whole thing lightens the
image a lot of times when you're adding
explosions in in visual effects like in
a movie you'll you like to use these
this ad mode because it helps blend it
in better with the background so we'll
go to the next one which is lighten and
this does just the opposite of what
darken does now we can go to screen here
which I like to use a lot screen is the
opposite of multiply and the color
values of the selected layer are skilled
above their original values based on the
color values of the layer underneath so
the layer on top there which is the
squish know that I like to use this one
when I just want to put something like
maybe like scratches or something like
that overtop a plain background I'll use
screen or multiply depending on what the
scratches are colored by and you can get
a cool-looking scratched up background
the next one here is these color dodges
here and a Dodge basically takes the the
color information from each Channel so
the red green or blue and it applies it
to the to the bottom image to increase
the brightness and that's the same for
all these dodges I mean color dodge and
classic color dodge kind of look the
same and then the linear dodge is kind
of like ad the ad mode so if you look at
that they're pretty much the same the
last one is lighter color and you can
see that that was kind of like the
darker color one I'm not too sure how it
works but it it pretty much like cuts
anything that's uh cuts a bunch of
things out I'm not too sure how it works
but if it looks cool when you use it on
your on your on your project I mean you
should use it so keep always experiment
with the blending modes if you find
something cool then use it the next set
here these are lighting blending modes
so the first one is overlay and I use
that one a decent amount the the
lighting ones increase or maybe
intensify the the contrast and the
saturation and a/c and if you apply it
to something that's like fifty percent
gray it's not really gonna do anything
like as you can see here where it starts
getting into a little gray but or down
here and I mean once once you get away
from gray which is total white or total
black I mean in between those values
that crease some interesting effects</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
