photoshop project and before I even
start tell you what we're doing today or
what we're going to be learning make
sure you're watching this video and high
def I'll put a link in it in the
description on the right hand side of my
screen now once you're watching this
video on high def you can move on what
we're going to be doing today for our
project is turning this image right here
and we're going to be making it kind of
bronze and bronzing it and giving it a
nice rustic look it may not sound real
cool right now but trust me it is so
once you have an image and you can get
an image of everything I just like a
picture of an old man just because go
over to your background or the main
image and go ahead and duplicate that
you can do this by holding on to it and
dragging it down here and let him go now
you can see you have a background and a
background copy make sure your
background copy is selected and go up to
filter go to other and go to high pass
and you want to change its radius to
about 5 pixels and click OK now you see
you have an all-gray image over the
thing over the thing so what you're
going to want to do is again make sure
your background copy select it and click
down here to your drop-down list and go
to overlay now you can see this mode is
now and overlay what we're going to want
to do from here is go right back to our
main background and we're going to want
to duplicate this again now we have a
background a background copy in the
background copy to move this very new
one the most recent one you created all
the way to the top once you're there go
to image and make sure you're on
background copy to go to image
adjustments desaturate
now once you're on this you can see that
your image has now turned the black and
white once you got this make sure the
same layer background copy to and change
it to hard light what this is going to
bring do is bring out a lot of the
features in the image now once you have
all three layers just how you want them
you can go ahead and click this little
button right here this down arrow and
this is going to give you a list of
options what we're going to want to do
is flatten image and what this does is
bring all the layers into one it's just
a lot easier to work with now once we
have one layer called the background go
ahead and duplicate this once again now
I have a background and a background
copy I know right back to the beginning
so that's where we're going to go go
ahead and do the very first thing we did
one last time and if you forgot its
filter other High Pass click OK and
click overlay and again if this seems
unnecessary then trust me you don't have
to do it but trust me you really wanted
this is what gives it the most defining
most rustic just awesome look now our
very last step go down to here and click
this is a where you can adjust a certain
aspects of your image and we're going to
want to go to curves well actually
before that it's a better idea to
flatten your image once again so make
sure you have one layer and now once you
do go to curves by remember clicking on
this looks like a half moon cookie
actually then clicking in curves and let
me have this simultaneously so you guys
can see you want to drag this line right
about there actually
right about there it looks good as you
can see it kind of lightens up your
image and brings out the highlights of
it let's go ahead and click OK and now
you have your final bronze looking image
so what you can see from here here's our
old image let me just zoom out in this
one let me zoom out on both of them so
you guys can see the difference here is
our old one kind of a plain looking flat
doll image and here's our new bronze
looking professional looking image with
all the features standing out even more
again one last time plain boring image
new awesome professional image so thank

learned something and remember to
