welcome to your 28th Python tutorial and
in this tutorial I'm gonna be teaching
you guys about default parameters in
your functions so a default parameter is
pretty much just that it has a parameter
but instead of you having enter it
already has a default value just in case
the user forgets to enter it or
something like that so the first thing
we're going to need to do is create a
function and I'm going to name my name
in a hopefully name is in the keyword so
let's have two parameters in our name a
first Parden name and last and let's go
ahead and put a colon after that and now
we have to print out our instructions
for the function so in this function I
just want to print out two strings and
strings are of course going to be both
values they take the first name and the
last name so right now we have a
function that prints out the first and
last name it's called a name so let's
see if this works
name will supply it with two parameters
Bucky drivers don't forget your
apostrophes or whatever it called and
there you go so this is um pretty much
basic function it takes two parameters
first which is Bucky last which is
Roberts and prints them out right after
each other first than last but what if
we want to add a function to already had
default values and say we want to
populate a database or something and if
you entered a blank value it would ruin
it so we want to make sure something was
in there all the time what we would need
to do is add something called default
parameters and what this does is
automatically supply a value even if you
don't supply value in your function now
show you guys sounds complicated but I
promise you'll understand by the end
let's go ahead and remake this function
called name but instead of first we want
to put a value for first right now so
let's go ahead put first equals Tom
already and last equals Smith
now let's go ahead and create the same
exact function print a percent us
percent is modulus what values is going
to take again the first and the last one
not last D now whenever we call it our
name function by default as you can see
you get Tom Smith voted percent alright
that deletes the purpose or defeats the
purpose I mean how can we enter our name
now well you can also use it to override
say you wanted to enter your name like
you did before Bucky and Roberts you now
have Bucky Roberts so this is just a
safety which if you don't enter anything
you get a value but you really want the
user to enter a value and then it spits
out your desired result and you can also
mix and match say name with parentheses
and put only one in here Bucky and you
get Bucky Smith and you could also do
this name and you can put last last is
equal to Roberts and you can get Tom
Roberts
so again if the user only enter is one
or the other or both of the values you
your desired result but just in case
they don't you always have a default
value right there so that is how you add
defaults in parameters and like I said
it's most useful when you're writing a
program or filling a database where if
you have a null or empty value it's
going to throw everything off so that is
one case where you'd use that so that's
your quick tutorial on default
parameters and how to use default values
and also had to change one value or the
other so uh thank you guys for watching
make sure to subscribe to my channel and
I'll see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
