your seventh Python tutorial in the last
tutorial I talked to you guys about
strings now that you guys have a basic
understanding of strings I can talk a
little bit deeper on how strings are
more useful and this is actually more
helpful tutorial now in the last couple
tutorials I showed you guys if you
printed out a string just like this then
it gave you a return value in single
quotes but if you printed it out like
this use the print statement and then
put something like that it wouldn't give
you single quotes around it and this is
because when it outputs it what plate on
does is convert your code to strings but
it does it in two different ways
now just take note of that for now and
I'm going to show you guys how to
convert two strings and actually why
it's useful in some applications or
probably the most useful function of why
this is even important at all is because
a lot of the times you're going to want
to treat a number as a string so say you
have a variable called num and it's
equal to 18 so go ahead and set that
variable equal to 18 and now you can do
math with it like num plus 16 equals 34
but if you want to use it in string like
print and then put Bucky is whatever we
can just leave that typos there fun
Bucky is and then we tried to add the
number 18 to string look what we get so
we can't concatenate a string and add it
with a number even though we want to
output the sentence Bucky is 18 so
instead of doing that we need to find a
way to change that number into a string
because now what Python is doing is
saying all right we have some letters
and we want to add a number to it how
the FT add a number to letters that's
not math that's not English that's not
nothing so now we have to find a way to
convert the 18 into a string
so what we would do is put numb and then
we set this equal to not 18 but STR and
inside that put 18 and what this does is
say alright whatever we put for the
number variable take the string 18 not
the number 18 now press Enter now
instead of the value 18 as a number it
sees it as a string or just characters
that can output on a screen now if we
try print and lucky is I'll spell it
right this time and then write num like
that we get Bucky is 18 so that's how
you can convert a number to a string so
you can use it to like outputs off to
user and it doesn't give you a bunch of
error messages um another thing that you
can do is say you have something like um
let's make another variable num to my
cursor out of the way num 2 equals
actually it's get like 32 or something
another thing that we can do that's real
quick in that doesn't really use a
function that if the type out is use
something called back ticks
now back ticks are against our long hold
on let me gather my thoughts that are
above that little tab key and beside the
one on your keyboard it's below the
little squiggly line it's below this
thing and let me show you guys how you
guys can convert values or anything to
string using back tips Becht it's back
ticks all right here we go let's say we
got 32 stored in num2 so anytime we try
to concatenate that to string it's going
to give us an error message so let's go
ahead and print my mom is add
number two now this would give you an
error message right here so since this
is a number and this is a string so how
can we convert this to a string without
using the string function all you'd have
to do is but back ticks around it just
like that now once you press ENTER BAM
so again back ticks and the string
function are two different ways where
you can convert anything to a string and
again this is useful because if you
don't it's going to try to treat this as
a number and this is a bunch of letters
and it's going to try to treat this as a
math operator and you can't add numbers
to letters just doesn't make sense and
one last one I want to talk to you guys
about this our EPR function this um it's
a little different than the string
function but for now I'm going to just
tell you guys that it does the same
thing that anytime you use the string
you can use this one right here and it
does the same thing so again string our
EPR and back ticks are three different
ways where you can convert crap to
strings using Python so that's your
quick tutorial this is going to help you
understand the next section so pay
attention this play round of it a little
bit and I'll see you guys next time make
