going over special products formed by
multiplying two special kinds of
binomials so I have an example right
here and we're going to foil this out
and then we're going to draw some
conclusions about it so you're going to
first outside inside last two times
2x times 2x 4x squared so I was first
now we're going to go outside 2x times
negative 5 negative 10x inside 5 times
2x positive 10x and 5 times negative 5
negative 25 so if we combine these like
terms they're going to go away because a
negative 10 plus positive 10 is get
going to give us 0 so 4x squared minus
25 so that's what this note down here is
whenever you have two binomials
multiplied that come in the form a plus
B times a minus B these middle two terms
are going to cancel out and all you're
going to be left with is a squared minus
B squared because you're going to get
from doing the outsides you're going to
get negative a be doing the insides
you're going to get positive a B and
those are always going to cancel to 0
but remember you can only use this
shortcut when you have a plus B times a
minus B if these two terms have the same
sign the middle terms aren't going to
cancel out so
now that we know that let's do some
examples so since I have X plus 3 times
X minus 3 I know that the middle terms
are going to cancel out so I can just
square the first term and square the
second term 3 times 3 is 9
same thing with this one I have 3x minus
7 y 3x + 7 y it doesn't matter that I
have two different variables because no
matter what these two middle terms are
still going to cancel so at one I Square
3x squared + 7 y squared remember you
have to square the 3 and this X so this
becomes 9x squared - 49 y squared you
can't just square the Y hat square both
terms so that's all um our lesson today
is going to deal with make sure you come
back and we're going to talk about
squaring binomials and then after that
we're going to go into solving equations
using these polynomials to make sure you
come back and check that out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
