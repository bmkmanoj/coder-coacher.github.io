another tutorial and in this tutorial
inheritance and constructor is the topic
of choice so we learn about inheritance
and basically all it does is it takes
all the crap that's inside one class and
it pops it into another class for you so
one thing I know you guys are wondering
is what about constructors because
constructors aren't like any other
function they're a special function
pretty much specific to that class so I
know where you guys are honoring in that
child class the class that inherits
everything does inherit the constructor
from the parent class as well but what
if the parent class and the child had
class both have constructors does that
mean one class has two constructors room
and you guys are going crazy well in
this tutorial I'm gonna explain it all
so let's go ahead and make two classes
right now and oh you got to click with
the mouse to first start typing all
right there you go class catfish and
don't ask me where I founded that from
actually I'm really in the mood go
catfishing right now so just deal with
it anyways go ahead and make a class and
call it catfish and go ahead and make a
constructor and go ahead and remember
underscore underscore there are two
underscores you need construct and go
ahead and just echo out something stupid
and like echo
I am the cash catfish that's the dumbest
thing I could think of right now and
let's go ahead and make another class
that inherits from catfish owed class of
course then would be ham extends
inherits everything from catfish so
looks pretty good to me so now let's go
ahead and make an object from this class
ham ham now let's name a ham oh for ham
object equals new ham class no
parameters so here's what's happening
right now that's how you guys rule
whenever you have a constructor in the
parent class and you have another child
class that inherits everything from it
if this class does not have construction
through itself then it's going to go
ahead and inherit the constructor from
its parent class so this class has
nothing in it no function is no
variables no constructor so since it's
blank and it does it have constructor
it's gonna go ahead and Herot its
parents constructor what it's catfished
so now now that we made the object
remember as soon as you create an object
that constructor is going to be called
this I am cache catfish is going to echo
on the screen so let's go ahead file su
refresh it's going slow because I'm
still uploading that video oh sorry guys
and refresh this and check it out I am
the cache catfish exciting stuff right
there so now let's go ahead back to uh
what's this thing called text Wrangler
who invented that name and let's go
ahead and make a constructor of our own
in this so let's go ahead and copy that
and paste the constructor right in there
and have a say something different so
have a say HAMB HAMB HAMB because you
know what else would you put in there so
now check this out whenever I said the
child class does not have constructor
then it's going to go ahead by default
and use its parents constructor now
whenever it does have a constructor of
its own it's saying you know what parent
I don't need your constructor even
though I inherited everything from you I
have my own constructor so whenever we
create an object I'm gonna use mine and
not yours biatch so let's go ahead and
save that obviously we have a very route
ham class right here that's why it's at
the edge so let's go ahead and refresh
this you guys can't see what I'm doing
but trust me I'm refreshing it and let's
go ahead and load this there we go
finally and refresh this and see what we
get ham ham ham
is very confused so anyways here's what
happened clearly as you saw just to
recap one last time whenever you have a
child class and it's blank it's going to
inherit the constructor from its parent
just like this whenever you do have a
constructor in your child class it's
pretty much going to overwrite this
parent constructor and use its own
constructor so anyways if you ever get
weird constructors or a constructor
that's unexpected that's what's going on
behind the scenes and yeah that's pretty
much all I have to teach you for this
story in the next tutorial I don't even
know what I'm gonna cover because you
know I'm just gonna wing it so anyways
thank you guys for watching and don't
forget subscribe and I guess I'll see
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
