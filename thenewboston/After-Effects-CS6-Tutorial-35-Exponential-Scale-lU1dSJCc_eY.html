all made it through the animation
tutorials because this is going to be
the last one for a while then we can
move on to layers so sometimes when
you're animating say like the scale and
let me just make a simple animation real
quick do it from zero I'm just going to
up the scale to 200 sometimes when
you're animating these it doesn't look
quite right when you increase
percentages like this you can see it
goes really fast in the beginning and
then at the end he scales way slower
that's because you're working with
percentages and that's how like pretty
much math works so I'm going to turn
this off you want it if you want it to
be exponentially growing with the speed
so you want this guy to start out slower
and then exponentially and gradually get
faster then I'll show you how to do that
right now you want to select both your
keyframes right click and go to keyframe
assistant exponential scale now you can
see all the keyframes that it creates
which is kind of annoying but if you
don't need to animate it anymore then
it's okay so let's click on the graph
editor and see what it looks like this
is how the graph editor works for the
position R for the scale now
and that's a pretty nice nicely curved
graph starts out slow as hell in the
beginning and then goes fast so to watch
this
now as you're watching it you might see
a problem the animation is basically
nothing right now right in that rate in
the beginning has nothing for a while
and then it comes out flying so to fix
that there is a workaround that I always
that I kind of like figure it out so I
ctrl Z to get a rid of your keyframes
there so that you only had the two
starting ones go to your first keyframe
and change that to percent now we can
time reverse our now we can at
exponential scale these keyframes I
guess I didn't click on it let's click
on this one and exponential scale and
we'll go to the graph header and check
it out you can see it's different it's
more instead of having almost nothing
and then right here going up it's
exponentially scaling differently so
let's take a look at the RAM preview
that's pretty
let me go to the graph editor I guess
this is a small glitch in After Effects
that happens every once in a while
the way to fix this glitch the only one
that I know right now is to get to like
close and then reopen the project so I'm
going to save it close I'm just going to
close out of After Effects and then I'll
open my old project
so my After Effects is on just a regular
hard drive so it takes forever to open
so let's RAM preview this again
and now you can see how the the scaling
is different and it doesn't wait like 20
minutes in the beginning for it to even
up here hopefully I didn't have anything
too embarrassing on my desktop there
when I had to change out I don't think
there is I don't want to check anymore
but anyways in a later tutorial I'll
show you how to basically edit these the
speed of that without having to go
through all these keyframes you pretty
much take this comp and put it into
another comp and timer remap the other
comp
so I'll teach that in a later tutorial
down the road and this will be the last
time you'll hear from me about animation
for a little bit we'll go on to layers
and hopefully it's just as exciting so
let's all give a cheers for finishing
the animation section for a while and
let's go and have a party no but really
beer pong at my house tonight
see you there I'll invite Bucky so you
guys can meet him see ya around and I
look forward to seeing you guys and the
next tutorials</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
