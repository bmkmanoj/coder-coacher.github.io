Illustrator cs6 tutorial today we're
going to learn how to group objects and
then we're going to learn how to isolate
objects within a group to be able to
work on them one on one so when you
select a group you're able to take a
bunch of objects that aren't linked
together or merge together or anything
like that and move them around or work
with them as if they were a single
object you can cut copy paste move
transform or do other things to these
objects once they're in a group that
will save you time so what we need to do
is just use one your selection tools to
select a few objects that are not
grouped together already or anything
like that we're gonna go ahead and
select these and we can see they're all
selected everything all the lines are
show all the paths are showing and
everything like that and what we're
going to do is go up to the object menu
and we're going to go to group now the
hotkey is ctrl G and that's something
you're going to want to remember because
you'll probably use groups a lot so go
ahead and click that and we have created
a group now if you go into your layers
panel and open up layer one you can see
that there is a group and the group
contains these paths now what I can do
is go ahead I can select the group and I
can transform them and I can move them
and everything all is one and all I
gotta do is just click on one and it's
gonna select the entire group so that's
pretty easy now if you don't want these
objects to be grouped anymore I gotta do
is ungroup them just go to object and
we're gonna go to ungroup and you can
see shift control G is the hotkey and
now these aren't grouped together
anymore and you can select them on their
own
so what if you want to keep everything
in a group but just work on one thing
every once in a while so let's group
these back up you can see we're in a
group you
the layers panel while your grouping and
ungrouping things is pretty helpful and
you want to have it open and you can see
this is the layers panel with the layers
of planes on top of each other I guess
and what we're gonna do is use isolation
mode so we're going to go use our
selection tool we have to use our
selection tool and double-click on a one
of our grouped objects so I'm gonna
double click the star and you can see it
this gray bar appears and this happens
anytime you double click anything and
you're gonna wonder what's going on or
whatever but now we're in isolation mode
look over here on our on our layers
panel and you can see that we're in
isolation mode so now we're able to just
work on the object that we want to work
on in isolation mode and I can move that
around without affecting the other
objects that go click on this now I can
move well my bed if I double click on
the star I'm able to isolate the star
here and actually transform in
everything like that like I did before
if I go to try to click on another
object here I'm not able to really
transform it or anything like that just
if you want to work on something else
just click on this bar here takes it out
of the isolation mode and we're back
into group mode here our regular mode
just double click on that and now I'm
able to just mess around with these as
well so there we go that's how we use
grouping objects and now we know how to
isolate things so remember you just got
to click on the bar up here to get out
of the isolation mode if I click on my
group here there is an isolation mode
button let me see if I can find it there
it is isolate selected object there we
go
if you want to you can also open up the
group and select these objects
individually here
and you can see that they get selected
just click on these circles over here on
your layers panel and I'll select them
so that's a pretty much all I wanted to
show you about selecting and grouping
objects we've got our isolation mode and
everything like that so we figured out
how to do that and hopefully can put it
to use and start working in a more
efficient manner on your projects so if
you liked it if you liked the video go
ahead and hit the like button or they
give me a thumbs up down there and
otherwise I'll see you guys in the next
tutorial have a good one everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
