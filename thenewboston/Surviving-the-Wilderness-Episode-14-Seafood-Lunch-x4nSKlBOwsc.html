feeling a lot better now I got a little
bit of food still very hungry but that's
what my crayfish cans gonna be for and
this fire it's a lot easier to start
fires now if it's not raining that is
well time to make the scan suitable for
catching crayfish should work quite
nicely
where's I caught close enough already
well when I was younger me and my
cousins used to catch crayfish all the
time we put him we take a little cup and
we put our hand in front of them and
they swim backwards so they'd swim right
into the cup and we pick it up out of
the water that's what I'm gonna do with
this and after I catch him I'm gonna dig
a pit in the sand if I leave them there
too long they can get away but I'm
probably not gonna be out there that
long they're kind of easy to catch if I
could find it now so I'll put them in
the pit when I get like maybe like a
dozen of them all throw on the can throw
some water in there and boil muck eat
the tails
well it took me longer than I expected
but I caught one show them to you oh I
can't tell if you're gonna be able to
see it or not but he's right in there
and he is going to be quite delicious
actually he's not as big as I thought
they were gonna be around here but
better than nothing
so now I got to dig a little pit I'll
leave them in there and get a couple
more and then come all up
well here we go the crayfish are right
in there five in total I was looking for
him for a while only got five I already
got him out of my pit which is right
here murky but they all stayed in there
so it's good and I'm gonna boil them up
and see what happens
the fire to a bigger location
I already had a little problem the
string broke on my thing but that's fine
because I saved most of them and I
rinsed them off and now I'm gonna eat
them on my plate right here they look so
good too
all right well I guess I dropped one in
the fire but I guess you will have that
sometimes all right here's one of the
little tails right here he looks pretty
good actually
hmm
that's really good
I'll shut some butter for it but with a
little shell in there but now I'm gonna
catch a bunch more
you grow stuff I just ripped the tail
part off
and not bad at all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
