corresponding angles formed by parallel
lines and what's gonna and these angles
are gonna help us solve some triangle
problems later on so when you have two
or more parallel lines right here as you
know we denote that with these little
arrows that are cut by a transversal
which is this line which we're going to
call line T corresponding angles are
congruent
so like this angle of this line in this
transversal is congruent to this angle
of the second line and this same
transversal just like this one right
here is congruent to here and the same
goes for the angles on this side so this
angle is congruent to this angle and
this angle is congruent to this angle so
knowing that we need to find the measure
of angle 1 and angle 2 so these are the
two parallel lines so their
corresponding parts are congruent so
like we said before the measure of angle
1 since angle 1 is congruent to this
angle right here has to be a hundred and
six because congruent angles have equal
measure an angle 2 is congruent to this
angle right here so angle two has to
measure 74 degrees okay so our
directions are to find the missing angle
measurements okay so we want and go 1
and angle 2 so these lines are
parallel and these lines are parallel so
there's a couple ways we can find out
these angle measures we're going to do
both of them so first if you look at
these two parallel lines this one in
this one we'll call this one a this
would be this one seeing this one's D so
if you look at this one that these lines
are cut by this transversal so that
means that corresponding angles have to
be congruent so this angle between line
on line a and line C is congruent to
this angle right here line be on line Z
so we can find out that the measure of
angle one is 87 degrees just using that
or what we could do is since these two
angles are supplementary we could set 93
plus we'll call this X right here equal
to 180 and if you subtract it over you
find out that this angle right here
equals 87 degrees and since these two
parallel lines C and D are cut by this
transversal line a and Wiens at this
line or this angle is congruent to this
angle so one would have to equal 87 as
well so those are just two different
ways you can do it and you can do the
same thing to find the measure of angle
two you can look at it as these two
lines are parallel and they're cut by
this transversal D
so this angle has to be congruent to
this angle so the measure of angle 2 has
to equal 93 degrees or like we did with
the other one you can say that these two
are supplementary
so you set 87 plus we'll call this y
equal to 180 if you subtracted over you
get y equals 93 and since these two
parallel lines C and D are cut by this
transversal B this line has to be or
this angle has to be congruent with this
angle so measure of angle 2 has to be 93
so either way you do it you'll get the
right answer it's just one way might be
a little quicker than the other so again
we are told to find the missing angle
measurements so we're going to start by
finding the measure of angle 16 so if
you look this line this line a and this
line B are parallel and right here
they're cut by this transversal G to
form angle 16 so this angle has to be
congruent to this angle so the measure
of angle 16 has to equal 120
so to find the measure of angle 17 we
have to do a little something a little
different so first we have to find out
what the measure of this angle x right
here is and then this these two angles
are supplementary angles so we can find
out the measure of 17 from there so
since these two angles are supplementary
we can add 120 plus X set it equal to
180 subtract the 120 over and we get X
is equal to 60 so then these two angles
are also supplementary so we said 1
sorry 60 Plus 17 well plus angle 17 is
equal to 180 but yet angle 17 is equal
to 120 and to find 18 you can look at it
as these two lines BNA or parallel
they're cut by this transversal z so
this angle has to be congruent to this
angle so the measure of 18 has to be 120
degrees so we learned about transverse
angles today and how they're congruent
but next lesson we're going to go into
other kinds of angles formed by parallel
lines so make sure you come back and
watch that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
