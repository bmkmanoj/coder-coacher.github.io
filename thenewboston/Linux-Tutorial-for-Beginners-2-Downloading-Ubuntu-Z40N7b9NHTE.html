show you how to download and install
Linux on your VirtualBox but before we
begin I want to explain one thing and
it's going to clear up a lot of
confusion that people have and that is
what the heck is a distribution and how
is it different than Linux well you know
how I said that you can have Linux and
install it on your computer or your
server well that's not entirely true and
it's kind of not true the same way that
you can't just install Windows you need
to pick a version of Windows Windows 95
Windows 7 Windows 8 Windows 10 well
Linux is kind of the same way Linux is
the core operating system and since this
is open source what people do is they
customize it and add features to it and
those are called distributions or deist
rows or distros however you say it
so what we need to do is instead of just
installing plain linux we need to pick a
distribution so a distribution like I
said is just a version of Linux and
there are a bunch that you can choose
from some of the most popular ones are
Debian and the difference between them
all is a lot of it is just personal
preference to be honest another thing is
what programs already come pre-installed
on it what's the overall layout the look
and feel and they customized some
different things but this is the
interface of Debian really popular one
this is Linux Mint that's another
popular one
this is Kali Linux so this comes with a
bunch of pre-installed programs for like
security analysts and I say security
analysts in quotation marks those little
air quotes I'm doing but the one we're
going to be working with is abouttwo now
don't freak out back okay so I'm going
to have to learn about Ubuntu and then
I'm gonna have to learn about Debian and
Linux Mint well I'm going to teach you
guys the core Linux concepts and these
concepts are going to apply no matter
what distribution you have so again this
is just one of the most popular ones
it's one of the most widely supported
and in my opinion is just awesome so go
to WWE to calm and click a desktop
because we want the desktop version you
can also run this on like a server like
if you're hosting a website online but
since we're playing around with it on
our desktop that's what we're going to
do and click download Ubuntu so we are
going to be taken to this page right
here and just like um you know they have
different versions of like windows or
whatever windows 7 windows 8 they always
release new versions of Ubuntu as well
so this one right here boot to 14.04
this is the one that I'm going to
recommend downloading and I'll explain
real quick the difference between these
so every so often a boon to comes out
with a stable version of their operating
system so you know how you're like okay
I'm going to download this but I know in
like three months they're coming to come
out with 15.4 and then you know two
weeks later they're going to come out
with a new version people want to avoid
that problem so what they do is every so
often they release an LCS version in
other words a long term support version
and whenever you download this they say
ok we're going to come out with new
updates but we promise to keep
supporting and keep fixing bugs with
this LTS version so this is the one that
you should always download if you want a
nice safe environment if you want to get
all the cutting-edge features then you
can download the later ones but 14.04
whatever the LTS version is at the time
when you're watching this video click
download and then you're going to be
taken to this page now instead of paying
anything if you just scroll all the way
down you can hit not now take me to the
download or if you want to donate go
ahead and then it's going to start
downloading in so it's going to download
this file in this file if you look at
the file extension it's an ISO so it has
file name dot is oh now this is if you
were to install this on a separate
computer or like maybe your laptop you
would take this and burn it to a DVD and
then you can stick it in your DVD drive
and install it just like you know how
like Windows comes on the DVD
you so you could do it like that however
since we're going to be installing it on
our virtual machine we can just use this
raw file and I'll show you guys how to
do that whenever this is done
downloading so pretty much right now
we're downloading the core a boot to
operating system which is a distribution
of Linux and well that's that so let me
just wait for this to download</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
