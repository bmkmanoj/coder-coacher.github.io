eighth tutorial and in this tutorial I
want to get started by talking to you
guys about the hand tool now we already
covered the magnifying glass tool and
the hand tool is actually right above it
this little icon but before we get to
that let's go ahead and open the
document it doesn't really matter what
image you choose and go ahead and zoom
in so it takes up most of the screen now
the reason I want to do this is because
it's easier to demonstrate the hand tool
shortcut H on your keyboard if you have
an image that's huge in zoomed in so go
ahead and select your hand tool and it's
very easy to work with the purpose of
the hand tool is the let you move around
the document now there are a couple ways
you can move around the document
whenever you zoom in far enough you get
scroll bars on the right hand side and
on the bottom right here that helps you
move around the document but the hand
tool allows you to do this much easier
just go ahead and click on the document
or the picture and drag it so as you can
see just by moving your mouse it's a
whole lot easier then you know maybe you
want to do paint this I different color
than going okay click this click this
and okay click this you can just go
ahead grab the hand tool BAM look at
that now the hand tool also has a sub
tool with a spun and it's called the
rotate view tool so in order to use this
pretty much just click on the image and
whenever you do you see a compass up
here all this does is pretty much
rotates your image now of course the red
part on the compass whenever you're
moving in that points to whatever
original part was up well you guys can
probably see it's pretty much represents
North on your image now aside from just
doing this manually we can also do is
say you want to rotate this image 90
degrees exactly
you can go up to the top right here type
in 90 and it pops right to 90 like that
so once you're done moving everything
around and you have the rotation tool
selected just go ahead and press reset
view or you can just go ahead and enter
0 and it's going to reset your view now
of course to get this back zoomed in
100% just double-click your magnifying
glass
and bam you're good to go so that's
pretty much all there is to using the
hand tool another thing actually I want
to demonstrate it should it demonstrated
this earlier but let's go ahead and zoom
back in again another cool thing you can
do when using um the hand tool is or I
should probably rather say this whenever
you're using another tool and I know
that I only talked to you guys about the
zoom tool in the hand tool right now but
if you're ever using like a paintbrush
or something - you know yeah Adam maybe
I'm going to put my name right here bu c
KY if you're ever using another tool and
you want to switch it in the hand tool
real quick and you're too lazy to go all
the way down here and click the hand
tool or press H on your keyboard you can
go ahead and hold in the spacebar on
your keyboard so check this out
painting with a paintbrush holding in
space BAM switch to the hand tool now as
long as you have space held in on your
keyboard you can go ahead and use this
hand tool maybe I want to paint his nose
blue really space on my keyboard BAM
switch backs it switches back to the
last tool that you use so remember those
few things the hand tool is H it's a lot
easier than using the you know scroll
bars on the right hand side and on the
bottom the rotate tool is cool whenever
you want to rotate it and you can also
enter the value manually at the top and
whenever you want to switch to the hand
tool real quick from another tool just
go ahead and hold on the spacebar you
got your hand tool you can move around
release it and you get your tool back
super easy super quick super efficient
so in the next tutorial I'm going to
teach you guys how to work with multiple
documents and I'm going to be showing
you guys lots of cool tricks so thank
you guys for watching and don't forget
to subscribe follow me on Twitter and
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
