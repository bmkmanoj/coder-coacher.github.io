tutorial and in the last story we
covered scope the difference between
private and public variables and
functions and even though we covered how
to access private variables from within
the class using a public function we're
gonna be covering that again and we're
also gonna be covering how to change
those variables and you might be able to
figure it out if you just sit down and
think about it but since this is such a
huge part of working with private
variables inside classes I'm gonna be
covering that in detail in this tutorial
so you probably don't want to skip this
one so let's go ahead and create a class
right now and name it beef because you
know can't use toon all the time and
let's go ahead and we just need one
private variable and definitely spell
that wrong private yep come on I'll get
it eventually private in college cows
name let's go ahead and make that one
bare bulb and now since this is private
variable we can't access it in any way
from outside this little class right
here so we can't set cows name equal to
Bucky out here and we can't say our echo
cows name out here either we have to do
all of our inner workings in here so
since we don't want this variable to be
useless and we actually want to be able
to change it and retrieve it from
outside our class we need to build two
special functions and these functions
and I'm not making these up these are
called setter and getter functions let
me go ahead and setter and we'll build
our get her down here now for every
computer programming language where
there are private variables this is a
something so you know I just wanna let
you guys know that I'm not just making
this up this is a cool nickname and I
came up with setter functions take a
private variable and allow you to change
them for example they can take cows name
and set it equal to Bucky take cows name
set equal to Lisa it sets up
have a variable getter functions take a
private variable and retrieve it so it
would allow you to echo Bucky from out
here or echo the name Lisa from out here
so anyways it pretty much turns a
private variable into a public variable
by using functions that give it that
functionality so enough of me talking
let's go ahead and start coding himself
so in order to do this just like the
last story you need to make a public
function because if you may have made it
private we'd have the same problem we
can only access in here what we want to
do is take something that's private to
here and make it accessible to the rest
of our program so that's why we need a
public function and just name this set
cows name you can name anything you want
nothing special and just go ahead and
write X actually um what's it gonna say
like the not the standards but the
convention is to write set and then in
camel casing which means capitalize
every first word um
that's the conventions of what pretty
much everyone uses so anyways now that I
covered all the conventional crap we can
begin program so anyways what we're
gonna be doing is passing in a variable
called X and this X will hold a name
like Bucky Lisa
Tony and it'll set the variable equal to
that name so let's go ahead and in order
to access any variable from inside class
of course use this and what variable do
we want to use cows name and let's go
ahead and set that equal to variable X
just like that same ways whenever we
call this function and we pass in a name
now this variable a private variable is
gonna be equal to that name and again we
can call this function from outside this
class so that is why we need this setter
function now let me just sign this up a
bit that she said and let's go ahead and
build our getter function now and public
wow did you just see what I did there
I like spouts every other word wrong
every other letter I mean so public and
function and now the get er is get cows
name easy enough and check this out
we don't need any parameter for this
since we're not passing in any new
information we're just getting the
variable itself so what we needed to do
is return
I should take a typing class alright and
now let's go ahead and this I forgot if
I had a copy still this cows name so
nice what this function does right here
is changes this variable to whatever we
want to change to and what this function
does right here is pretty much returns
whatever variable you asked or pretty
much gives you a private variable but
since it's in a public function and
remember anything that's public we can
use outside this class we're gonna be
able to use it in the rest of our
program so anyways if you don't believe
me let's go ahead and uh prove it to you
guys right now so the first thing we
need to do to use anything in this class
whether it be public or private is
create an object so that's cow
object it doesn't have to be kaua object
i just you know i thought that was a
neat name so equals new beef with no
parameters so let's go ahead and it
would probably be a good idea to let's
go ahead and echo the name right now
just so I can show you that's not blank
probably a good idea but you know it's
not a good idea putting Gatorade in your
humidifier because you know you might be
thinking maybe I'll kill two birds with
one stone
I will quench my thirst and I'll also
humidify my room but that is actually
not a good idea and yes I'm talking from
personal experience here so anyways
let's go ahead and echo the cow object
and let's just go ahead and use that
method and what was that called let me
just copy this I'm Way too lazy to type
this stuff oh I got stuff to do today
all right get cow's name so what this is
gonna do is it's not gonna give you that
fatal error from last time since this is
actually a valid code just cows name is
not equal to anything right now
this is gonna echo out nothing at all
it's just gonna do nothing so now what
we want to do is we actually want to
change this cow's name to set equal to
something so let's go ahead and yeah
again not typing all this crap out so
now what we want to do is we want to use
our setter function so set what make
sure I don't type anything you're on set
cows name and what do you want to set
this equal to let's set equal to like
Sarah so what this is gonna do is its
first gonna retrieve the name and echo
it out it's not equal to anything yet so
it's going to echo out nothing now we're
gonna give it a name right here so after
this when we echo it it's gonna echo out
Sarah that's what this line of code is
gonna do
so now let's go ahead and change this
again this cows name was Sarah
but it had a little sex change and now
it's named as Dan Henderson hmm didn't
know that was possible but guess what it
is
so now let's go ahead and copy this and
echo it out one more time
so before I run this program in a first
let me check for typos make sure I
didn't wrote get crows name or anything
like that and got on my semicolons
everything looks good so anyways what
this program is gonna do is this is
going to create a new object which
pretty much gives us access to this
class right here and after that is gonna
say alright echo out the name of the cow
well he doesn't have a name yet so
nothing's gonna happen and then it's
gonna say alright let's give you a name
cow your name is Sarah and then let's go
ahead and echo that out so we can see it
and then we say alright now your name is
then Henderson and now let's go ahead
and echo that out so we can see that and
we did this through the use of setter
and getter functions and whenever we
needed a set the name or change the name
what we did is we made a public function
to acts as a private variable and we
pretty much passed then you know Sarah
or Dan Henderson as X and it changed
this private variable
2x and whenever we wanted to get that
name or retrieve it so we could echo it
out what we did is we just said all
right return a variable from this class
and make it be cows name so yeah the ADI
you know all the stuff you should know
so let me make sure I save that refresh
and move it over yes and check it out
at first it echoes out nothing it does
nothing so that's why it starts the
beginning and then it that goes out Sara
and then Dan Henderson so check this out
pretty cool pretty flawless we didn't
get any errors at all so again one last
time I want to recap whenever you want
to use a private variable you have to
use public functions in order to use it
from outside that class so anyways
that's what I wanted to say in this
tutorial so thank you guys for watching

any questions just ask me on my forum
and if I don't answer first someone will
ask for it so thank you for watching and
well I'll see you guys next door</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
