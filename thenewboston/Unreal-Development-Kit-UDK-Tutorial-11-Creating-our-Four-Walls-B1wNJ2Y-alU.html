decayed soro and in this tutorial now
that we got our floor built it's time to
start putting up some walls so what I'm
gonna do is first of all I'm gonna
envision that we're building a little
house here and instead of putting up
four walls that cover the entire length
and the entire width of this house I'm
going to leave some space in front for
you know a front deck or front porch
whatever you want to call it so I'm not
gonna be just in closing this totally
I'm gonna be leaving some space for a
porch I think that'll make things a
little more interesting so let's go
ahead and the first thing I want to do
is let's go ahead and build these short
walls right here as you know we got a
short length in a long length or aka
width in length so I'm gonna be taking
care of those shorter walls first so go
ahead and we first want to make sure
that we first want to check the
properties of our floor to make sure the
dimensions on what we should build our
short wall so we already know the width
of this is 1024 and that's this right
here the X so we can go ahead and leave
that right there we already know that
the length of it is let's see what it is
1280 and check it out since we're
building a short wall we only want to
have the length be like 32 so let's go
ahead and change this 32 and now for Z Z
is the height now we can pick anything
we want for height I'm gonna make my
walls let's just say 576 tall so let's
go ahead and if we build this in X out
of it we can see that this is a pretty
good height so we could go ahead and
position this wall in this perspective
view right here but as you can see it's
kind of confusing so it would probably
be better do this go ahead and in your
front view go ahead and drag this up
into your wall sits exactly on the base
of your floor that's probably the
easiest either using this side view in
the top left or front view where you can
position your wall another thing you
want to do is you want to slide it all
the way back to your very back corner
and probably if we scroll in here let me
just drag up a little bit we can
position this wall exactly on the very
back edge
so that way you can see that these graph
views as I like to come
they aren't totally useless I know they
don't look really pretty but whenever
we're doing precision movement they
actually come in handy so with that
being said my wall looks good in all my
angles let me verify this top view front
view side view and perspective view it
looks pretty good so I'm gonna go ahead
and hit CSG ad and add my wall right
there now let me go ahead and show you
guys a little trick in order to build
another wall let me go ahead and
actually maybe I'll change the angle
this a little bit right there might look
good
in order to build another wall we
basically need an exact duplicate of
this so what we can do is we can take
this red boat or brush and we can move
it and we can build it again well I want
to teach you guys a little trick in
order to make an exact copy of a shape
you already have go ahead and select
that shape and now if you go ahead and
hold alt on your keyboard and go ahead
and drag it forward we can get an exact
copy of that shape so let me go ahead
and hit release there and that actually
looks pretty good right there I actually
want to drag it back just a bit let's
see I probably wanted to drag it back I
don't know maybe right there and
actually I hit all again so let's go
ahead and drag that back right there and
I think it looks pretty good right there
I want to get two lined up perfectly so
this gives us enough space for a porch
right here and also it gives us a nice
space for the inside right here so we're
saying alright Bucky so what you did is
you dragged that wall but we're not
having a duplicate wall so the reason
behind that is because remember and a
couple tutorials ago I told you guys
anytime you update your geometry you
have to rebuild it so go ahead and build
geometry for visible level and close
that and whenever we do that we see we
indeed get a wall
pretty cool huh so now let me tell you
guys another little trick so before what
we needed to do is we needed to
calculate how big how tall pretty much
needed to calculate the size of the wall
well now what we need to do is we need
to figure out the length between this
wall right here and this wall right here
so what we could do is you know maybe we
want to go to the grid and count
yada-yada yada-yada
maybe this grid will be easier to count
but I want to show you guys a nice
little shortcut in order to measure two
distances on your grid what you need to
do is you need to go ahead and select
the point on your grid and then hold the
middle mouse button and this middle
mouse button is kind of like a tape
measure go ahead and click it and hold
it and drag it and now once you start
dragging it you can see that our a the
distance between these two walls is 896
so that's how long I need to make my
third wall again one more time any time
you want to measure the point between
two points or the distance between two
points rather hold your middle mouse
button and drag and it's kind of like a
virtual tape measure 896 that's how big
I need to make it and just to verify 896
divided by 32 that divides evenly so
make sense so now let's go ahead and
select a red builder brush and go ahead
and right-click it and now let's go
ahead and change this so the length X
remember if we scroll down here we can
see that the length or X is gonna be
pretty much the width of the wall so we
want to change that to 32 and now the Y
that's the length we calculated that's
the 896 and also Z that Z the Z
shouldn't change because remember Z is
height and again if you get confused
look down here in the bottom left-hand
corner and that's going to give you idea
of what X Z and Y means so it's 32
thickness the length is 896 in the
height just like the other wall is 576
so go ahead and hit build what I say
build well not not the funniest thing to
say but all right
so we can like I said position this in
the perspective view right here but I'm
gonna go ahead and in position mine in
the top view so go ahead and move this
over to the top view scroll in make sure
it's positioned nicely and another thing
I want to do is in my side view check it
out it's not exactly hitting the ground
go ahead and move this down in our side
view and if we look in all our views
right now we can see that this wall is
perfectly lined up on its side on the
front on the top and it looks pretty
dang good in our perspective view too so
go ahead and hit CSG ad and it's going
to add that geometry pretty cool huh
so now let's go ahead and get our read
Builder brush out of the way
and what I want to do is go ahead and
highlight this in our side view and I'm
gonna use that copy shortcut again so
actually is this the best view to do so
well let's go ahead and do this let's
move our read builder brush out of the
way right here and probably the top view
would be the easiest although you could
do it in the side view again like I said
anytime you want to copy this wall
exactly highlight the wall make sure you
don't have your red go-to brush selected
make sure you have your wall selected in
the outline will be blue hold down alt
on your keyboard and go ahead and drag
it until it ends up where you want to
copy it and go ahead and let go so if we
go ahead and scroll in we can verify
that actually I messed up a little bit
let's go ahead and drag that till it
matches up and make sure you verify it
in all of your angles the front view the
side view and the top view and also
might as well just verify in the
perspective view that looks good and
once it does you're ready to move on so
the last thing you probably want to do
is build this so go ahead and build your
geometry and indeed we get a
nice-looking house with four walls again
what I'm gonna be doing in the upcoming
tutorials is I'm gonna be adding a door
in front and you know maybe Adam some
pillars for the porch and of course we
need a roof as well or else it's gonna
rain on us so we have a basic shape of a
house done a couple things you need to
take away from this tutorial is make
sure if you ever get confused you don't
know what length width height is go
ahead and just look in the bottom left
and that's going to give you the idea of
what XY and z is and also anytime you
want to copy make sure to hold all onion
keyboard and drag the shape that you
want to copy and you're not going to see
it at first into your rebuild your
geometry so make sure your geometries
rebuilt so there we have the beginning
of our nice little house it
it looks like Super Mario Brothers top
hat not how this has like kind of square
anyways I'm just talking myself to so
thank you guys for watching and yeah
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
