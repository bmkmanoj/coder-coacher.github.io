tutorial and in this lesson I'm going to
be teaching you guys how to send
messages because remember whenever we
are able to type stuff into that text
box what it's going to do is there's
going to be a listener that sits on that
text box and it basically waits for you
to type in a message and hit enter once
you hit enter it's going to grab all the
stuff from inside your text box and it's
going to call it on this method that
says send message so what this message I
mean excuse me what this method does is
it sends a message to whoever you're
connected to so of course it probably
would be a good idea to you know build
this method so it actually worked so
what this is going to do is send a
message to client which is basically the
computer that's connected to the server
and private void send message now just
to clear things up send message is
different from the show Wow
you know what saying send message and
show message are very complicated
alright so send message sends a message
to the client and what show message does
is it pretty much displays both of your
guys's messages on the main chat area so
you know you can see the history of your
conversation so again what we're going
to be doing is coding the method send
message right now and what this does is
send a message to someone else
so again the send message method takes
one parameter string message which is
basically what message what did you type
into that chat area what do you want to
send well like everything else it's good
idea to put this in a try-catch
statement I'm sorry guys but you know
it's good programming practice so try
and catch
I owe exception and what this is going
to do is it's pretty much going to catch
an exception if for some reason it was
unable to send your message so what
we'll do is chat window a pen and
remember that chat window is the main
area that you view all of your guys's
messages and what append means is
basically stick this into the chat area
so you guys can see it might as well put
caps lock error dude i dude I can't send
that message for some reason so
hopefully you should never see that
because you know I don't know maybe
something a bug rant wrong in our server
midway through sending the message then
we would get something like that but
most cases you just want to be able to
send it successfully to the client or to
the other person so whenever you do that
this is how you do it output which
remember our output is our stream that
sends data or messages away from us to
someone else so that's what we need to
tap into right object now the right
object method is a method that's built
into Java and what this does is it
basically well sends a message through
the output so this is going to write a
method or create an object and send it
to your output stream now once it's in
your output stream it's going to go to
the client or here ever you're connected
with so what do we want this message to
say well just go ahead and put server so
that's and if you guys were creating
like a real chatroom then this would be
your username but since this is the
server that's sending these messages
that's why I did that
so server and the message is message
and I need to put quotes right there all
right so basically what we're doing is
whenever we pass something into here and
let me go ahead and give you guys
example so say that we typed in um hey
Bucky what's up then it's going to pass
hey Bucky what's up into this send
message method also a tongue twister by
the way now whenever we get that string
called message message is now equal to
hey Bucky what's up so of course that's
a string so your string that you're
going to send to them is first of all
who is it coming from server
- hey Bucky what's up that's going to
write an object into your output string
now once that entire string is in your
output stream it can go send it along
the stream to the client which is the
other person and of course if you
remember from a couple de toros ago
whenever you pretty much write something
into your output stream it's always a
good idea to output flush it out once
you're done sending stuff and that
pretty much means in case you know
something happened and you have any
bytes left over then just go ahead and
flush them out that means push all the
extra bytes on to the user just so you
don't have anything left over buffering
in your stream and this is just good
housekeeping stuff although it you don't
need to actually call it too often so
once you're done with that of course the
message is sent to them but what you
want to happen is you want that message
to display on your screen because if you
remember from you know AOL Instant
Messenger is something whenever you send
something to them it pops up on your top
window on the screen the message that
you just typed it doesn't just show
their messages it shows the conversation
your messages and their messages so we
actually want to show message the one
that you just wrote and we of course
want to show this on a new line so new
line and the message is server
-
Plus whatever message you just wrote and
I like to put my pluses with a little
space right there just because I think
it looks a little bit neater so
basically we should have one error right
now that says show message and also
another one that says able to type
because we didn't code that but
basically this is all you need to do in
order to send a message to another
computer the first thing is you need to
write a try-catch because you know in
case something goes wrong then we you
know can successfully handle it but
basically our message or string that we
want to send to the user is going to be
an object so now that the object is
created we can put it in our output
stream which is basically the road that
it's a one-way road and it goes from our
computer to their computer so now that
we sent the object right here it gets
sent along the stream to them and if any
crap gets left over we can just flush it
right out to them and just so we can you
know see the history of our conversation
we want to also show this message on our
screen the screen that we're looking at
right now so that's why I put new line
because every message should go on a new
line and just says server message simple
enough so now in the next tutorial I'm
going to show you guys how to put how to
code the show message method which
pretty much is extremely easy pretty
much displays method messages on your
GUI so nice thing guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
