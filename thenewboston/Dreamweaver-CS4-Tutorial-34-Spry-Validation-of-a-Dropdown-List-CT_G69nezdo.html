to be going over a validation of
drop-down menus so let's get started by
creating a drop-down menu go over here
at the left and click on spry validation
select I'm going to give it an ID of
drop-down one and I'm going to give a
label of make a selection say okay and
now if we have created our spry select
span and we have created a label for our
select tags so inside our select tags
we're going to need to add some options
so click on list values and say option
one option one option two I'm going to
add one more option three we go and now
you can see this create our options for
us and now we're going to need to add
some validation to make sure that
they're not selecting the wrong thing so
click inside of the span tag here and it
says do not allow blank value so since
we have the blank
checkbox checked what that means is do
not allow value that is blank
so now that we've created a value right
here that is null then on a submit it
should
oops go back to a regular form here
there we go
what you can see is when I click Submit
this option once it has a value of blank
is not allowed to be submitted so
another way that we can validate our
drop-down list menu is with an invalid
value so we could change this
to a negative one I'm going to change
this to blank and when we submit this
form it's going to be invalid if we have
the blank option selected because the
value is negative one C so if we choose
any of these other ones we can submit it
but if that if the one that is a blank
is chosen then it won't allow us to
submit it so let's just recap real quick
with our drop-down validation we have
two options we have the invalid value or
the blank value and if you do not want a
user to select a certain option then you
could either change it to a value that
you make invalid in this case which is
negative one or you can also change it
to a value that is blank either way will
work if you do not want the option to be
submitted so that is it for the
validation of a drop-down select menu in
the next tutorial we're going to be
going over survive ala Dacian of a
checkbox I mean now have a choc-ice mode
of a password so thanks for watching and
don't forget to subscribe I'll see you
in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
