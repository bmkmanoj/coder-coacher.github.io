castle / house / whatever heck is so
first thing I'm going to do is I'm
actually going to copy this right here
holding ctrl alt and drag this out just
a tidbit because I had a feeling I'm
going to want to make my wall just a tad
bit bigger so let's go ahead and add a
bridge now by opening the content
browser and dragging this bridge right
here out I'm right about there and it
looks pretty huge now and I think that
is because my cameras right close to it
I think it's really that huge so if we
go ahead and in our side view scrolling
scroll in you guys ever see that CSI
were there like enhance enhance its BS
anyways you guys probably have no idea
what I'm talking about so let's go ahead
and in my top view position this right
where we want it and I'm going to need
to grow to bridge by like let's give it
2 point 0 see how that looks to point o
let's go ahead and bump it up just a tad
bit more 2.5 hmm all right good enough
so my top view I want to position that
right about actually it looks pretty
dang good my perspective nicely
positioned bridge Bucky and now let me
go ahead and look in these views make
sure it's touching and hey good enough
and just verify in my perspective view
that it looks amazing and verified so
now I got my bridge in bridge beds now
it's time to actually start building
this castle or whatever the heck I'm
going to build so go ahead and in your
content browser I think I feel in my
heart that as soon as our user is going
to come in then we want to build them
like an epic archway to go under so
let's go ahead and in our content
browser delete bridge and go ahead and
type in arch and let's see we got to
work with this one looks pretty cool but
that might be a little hard to work with
this one might be a little easier to
work with it looks pretty dang good so
go ahead and drag that out on your
screen and the first thing I'm noticing
is this is amazingly amazingly huge so
what we're going to be doing is roomy
shrinking that by let's see point five
let's see how that works yeah it's a
little bit better so let's go ahead and
select that and see where it is and
maybe if we all right that looks pretty
right there I mean we can always move it
later on right like I said kind of
winging this tutorial but i think that
arch looks pretty good right there the
reason that i'm not going to adjust it
up and down right now is because i'm
going to build the walls first and then
i'm going to set it right on top of the
walls so with that being said i'm going
to go ahead into my content browser grab
some walls and by the way if you guys
think you can build a better castle than
this awesome amazing 1 i'm building go
ahead and build it and send it to me in
a video response and I'll just prove all
the video responses like I always do I
don't even look at them I just put check
all approve all and we can see who
builds the best castle and I'm guessing
that yours probably be better than mine
since I'm doing this in like five
seconds so let's go ahead and look
search for a wall none of these look
very appetizing this one looks all right
but what's something a little more this
looks pretty good so let's go ahead and
drag this out X and my wall looks pretty
good right now but I wanted just a tid
bit bigger so I'm going to go ahead and
let's say I want to grow this by 1.5
that's pretty good so the very first
thing I'm going to do is position
exactly where I want it and that would
just happen to be well let's say we want
to like leave space on each side
obviously so we'll go ahead and put one
right there and we'll pull another one
right there for now so if we go ahead
and take this and drag it up so it sits
right on top of those then end my front
view I can just go ahead and grab each
one of these and drag them right under
again if you're building a game you
typically want to you know take more
than half a second make sure everything
is positioned correctly but for now I do
not want to do that so this is what I
get and I guess even if I want to yeah I
got an idea so I'm going to go ahead and
copy this and I'm going to drag them
both up because I kind of want the
effect that yeah that effect right there
I really like where this is going oh
yeah this is going to look sweet so now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to go
ahead and grab these walls right here
and probably in my top view would be the
best bet yeah oh yeah and just go ahead
and rotate and then with your rotating
selected go ahead and hold down alt and
you can actually rotate these the copy
them as well you guys probably thought
that moving them was the only way but
boy were you wrong so let's go ahead and
if we position these exactly we want
them with both of them selected stowed
and just move them right about there and
go ahead and my perspective view I want
to make sure they look amazing again we
really don't want these to overlap
because if they overlap then you're sad
meshes are going to create this concrete
looping through each other and it
wouldn't look really natural so I think
that's a pretty good natural looking
again see this look right here of this
concrete kind of going into this that's
alright because I mean concrete could be
built into each other but if these walls
were doing it then that will look
unnatural so for now it looks pretty
good I think so what I'm going to do is
go ahead and select those and all and
drag it down right about there and now
let me go ahead oh man this is looking
just oman it's almost looking too good
that's the problem so with those being
selected I'm going to go ahead and drag
these and I'm going to kind of make a
hallway
so let me just go ahead and in my top
view alt and drag you can almost make a
song out of this alt and drag and alt
and drag and one and two and alt and
drag so I've got a nice little hallway
going on there so let me go ahead and
scroll down to players view and as I as
I can see first and foremost this is
totally not centered well I'm just going
to say that that's what I was going for
even though it clearly was not what I
was going for so let's go ahead and see
what we got so far so we got a starting
point right here it's pretty good the
player is going to cross over this
bridge look around 01 what's over here
uh-huh no nothing what it's over here
I'll go to bug gonna go down this
hallway and that's what the player is
going to do so it actually looks pretty
epic in my side view right here looking
pretty good again if we want to make
this even more epic you can add windows
and you know maybe a guy at the top
shoot and catapult at you but we don't
have time for that right now so in the
next story what I'm going to be doing is
well I'm just gonna be spicing things up
a bit so it's gonna be awesome again um
like I said the best way to probably
learn this is just to create your own
but if you want to stick with me and
watch when we build the rest of my
awesome castle then you are welcome to
again sorry I didn't plan anything out
but hey that's that this is all you guys
get so thank you guys for watching and I
just I just had another idea I'm going
to go ahead and expand these all the way
down I'm going to do that between this
video in the next video so when you guys
come back this is going to look even
more awesome so for now thank you guys
for watching don't forget subscribe and
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
