column layout a two column layout a
three column layout
there are some properties that are going
to be the same for example the
background is going to be the same
opacity they're both going to you know
only display whenever you hover over
them they're going to all have the same
padding whatever properties are similar
in all layouts this is what we're we
want to set out of course the main thing
that is different about them is the
width of them this one column layout is
a lot skinnier than the two column
layout so on and so forth but for now
what is gonna be a common attribute of
all drop up menus the first thing is
then this is pretty much all
housekeeping stuff padding-bottom 15
pixels if you don't have a padding
bottom it looks really weird
display:none and text-align:left so
basically what we did is we added some
spacing so the text doesn't look weird
whenever it's in there
the position:absolute is necessary just
like whenever we did the programs menu
because if we didn't have this then it
would appear in a very weird position
whenever we have position:absolute it
makes it positioned relative to the list
item so relative you see how each of
these drop menus appears exactly where
you think it would well that's because
it's saying okay where do you want me
positioned on the website
well actually whenever we put absolute
it uses this button as a reference and
that way whenever we move over
eventually it's gonna be basically
exactly where we want it
so again position:absolute means use the
button as a reference for the drop up
now like I said these are going to be
common for every single drop up menu
however the things that are going to be
different are the layout sizes so for
layout the one column layout
and this would be an example of that
where you only have one column we want
to go ahead and give this a set width so
go ahead and set the width of this equal
to 140 pixels now we want to do this for
width of each now we want to do this for
each layout one column layout two column
and three column two and three now for
the two column layout we want this 400
or excuse me
280 and for the three column layout we
want this of course none other than 420
for show for sure by the way yesterday
was 420 so if you celebrated
congratulations now basically what we
did here is we set these layouts apart
and we pretty much want to make each one
bigger because then we can stick more
columns in it of course now basically
what we did is we added a hundred and
forty pixels to each layout so each
column is gonna be a hundred well it's
not gonna be a hundred and forty exactly
but because you're gonna have some space
on the left hand side but it's basically
going to be a hundred and forty pixels
so in the three column layout you can
stick either one three with column n or
three individual single columns make
sense now after this what we want to do
is if you guys haven't noticed yet we
didn't set any property so that these
appear whenever you hover over the
buttons so right now even though they
have a width and also all these
properties so the text looks like cinema
it's not displaying by default nothing
is going to display
we only want these to display whenever
you hover over the buttons so how do we
change this well actually
okay Audrey display on hover or display
drop up menus on hover alright I might
as well type this out
I don't want cheat on this one so in the
footer menu remember the list item hover
and remember the list item is just the
account profile in two columns button
whenever you hover over those and
whenever you have a class called either
one column layout and now we can go
ahead and copy so whenever you hover
over a button that has the one column
layout the two column layout or the
three column layout that's when you
display it so the first thing we want to
do is set the display because by default
it's none and we want it to display so
go ahead and just change this to block
and that'll make sure that it appears on
the screen now the next thing that you
want to do is it's going to be
position:absolute but what we want to do
is just in case and you guys override it
whenever you're messing with it I'm
gonna go ahead and copy some of these
for our piece so margin remember we will
not only want them to reference the
button in terms of where we're telling
it to appear on the web page but you'll
also want to move it to the left 15
pixels and that's because with our
padding and our border it would appear
the corner of it would appear like right
around here if we didn't move it to the
left 15 pixels so zero zero zero
negative 15 pixels moves it exactly
aligned with the left hand side of the
button pretty freakin cool now the
bottom of course just like before we
have to move it up 40 pixels if not it
would appear on the very bottom of the
browser which we do not want now the
border radius I'm actually going to copy
these too because I'm too lazy to type
them
all right so the border radius and the
background that's what I'm looking for
so just like the program's menu we're
gonna give a background a 50% 50% what
the heck 50% opacity as well is make the
top two corners curvy so what that does
is it I don't know if you guys can see
it right there not only does it make
your background transparent which is
awesome just like this one but I also
make those top corners the top left in
the top right curvy while leaving the
bottom right in the bottom left ones
square I think that looks cool if you
guys think otherwise then this is how
you change that right there so now what
we did is we basically made three
different layouts we added one column
layout a to column in the three column
layout basically we made different width
drop menus but now what we need to do is
in guys this is gonna take like to set
actually it's probably gonna take like a
minute and a half literally what we need
to do is we need to style the individual
columns because as you guys can see a
standard column is 130 pixels this is
130 pixels this is 130 pixels this is
130 pixels however we also need to style
a column that takes up to like this one
and this is actually 270 pixels so you
can either use it with a single column
or a double column and that equals 3 or
you can style one big column and um this
would be 410 and you can see this takes
up one this takes up to 1 that would
take up 3 pretty obvious what that would
look like but anyways thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe in don't
forget to check out my new website
Bucky's room comm it's pretty sweet link
below and I'll see you guys in the next
video where we are going to be finishing
