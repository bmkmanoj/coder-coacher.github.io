and fiftieth Android tutorial for the
new boss in and just want to say
congratulations for getting it getting
this far I know we've gotten kind of
quick in some places been pretty boring
lately so I apologize for that
just been trying to get all these
tutorials done and so you know my humor
just went down the drain but let's just
try not let's just try and keep going
here first thing if you guys noticed I
just deleted pretty much or get method
and we're just starting again brand new
from within this class we're gonna
actually pour some data from Twitter
using JSON which is JavaScript object
notation and we're just going to read
some information from basically the JSON
URL which I'll kind of explain what it
looks like and all that stuff as we go
but first we're going to create new
method within our class that returns a
JSON object so we're just going to say
public JSON object it's the type that is
going to return and we're going to call
this I call this last tweet something
like that and we're going to get pass in
a string that is going to be the user
name something like that and we also
want to throw some throw some exceptions
so we're going to say throw a throws
client protocol exception
input/output exception and a JSON
exception or JSON Act exception all
right so now that we have this method
set up got add Oliver imports control
ship Doe again and adds our imports for
us and we need some kind of a return
statement that's going to return a JSON
object we'll get to that in a second the
first thing that we want to do again is
have an HTTP client that's going to
basically be a default so we're going to
set that up above our class so we can
refer to it everywhere else so HTTP
client and we're going to say this
client is again just keep things kind of
familiar they're thinner on create
method we might say client it's equal to
new a default HTTP client just standard
default client nothing new for the most
part again just adder imports all right
so now let's get into it basically
mainstream websites that use some kind
of JavaScript
you know object notation or adjacent
allows that to be public so you know
people like us else can pull some of the
information and use in our applications
and Twitter has you know a JSON that we
can actually pull some information from
and you can search that you know like
Twitter JSON and a lot of you know top
few results will show you the actual
website link that you guys can give some
information from and which what type of
JavaScript notation it is for this one
what we're going to do is we're going to
set up you know that URL above our class
because it's not going to change so
we're just going to say final static
string and we're just going to call this
URL something like that and what we're
going to do is we're going to refer to
the JSON string called HTTP port slash
forward slash API dot Twitter
dot-com 4/1 Ford / statuses for / user
underscore timeline dot JSON so that's
the one that we're going to use again
you can just search in Google find
different types and see which you know
what it does and for this one it just
kind of pulls up I think the last few
tweets or something
and I'll get into what that website
actually looks like or what that URL
string does and and all that good stuff
as we go but now what we want to do is
we and we just want to build a string
builder so we're going to say string
builder we're going to call this one URL
this one's lowercase URL so it's
different than our string we're going to
set this equal to be a new string
builder and we're gonna say URL within
the parentheses so basically what we're
doing is using a string builder to build
the string off of our off our JSON code
or URL whatever you guys might refer to
that as and then what we're going to do
is we're going to parse some data from
that but before we do that I want to
show you guys what you know this kind of
looks like so we're going to do that
first so give you guys give yourself a
few spaces we're just going to use again
the HTTP GET command and we're just
going to say get and this is equal to
new HTTP GET and then we're going to
refer to our URL lowercase dot - string
so again nothing new for the most part
and that's properly it for this tutorial
we haven't done too much but we do now
kind of understand that some mainstream
services like Twitter allow some JSON
references that we can pull some data
from and use and you know our
application actually doesn't do all that
work it's Twitter that's doing the work
and we're just pulling some of the data
so that's probably the lesson for today
well it's all we're going to get into
you know setting up this last tweet
method to return a JSON object and I'll
catch you guys in the next tutorial have
a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
