Photoshop cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackbird and in
this tutorial I'm going to go over how
to use the zoom tool in all of its glory
so I'm going to go over pretty much
everything that you can do with it so
the zoom tool is this magnifying glass
looking thing here and click on it and
and it'll bring up the zoom tool options
up here and you'll be able to tell that
you have it selected because you have a
magnifying glass with a plus sign in on
your over top of your canvas here so the
first way you can easily zoom in and out
is just by clicking on the image so if I
left click on this image it's going to
zoom me in if I hold alt and click it's
going to zoom me out now there's a few
ways to zoom in and out using this tool
and a whole bunch of different ways to
do things that you want if you have this
scrubby zoom selected and you hold your
left mouse button down and you move
right it's going to zoom in OOP geez and
if you move left it's going to zoom out
so that's a very handy it's better than
just clicking and zooming but one thing
about clicking and zooming is it kind of
centers like the center's the image more
over towards you clicked and zoomed if
you uncheck scrubby zoom now you can
make a bounding box of where you want to
zoom into so maybe I want to zoom in on
these tires so that's a how you do that
let me
you uncheck it they're both they both
have their uses they're both pretty
decent and as you can tell like if I
started zooming in on something like
here and then I started zooming out
it'll automatically usually centers it
for you so that your canvas isn't over
here on like the corner or something
like that now we've got a couple things
going buttons going on up here actual
pixel pixels fit screen fill screen
print size so if we click on actual
pixels it's going to zoom it to like
pretty much 100% if we go to fit screen
it's just going to fit the entire screen
with the image so right now this image
is large so it's at 28.8 2% if I click
on fill screen that's just going to fill
up the entire screen even if it has to
cut off the edges and print size is how
big this is going to prime some paper or
something like that there's a little
cool hockey that you can use to zoom in
temporarily and it'll snap back to what
it's at so if you hold down the H key
while you had the zoom button here
clicked and drag it will temporarily
zoom in a little bit for you and then if
you let let the H key go it'll snap back
so that's just like a cool little thing
you can do if you're working and need to
like zoom in temporarily now you get a
couple checkboxes up here that are kind
of self-explanatory zoom all windows
here will zoom both of these two windows
at the same time so remember what this
one looks like pretty zoomed in there in
this one if i zoom in this one also
zoomed in so that's what zoom all
windows means
and then we got resize windows to fit so
if I click on it it's going to just like
try to fit it for you and I don't really
like it too much
so I don't really use resize windows to
fit then you can also select if you want
to zoom out by or zoom in by selecting
either the plus or minus magnifying
glass there and there are some presets
but I'm not going to get into that today
so like maybe you want to have one that
zooms in a certain amount you can set it
like you can set that up now you can
zoom in also without even having to use
a be on the zoom tool which is pretty
neat if you click on any other tool so
I'll click on this magic wand tool here
you hold down control spacebar and you
can see it turns into the zoom tool
which you can click and zoom out or zoom
in if you hold alt while you're holding
ctrl + spacebar you can zoom out so
that's just a quick way to do it and
then let go of the hotkeys to get back
onto the tool that you are using which
is pretty sweet so that's all the uses
of the zoom tool if you watch the
tutorial before this it was about the
navigator and the navigator and the zoom
tool are pretty much used like the same
same way so use those interchangeably if
you want whichever way you prefer is up
to you whichever you can work faster
with is what I would recommend so thanks
for watching this tutorial guys and
girls and have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
