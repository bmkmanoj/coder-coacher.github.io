biology tutorial and in this tutorial I
want to take a closer look at the plasma
membrane specifically the different
parts that make it up and the first part
I want to start with is called the
phospholipid so phospho lipids now
remember that we talked about
phospholipids before and there were a
special type of lipids specifically I
said that they were the part that made
up the cell membrane so let me go ahead
and show you guys where they are in the
cell membrane so there are actually two
layers of these one is on one side and
the other is on another side and they
look something like this with a head and
tails so we'll say that this is the cell
membrane right here and I might as well
go ahead and write outside we'll say
this is the outside of the cell and this
is the inside of the cell with all the
cytoplasm so basically the first part of
the cell membrane is the phospholipids
now again like you can see there are two
layers of phospholipids and that's why
some people call this the phospholipid
bilayer so again the first part is the
phospholipids in a couple things to
point out here is that obviously they
have heads right here and they also have
tails so two parts of the phospholipids
and if you're wondering okay so does it
just happen by chance after randomly you
know all their heads are stuck together
and all of their tails are stuck
together or pointing in the same
direction
and it doesn't happen by change because
in fact the heads of these are attracted
to water and the tails right here repel
water so since the outside and the
inside are kind of watery
I'll just put watery right here that's
why the heads are attracted to this part
and this part and the tails because they
don't like water or they repel water
that's why they are attracted to the
inside where there is no water at all so
again watery solution outside the cell
and inside the cell so that's why the
why the two layers of the phospholipids
are pointing towards the watery side and
the inside where the tails are or
repelling the water simple enough so the
next part of the plasma membrane are
proteins so I'm going to go ahead and
draw a big ol protein and let me see if
I can well let me turn my tablet so I
can write sideways Pro T okay that's the
best I can do but basically that is a
protein right there now again as you can
see the proteins are kind of embedded in
the phospholipid bilayers and they
aren't just stuck there they actually
float around your entire cell membrane
but for right now it's easier to drop I
just dry embedded like that so the next
part I guess we want to talk about is
actually it'll probably be easier if I
draw some more of these because that's
kind of what they look like you have
your proteins embedded in your
phospholipid bilayer so it looks
something like this if we were to take
your cell membrane which is incredibly
thin and we were to put it under an
incredibly powerful microscope would
have your phospholipids with some random
proteins embedded inside however that's
not the entire story there is a bigger
part to this and the next thing that I
want to cover is cholesterol now
cholesterol I guess it will look
something like this come in these little
chains and around these positions so I
guess since I have this color coded I
might as well go ahead and write
cholesterol now remember that I told you
guys about cholesterol earlier on but
the job of it in a cell membrane is to
make the membrane more stable and
another cool feature that it has is
whenever your cell gets really cold in
your body gets really cold the
cholesterol prevents it from freezing or
otherwise if you didn't have cholesterol
whenever it was really cold outside your
cells would freeze and solidify and turn
rock-hard but thanks to cholesterol it
prevents that so whenever your body
temperature is really low cholesterol
does in fact come in handy so again the
doctor said that's really bad but it's
really you know useful in some cases so
the last thing that I want to talk to
you guys about is let me pick a color
that I haven't used haven't used yellow
yet is the carbohydrate chains now the
carbohydrate chains are outside your
membrane and I guess I can just draw
these like this I don't know triangles
obviously they aren't really triangles
in your body but there are these chains
that are outside the membrane but still
part of the membrane technically so the
carbohydrate chains let me just go ahead
and label these carbohydrate chains they
do serve a purpose other than to look
good and their purpose is to identify
the blood orgs identify the cell and
we'll talk more about that later on
but just remember right now that you do
have a carbohydrate chains and a fun
fact is that your blood type you know
how you have a B oh they actually depend
on which type of carbohydrate chains are
bonded to the membrane pretty cool but
just worry about that later on so for
now of course the main part of your cell
membrane is this phospholipid bilayer in
the phospholipid bilayer has heads and
tails each phospholipid the heads
attract water the tails repel water so
that's why you have two layers that are
arranged like this your proteins of
course they do a lot of different things
we'll talk about those later on
the next Oriole actually exactly what
they do but they float around your cell
membrane and do whatever we need them to
do cholesterol right here the job of
cholesterol is pretty much to make your
membrane more stable and also help it
from freezing whenever your body
temperature is too low in your
carbohydrate chains pretty much identify
your cell and also play a role in
depending which type of blood you have
in blood cells so that's pretty much a
really close zoomed up view on the
plasma membrane aka the cell membrane
hopefully you understand all you need to
understand about it for now and the next
Oriole like I said we're going to be
talking how particles in material
transport through the plasma membrane is
going to be awesome but for now thank
you guys for watching and I'm going to
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
