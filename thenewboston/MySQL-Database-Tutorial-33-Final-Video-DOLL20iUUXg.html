33rd and final video of MySQL now I know
there's something such as triggers
cursors stored procedures some things
that I didn't cover but a lot of these
technologies are not fully supported to
get in all versions of MySQL so what I'm
going to do is I decided not to teach
these other things until the technology
is fully developed and that MySQL in all
versions of them support these things
such as triggers cursor stored
procedures so on and so forth so for now
there you go that's your beginners
tutorial in MySQL database in
congratulations you made it to the end
and before I guys before I let you guys
go I want to tell you guys a couple of
things first of all whenever you want to
backup your database in PHP myadmin
go ahead and log in and click on the
database that you want them backup for
example mine is named YouTube so I'm
going to go ahead and click on that and
now all you have to do is hit this
export tab right here now you can go
ahead and choose custom if you don't
want to export all the tables or
something what the easiest way is just
to use quick selection quick export and
make sure you export it as SQL format
now when you go ahead and hit go what
it's going to do is it's going to save
the file for you now this is your SQL
fire file pretty much the file that you
have been importing for my file to use
an example it's basically the same type
of file so there you go there's your
backup if you ever lose your database or
something just create a new database for
a quick and import this file using the
import tab and you'll be good to go so
that is how easy it is to export and
import pretty much how to backup a
database using phpMyAdmin now I said
that that was the last thing but I
actually want to give you guys a few
more tips that are going to make your
database life a whole lot easier now the
first tip tip is whenever you create a
database and you're creating your tables
take the time to create your table
structure properly make sure you have
all the columns you need make sure you
name them properly and especially make
sure
take time to choose the right data type
in the right amount of memory for each
column it's going to save you guys a
whole lot of headache in the future now
the next step is make sure you never
retrieve more data than is necessary
this is probably the biggest mistake I
see beginners use for example they
pretty much use select all for pretty
much their only query and then they pick
out the pieces but this isn't good you
typically want to use select all
basically never unless it's absolutely
necessary again
never get more data than you absolutely
need and the last piece of advice is
full text is usually generally better
than like remember this full text
greater than like it's just faster and
it's cleaner and it's the technology is
just better in every way I can think of
so with those little pieces of
information I'll finally let you guys go
because I bet your brain is about to
explode from all this MySQL so go take a
break go do something else in again like
I said whenever these technologies are
fully supported I'm going to come back
and do either add more videos onto this
series or do an advanced tutorial series
on MySQL covering triggers cursors sort
procedures all that good stuff but for
now that's all you guys get so thank you
guys so much for watching this series
and if you have any further questions
just go to my forum tnb forum comm and
I'll answer for you there so again thank
you guys for watching don't forget
subscribe and don't forget to add me on
Google+ I'll see you later and thanks
