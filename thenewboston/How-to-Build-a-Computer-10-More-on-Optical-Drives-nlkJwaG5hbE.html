come across
is you're gonna come across a DVD Drive
and a DVD burner now this is very
important a DVD Drive only reads data a
DVD burner can read data and write it to
a see me so why wouldn't you get a
burner I have no idea okay
always get a burner again you want a DVD
burner Drive can only read burner can
read and write data what one do you want
come on get a burger alright now that
you got a DVD burner you need to
understand one little thing I touched on
it before but this time I'm going to
touch on that again you're gonna come
across when you're getting a burner
things that says DVD - are or DVD - RW
what - r means is right speed I don't
know why they meant that are because it
isn't like a write your right-hand side
you're writing on piece paper but this
is your read speed or how much data you
can put on the CD your rewrite speed
some DVDs you can have it work when
there's already data on the CV you can
write over it and do it again you're a
right speed you can do it once and some
DVDs once there's our data you can write
over again some you can so make sure you
just remember that your write speed are
if it says R on your DVD burner then it
means right it says RW then you can
rewrite CDs it doesn't really matter
since I don't really rewrite over a lot
of DVDs since they're like like five
cents each book just in case you wanted
to know and for a boat today we went
with the light on and that was the
brand-name DVD remember not a CD don't
ever buy a CD drive or burn you want a
DVD burner not just drive we got a DVD
burner
we went with the IBE interface and our
speed is 20 by 8 by 16 and these respect
the 24-hour right speed how much we can
give or how fast we can give data on the
cv8
is our rewrite speed if there's any data
on the CD or dvd I'm gonna rewrite it
and we went with 16 for our read speed
any data that's on the DVD we're gonna
take it out we're gonna read it at 16 so
now that I told you guys what I went
with my build today hopefully you picked
out a DVD drive for your build today and
once you didn't make sure to subscribe
to my channel watch this story on high
death and once you learn everything
there is to learn in this tutorial move
on to my next tutorial and I'll see you
there thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
