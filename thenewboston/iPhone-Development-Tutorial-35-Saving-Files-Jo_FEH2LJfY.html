data tutorial in the last tutorial we
pretty much about the show of our
program in this story we're going to be
building the meat of our program or at
least whatever we get through so oh that
was disgusting and it smells so shows
and meet I suddenly want to talk over
right now but anyways let's go ahead and
the path file as promised what this
method needs to do is return the path to
file inside are documents forward now
let me give you some background every
app has its own documents folder and you
can only access what's in your documents
folder you can't access the documents
folder in another app Steve Jobs was so
kind to do this for security purposes
give every app its own documents folder
and you're only allowed to read what's
in that so what we want to do is create
a file inside that folder and in this
file we want to be able to save data
read and write data to it so what we
need to do is in this method go ahead
and get a path of that folder and go
ahead and pretty much put a file in it
so in order to do that it's this NS
array create an array called pass and
then go ahead and call them it called NS
search for passenger Curie's domain and
ask documents directory there we go
guessing pretty good so far NS user nope
num domain there you go have faith in
the Xcode and yes so what this method
does is it returns you an array of
pretty much directories now you're just
going to have to trust me on this one
your documents directory is the first
object in this array just trust me in
this one all right I mean you really
don't need to know how this method works
on that's why it's built in it's kind of
like you know you don't need to know how
a microwave works in order to use a
microwave you just need to know how to
use it so you know just trust me on this
one NS string
documents folder documents folder looks
good looks good so as I said our
documents folder is pass that pass array
right here object at index zero so right
now we have a string that is to the
documents folder person all right well
the only want to shrink the file that's
inside that folder since that's if I
we're going to be working with well yes
we do so all you need to do is go ahead
and return documents folder string by
appending format and then whatever you
want to name your file my file dot P
list and make sure it's p list and I
know I didn't talk to you guys about
properties list but you know I have
anything to say after I just didn't talk
to you guys about I'm sorry and so this
pretty much what this method is doing is
it's returning you a path to this file
right here in this plist file this
property list file is where we're going
to be doing all of our saving and
writing and everything like that so
that's how that works so now we need to
throw the meat for this application will
terminate and what this method is is
this is the method that's going to get
called whenever your application is
about to quit so whenever someone
presses the home button and you quit it
this is the code that's going to be run
first in art what do we want to do in
this method before I begin what we want
to do is we want to take the text out of
the text field and save it to a file so
you know we could use it later so let's
go ahead and do this NS mutable array go
ahead and create an array cauldron all
right pretty cool huh and then go ahead
and there we go NS beautiful array
allocate some space initialize it so
pretty much we have a blank array right
here not a blanket array so now we want
to add some to it add object let's go
ahead and add the text from that text
field so now we have an array with that
text field is it only object in that
array so we're saying all right now we
have to somehow take this array and
write it to a file oh this is going to
be confusing probably some real long
method oh no my friend check this out
array right to file and then you put
what file do you want to write it to oh
man now I got to get that oh wait a
minute we want to write it to self path
of file wow this is incredibly easy we
already have a method to the file we
want to write it to and we just have to
call that method see you guys thought I
was just doing this for fun randomly
because I'm drunk but I'm not and now
just go ahead and put yes and we're good
to go I mean we should go ahead and
array release because don't forget
anything allocate you need to release so
that is all there is to saving your data
so now whenever this application closes
any time the user hits the home button
it's going to take the text out of field
one and it's going to save it to a file
verse saying all right so when your
application opens then how does it know
to get that information well it doesn't
yet we didn't build that code yet but
this is all there is to saving data now
in order to read that data on startup
and use it again I mean we're going to
have to build some more methods and
that's exactly what we're going to be
doing in the next tutorial but for now
check this out you just learned how to
save data I mean that's pretty cool you
pat yourself on the back so uh yeah I'm
going to pound some more beers and I'm
going to meet you guys in the next story
of st. Bucky
what if I can't wait to next to her what
am I supposed to do the vent well I got
a nice app in the link below that you
can go ahead and download if you want I
made it first step ever so uh yeah
thanks for watching check out my app
please I'm begging you I my knees
begging it and yeah and next sauriol
we're gonna learn how to actually take
the data that we saved rip it from the
file and actually use it in our program
so I think you for watching don't forget
subscribe and I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
