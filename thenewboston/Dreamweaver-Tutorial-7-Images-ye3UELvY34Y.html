dreamweaver tutorial and then this story
i'm going to be talking about images how
to enter images on your web page and
what you can do with them now the first
thing that you can insert on your web
page is something called an image
placeholder now say you have some text
on your webpage and you know that you
want to put an image there but you don't
quite know what image you want to put
yet you would insert something called an
image placeholder and all this does is
take the place of an image so it allows
you to see what your web page would look
like when you did insert it image on it
and to do this go upside image I mean
insert click image objects an image
placeholder you can then specify the
name of whatever your future image is
going to be in the width and the height
and all these attributes then click OK
and as you can see a little box pops up
yet you can resize and it allows you to
give you an idea of if you had an image
on your web page what it would actually
look like I'm going to go ahead and
delete all that and i'm going to show
you guys how to add an actual image now
there are two different ways that you
can do this you can go up on your insert
bar comment
in this a little symbol right here when
you highlight it says images you can do
it that way or you can go to insert
image then all you have to do is
navigate to whatever image you want
right here I have one on my desktop and
just double click it and one thing to
note when you're working with images on
the web make sure that you use JPEG
unless you know that you want to use
something else but in general make sure
they're jpg and another thing to note
when this box pop up pops up you can
just click OK every time ignore it but
it's a really useful to add some
alternate text this will help other
websites find your image and also help
search engines find what your website is
about and help you get more popular on
your website this is because search
engines don't know what images are so if
you add alternative text just a brief
description of your image it will tell
the search engine what it is and it
won't show up on your website at all so
adding a brief description of your image
right here can only help you it can't
hurt you at all then click OK and as you
can see I have a picture of my friend
making out with some chick at a party
here so that's how you insert a basic
image on your webpage and another thing
that you can take know of is these black
little squares around your image as you
can see these are for resizing your
image to make it bigger or smaller
and you can also reposition the height
or the width but one thing you want to
take know of and this is probably the
most important thing that I can teach on
images you do not ever want to use the
resizing things why because when you're
making a website and you resize your
image this way then it takes about 10
times as long for the image to load not
actually 10 times but it takes a lot
longer what you want to do is get is
edit your image size in the actual
program such as Photoshop or Microsoft
Paint if you use in it and then once you
have the image size just upload it
whatever size you want this will save
your website a ton of loading time and
another thing that you want to do the
last thing I'm going to go over and now
is go down the border right here and
make sure it equals 0 sometimes when you
insert images in Photoshop they'll give
you a default background of 1 or 0 point
5 so make sure this is equal to 0 if you
don't want a border so that's all the
time we have for right now in the next
tutorial I'm going to be teaching you
how to add a background image and a roll
over image to your website thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
