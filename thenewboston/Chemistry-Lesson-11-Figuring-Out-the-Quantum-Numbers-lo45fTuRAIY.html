quantum numbers are and how we can
calculate them let's go ahead and figure
out the quantum numbers for the first
two energy levels
we'll start with energy level one why
not it's a smallest energy level the one
closest to the nucleus so at energy
level one we need to figure out how many
different shapes we can have well in
order to do that we get a range of
values 0 to n minus 1 so we always have
zero because it says we can and now we
need to figure out n minus 1 so if we
took a took a look at the end value
which is 1 and subtracted 1 from it it
would be 0 so 0 to 0 is 0 basically we
can only have one shape at the first
energy level now for the notation what
you basically do is you write the N
value and then the L value however you
write the N value and the L value has a
corresponding letter to go along with it
and for 0 its S which basically means
spherical now if you don't know what
letters I'm talking about go ahead and
watch my story I think it's like
tutorials ago I talked about the L value
and how it can I pretty much explain it
so now at this energy level we need to
figure out how many different ways we
can tilt this shape now the different
tilts are based on the shape itself in
the ranges negative L to positive L so
if we look at L it's zero so negative
zero it's a positive zero well that's
just zero so go ahead and write zero
right here what this is basically saying
is ok you can only tilt this it's
basically stuck in the same orientation
forever you can't tilt a sphere or ball
in different directions and for this
electron spin this is an easy one it's
always going to be negative 1/2 or
positive 1/2 basically saying in this
energy level or this shape right here we
can have two electrons one can be
spending counterclockwise and one can be
spending clockwise so that's basically
what we're saying in the first energy
level it can only have one shape here's
the name of it
you can't tote it at all it's stuck in
the same place forever and it can have
two electrons one going counterclockwise
and one going clockwise simple enough so
now let's go ahead and get a little more
complex and figure out the quantum
numbers for the second energy level this
one's a whole lot more fun so at the
second energy level we need to figure
out the different possible shapes it can
have so we go ahead and we always have
zero so that's one shape and then
spherical and then we figure out okay we
get the range of n minus 1 so 2 minus 1
is 1 so we have 0 to 1 so that's our
range of values so now we go ahead and
write the notation which is remember the
end value and then the L value so for
this one it's 2's and for this one the
end value is still 2 and the 1 is P so
this pretty much means a bigger sphere
and a big in P the P shape looks like
two balloons pressed together so now we
need to go ahead and figure out for each
sub shell how many ways can we tilt that
shape so negative L it's a positive L
the L value for this is zero so again
zero two zero is just zero in that is
because you can't tilt a sphere in
different ways no matter which way you
tilt it it's always a perfect ball
basically now for this one 2p looks like
two balloons pressed together so how
many different ways can we tilt this
well negative L it's a positive L we
have negative 1 0 &amp;amp; 1 I won't write
positive 1 so basically in the 2p
sub-shell
we can tilt that shape in three
different ways so for this one again the
electron spin we have negative 1/2 and
positive 1/2 for the 2 s orbital or 2 s
subshell and for 2p each of these can
hold two electrons so 1/2
positive 1/2 negative 1/2
positive 1/2 negative 1/2 and positive
1/2 so if we take a look here's what
we're basically saying in the first
energy level we can only have one shape
now in that shape we can have an
electron spinning clockwise and counter
clockwise so we can have two electrons
in the first energy level and if you
remember that's what Bohr agreed with in
Bohr's model he said the exact same
thing the first energy level can hold
two electrons this is just a more
sophisticated model so first energy
level taken care of now in the second
energy level we can have basically two
different shapes we can have a sphere
and two balloons press together now in
the second energy level we can also have
eight electrons one two three four five
six seven eight
so the first energy level can hold two
and the second energy level can hold
eight electrons
pretty cool huh and remember that's what
Bohr said the first energy level can
hold two the second one can hold eight
and that's true this is just a more
sophisticated way of figuring that stuff
out so for the third energy level I'm
going to leave that up to you guys the
first person to comment and figure out
here's the question of the day here's
your homework assignment how many
electrons can you have in the third
energy level and once you figure that
out leave a comment below and the first
person to get the right answer wins I
don't know what I like I'll say
congratulations you see there's
something stupid and ridiculous so
anyways thank you guys for watching
hopefully you figure out now how to
figure out the quantum numbers and
hopefully what they mean and in the next
couple of tutorials I'm going to be
making this even more simple until the
picture is crystal clear in your head so
now that you know how to figure them out
go do your homework
first person to come up with the answer
wins so thank you guys and I will see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
