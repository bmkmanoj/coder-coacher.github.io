video tutorial for the new boston in the
last tutorial we looked at the jquery
focus in event handler to create a field
on our page well to activate this div
when a field in our page is clicked so
every time we click on a field or focus
into a field using tab we have this div
displayed and we noted the difference
between this and click and also why
click shouldn't really be used in this
case now in this part of the tutorial
we're going to look at focus out and
we're going to take the lazy probably
incorrect way to do things well yes the
incorrect way to do things
however this is just going to
demonstrate the focus out event handler
so with my focus in with my name and my
focus in with my age the two fields that
I currently have on the page these both
have functioned to them that allow us to
display this text in a div or in a span
rather when the field comes into focus
I'm going to copy and paste these just
underneath and I'm going to change focus
in to focus out and the same with this
one
focus in to focus out so now we have
four of in handlers for each name let's
just rearrange these to make them a bit
easier to talk about we have the focus
in for name when we focus in on name it
says enter your full name now when we
focus out we want the span to have no
text in it at all or you might want to
perform some kind of validation
procedure here for example validate and
then in here you could specify the field
you want to validate so there's a
variety of options you can choose and
depending on what you're doing with this
you can change it to suit what you need
to do so again for age we have focus in
which creates the text inside the span
using the HTML function enter your
current age with the focus out we also
want this
to be blank so let's go to our page and
see how this works when I click on the
first field it says enter your full name
as we've seen in the previous part of
the tutorial now when I focus out you
can see that this disappears so when I
click on the net when I click on your
name and I tab down to your age these
valid this value disappears and this
value is back again if we were to use
Shift + tab to go back up you can see
that the same happens again so despite
the fact that we've already spoken about
the click this now really demonstrates
how actually useful it is so as I've
said before this was just to demonstrate
the event handler however there are
better ways to do this then actually
copying the event handlers down your
page so probably a good idea to look
into this to avoid duplicating code
unnecessarily</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
