twenty-fifth c-sharp tutorial that I'm
making for the new Boston and in this
tutorial I'm going to be showing you how
to have multiple callers and your linear
gradient brush so for this tutorial that
you need to have a panel and then when
the user clicks on your panel you're
just going to want to have a new linear
gradient brush be created and the colors
in here really don't matter
we're gonna be changing those and you
just don't want to have new graphics be
created for your panels so that we have
some place to draw alright so the first
thing that we're gonna want to do is
create a new color blend so it's nice
tight right here color blend I'll call
it Stevie and scent equal to my new
colored one and inside of this color
button one class is where we're going to
be storing all the colors that we're
going to be using in our linear gradient
brush and the positions that those
colors will be in the actual great name
so the first thing that we're going to
want to do is set the colors that we're
going to be using so we're just move the
colors property and we have to set that
equal to a color array so we're going to
create a new color area right here and
I'm gonna be using three colors I'll
just use black white alright so now I
have my three colors and you can have as
many as you want I'm just gonna have
three and the next thing that we have to
do is set the position that our colors
will be in the actual gradient so if the
whole gradient has a value of one we're
gonna have to tell the c-sharp compiler
where we want those colors in the
gradient so we're gonna do CB when you
the positions property and this has to
be set equal to 8 load eraser is a
floater right here and instead of our
float array and where we positions that
these colors will be and the positions
that this colors will be at will be the
center of the color so we want the
center of black to be at the very
beginning so it'll put zero down for
blue we just want it to be in the middle
so we're gonna say 0.5
and in order to convert it into a float
we're just going to put a path after it
and then we want the middle of white to
be one so let's go on and with the F
vector if you convert it into a float
alright so if you want all the color
gradients or all the colors in your
gradient that be the same length then
basically what you're going to want to
do is just make it so the difference
between the first and then the number
after that is the same so from to get to
here to here is 25 and then to get from
here to here is 0.5 so say we wanted to
have four colors well we'd make it zero
and then 0.33 or a third so it's a third
to get from that to that and so on but
we'll do that after we get down these
three colors so now that we have our
color blend all set up now we're gonna
have to actually attach our color blend
to our linear gradient brush so in order
to do that we're gonna say LGB moves
interpolation colors and we're going to
set that equal to our colored ones so
this equals C D or whatever you call
your color blind and now that we have
our linear gradient brush all set up we
can now draw something with our garage
so we're just gonna draw a new rectangle
you can draw anything I'm going through
our rectangle and we're going to put our
brush that we use so linear gradient
rock and then the positions for our
rectangle so I'm going to put 20 20 and
50 because that's the position of our
gradient alright so now I need to bug
here and click we should see every
square actually being created with the
colors black blue and white in it so it
should start with black then go down to
blue and finish with white yeah perfect
alright so now I'll show you how to do
with four colors so let's say we just
wanted to have it go let's say after
believe it goes like sky do so instead
of the sky blue now well now this isn't
gonna work not only will that work
because we don't have enough numbers but
the values aren't correct unless you
just want to have like black be like 50%
of it or something but we don't want
that so we're just
always start at zero here and then we're
gonna have it be one three three for a
third and then claim six six four two
thirds and then one and you're always
going to want to end on one so like I
said before you're just going to want to
have the difference between two numbers
inside of this array be the same if you
want the values or the size of each
color and your gradient to be the same
so since we want it to be since we want
the length of black and blue and sky
blue and white to all be the same we're
just going to have the difference
between these e to be the same so to get
from zero to a third it's a third get
from 1/3 2/3 to the third and to get
from 2/3 - 1 it's a bird so just
remember that cooking an easy way to
figure out what values you need or how
many colors you have all right so now
maybe bug here we should see there are
now more colors in our gradient you
should go from black to blue the sky
blue little white and they should all be
the same one yep pretty much
so that's it for this tutorial on using
multiple colors and your linear gradient
brush so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
