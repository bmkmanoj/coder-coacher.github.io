with a video tutorial for the new Boston
in this tutorial we're going to be
looking at the fade in function in
jQuery which allows us to fade a
particular element of our choice in our
webpage so the first thing I'm gonna do
is I'm going to use the example of an
image so I have an image saved in this
directory let's just take a look at that
and it's Tartan jpg so I'm going to
include this into my page so Tartan jpg
give it an alt attribute which would be
tartan and we also need to give this an
ID so I'm going to give this an ID and
just call it image so this is what we
reference to when we need to fade this
in or in the next part of the tutorial
or fade this out so now that we've got
our image let's open up our browser and
preview it you can see that it's just an
image on a page plane okay so now what
we want to do is we want to include the
functionality to fade this in when our
page actually loads so I've included
effects j/s which is going to allow me
to do this and obviously I have jQuery
Jes included as well so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to allow the image to
fade in once the document has loaded so
we need to reference the document which
is document in parenthesis obviously
with the leading dollar sign and then we
use the ready function and inside of
this we create a function with a block
and inside here we can write exactly
what we want to happen so what we want
to do is we want to take this image
element which we've named image this ID
that with this image page element that
we've named image sorry then what we
want to do is we want to use jQuery to
fade it in from here being not visible
when the page loads so what we can do is
we can say dollar and we need to
reference this image
and then we can say dot fade in now
let's go to our browser and preview this
so you can see that it fades in as soon
as we load the page now there are some
additional parameters that we can give
this function in order to change how it
works and the first one is the speed now
we can name this ourselves so sorry we
could say slow or we could say fast for
example or we can give it a numerical
representation so we might have a
thousand that's one seconds because
we're using milliseconds or you could
say something like five thousand which
would represent five seconds let's go
ahead and say two seconds for now and
you'll see that the speed in which it
loads in which the animation takes place
will be a lot slower let's go and give
it the example of slow so you can see
that it's loaded in a lot or faded back
in a lot slower than if we were to use
fast for example that's a very quick
fade in we also have the optional
parameter of how it works now by default
this is swing this is just the way the
animation takes place and and from it
being not visible to visible we could go
ahead and use linear when we refresh it
just works in a slightly different way
it's quite hard to see how it works but
for now that's that's an option now the
last is a callback function so what we
can actually do is we can use a function
to again display when this animation has
faded in so we could say function create
a block and just bring this down and
inside of here once this animation is
complete and completely faded in what we
could do is we could say perhaps append
some text to a div or a span so I'm
going to create a div just here
and I'm going to call this image
underscore feedback and inside effect I
want to reference this again so image
underscore feedback and I want to append
some text onto it or create some text
inside this div and I'm just gonna say
effect complete so now what's going to
happen is however however slow or fast
we have this once the animation is
finished finished we have this callback
function to let us know so when I press
f5 you can see or let's just change the
visibility of this inside let's just say
style equals display:none so I'm using
inline CSS just to style this so we
can't see it initially when i refresh
you can see that as we fade in we don't
have this effect complete text there
until the animation is complete so the
callback function could be used to
perhaps load an image and then display
additional images so that's an option or
that's a usage of it again if we just if
we load it in say in two seconds
this will take slightly longer and then
it will display our effect complete
message there so this doesn't have to be
used with images it can be used with any
other HTML element so you just do
exactly the same thing you would use fit
the fade in function but this time
reference something different for
example if the ID was for example a form
or a text a text input field you could
actually fade these in it as well but I
think images is a nice example to use
with fade in when you're looking at
effects in jQuery</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
