and I'm back now with another video for
the new Buster this time we're going to
be talking about databases now in this
video I'm not going to teach you how to
set up a database how to write data to
etc etc but we're just going to talk
about wire database is important in most
real life application situations
I'm also going to be talking about a bit
about the MySQL database now this is
also called my sequel you may hear
people call it my sequel but for the
duration of these tutorials I'm going to
be calling a MySQL okay so why do we
need to use a database now you may have
come across databases before in the
format of say Excel not exhale sorry
access another database applications
where you can store values with specific
column names and you can store these
values as a row I mean you can do that
in Excel as well but okay so let's just
get rid of these PHP tags and I'll take
you through why we might want to store
data in a database now if you've already
looked at file handling you'll know that
we've stored things we may have stored
things like hit counter value in a file
and then what we've done is we've opened
the file up we've read the value in
we've closed the file we may have then
opened the value of the file up again to
rewrite another value now this puts a
huge amount of strain and complication
as well on the whole process now let's
say we wanted to write a value to a to a
file what we're doing is we're opening
up that file so a reading file data we
are then writing a value to a file what
happens if we want say to include a
username a password a first name a
surname
and other data let's just say website so
you may have hundreds and hundreds of
records with people that username their
password you may want to create some
kind of login system for this now you're
not going to do very well if you're
using files to store this data you can
by all means use files to store this
data however it's a lot more secure and
it's also a lot quicker to use a
database and in this case we're going to
be using MySQL because it is one of the
fastest databases available to use
now MySQL is hosted on a server so it
will have it will have its own port
number if we open up the xampp control
panel you can see that I've got this
process MySQL and it's running at the
moment and I think it runs on by default
so a look can't see let's stop it in and
restart it so it's running on port 3306
now from PHP you don't need to worry
about this too much you don't need to
worry about accessing it you know as a
server but we do use some functions to
connect to our database and then we
still connect to our server and then we
use another function to connect to the
database itself so you can have a
variety amount of debt a variety of
databases within MySQL and then you can
have a variety of tables inside them
databases now a database would be say
users so this is my users database here
I've got user name so I'm going to set
Alex password I'm going to put pass one
two three first name is Alex surname is
Garret and website PHP academy' two org
so I've already put one record in for
myself now this could this table we're
looking at here this is going to be a
table could contain other data so you
could say Billy again the password might
be past four five six Billy Garret and
we might not have a website so we're
storing essentially data this way
I now the way we can access is access
this is we can select our table what we
can then do yes so this is our table our
database name we'll just say table users
a database name might be called PHP
academy' for example and our table might
be called users so now what we can do is
let's say we've stored you know we're
storing users we can do this on the fly
but what we can do now is we can select
different values so I can execute
something called a query which will
select a specific amount of data from a
specific row now usually you'd have an
ID field on the start of a row and this
this is this will be created something
called auto increment so you know
incrementation is it just increments
every time so for each record created
it's automatically increments and this
adds to the unique property of it and we
can define a primary key for this ID and
the primary key is just the unique field
or the new unique column name in your
database</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
