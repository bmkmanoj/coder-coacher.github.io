illustration cs6 tutorial and in this
tutorial i'm gonna show you a bunch of
more tips on how to work with your paths
we're gonna use stuff like the reshape
tool and we're going to use the eraser
tool and the pencil tool and a bunch of
other tools to modify our paths and make
them and do some more useful things so
the first thing I want to show you is
the reshape tool and that's down here
what it's going to be under where the
scale tool is go ahead and make a shape
and use your direct selection tool to
select some of the paths and go ahead
and select two points you can select one
point as well if you want to and select
your reshape tool and you're able to
manipulate these edges here like that
and make different types and reshape
your paths there actually now if I just
select one I'm going to do a lot of
switching back between my selection
tools and my other tools so it's a good
idea for you to start using your hotkeys
the direct selection tool is a I'm just
gonna click every time so you guys can
see what I'm doing you don't get lost
right now I just have one anchor point
selected now when I go to move this you
can see the left anchor point stays but
the right one moves so that's really all
there is to using the shape tool the
next thing that I wanted to show you
guys what's the eraser tool and show you
how that works I want to create an
eyeball for this pac-man here that I
made I don't know it's not the best
looking pac-man in the world but it's
it's my pac-man so I'll appreciate it
all you need to do is select your eraser
tool and you can use the bracket keys on
your keyboard to make the circle bigger
or smaller and then go ahead and click
crap you gotta have the selection tool
there you got to have your path selected
you always got to have your path
selected when you're doing these things
click
then it cuts out a hole in your path and
now these paths are actually combined
now they're all one let go to take my
direct selection tool and select the
outside path here and move it you can
see the circle is going to move with it
I just select the circle try to move it
it's going to move along with the path
as well and if you look in the layers
panel you can see that it's a path now
it's going to be a compound path so
that's what we got there now what if I
want to create a path free handedly I
don't want to use the pen tool well you
can use the pencil tool click on it make
sure that there's a stroke here so we
can see what you're doing and go ahead
and draw I'm going to draw this circle
shape and you can see that it's not the
greatest-looking shape ever but there is
a path and there are anchor points so
what I'm gonna need to do is go ahead
and delete one of my path anchor points
and you can see that didn't work too
well to try to move these together use
my direct selection tool here try to
move some of my points I'm gonna zoom in
we can see what we're doing a little bit
easier all right there where I go and
now I have two paths together
it's a 1 anchor point and it looks like
crap so I'm gonna use what's called the
smooth tool and that's underneath the
pencil tool and I can actually go along
parts of my object here and smooth them
out
I go around like this this should smooth
it out and it's smoothing out parts of
my object now
the tool doesn't always work the best
let me go back and redo that so I can
get it back together it's it's it kind
of it's a little unpredictable
double-click on it and you've got some
options you got a smoothness the higher
the smoothness the more smooth it's
gonna make the path and fidelity is how
far you get a draw to actually get your
smoothness so I'm gonna put this I'm
gonna hit reset and get these back to
the default options and hit OK now I'm
gonna try to use the tool hopefully it
works a little better than it did before
there we go we're starting to get
somewhere another way to make the points
smoother if you got a point like this
that's being stubborn
go to your convert Anchor Point tool
click and then go ahead and click again
see it's these points oh yeah the points
were never combined that's why but these
will go to edit our object path join now
they're joined ok try to move these out
so they look a little bit alike and now
let's try our smooth tool again now
we're getting somewhere
and we're and I'm starting to smooth
these out and you can see how this works
it's gonna just try to smooth out your
shape and it's not going to be perfect
so you're gonna have to use your direct
selection tool or any of your other
point manipulation tools kind of smooth
this out make it look a little better to
get what you want you might have to go
in and start deleting points deleting
anchor points I want the hopefully this
doesn't delete it right out ooh there we
go start to leading anchor points so
that way you can get a smoother shape
when you have too many anchor points
like I have to right next to each other
here it creates a problem and starts
making things more getting things too I
don't know how to say it makes things a
lot more jaggedy the last thing I wanted
to show you is with the eraser tool
again I'm gonna show you when you go
ahead and try to erase something around
the edges here I'm gonna so I'm gonna
erase this I could I have it selected
and now let's try to erase it
you see it's gonna create a new path and
have the path conform to what you tried
to erase and the more jaggedy erase the
more points you're going to have to make
to compensate for that so that's the
last thing I just wanted to show you
remember that using the bracket keys
makes your erase your tool is smaller or
bigger and that's all I got to show you
so thanks a lot for watching this one
everybody have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
