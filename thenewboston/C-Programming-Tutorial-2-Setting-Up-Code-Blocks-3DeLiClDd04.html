downloading so you can either double
click this or if you're not using Chrome
what you should be then just go to your
downloads folder or mine is in Bucky
we're yet downloads downloads and this
is the piece of software that we just
download the file that we just
downloaded should I say so double click
this and it's choose yes it's pretty
much gonna take you through a wizard
very simple stuff just click Next
I agree let me just read this but a
little bit yep read all that agree we
can just select the defaults for
anything and install holy crap that is
fast
alright so this bad boy is installing
and once it's ready and actually puts
all my icon on your desktop which is
actually really handy by default
yes I do so this bad boy opens up and it
might take a while if you're starting it
for the first time to boot up and the
first thing I actually want to do is
minimize that and well I can click Next
finish out of that and I want to make um
a folder on my desktop so new folder and
this is where I'm gonna be putting all
of my project files so I'm gonna put C
underscore tutorials and also I want to
mention this um make sure that you just
don't make a folder called C because
that is the name of your hard drive so
if you try to make another folder called
C then it's gonna get confused so again
anyways just don't name it C you know
it's probably self-explanatory but heads
up just in case you forgot so once you
got that taken care of
open up your IDE again and okay kind of
overwhelming so I want to show you guys
how to get started what we need to do is
we need to create a new project so you
can either click this button right here
or you can just go to file new project
whatever you feel like
and of course we have a bunch of options
and what we want to select is this right
here console application this is
basically just a simple program for your
desktop it's not like for phone it
doesn't have any weird settings or
anything like that so console
application and hit go and it says ok a
little alert whatever and it says what
programming language to use basically
this piece of software can use two
different languages C++ is like well
it's we're not learning it so just go
ahead and pick C because well that's
what this tutorial series is about click
Next and it says okay the first thing is
give a title to your project and I'm
just gonna name mine uh actually I'm
probably going to be using this one for
a while so I'll just name it
Bucky's um program something stupid
probably the stupidest thing you can
think of and as you can see the other
stuff automatically fills in as well the
project file name and the resulting file
name and pretty much saying where do you
want to save this and of course I want
to save it in the folder that I just
created click OK and click Next all of
this stuff is good by default basically
asking what compiler do you use but
whenever you download it everything is
set up perfectly so don't mess with any
of this stuff just click finish and
blank screen we must have messed
something up well actually if you go to
your left you're gonna be able to see
all your projects right here so this is
the name of the project that we just
created
Bucky's program or whatever you named
ears and all of the files that we have
right now are in this sources folder so
if we click that little plus sign we're
gonna see that it automatically created
one file for us called main dot C so go
ahead and double click this and it's
going to open up right here so pretty
much all of your files are gonna be on
the left hand side this right here is
pretty much your text editor like
notepad and up here are a bunch of
settings that I'm not gonna like explain
everyone right now because it would
like the most boring video ever so I'm
just gonna be explaining them as we need
them so basically um the first thing
that we see is we get all of this by
default and this is actually a very
simple program now I know you guys don't
know what any of this means right now
but I do want to show you guys how to
run the program whenever you're ready so
we can actually run this right now by
clicking this little button it's called
a build and run and it takes actually a
couple of steps to run your program the
first one is to compile it or build it
pretty much take all of this code the
words that we understand in the
translation translates it to once and
zeros now once you have that program or
that file that the computer can run you
can click run or you're just gonna be
clicking this and it does it all in one
shebang so click this it builds it
converts it and runs it and the final
result result of this program it just
prints out hello world on the screen so
again I know you guys don't know what
all these words mean and while we're
using all these symbols but I just want
to show you guys how to get up and
started right now and in the next
tutorials I'm gonna be explaining what
all this crap is and how we can um well
start making programs and actually
before I let you guys go the last thing
I want to mention is in these tutorials
I'm gonna be typing a whole bunch of
source code and if you guys just want to
like sit back and watch it swirls and
then get the source code later on I'm
gonna be posting all of the source code
on my website so if you go to my website
Bucky's room org and if you click forum
then in the c-section c-section get it
anyways if you just click that right
there
then of course my source code isn't
posted right now because I'm I haven't
typed anything yeah I'm just making the
videos now but all of the source code is
gonna be right here just click on it
it'll be like source code for the
tutorial number 4 click it you can just
copy the code and boom I'll give it to
you guys for free so thank you guys for
watching and well I'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
