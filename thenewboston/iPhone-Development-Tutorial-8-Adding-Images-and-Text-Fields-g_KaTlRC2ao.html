your eighth iphone development tutorial
and you know how I said like in the last
tutorial that we're done coding for now
well I actually lied I forgot one little
semicolon in my interface right after
password so go ahead and add that
because if you don't you're going to get
air so once you're done adding your
semicolon I know it was a lot of code
you can take a break now go ahead up to
your build and go ahead and select the
build and this is pretty much going to
build your files check for errors and
also save them for you so now once you
build them hopefully you don't got any
errors and yeah it looks like we're good
to go so now the next step in this
process is to open the interface builder
and add all those objects on the screen
since we now built the outlets so go
ahead and expand your resource resources
folder and go click whatever your
project name is view controller XIB and
this of course is going to open your nib
file and now let me just go ahead and
rearrange your thing real quick move
this up a little bit just a little bit
and yeah it looks like we're good to go
so the first thing we want to do is go
ahead and add that image on the screen
and in order to do this make sure you
have your library open and go down and
click this little button right here this
is the image view allows you to add
images pretty easy so go ahead and drag
this on your screen and as you can see
it automatically expands what we want to
do just go ahead and shrink that to the
approximate size of our image the actual
size doesn't really matter so you know
that's approximately where it's going to
go and I'll show you guys why I don't
have to do it exact in a little bit but
now with this still selected what we
want to do is in the image attributes
aka the inspector go over to this
drop-down for image and this is what
image do you want to use well it's going
to give you all of your resources images
that you have since we only have one
pretty self-explanatory Bucky pick ping
that's my main banner so now you can see
with that we loaded that picture but it
doesn't exactly fit in
it may be cutting off or the box may be
too big in order to get this image for
you to exactly fit the exact same size
is your picture what you need to do with
this image view still selected is go up
to layout and size to fit that way your
image view automatically scales to the
size of your picture check this out
pretty sweet huh so the only other thing
we want to select in here is one more
drawing option I mean all of these are
pretty self-explanatory I don't want to
take the time and go through them all
because we got stuff to do but make sure
underdrawing you click opaque now what
this means is it's pretty much not
transparent at all um it's just pretty
much whenever you click opaque it means
it's not transparent and it helps speed
up the drawing whenever you're running
your application so aside from this
awesome picture right here remember we
have two labels on the left and two
empty text boxes on the right so what we
can do is we can go ahead and add our
text fields and you do that by clicking
text field dragging it over and go ahead
and add one right there and remember we
added 14 name 14 password and now let's
go ahead and add those labels add the
label double-click it put name and also
add another label called password for
our super-secret login box now what you
usually want to do is you know expand
that that looks pretty good and go ahead
and expand that so that fits as well so
aside from adding these labels we excuse
me these text boxes we actually want to
mess with the attributes a little bit so
go ahead and select your top text field
and now scroll over to your text field
attributes your inspector so the first
thing we want to do is remember by
default we had some text that popped up
in the text field and this is pretty
much the default text
over in your text field attributes this
was the text in the placeholder so go
ahead and add a little prompting place
or bed type username so aside from
giving them one prompt what we want to
do is whenever they click in here the
keyboard is going to pop up
automatically and by default the
keyboard is going to have a button that
says return on it well we want to change
that to done so under your text input
traits keyboard go ahead and check oh
wait a minute text input traits return
key that's why I'm clicking go ahead and
click done make sure don't click
emergency call or really really bad
things are going to happen when you try
to run this so go ahead and click done
under your return key and that changes
the return key on your keyboard to a
done button so that's all we need to do
for this field so aside from that what
we need to do is select this password
texture and remember this one was a
little bit different for the placeholder
go ahead and type in enter password
because that's what you want to do and
aside from this under the keyboard type
by default it has a bunch of numbers and
letters on it but I mean this is our
secret bank code we only want to be able
to enter number so go ahead and give
them a number pad only this will give my
keyboard with no letters on it only
numbers and also we don't need a return
key because this number pad doesn't even
have a return key but what we do need to
check is secure this secure is whenever
you type in a number it's going to give
you that little circle instead of
showing the number because you know we
don't want our friends this year super
seeker password so you know that's all
we have to do as far as putting the
objects on the screen now from here what
we need to do is add the outlets to each
corresponding object so again if you
forgot how to do this in your files
owner go ahead and ctrl and drag and
once your highlighted over the
corresponding object release and the
outlet for this one is named and then
whenever we use name in our coding it
references is it references is
references references is this object now
go ahead and ctrl and drag to password
and let go and use choose that outlet
password and now whenever we use the
password variable in our code it
references is this object references
references river references so anyways
go ahead and file save your nib file and
now in our Xcode we can go ahead and
build this run it and see what we get so
go ahead and if you go ahead and click
username type in your username mine is
Bucky and now go ahead and password and
see here's the default um what was it
called placeholder entered password and
don't look at my password 12345 will
never guess that so now we are done
that's what you need to do but check
this out alright I'm done enter my
username password so how do I actually
get out of this so maybe even click done
now the keyboard isn't popping down so
what the heck out of heck did I get out
of here well actually in order to make
the keyboard pop back down what we need
to do is we edit need to edit a little
bit more of code so that's what I'm
going to be showing you in the next
tutorial I mean we already basically
built ninety percent of our tutorial
just need be editing a little bit more
of code to make things a little bit
smoother so that's that for this story
in the next tutorial we're going to be
making awesome I mean we made it good
but we need to make it great so that's
what we have to look forward to and yeah
if you have any questions guys feel free
to click on the link below in my forum
and ask me any question you want and
I'll feel free to answer for you guys so
also get the code there so anyways
enough of me rambling check out my next
tutorial and don't forget subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
