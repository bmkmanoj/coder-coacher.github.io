android tutorial we're going to learn
how to delete an entry so what I want
you guys to do is go into the SQL Lite
example and we're going to go into our
delete button again we're just going to
copy which row we want to delete so
we're going to copy that string row
which is going to be from our edit text
row and then also are converting it into
a let's just copy that and paste it
there and then what we're going to do
again we're just going to create a new
hot-or-not object so copy that paste
that maybe change these variable names
to 1 1 1 who knows something like that
alright so then we just have our X dot
open not the new X dot delete entry and
we're going to delete the entry
according to which row we want to delete
so we're going to say L row 1 and then
e^x x 1 dot close all right so just
change all those the X 1 for the most
part and then we just have to you know
create this method within our hot-or-not
class so now we're going to switch over
to a hot or not class where this method
has been created and all we're going to
do is delete our entry now so what we're
going to do is just say our database and
again we've learned about update entry
and all that good stuff this time we're
going to learn about the delete method
so again now it's just going to be our
table name which ID we want to Pat our
which row ID we want to have so again
we're just going to say row ID equals or
plus equals plus again and then whatever
we're passing in so L row 1 and then the
third parameter set to null so again
it's pretty much the same layout same
concepts nothing new we just learned
about this delete method that we can use
so let's run our application and
actually since we pray off some time
since I was pretty quick what I want to
show you guys again we
set up something here to kind of proof
check everything so what we're going to
do is we're just going to copy this
catch clause for update here and paste
it for each one of our get information
for example and paste that there and
we're going to add a tri bracket and
then I'll just format it so you guys can
see what's going on here so again we
just add a try and a catch exception
we're going to print out air for the
most part and we're going to delete our
boolean value that we copied and we're
also going to do that for a modify and
again we have to add the try and delete
our boolean value format and lastly for
our deleting method we're going to you
know add the try and the catch exception
and format delete and then also we need
to throw an exception that we want to
catch so we're going to switch back over
to the hot-or-not class just scroll up
to basically when we use our open method
that says throw exception we're going to
copy that and then we're going to paste
that for we're just going to paste that
for our get hotness get name and update
entry and and also our delete so that
way we can kind of you know we can catch
some of those exceptions which I'll show
you guys here when we run our program I
know I kind of ran through that quickly
but hopefully that won't be a problem
hopefully you guys understand what that
try and catch does which which I mean
where I pasted it I should say so now
let's go down we're going to go to our
SQL Lite example and again we're going
to view our database we have two entries
Travis and Samantha and and first let's
try to get an entry of Row 5 just get
some information and this is what we
just created that dialog that says dang
it and it says it's out of the bounds
because we don't have a v in and so
that's kind of what we did there so now
this uh
kind of create some more entries we're
going to say Travis
or Jenny you know she's nine I update
and now let's view it we're going to now
edit Samantha so we're going to pull our
information first so we're going to hit
two and then say get info we have
Samantha here now we can edit it we want
to change her to like a four and haha
and then we're going to say edit entry
and now let's view our entry as you can
see Samantha's change the for now let's
delete Samantha so we're just going to
hit delete which is going to again pull
this ID and delete that entry so now if
we go to our view database Samantha is
no longer there and as you can see you
might have seen before I'm just going to
update our database so it's going to add
a few more Samantha entries so one two
three and then we're going to view our
database and as you can see even with
Jenny I had some more entries before and
I deleted them but the next time you add
an entry it's going to skip over that
entry and you know a row ID is still
going to be going up from that point so
that's something you guys might want to
consider and that's pretty much it for
the SQL Lite database stuff and we're
going to get into something else in the
next tutorial not quite sure yet what
but all right have a good one guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
