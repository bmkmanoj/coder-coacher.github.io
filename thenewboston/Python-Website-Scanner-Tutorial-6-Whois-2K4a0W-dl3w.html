video I'm gonna show you how to get the
who is of a website domain now if you
don't know what who is um is kind of
weird to say but this is a tool that
gives you information about who
registered a domain name so if you just
write any domain name the top-level
domain the new boss on Comm so make sure
that you don't add HTTP or www or
anything like that and remember we got
this in a previous tutorial like the
second one or whatever you can run this
tool and it shows you info about who
registered the name who they registered
it through and if you didn't choose
domain name privacy then it's also gonna
give you information like their phone
number their address their full name you
know a bunch of like personal
information so another thing I want to
point out whenever you're making a
website and you buy a doughnut a domain
name you register a domain name
there's any option that says do you
wanna buy domain name privacy now it's
gonna be like ten bucks or something in
a year but it's worth it because if you
don't all of your personal information
is gonna be out for the public to see so
make sure that you choose domain name
privacy and well there you go
so for this let me just make a new and
what am I gonna name it who is let's
keep it real simple
who is that py so this is gonna be you
know just like before what we're gonna
do is we're gonna call function called
get who is and we're gonna pass in the
URL and remember this is gonna be the
top-level domain name and the command
show you guys now remember the format of
the command is just the word who is a
space and then the top-level domain name
so for this who is make sure you add a
space after there and then the URL which
is going to be like the new Boston com
amazon.com whatever it was like hard to
think of just the domain name weird all
right so the process for this equals OS
pop in make a process open and command
and now we wanna whenever we run this
command we just want to get a not import
OS that's embarrassing we need to
convert this to a string so results
equal string process read and from here
we just return the results alright and
that's all there is to it so this is
actually probably the easiest tool that
we made yet and just so we can verify
that this bad boy works or you just
write print get to is the new Boston
comm so I run this and check it out
alright so this is all the information
about my domain who registered it who I
registered it through and let's do
another run real quick let's uh do read
it I love read it I'm addicted to it
alright so there you go whoo register
this their names phone number Yeti Atta
a tomato tomato
lots of sweet information so let me tidy
that up a bit and that ladies and
gentlemen is how you build a who is
scanner in Python don't know where we're
gonna be covering in the next video but
it's gonna be sweet I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
