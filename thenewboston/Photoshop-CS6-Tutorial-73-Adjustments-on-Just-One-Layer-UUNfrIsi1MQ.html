Photoshop cs6 tutorial I'm host buddy
Blackbird and today we're going to learn
how to control an adjustment layer so
that it only affects the layer that you
want it to and so it doesn't affect like
all the layers below it just the one
that you make it affect so what I did in
here is I have this in here I don't want
that there I was just messing around
with that so what I did is I placed a
moon into the scene and what I'm gonna
what I wanted to do was add this hue and
saturation only to the moon well right
now it's a affecting the background
layer also so if I turn it off you can
see that it's affecting the background
layer as well as the moon now all you
need to do to fix this is a really
simple trick you're just gonna create a
clipping group is what it's called so
hold down alt on your keyboard or option
if you have a Mac and go over top of
this line that separates these two and
it'll change into a square with a down
arrow pointed now if I click on the line
when the cursor is changed like this
it's going to add a clipping group and
now you can see that the background is
not affected only the moon is you can
you know that you're into a clipping
group if it has this little down arrow
over here to the left of the icon in
your large pet in your layers panel so
if I go to try to adjust my hue and
saturation just check out the moon right
here you can see that I can change it to
whatever I want now and it's not
affecting the background which is good
so we fixed that problem so I mean
that's all that's really - it's easy but
it's very helpful so let's just go over
it again the way to get it this out of
being in a clipping group is just to
hold alt again you click on this hold
all again and you can see that the eye
the cursor now has a line through the
arrow that means you're taking it away
so I click on it
and now everything is back to our the
adjustment layers back to affecting
everything so remember just hold all or
option-click on the line and only affect
a layer directly below it and no other
layers very very helpful for adding
adjustment layers to items that you
don't want to have affected by that you
only want to have affected by the
adjustment layer so I mean that's really
all you need to know for this tutorial
and you may be thinking yourself why'd
you upload a three minute tutorial well
what I've been doing with all these
tutorials is trying to keep them short
so when people search on YouTube for a
specific item they don't have to sit
through a whole lecture about all these
different things like when I'm searching
through and I want to just figure out
how to create a clipping mask real quick
or a clipping group or something like
that I don't want to have to sit through
and like search through what all these
people are trying to tell me about all
this stuff that I already know I just
want to figure out that one thing so
that's what I'm trying to do with these
tutorials by keeping them short and I'm
just going over like a specific items in
the tutorials and hopefully you guys
like that if you don't really then just
let me know in the comments or if you do
then let me know in the comments too so
I listened to your guys's feedback it's
always helpful so thanks a lot guys and
I'll see you in the next tutorial it's
gonna be awesome
see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
