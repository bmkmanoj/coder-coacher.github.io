tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to use the clipboard
class and in case you didn't know the
clipboard is what holds the data when
you copy something so every time you
copy something the data that you copied
is stored on your clipboard so with a
clipboard class and c-sharp we can now
access all the data view copied and we
can writes data to the clipboard so all
you're going to need for this tutorial
is a button to text boxes and two
picture boxes and when the form loads
just make sure that you have a picture
box load up or the picture box is image
V equal to something so I just made it B
equal to on the C sharp image so now
maybe blog should just see you have a C
sharp image if it's stretched but you
can you can tell what it is so in order
to begin reading data from our clipboard
we're going to go ahead and click this
click Me button now we're just going to
go ahead and type out clipboard so we're
just going to use these static methods
inside of it and the first method that
we're going to be looking at is a gif
text method and the get text method will
basically just retrieve the text on your
clipboard if there isn't so as long as
you previously pop the thing you
previously copied is text then it will
retrieve that text so now I can set
textbox to text to whatever text is on
your clipboard so now I'm a debug if you
were to type something out in this text
box such as atom and copy it
click-click me it should put it right in
this text box yep click something
different copy it yep if you type
something different and don't copy it we
should only get that s-stay whatever
yep and we could even copy something in
a different program so if we type
something out notepad such as hello we
copied it click this click Me button we
should get hello yep we got hello you
can also retrieve images from the
clipboard
so we could do Clifford dot get image
and we'll retrieve an image if there is
one on your clipboard so we're just
going to set a picture box to image
equal to the image on your clipboard so
now when you debug go copy an image like
this Google image right here just click
copy image and when we click this click
Me button whatever is images on our
clipboard should now be in this text bar
or this picture box yep the Google Image
refer you can also get things on the
board if you if you are if they aren't
images or text or an audio stream or
something like that you can use the get
data method and inside of X get data
method eating a string format and since
I don't know any some formats off the
top of my head and you're probably not
going to want to remember them you can
use the data formats class and inside of
this data format class is basically just
all of the formats so if we wanted to
retrieve RTF which is rich text format
then we could do that if you want to
occur you just plain text you can do
that as well
wanted to get T iff image to do that I'm
not going to give an example of these
because they're pretty straightforward
if you wanted to retrieve HTML and do
that as well you can also set data to
the clipboard for example if you wanted
to do clipboard dot set text you could
set atom to the clipboard so basically
it will just copy this for us so
whenever we paste we will get atom and
usually there are problems with this up
set anything methods probably may get an
error here yeah request clipboard
operation not succeed and I have looked
all over and no one seems to know the
answer to this it does copy it however
so if we put this put a try and catch
statement around this and the catch does
nothing it will appear as though it
worked but I don't know it's really
messed up so if you type if we just
click this click Me button you should
have atom on our
bored paste yeah we have Adam but it
drew an error and there's really no way
to fix that but we can set text to it
anyway so if you want to just set like
my little Bob we get that Bob click this
click Me button paste yeah except Bob it
just sets it fine although it throws an
error
you can also set images as well so if we
wanted to do dot set image you can just
set picture box one image and then after
it's done throwing an error you'll set
whatever it copied which is picture box
one's image equal to picture box twos
image so we'll just do clipboard dot
get image and we should just get the
image from picture box one yep copied it
right over there the last method that
I'm going to be showing you is a clear
clipboard method and or this clear
method and it will just clear whatever
information is on your clipboard
so if we were to go right here and copy
something and then click this click Me
button it should just clear it so we
can't paste anymore system clear there's
nothing on our clipboard is what if we
were to just regularly copy this and
click paste
yeah paste fine so that's it for this
tutorial on the clipboard class so see
you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
