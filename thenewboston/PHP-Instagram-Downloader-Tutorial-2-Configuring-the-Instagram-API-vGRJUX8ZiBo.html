video and in this tutorial what I'm
going to be doing is basically going to
be setting up pretty much configuring
our Instagram API so we can actually use
it because you know that would be pretty
useful so I'm actually going to make
this a PHP file so might as well just
save this as and where did we put this
BR downloader index dot PHP and save it
and now let's actually make it a PHP
file alright now this obviously isn't
code but before we get to that actually
I'll do it up here what I want to do is
I want to make a few additional settings
so our server doesn't timeout so what
this is going to do as I told you guys
is is pretty much going to connect to
Instagram and it's going to download a
bunch of photos so it might take a while
depending on how many photos the user
has so I want to make a couple settings
to make sure that our script runs for an
adequate amount of time so the first
thing is set time limit and when we set
this equal to zero it doesn't mean run
for zero seconds it means zero means the
script is going to run for an infinite
amount of time the next setting is any
set and you can actually have a bunch of
parameters in here but the one that I
want is default socket timeouts and I'm
just going to put this at 300 and this
is just so we can configure our server
so make sure that we have an appropriate
amount of time and then I just want to
put session start and this of course
either if you don't have a session yet
it's going to start a new session and if
you already do have one going it's just
going to resume your existing session so
after we got our server taken care of or
our PHP configurations that allows
enough time for it to run what we can do
now is
start configuring all of this crap so I
actually want to make some constants and
I'll just put Instagram API keys now I
want to make constants for pretty much
just all of these so I'm going to define
them and the first thing which is our
client ID I'm just going to call this
client ID and that's that so we can
delete this we can actually copy and
paste this now the next thing I want to
find is of course the client secret hope
I didn't actually accidentally this
about secrete are they spelled the same
way who freaking knows but once we
define that we can delete that and one
more constant that we can define is this
um Oh got Fleming I threw out this
redirect URI URI and that is this baby
right here and you actually don't need
your um the website URL because you
don't really have settings for it you
just you know the web page that the user
goes to so on your website or whatever
just put a link to it and it says hey go
to this link and link in your you can
like download all your Instagram photos
or something
and there's actually one more constant
that I wanted to find and that is I want
to say let me go ahead and type this
first I want to say this we want to have
a place that doesn't change so that's
why I'm going to make it a constant that
says whenever you download these images
from Instagram this is the directory
where you're going to save a mat and
you're on your server so I'm going to
make a folder called pics and that's
what this images
image directory is if you don't include
this and then you try to save an image
in a folder it's going to say hey you
got a error that folder or directory
doesn't exist so that's why I want to
make sure that we create it right now
and speaking of which it's probably a
good idea in here yes you don't even
need to create it on your client just on
your server but you know I'm lazy so
whatever be our downloader be our
downloader refreshes and enter and now
we have that pics folder on our server
so again we don't even really need it
right here because this script is going
to be running on our client it's just
for a development we don't need it on
our server but you know whatever so now
if we go to right here again we can see
all right we have all that crap because
we didn't delete this refresh upload
and now check it out nothing happens
because we didn't do anything yet and
that's what we wanted and we also can
verify that we have that pics folder
right there so now we got the API
configured and in the next video what we
can do is now that we've got all the
boring stuff out away we can actually be
getting into the good stuff and the
first thing I want to show you guys how
to build that link that they click and
it's actually kind of weird but it's
more it's simple once you get the hang
of it so well I'll shut up and I'll see
you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
