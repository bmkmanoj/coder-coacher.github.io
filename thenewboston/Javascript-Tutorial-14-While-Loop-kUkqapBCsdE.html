fourteenth JavaScript tutorial I think
it is and not the last story we talked
about a forward loop and what the for
loop does is allow us the loop an action
a certain number of times and this time
we're gonna be talking about the while
loop and what this loop does is allow us
to loop in action as long as something
else is true so let me just go ahead and
code this and talk you through the first
thing you need for a while loop is the
syntax while whi le and then actually
the first thing we need before any of
that is a variable so let's make a
variable I equals and let's just set
equal to zero for right now and of
course add your semicolon and the next
condition that we want to run is called
a while loop and like I said this allows
you to run the function a certain number
of times so let's go ahead and type a
while and that's the syntax Rivest and
in your parentheses right here you want
to type however many times you want it
to loop so we're gonna say as long as I
our variable is less than or equal to
ten
we want to perform a certain function so
what exactly do we want to do well we're
gonna type that right in the curly
braces so first we need a variable and
then we say while this variable is less
or equal to ten we want you to do
whatever we type in here so let's give
us some actions to type in here first we
want to say document dot right which
means just output on the screen let's
have it right again I'll add your double
quotation marks because this is going to
be a string the number is and with a
quotation mark plus I so this is gonna
output the number is and it's gonna
write I because I is gonna be the
variable no I'm just copy and paste this
so first it's going to write whatever
the number is and then
let me just add a line break and all
this is going to do is move our number
to the next line and see right now it
would say as long as the variable is the
less than or equal to ten and it's going
to be zero so it's going to go zero a
line break zero line break and it's just
gonna keep going and going so what we
need to do is change the variable so at
the end of the action we're gonna put I
and add one to it so then our action
doesn't just keep going on forever so
here's just kind of happening right now
we're gonna we have a variable I and is
equal to zero right now and we're gonna
say every time this variable is the less
than or equal to 10 I want you tell me
what the number is then go to the next
line and do it again and this just adds
one to it every time so we don't keep
getting the same thing so let's go ahead
and save this and refresh our blank page
and as you can see we have the number
zero one two all the way to 10 just what
we wanted and as you can see a while
loop and this is a syntax risk it allows
us to perform an action a certain number
of times by changing this right here
so study this in Liron list and thanks
for watching my tutorial and I don't
know we couldn't be talking about in the
next tutorial but it's gonna be good and
please I'm gonna put a link on the right
hand side called auto lien chat comm if
you like my tutorials please go there
