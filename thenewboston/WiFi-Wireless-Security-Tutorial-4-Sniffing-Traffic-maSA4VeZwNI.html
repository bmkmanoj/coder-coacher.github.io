in monitor mode aka spy mode what you
can do is you can start snooping on
people's traffic so one of the easiest
ways to get started with that is if you
just type a Wireshark and this is going
to pop open Wireshark and it's going to
give us a little message and this isn't
anything you know you have to worry
about this is just because whenever we
are running these programs in Kali
we're running them as route by default
in Wireshark doesn't like it but you
didn't do anything wrong you know those
aren't errors or anything they're just
little alerts so Wireshark if you don't
know it's a program that lets you view
and analyze packets in other words it
lets you view the traffic on your
network and if you want to get more
familiar with it or learn more about it
I actually made an entire tutorial
series just for Wireshark I think it's
like 10 videos or something so in this
tutorial series I'm just going to you
know briefly do everything kind of
quickly because I assume most of you
guys have experience with it but anyways
for those of you who don't what you do
is you select the interface or card you
want to listen from and we want to
select WLAN one since that's the one
that can hear everything and then you
just hit start so let me clean some of
this up so give it and get rid of that
art so right now you can see we got a
bunch of traffic coming on and just to
prove that it can hear other devices I
have an old crappy tablet that I have in
my hand right now and I'm on amazon.com
and all right so you guys right
there so let me hit stop and shut this
beast down all right so we can see that
we can now view traffic from this
Samsung device and that was a tablet
that I was just holding so I was just
holding that but it could be anyone it
could be my kids it could be someone at
my university it could be someone you
know at Starbucks
wherever so that's pretty cool monitor
mode is working correctly everything is
set up looking sweet now if you guys are
like you know I wonder what they were
talking about so I'm going to go to view
Hecate bites and all right so what you
guys are going to notice is if you start
scrolling through here all of the data
it just looks like mumbo-jumbo you can't
really understand it and that's because
on a Wi-Fi network all of that traffic
is usually encrypted so hmm that's
interesting so all these tutorials are
worthless well there's a bunch of
different encryption algorithms and I'm
going to be showing you guys how to
break them all and that's a well it's
not the great thing about Wi-Fi it's
actually a terrible thing about Wi-Fi
but it's great for us because all of
these protocols are really insecure and
when people think they're being safe
they're really not they're really easy
to uh you know be spied on so that's
what we have to look forward to and we
close out here and show you guys one
more thing so right now we got a card in
monitor mode it's picking up everyone's
traffic working awesome if you ever want
to take your card out of monitor mode I
don't know maybe you just are done
playing around you just want to get on
the internet again nothing special we
can do is you can write airmon-ng stop
WLAN one month or whatever the new name
of your network card is and hit enter so
now I'm clear that in IW config you see
that you now have your regular WLAN one
back to normal and this was just like I
said my one that I already had that we
aren't using now another thing that
you're going to want to do is you want
to restart your network manager so if
you go to service network manager start
what this does is it pretty much says ok
we're just going to give you some new
network settings because we or
aircrack-ng it changed a couple things
like well I'll show you guys well you
see we didn't have you know a connection
to the Wi-Fi before and all of the you
know different modes were kind of they
kind of got messed up whenever we're
playing around so this just restarts all
of your basic core Linux and network
settings so really simple to commands
roasted good go so that is how you
verify and look at the packets that are
coming in and also how you take a card
back out of monitor mode and put it back
into managed mode pretty sweet see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
