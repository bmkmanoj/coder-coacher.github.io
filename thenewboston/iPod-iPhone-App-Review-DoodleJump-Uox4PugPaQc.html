here to do another request in this
request or excuse me I'm at another app
review and this is a request for a
doodle jump right here now doodle jump
is a pretty fun game for the ipod touch
and i actually been playing this for a
while we just got on my ipod right here
but a while ago my sister actually got
me addicted to it um she's 11 so come to
think of it she actually got me do a lot
of stuff like you know chocolate
knitting and cocaine and anyways here's
the game right here and as you can see
the point is to make your doodle jump it
as high as you can without falling off
the ledge and that's my doodle right
there and how you move them around you
actually tilt your ipod touch left and
right and the tilt sensors in it will
actually move the doodle however you
wanted to move now you can also do
another couple cool things like press
any shoots I don't know what it is you
should stuff out of his mouth and this
is if you ever come across monsters you
can shoot them down or you know whatever
you shooting has a mounting nuts or
something so aside from this you can
also jump on special things like
trampolines or the spring right there to
get it so there's a chair playing right
there and another thing the last point I
want to make before I actually play this
game you can also go across the screen
like this or this and this will make
them well it won't make them like hit
the edge or anything I actually make
them jump to the other side of screen so
again like I said all you have to do in
this game is try to get as high as you
can and kill any monsters that you come
across so let me go ahead and use his
hat and see this is one of the special
things that will float me up and let me
just go ahead and quit jump in and I
should have shot that monster down but I
definitely need to because he was in my
way so let me jump on this and I'm
probably gonna lose soon because they're
getting kind of thin now
and let's see how I can get this time
I've tried to find some more stuff for
it see there's another spring right
there it helps you jump a little bit and
you don't want to go in that hole and
you definitely don't want to do it i
jist it so that's pretty embarrassing
right there because I wasn't paying
attention and I was looking at the hall
but I get side tracked easily but
hopefully you won't and hopefully you're
a lot better at this than me so like I
said that's it it's a fun game funner
than it looks and it's one of those
games that you can keep playing forever
so I'm going to write this game a 7 out
of 10 I would definitely recommend
buying it because just because it's
addicting and remember don't forget to
