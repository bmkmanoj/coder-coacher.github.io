factoring to solve word problems so like
I've always told you the hardest part of
word problems is setting them up after
that the math is actually pretty easy so
let's focus mostly on the setup of this
problem the sum of the squares of two
consecutive positive even integers is
340 find the integers so I know that
sounds like a lot but right here where
it tells us that it's positive and
integer just tells us that's it up that
it's a positive whole number two
consecutive even integers is going to
help us define our variables so X is
gonna be the first integer and
consecutive means that they come one
right after another but since it says
even if X was 2 the next integer would
be 3 if I just said that it was X plus 1
so we have to say that it's X plus 2 in
order to ensure that the second integer
is also even so the sum of the squares
so that means we're gonna square the
first integer and add it to the square
of this second integer and the sum is
which means equals 340 so let me square
this out you get x squared plus 4x plus
4 is equal to 340 we're gonna combine
our like terms and we're gonna pull this
340 over because remember when we solve
equations by factoring we have to set it
equal to 0
negative 3 36 equals 0 we can factor 2
out x squared plus 2 minus get minus 1
68 equals 0 so here's where the guessing
check part of this comes in we have to
figure out which two numbers to multiply
to make 168 but divide to make or I mean
add to make 2 so I'm just gonna with my
calculator plug in some numbers and see
if I can get any that will fit those two
rules and I found out that 160 divided
by 12 is equal to 14 so if I make this X
plus 14 X minus 12 then they'll add to
give me a positive 2 and multiply to
give me a negative 168 so I'm gonna set
these both equal to 0 if I add 12 over I
get 12 if I subtract 14 over I get
negative 14 so since our problem told us
that they had to be positive I can
scratch out that negative 14 and I know
that X is equal to 12 but since it's a
defined both integers I have to add 2 to
that to find the second integer so X is
equal to 14 so we're gonna do another
example 14 less than the square of a
number is the same as 5 times that
number so we're gonna let X
equal the number 14 less than the square
of a number
so x squared minus 14 is equal to five
times that number let's subtract that 5
over minus 14 equals zero now this isn't
a special kind of trinomial so we just
have to factor it normally so what two
numbers well the only things 14 is
divisible Y is 7 and itself so 7 times 2
will give us 14 and since I have a
negative 5 that meets needs to be a
negative 7 plus a positive 2 because
then we'll get negative 14 and negative
7 X plus 2 X is equal to negative 5 X
let me set these equal to 0 X minus 7
equals 0 X plus 2 equals 0 X add 7 over
you get 7 subtract 7 2 over you get
negative 2 so now what we do is we plug
this button in we plug both these
numbers in and see which one makes a
statement true so 7 squared minus 14 is
equal to 5 times 7 7 squared is 49 minus
14 is equal to 35 you subtract that you
get 35 is equal to 35 so that one checks
out we have to make sure that the other
one doesn't or it does as well so we
have negative 2 squared minus 14 is
equal to negative 2 times 5 so this is 4
minus 14 equals negative 10 negative 10
equals negative 10 so those both work so
that means the number is either 7 or
negative
- and it's possible to have more than
one correct answer for these problems so
it's all we're gonna do with word
problems today make sure you come back
and watch your next lesson where we're
gonna use factoring to help us solve
geometric problems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
