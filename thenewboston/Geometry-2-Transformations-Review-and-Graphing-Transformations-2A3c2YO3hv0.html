with a quick review of transformations
and then we're gonna learn how to graph
transformations so our first kind of
transformation is called the translation
it's also known as a slide we take an
object and we'll move it one direction
and get an image that's in the exact
same place next we have a rotation when
you take a object and you rotate it
around a point so we're rotating it
around this point
and reflection is where you have a line
that you're gonna reflect it over and
you just produce a mirror image of the
first shape so now we're gonna do some
graphing so for each point right it's
reflection so for 2 negative 3 first of
all the plot the for the original point
so 2 negative 3 that's a and we want to
reflect it across the x-axis well if you
remember this is the x-axis this is the
y-axis so we're gonna reflect it across
this axis so when we reflect across the
x-axis we keep our same x-coordinate but
we're gonna make we're gonna take the
opposite y-coordinate so when you go
from coordinate from quadrant 4 up to
quadrant 1 you're gonna go from a
negative Y value to a positive Y value
so this point becomes 2 positive 3
to positive three and this is a prime so
this time we're gonna take beam and
reflect it across the y-axis so negative
1 positive 2 beam and we're gonna
reflect it across the y-axis with just
this vertical axis right here so when we
reflected across the y-axis we're gonna
keep our same Y point and take the
opposite x-coordinate so if I go from
quadrant two to quadrant one I go from a
negative X to a positive X so this
becomes positive 1 1 2 this is B Prime
so now we're gonna do some more examples
so we're gonna find the image and so
we're gonna do whatever they tell us to
do and we're going to produce an image
similar to this one so first we're going
to reflect it across the y-axis so when
we do that we keep the same y-coordinate
so first we have to find the coordinates
of each point u is 1 2 V is 3 2 and T is
3 4 so we're gonna keep this same
y-coordinate for each
and we're going to take the opposite
x-coordinate this time if we go from one
to quadrant two we're gonna go from
having a positive x to go to having a
negative x so we're gonna take the
negative value of each so negative one
negative three negative three so now
let's plot this new shape negative 1 2
and negative 3 so here is this triangle
T you be
I don't know excuse me V you reflected
across the y-axis so now we're gonna
translate this shape to right so when we
translate we're just gonna push it over
two to the right so we're gonna take our
coordinates and we're gonna add two to
the x coordinate because if we're moving
it over right we're gonna increase our x
coordinate by two so this becomes 1 plus
2 which is 3 1 3 plus 2 which is 5 and 3
plus 2 which is 5 so now let's plot this
new shape so 3 2 this point right here
I'll use a different color so you can
see it better this point right here is
now point you V is 5 - this is our new V
and T is up here at 5 4
and that's iron translated image so
that's all we're gonna do with
transformations today make sure you come
back because we're going to start
talking about triangle inequality</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
