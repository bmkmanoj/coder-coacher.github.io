in flash today I'm going to be teaching
guys how to add a motion guide to your
animation now what emotion guide is it
allows you to move your object or
animation along any path that isn't
straight so let's get started and
learning how to do this select the first
frame and make sure it's a keyframe and
try any object that or image that you
want I'm going to just because I feel
like working with a basketball today let
it Indre sweet basketball into my first
keyframe and since we're going to be
working with a motion guide we're going
to be need to convert it to a symbol so
to do that highlight your first keyframe
right here and click modify convert to
symbol then click OK now your animation
instead of a basic shape it has become a
symbol so now go to another frame and
insert a keyframe now move your object
around the canvas click in between it
and click tween motion as you can see we
now have an arrow with a purple faded
background and this lets us know that
our motion tween has worked remember it
needs the Assemble to convert it to
emotion now simply simply press Enter
and you can see that we now have a
motion guide along
our image so now that we have a basic
straight from point A to point B let's
learn how to create a motion guide to do
this highlight your first keyframe make
sure your first keyframe and layer one
is highlighted then click this little
button that looks like a curve with dots
on it and it says add motion guide and
click add motion guide now you see that
you have a new layer that pops up now in
your new layer not not the one that says
layer one but the one that says guide
layer highlight your first keyframe and
with your pencil tool metamodeling I'm
going to do that now this is your path
that it's going to follow and it's not
actually going to appear on the screen
it's just a guide now go back to your
layer 1 and highlight the first keyframe
as you detonate of the path now go to
your last keyframe and layer 1 and as
you set it up so now we have layer
number one keyframe and layer number one
make sure you're not in your guide layer
in keyframe and layer number two now as
you see we now have a path and when we
press Enter our object now follows that
guide layer
so remember you make your guide in your
guide later and you snap it in on layer
number one so let's see how this looks
like if we're actually test it as you
can see when it actually shows our guide
layer doesn't show and our basketball
appears be bouncing along whatever path
we made and this is how you can make a
motion layer to move your objects along
any line that isn't straight and next
time we're going to be talking more
about animation but if you missed
anything that I went over today and go
to my website the new Boston comm now I
have a step-by-step instruction
instruction on how to do all this thank
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
