the next thing we have to do we start
putting together don't roll bar now
whenever you build your own custom
framing typically weld this on whether
you know whatever kind of plug you have
lying around well on this Raymond came
with a pre-built
roll bar but the concept is really all
the same roll bars are pretty much these
bars of piping that go over the cake now
the point of this is couple things first
of all it makes your go-kart or dune
buggy a lot more safe and second it
helps save live fringe so all go-karts
and dune buggies although they aren't 1%
required they should have roll bars and
this one is actually pretty cool became
very wired with all the lights and turn
signals and stuff so hopefully I can
just lift it on by myself
well I got one side come on baby come on
there we go
now just bolt this baby on don't be good
good now mounting the main centerpiece
of the roll bar is really easy anything
anytime you want to mount something onto
the frame use of course the bolts and
these little nuts which are made
specifically to contour the shape of the
pipe so go ahead put one knot on one
side and we're going to need to pound
this through a hammer let's see if this
one goes on any easier oh yeah there we
go so you'll know they have it correct
because this feels nice and snug because
it's contoured and fitted nicely to
place so put one on one side one on the
other and tighten it up now another
thing is if you have headlights or turn
signals or any electric pre-built into
your roll bar then this is the time
where you want to hook it up so just go
ahead and take your two clamps one from
your electric box and the other one come
from your real car and there you go you
should be hooked up
alright guys now that the main middle
section of a roll bar and solve for
ready to move on to installing the rear
in the front sections of the roll bar so
let's do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
