season or at least fantasy football
season so for those of you who didn't
know in addition to being a super
computer nerd I'm also a huge football
fan and also a huge fantasy football fan
so what I'm going to do this year is
something that I've done a little
different from the past couple years I'm
going to open my league to all of my
subscribers now this is a league that's
20 people maximum so there's obviously
going to be a limited number of spots
maybe I'll open up a secondly if I get a
bunch of requests but um I don't know
yet so in my fantasy league its twenty
dollars enter and all of the money goes
to the prize pool I'm the commissioner
and I don't keep any of the money it's
all prize money now I don't know right
now if it's all going to go to the
winter or if it's going to be paid the
top two or top three but anywho all the
money's going to the prize pool no
Commissioner fees or anything like that
so if you want to enter my fantasy
football league here's what you need to
do you need to send me a private message
through my youtube channel and I'm going
to check that and just tell me that
you're interested in what i'm going to
do is send you the league ID and the
leak password now once you are enter
your league get everything set up get
your team set up first then i'm also
going to send you my paypal email now
you have 24 hours send me your $20 dues
or I'm going to delete you from the
league and give your spot to someone out
someone who is actually going to
participate so like I said there's 20
teams maximum and we're gonna draft at
10pm eastern standard time or eastern
daylight time and it was 10pm North
Carolina time on July thirty-first and I
believe that's saturday um if I forget
anything I'll leave the details below
and like i said i'm in charge of all the
money so if you win at the end you don't
have to worry about you know trying to
get a hold of everyone to give you
twenty dollars
I am responsible for it all so you can
trust me you don't have to worry about
you know talking to a bunch of people
that you never met before only me so
you're in good hands now a couple
technical details that you might want to
know first of all like I said we are
doing a live draft num this auto pick
noob bull crap or anything like that a
live draft so you know no rookies a lot
also the type is going to be
head-to-head and that means you're
against someone each week instead of you
know just going by points another thing
is that there's no maximum moves and
what's the one oh yeah leave boats on
all trades to keep everything fair and
also that there's an 18 playoffs at the
end of the season so you know those are
just a few rules all of the rules are
going to be listed in the link below I
pretty much try to keep everything as a
standard as possible since you know
there's gonna be a lot of people I
didn't want to mix up the rules or
scoring settings too much so
everything's pretty much standard for
the most part so anyways that's how it
goes 20 teams max if you want to join
don't forget to send me a message
through YouTube I'll give you all the
information and register once you're
registered you have 24 hours to make
your payment and i'll send you the
information for my paypal too but yeah
that's all i have for you and again I
know I'm forgiving like a million things
so if I do um you can just ask me
question here and I'll answer it or
click on the link below like I said for
all the settings and scoring's or if I
forgot anything I'll put it in the
information box below but anyways I look
forward to seeing you there and uh yeah
I talk a lot of smack by the way on
fantasy football so uh yeah just be
prepared for that and one more thing you
might be interested in girard from
surviving the wilderness he actually did
survive and he's in this fantasy
football league too so I'll watch out
for him and if you're in it you can feel
free to talk a bunch of smack to him so
I think you guys for watching hopefully
I'll see you in the league and uh yeah
i'll be making a you know computer stuff
at another time but for now I'm
concentrating on fantasy football so
thank you guys for watching thanks for
subscribing and I was
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
