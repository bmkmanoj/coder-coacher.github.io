tutorial for the new boss and finish up
our email Java class and you know
thinking about it now this is basically
this applications for the most part is
pretty pointless you don't learn a lot
of new stuff but what we are going to
learn is sending an email using kind of
the default email from the Android phone
so we're going to do is we're going to
do that through our button so when our
button is clicked it's going to call
this on click method and it's going to
set up this message etc so we're going
to go below where the message is set up
and again what we're going to do is
start an activity we're going to use
instead of an intent for a class that we
already have we're going to use the
intent that that basically is going to
reference the phone for the email so
start up an email application and so
what we're going to do first what we're
going to do is set up an intent just
like we set up all other types of intent
tense for the most part and so we're
going to say intent and we're going to
call this email intent something like
that and hit enter and then just again
we have to import the intent and say new
intent just like always and this time
what we're going to put in the
parameters is we're going to reference
something from the Android SDK and it's
going to be called Android content dot
intent dot action send and you have some
of these other actions that you can call
such as like action answer call if
you're going to call someone for the
most part again you can click on them
and see what they do I just wanted to
show you guys that we can use some
intense to start up some applications
that the phone has in this one what
we're going to call Erb basically this
one is going to be called action send
it's going to deliver some data to
someone as you can see so we're going to
pick that and just end the closing
statement and now what we're going to do
is add some stuff to this intent to make
it unique so what we're going to add is
basically the email we're sending it to
first so we're going to reference our
variable that we set up email intent dot
and then we say put extras because we're
going to put some extra stuff in there
it as you can see mostly there have to
two things within the parameters a
string name which again is going to
reference something from the SDK and
then the data we want to pass through
there so we're just going to click on
one of these and for the first one again
it's kind of a string reference and
again we're say Android content dot dot
and tenth dot extra email and I'm just
going to scroll through here basically
what this action name is is basically
going to refer to what email were
sending to and again it's going to take
or for this one it's going to take a
string array so that's why we had to
create this string array right here even
though we're using just one string for
the most part so this has to be a string
array otherwise it's not going to work
and so we're going to use this variable
we set up called email address and then
end our statement let's put some other
things within this act email so we're
going to say email intent adding to the
intent again by saying put extras or put
extra and we're going to now add like
basically you know the subject of the
email and we're going to say Android
again dot content dot intent and again
like if you guys ever want to build a
you know email address for the most part
you probably are going to remember all
these action names so that we're just
again building kind of a reference pack
that you guys can use later so we're
going to say now is extra subject
because that's going to be the subject
of the email and we're going to say I
hate you
something like that make it nice and
friendly and what else can we do or
we're going to add our actual message
and put that within the actual body of
the email so again put extra and this
time we're going to say Android content
dot intent and this time is going to be
called extra text
and as for the value we're going to use
this message or this string that we set
up where it covers basically all of our
variables and stuff so we're just going
to say message again our string values
and also what we want to do before this
line
I just realized so we want to set the
kind of the type face for the most part
kind of tell it what kind of type we
want so again we're just going to say
Android and tenth dot set type and we're
going to say within quotations plain
forward slash text in quotations and
I'll kind of set it to plain type text
there we go we've pretty much set up our
intent now it's going to pass on for the
most part or put extras within the
whatever email we want to send it to
give it a subject and also give it the
actual message and then all we have to
do is say start activity and then what
intent do we want to start we want to
start off this intent that we've been
kind of defining so there we go
that's basically the end of the tutorial
and our application is done I'll show
you guys what looks like it's not going
to run on the emulator because I will
explain that in the video what's up guys
so here's our application I'm just going
to open it up and as you can see there's
a there's text down here so that's why
it's all kind of squished right here but
we have a scroll view for the most part
I'm going to put in an email and test it
out my email if you guys want to send me
one is Travis at my bring back comm just
to make sure it works
then hateful intro we're just going to
say you're a douche
it's supposed to be apostrophe er but
who cares most hateful people don't
really care about grammar so a person's
name we're going to say Travis and
that's spelled wrong as well who cares
stupid things that this person does make
tutorial make tutorials I should say oh
you want this person to do cry and
hateful outro later loser alright so
basically we filled in all our
parameters and now when we hit this
button it's going to start the email
intent which is going to look like this
let me see if I can focus it and so it's
going to select all the email
applications that has that the user has
on their phone that's why we can't use
the emulator because there is no email
actions for the most part and you have
to have a basically be signed into email
because you have to send this email from
you know a certain email address as well
so I'm just going to click Gmail and
look it fills out our body it has the
subject I hate you and we're basically
which which email we're sending to from
right there and you know that's the easy
way to send hate mail for the most part
if you guys want just as hello Travis I
wanted to say that you're a douche not
only that but I hate when you make
tutorials that just makes me really
create or makes me crazy I just want to
make you cry well that's about about all
I wanted to chitchat err about oh and
later loser oh also if you get bored you
should check out my bring back calm PS I
think I love you so it's kind of a weird
thing and obviously sorry is having
trouble reading that because I was
trying to look at my camera and at my
phone at the same time but alright
anyways so that's the end of this
tutorial guys have a good one peace
and just to show you it's sending a
message as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
