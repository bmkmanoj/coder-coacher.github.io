this video we're going to be taking a
closer look at the gun in bullet problem
so I already told you guys theoretically
what should happen since both of the
objects start out with a velocity of 0
the total momentum of the entire system
is zero therefore after you fire a
bullet from the gun the ending momentum
or the momentum whenever the bullets
being fired is also zero does that make
sense well hopefully after I show you
guys this example it will so let me go
ahead and draw my trusty gun and I'll
give it a trigger and I might as well
give it a handle too now inside the gun
you have a bullet now make sure my bow
that doesn't look like a wiener this
time but we already know from the
formula momentum equals mass times
velocity that the total momentum of the
system has to be 0 why is that well the
gun and the bullet right now before you
fire aren't moving at all
so since velocity is 0 momentum equals 0
now let's go ahead and throw theory out
the window and throw in some actual
figures so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to give you guys the mass in the
velocity after okay definitely spent ok
maybe I should give it to Toria on how
to spell after after the firing so we
need two pieces of information the first
one is the gun and the second one is the
bullet so what information do we have
already well I'll say that this gun has
a velocity of 30 or excuse me has a mass
of 30 kilograms and I'll say that this
bullet since it's it's much smaller it
has a mass of only half a kilogram now
after we fired the bullet some guy was
waiting down with the speed gun and he
told us that the bullet shot out of
there really quickly at a rate of 400
meters per second and we said ok how
fast was the kickback speed of the gun
and he's like I don't know
oh you don't know didn't you calculate
that too and he's like no sorry man I
don't know that's what you have to
figure out so we'll put a question mark
right there and that's what we're going
to figure out and that's what I'm going
to be teaching you guys in this tutorial
how to solve for one of these variables
when the rest of the information you
have available well let's go ahead and
do that right now and figure out the
kickback speed of the gun so again what
we know is the total momentum of this
has to be zero since the initial
momentum is zero so what we do is in
order to get the momentum of each let's
go ahead and figure out the momentum of
the gun first mass of the gun times the
velocity of the gun will give us the
momentum of the gun now what we need to
do is add this together with the mass of
the bullet times the velocity of the
bullet and whenever we add these two
things together we have to end up with
an ending momentum of zero so the very
first thing we want to do is we want to
figure out the momentum of the gun mass
times velocity well you take the mass of
the gun which is 30 and I'll throw out
my units for right now and you times it
by the velocity of the gun now of course
that's where we're trying to figure out
so we don't have that information yet so
just go ahead and put X as a place order
now what we need to do is we need to add
this with the mass and velocity of the
bullet so the mass of the bullet was 0.5
and the velocity of the bullet was 400
so let me just go ahead and throw those
in parentheses and I'll say that this
entire thing equals 0 well let's go
ahead and figure out this part right
here first of all whenever you take
point 5 times 400 you get 200 now what
we have right now is 300 x equals 200
Orcs do t get ahead of myself here plus
200 equals zero now you guys can
probably figure it out from here but in
case you don't know what to do in order
to figure out X what you need to do is
subtract 200 from each side so you get
30x and it's equal to negative 200 and
now of course the velocity of the gun is
X so what we need to do is get X alone
so take negative 200 and throw it over
30 and also you throw this over 32 and
you end up with X equal to and it's
actually equal to negative six point six
repeating and the units that we were
working with is meters per second so
tella you know whoever was asking us for
this information the police officer the
guy calculating or maybe we just were
curious that whenever you fire a gun
with a mass of 30 kilograms and the
bullet is half a kilogram and it's
firing at a rate of 400 meters per
second then the kickback speed of the
gun is negative six point six meters per
second and if you guys are saying okay
six point six meters per second why the
heck is this negative right here well
the negative symbolizes direction it
basically means it's moving in opposite
direction than the bullet so since this
is positive right here 400 meters per
second it means that the bullet is going
to go this way and a negative number
means the velocity would be this way
opposite directions so that is how you
calculate one of the variables when you
have the rest of the information thus
proving the law of conservation of
momentum so that's all I got for you
guys for this tutorial um I don't know
where we're going to be covering in the
next tutorial but it's going to be epic
so thank you guys for watching and I'll
see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
