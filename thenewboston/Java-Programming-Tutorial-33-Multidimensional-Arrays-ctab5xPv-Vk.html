tutorial and in this story I'm going
teaching you guys about
multi-dimensional arrays now people make
multi-dimensional arrays whenever they
want to do something like make a table
in Java or make something where you need
coordinates so again or not again for
the first time the syntax for making a
multi-dimensional array is your array
type which is in it in this case first
array this is just the name of the array
and instead of just one square bracket
you actually add to the first one is for
the row and the second one is for the
column so how you create this is this
and this of course is a multi dimension
array initializer and this is the
easiest way to create multi-dimensional
arrays so you pretty much have your main
array right here once that I'm just
filling it with number four five six you
actually fill them with other curly
brackets where you can put something
like a nine ten eleven and then anytime
you want to go to a new rope just press
comma and new curly brackets and put
something like twelve thirteen fourteen
fifteen so what this would mean right
here
is you have an array with your first row
being eight nine ten eleven in your
second row being twelve thirteen
fourteen fifteen so whenever these you
want to call an element in your array
the first row of this the first call is
zero so this would be first to raise
zero one first array zero to like this
first array zero one
that's why I'm talking about when I say
first of all one and this will point to
this and anytime you want to call
something on your second row its first
array one zero first array 1 1 4 3 1 2 1
3 so that's how you call elements in a
multi-dimensional array but what if you
said alright I want to build a table but
I want it to have different column
linked
can I do that sure Ken so int second
array let's go ahead and create that and
instead of in your array having all the
same row links what you do is this may
be in your first one you would put
something like 30 31 32 33 and then in
your second row you would have something
like 43 and then in your third row you
have something like 4 or 5 6 so what
this would do is create a table with 3
rows 1 2 3 in the first row the columns
would be 30 31 32 33 in the second row
um it would only have one column 43 and
in the third row down it would have
three columns four five and six so again
how you would call or use the elements
in this array anytime you want to use
this one
the first number you would put a zero
and then put the number of the elements
so zero zero don't move that 0 0 0 1 0 2
0 3 this one won't only have you would
be able to call 1 0 and this one need to
be called 2 0 2 1 2 2
so that's how you call elements in a
multi-dimensional array and actually in
the next tutorial I'm going to be
building a program to output this so you
can see visually what I mean in how you
create a table with rows and columns and
once you see it it's going to make
complete sense to you and it's going to
be really easy so that is the basics of
a multi-dimensional array again in the
next tutorial I'm going to show you guys
visually how to do this so it'll make a
lot more sense to you so thank you guys
for watching please check out my next
tutorial and I will see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
