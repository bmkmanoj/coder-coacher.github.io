video and in this tutorial let's go
ahead and learn about sliders and
sliders are actually one of the more
common items that you're going to add to
your interfaces so I wanted to take an
entire tutorial and talk about them
because they behave a little bit
differently than some other items so
first of all what I did is I created a
brand new blank project nothing special
now for this the first thing I'm going
to do is just uncheck you size classes
disabled so we got that standard iPhone
template now of course a slider you guys
field probably already guess what this
is it is that thingy that the user can
slide all right pretty cool so you would
use this there are a lot of like user
settings that are variable or also if
you're like making a game and your
character can have like a different
amount of I don't know like life or
health or anything like that then you're
going to use this now you're probably
wondering all right well what's the
value of this what numbers does it
return by default well whenever we want
to say the minimum or maximum or what
number it's setup at default what we can
do is we can hop over to the attributes
and give it all those values right here
now right now it's 0 for the lowest than
1 for the biggest but you're usually
going to have something like 1 to 100
say that you're making a game and your
user can never have like greater than
100 health or something now the current
is whenever this slider first appears on
the screen was the default value what is
the default position and for this I'll
just set it at 50 so look what happens
when I deselect that the slider moves to
the middle position right there so again
this is all the background information
the value that iOS is going to know but
the user has no way of knowing or is
this 50 is this 500 what so for that a
nice little indicator I'm just going to
add a label on the screen and this label
in this example we'll set the 50 at
first
and just so I have no space let me
maximize this and center align it by
clicking this button and drag it in the
middle of the screen so again all this
demo is going to do is the user is going
to slide this and it's going to change
the value and display to them but again
in real life you would want to do
something like changing like the health
of your character or something like that
and also just because this is annoying
me I want to change the background color
so make sure you have both your items
deselected and just click somewhere in
this white area and I'll change it to
like hmm that's pretty good color
whatever color that is turquoise or
something all right so now what I want
to do is I want to get rid of a fowl
navigator I don't really need it right
now and go to my split screen so I can
see exactly what's going on behind the
scenes so let me just go ahead and get
rid of some of these comments so it's a
little bit more clear all right so the
first thing we're going to need is of
course an action and the action of
course the add it you hold down control
drag create your action and I'm just
going to first of all change this to
action and what do I want to call this
I'll just name it something like slider
changed now for the type of what can
call this well this slider right here
and hit connect now here's the thing
before whenever we made a button or
something these methods were just called
pretty much one-time whenever the user
click the button however for a slider
what's going to happen is this method is
going to be called every time the value
changes so if they slide it from fifty
to hundred it's going to be called you
know like not just once but constantly
so it's constantly going to be called
whenever they are changing the value of
this so that's why it's a little bit
different than a button or anything like
that and you guys are going to see in
the example exactly what I'm talking
about now another thing we need to do is
if we want to change the text on this
label we need the outlet to it so
control stick it right up there
and yes it is an outlet and I'll just
name it something really creative like
labeled alright looking pretty good now
in our method or action what I want to
do is I want to show you guys a problem
that we have by default so if we take a
variable and what I want to do is I want
to get the value of the slider so what I
can do is I can actually call sender
which is the slider itself that's the
object that's causing this method or
action to occur and on this I can just
get the value of it now I don't know if
you guys saw but what that does is it
returns a float so even though whenever
we look at this slider the minimum is 1
the maximum is 100 and the current is 50
so in your head you're probably thinking
all right they can slide it to something
like 64 72 10 but what's actually
happening is it's getting the float
value so a bunch of decimal places so
I'll show you guys the problem that we
have in just a second but anyways once
we have that value we can change the
text on this label equal to whatever
that value is so I just set it equal to
something like slider not sodor slider
value all right now this alright it
looks pretty good I mean we don't have
any errors but let's check this out all
right and I forgot to change to my
iPhone stimulator
all right so build succeeded looking
good now hmm it's interesting all right
I put it to 1 to 100 and now I mean it's
working fine 1 200 but I'm getting all
these float values and that's not really
what I want because I really don't care
you know how precise that is for just my
game so if you want this effect then
it's fine you can leave it but most
people just want the whole number so
what you can do in that case is this let
me just cut this now for the slider
value what you can do is you can call a
method called L Rauh
to F and make sure you choose the one
called float because again what this is
doing is it's going to give you a float
by default so just hit enter and for the
value you just write sender value so
this is the value from the slider and
what we're doing right here is we're
just rounding it off to essentially the
nearest whole number so now if I run
this check out what happens there you go
it gives us the effect that we were
looking for so that ladies and gentlemen
is a slider and in the next example I'm
going to be showing you guys one of the
more well this was also a pretty common
item but another item that's used law
and that's segmented control so I'll see
you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
