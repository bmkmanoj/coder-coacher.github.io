game development tutorial with slick 2d
and in these next couple series of
videos what I'm going to be doing is I'm
going to be showing you guys how to make
a very simple RPG game now this game is
going to kind of have the field like
Pokemon or like an old game on Nintendo
like Zelda something like that but what
it's going to be is it's going to be
called Bucky land and it's going to be a
little character named Bucky and he's
going to walk around his own little
world and basically do whatever the f he
wants because he's Bucky and it's his
land so the first thing we need to do is
we need to download all the image files
that we're going to be using in the game
now awesome for you guys
I already made all of the images and I
stuck them in a folder and they're able
to download for free so here's how you
go ahead and get them go ahead and open
up Google Chrome it won't work on any
other browser go to T&amp;amp;B
forum comm and scroll down until you
find the java section go ahead and click
that and then you're going to see the
topic right at the top that says java
game development with slick source code
go ahead and click that one and now if
you want all the source code for this
game it's a source code tutorials 12 - I
don't know because I don't know how long
the series is going to be but it's going
to be using those basically three
classes game menu in play so if you
don't want to wait and watch the series
and you just want to go ahead and view
the source code maybe follow along that
way go ahead and get it all right here
but for now what we are interested in is
this Bucky World zip I know the game is
called Bucky land in this files called
Bucky World couldn't make up my mind by
anyways go ahead and click this zip file
look excuse me got hiccups go ahead and
click that zip file download it and once
you download it you're going to have all
of these images so here is little Bucky
character right here Bucky has four
different ways or four different images
of him his back front left and right and
what we're going to be doing is we're
going to be animate animating him
differently depending on what direction
he's walking obviously
and we just have two buttons for the
main menu and the world which is
basically his little home with this I
don't know like office building and a
bunch of trees so again those are all
the images that you need so in order to
import those so you can use them in your
game go ahead and expand hand blaster
expand re s and if you guys don't
already have them in there just go ahead
and highlight all of these and drag them
in your re s folder so now what we can
do is we can go ahead and access them
whenever we need them in Bucky land game
development so that is it and what I'm
going to do is I'm going to actually
start coding in the next video but
before I do I want to mention this I
basically clean everything out of the
menu class and also the play class so as
you can see the only basically line of
code I have is just this return 0 and
return 1 like we did before and I also
left everything this pretty much the
same in the game class because you know
of course just like the examples before
this game is going to have two states a
menu state which is the main menu in the
place state where you play the game and
basically everything else is the same so
there's no reason to touch that at all
so again keep your game class the same
and clean out everything in menu class
and play class and once you do that and
once you have all your images imported
then you're ready to go ready to start
developing probably the greatest RPG
game ever made Bucky land</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
