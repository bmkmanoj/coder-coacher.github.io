tutorials that have ever been made
my name is Bucky Roberts and in this
video series I'm going to teach you guys
everything you need to know about
node.js now if you're watching this
video series I'm going to assume that
you guys have heard of nodejs before but
you may not know exactly what it is you
probably just know that it's becoming
really popular and that you can use it
to make cool stuff for the internet but
I don't know maybe you went to your
website and you started trying to figure
out what it was and you saw this alright
scalable applications let's see it's an
event-driven on blocking all right um
that's confusing let me just go and see
if I can see what these examples are oh
yeah look at this now everything makes
sense to me so again going to the
website inserting you know trying to
read everything they don't really do a
great job of explaining what the heck
this thing is for a complete beginner so
let me put it in really simple terms no
js' is a way that you can make really
cool server-side applications and that
means that if you want to make let's say
a website or a chat program or a game or
even like a social network any web
application that you can use to actually
connect people no js' is an awesome
choice now if you guys are like alright
you know what I already know PHP for
example sounds like it can do all of
those things so I'll see you later
maybe I'll catch you in another tutorial
series well here's the thing
the reason that nodejs is becoming so
popular for one reason is because it's
awesome for real time stuff for example
if you were to make a chap location and
of course you would want to be updated
in real time
well PHP isn't that great for those
kinds of applications it's kind of slow
and it uses a lot of memory resources
and that has a bunch of drawbacks and
again to explain all of the benefits of
nodejs I'm going to have to show you
guys some examples so the
first thing we should do is install this
bad boy so in this video I'll show you
guys how to install it for Windows in
the next video I'll show you how to
install it for a Mac so again you guys
probably figure this out
might as well just click this big green
install button to get started and this
is going to give you a MSL ms:i file
which is essentially just a wizard and
it's really easy to install actually so
wait - that gets done double click it
and you trust it ok I trusted I trust it
actually let me minimize out of this
alright so right here you pretty much
just want to keep all the defaults next
let me read through this blue ok I
definitely uh yeah definitely read all
that next it's going to install it in
the default location do not change this
please make sure that it's right in your
Program Files next everything looks good
next install do we give it permission -
yes of course we do Digitek do don't do
all right
apparently it completed easy is that
let's go ahead and finish this and now
what do we do I mean how do we know for
sure that it actually installed well the
first and probably the easiest test that
you can do is you can actually go to
your command line by if you go to your
Start menu and then you can either
search for just type CMD and that will
pretty much open up the command prompt
so what it did whenever it installed it
is it set up a system path so now we can
actually run it by just typing the word
node and just the test again I know that
I'm not explaining the syntax or
anything this is pretty much just the
test and make sure that everything is
installed properly well if he type
console dot log and inside here you just
type something like I'll just type
anything you want bacon what this means
again is just print some text out to the
console or in other words this terminal
so again don't really worry about the
syntax just copy this make sure
everything is working if it's not then
go back and make sure that you kept
all the defaults whenever you installed
it but if you see the word bacon
undefined then you're good to go so of
course what we can do is we can type a
bunch of nodejs in this awesome-looking
you know command prompt but fortunately
they have programs that are a little bit
you know more aesthetically pleasing
than this thing that looks like it was
developed in 1940 so first of all I want
to mention that I am a big fan of free
itës and pretty much software that you
can develop no jsn however for this
tutorial series I'm going to be using a
JetBrains IDE to type all my code and I
highly highly highly recommend it if you
actually buy this then it is let's see
fifty dollars but guys trust me you guys
want to download this IDE is hands-down
the best platform for developing nodejs
applications and I know that everyone
has a personal preference you know some
people like potatoes some people don't
whatever but this is not a competition
this is the best and another thing is
for students or if you're just teaching
it or even using it for an open-source
project it's completely free so guys
splooge on this I know it's 50 bucks
like I said but it's well worth it if
you got to steal some money from your
grandma or anything then that is fine so
download this again if you want to try
it free for 30 days through that and
actually I don't have this exact IDE
installed on my computer I actually have
another IDE from this company but
they're pretty much the exact same thing
on mine is called IntelliJ but again if
you install it you're going to see that
it's pretty much the same thing this IDE
is more geared towards Java development
but I'm going to show you guys how to
install a plugin and it's pretty much
going to give you the exact same
functionality as a webstorm so the first
thing we want to do whenever we have our
IDE installed is create a new project so
go here and what we want to choose from
here
is just a static web application this is
just a blank on web application nothing
fancy it's it's pretty much like the
most basic uh
project that you can make so I'm going
to click Next and from here again just
choose wherever you want to save it I am
going to save mine in a node.js file
that I already made before this little
tutorial and I'm just gonna name my
project like Bucky so I want it to be
named Bucky I'm gonna save it in a
directory Bucky looks good finish do I
want to create it yes I do and check
this out alright right now we just have
a directory called Bucky which is our
main directory and this folder right
here is pretty much just all the
settings for arm jetbrains your IDE like
your preferences and stuff we actually
never are going to edit anything in here
and this is just a file that references
these are pretty much just uh JetBrains
files that came with your ID nothing to
do with nodejs so don't worry about
these or ever worry about touching them
so we pretty much have a blank project a
blank folder with nothing in it so the
first thing of course we need to do is
create some kind of file well if we
right-click our main project we can
select new javascript file and name this
file app dot j s so this is going to be
our starting point in other words
whenever we start making note j s
applications our program is going to
look to this file first
and whatever coded is in here it's going
to run so it's like our main file simple
enough so if I just want to actually
we'll just do this so console.log so
just like before we can type bacon and
if we either right click and run this
check out what happens so we pretty much
have the exact same thing as the command
line however as you can see this
little environment is a little bit
cleaner and gives us a few more tools
than that boring black and white
command-line so there you go that is set
up and running perfectly however there
are a few things that I want to take
care of the first thing is this whenever
we start running actual applications we
of course want to make these for
websites most of the time instead of you
know just having the user use a terminal
or command prompt so what I'm going to
do is this I'm going to go up to this
little drop-down menu in the top right
and I'm going to choose edit
configurations and this is pretty much
saying how do you want to set up on your
program to run well if you click the
browser live edit tab then we can say
this after this program launches then
open it in and you can choose whatever
browser you want I of course am using
Chrome as my default if you don't have
it then get it so again after this
launches then don't just run everything
in the terminal actually open it up in
an actual website and of course you
can't just open it in Chrome you need to
give it on a website to open so up up
HTTP localhost which means my computer
port
888 so again whenever we're making
nodejs applications we're going to have
to say that this arm is the correct or
in the correct location but we'll take
care of that whenever I show you guys
how to do everything just setting
everything up now so just hit apply okay
and if we run this right now then it's
not going to open in Chrome and that's
because we're not giving it any code to
open in chrome right now because all
this says is print some text out to the
terminal which is this so I know it's
kind of confusing but you guys are going
to see later on whenever we start making
actual nodejs
apps that actually make sense so one
other thing that I want to explain is
this eventually when you start typing
natural nodejs you're going to get some
more
things from your IDE so in order to get
rid of those warnings we need to tell
armed IntelliJ or actually think if
you're using webstorm then everything is
going to run fine but if you're using
another IDE from jet brains and this is
what you do you need to go to file
settings and first of all you need to
install the node j/s plugin so like I
said this webstorm right here if I
actually just click it it's already set
up for nodejs however if you have I
don't know another product like IntelliJ
this is mostly as you can see for Java
however you can tweak it to pretty much
use with nodejs
so this is how you do that you go to the
plugins and type in node J s now you're
going to see a plug-in called nodejs
which pretty much means i want to be
able to write nodejs code in this piece
of software so you install that i of
course already have it installed so
that's why it says uninstall for me but
you will see a thing that says um
install click that and once it's
installed this is another thing you need
to do I actually could have got that
open but if you go to file settings you
can click languages and frameworks
expand JavaScript right here and click
on libraries now as you can see we now
have a few additional libraries that is
capable of understanding so we want to
just enable nodejs and nodejs Global's
again the core modules and Global's and
again you don't really have to worry
about exactly what this is right now
we're just telling our program that says
hey whenever we start typing nodejs code
don't get tweaked out and freak out
because um you know you don't understand
what it is so those libraries whenever
we enable them it just says be aware
that we're going to be developing nodejs
in here that's it so now we are good to
go again in the next tutorial I'm going
to show you guys how to set it up on a
Mac and also if you guys want to use a
free IDE I'm going to show you guys how
to download and install sublime to use
when
no js' so it's gonna be cool I'll see
you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
