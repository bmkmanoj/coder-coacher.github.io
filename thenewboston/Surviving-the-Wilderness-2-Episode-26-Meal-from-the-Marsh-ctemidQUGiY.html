check this out right here cut - awesome
frogs this one is actually a really big
one and this one's just a little smaller
one but cut these I uh I was walking by
the UM not by the stream but by the
little marsh it's next to it and it's
really buggy around here but anyways
imma gonna cook these babies up finally
I get some real food to eat so first
things first I think what I'm gonna do
just get a stick and make it into a
little point so I can cook them on it
click the frogs on it like a marshmallow
so probably something like that but this
one's kind of bent so see if I can find
another one just one over here might be
good I think I'll use that right there
should be good to go got to be careful
not to let this fire spread I didn't
want to make it down by the beach
because it's too far away and I really
want to eat right now so it's probably
long enough
probably get it right there I don't need
a razor-sharp I never cleaned a frog
before but I'm guessing it's the same as
any other animal a deer whatever and I
already killed it so these are just his
nerves they really did suck having to
kill a pup
I hate killing animals but I don't
really have a choice out here
so I'm gonna I probably fry up the whole
thing once I get all the guts out and
yeah it looks like the majority means on
the lake so I'll probably fry it like
this then just eat the legs and I guess
that's the plan I'm gonna go ahead and
clean the bigger one now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
