third tutorial and in this tutorial I'm
gonna be covering addition in scientific
notation now to be honest whenever
you're working with addition and
subtraction in scientific notation it's
kind of easy the only time it gets
tricky is whenever you're working with
multiplication and division whenever you
have to multiply to these bad boys
together it gets kind of weird whenever
you have to do it on paper so in order
to understand that we first need to
understand addition and subtraction so
right here I'm working with two positive
exponents ten to the fourth and ten to
the fifth in the next example I'm gonna
be showing you guys negative three and
negative two and lastly I'm gonna be
showing you guys what happens when you
try to add scientific notation with a
positive exponent with a negative one
and it's kind of weird so just stick
with me and just follow along so say we
have two huge numbers right here and
these are really big numbers they can
symbolize you know your mom's weight
plus your grandma's weight burn or
something like that so the very first
thing we need to do is convert these two
I'm just going to call them real numbers
basically numbers that we can understand
so six point two one four times ten to
the fourth is 6 2 1 4 0 so 2 point 4 6 1
times 10 to the fifth is 2 4 6 one with
two zeros so now what we need to do is
we need to take this number 62,000 and
add it to 246,000 you know plus some
change so whenever you add these two
numbers together you get three hundred
and eight thousand two hundred and forty
point zero zero now we aren't done yet
if you ever had this question on a test
from you know your science teacher or
whatever you need to take this final
number right here and you need to
convert this in the scientific notation
so in order to do that you want to move
the decimal place all the way over here
so ever say inari here's where I want it
to be but here's where it is right now
all you need to do is count the spaces
two three four five so basically your
final answer is this three points make
that a little easier to see zero eight
two four you can forget about all these
extra zeros times ten to the fifth so
that's your final answer six point two
one four times ten to the fourth plus
two point four six one times ten to the
fifth equals three point zero eight to
four times ten to the fifth there you go
so aside from that we also need to learn
how to add two really small numbers
together so we have a number like three
point six times ten to the third plus
two point four times ten to the negative
two and again like I said these are two
really small numbers like you know maybe
your mom's IQ score burn and yeah these
corny jokes are gonna be coming all day
long so just get used to them so this
summer whenever we convert scientific
notation or excuse me converted to a
real number is point yeah it's
embarrassing all right point zero zero
three six and this bad boy over here
whenever we convert this is point zero
two four so whenever we add these
numbers together we get point zero two
seven six but if you put this is the
final answer on your test your teacher
is going to frown upon that and probably
take some points off what you need to do
is you need to convert that scientific
notation so this is where you want the
decimal point to be so we need to move
that one two spaces right there so two
point seven six and make that a little
bigger times ten to the negative two is
going to be your final answer because
remember if you move that two places
then you need to make your exponent two
right there so this is your final answer
that's what they expect to see on the
test so now last but not least say you
have a really big number like this one
yeah I'm gonna be doing that like all
the time too
nine point three times ten to the third
plus a really small number one point six
times ten to the negative two well let
me go ahead and convert these numbers
first so you can see them a little bit
easier so this number right here is nine
three zero zero nine thousand and three
hundred plus the small number over here
is point zero one six pair that down so
whenever you add these together again
you don't need a calculator for this
it's ninety three hundred 0.016 well
obviously like I said this I'm gonna
make that a little bit bigger this is
not nearly good enough to go as this
final answer on your test we need to do
is you need to convert this to
scientific notation so right here is
where we want the decimal point to be so
we have to move it three places to the
left so our final answer is nine point
three how many zeros one two three one
two three one six times ten and you
remember how many places we move that to
the left three so that's our final
answer that can go on our test so this
number right here Plus this number
whenever you add them and convert in a
scientific notation is this number right
here so again like I said that's how you
use addition in scientific notation
whenever you have two positive exponents
two negative exponents and in this case
a positive exponent and a negative
exponent so that's how you do that and
again that subtraction is really simple
as well the only way it gets really
confusing whenever you're trying to do
it is when you're working with
multiplication and division and we're
gonna eventually be covering that and
I'll show you guys a really easy way and
some really easy trick tricks to do that
but for now thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe and yes in the
next tutorial corny jokes galore so I'll
see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
