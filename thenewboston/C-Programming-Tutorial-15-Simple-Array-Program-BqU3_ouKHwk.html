15th or something a tutorial on a race
and the last one was on a raise but I
promised that I would build an
application to show you guys why arrays
are actually useful so that's what I'm
going to do now so all I have to do is
follow along and open your mind and just
learn so the first thing that I'm going
to do is build in an array just like
last time let's put five elements in it
and let's go ahead and fill this array
with some kind of elements let's say the
ages of my brothers and sisters and I
don't have five brothers and sisters so
we'll go 21 for me uh 18 let's say
pretend I had one that was 47 another
one that was 21 was my twin named monkey
and another babysitter name for it so
that's one two three four five so
remember the position number for each of
these is zero one two three four and you
can have these any numbers you want and
doesn't matter the next thing I'm going
to do is go ahead and build a counting
variable and in case you guys don't know
in by in case I mean you guys don't know
because I didn't tell you it
um this application is just going to add
up all the numbers in the array for us
so we're going to be building a for loop
later with a counting variable so that's
why I need that and the last thing I
need is a variable to keep the sum of
the total or pretty much the sum or the
total however you say so now that we got
our array and two variables one for it
accounting variable and one to keep the
sum let's go ahead and go to a for loop
now our first condition is I need to
start a zero and this is because the
first position number of this is going
to be zero and it's going to go to four
so let's go ahead and add our next
condition the maximum I is less than
five and we have less than five and not
equal to five because it's always going
to be less than five which is 4 if we
put less than or equal to is going to
try to get that fifth number and zero
one two three four
there is no five it always goes from
zero to four not always but in this case
and now let's go ahead I plus plus since
we want to just loop it through one at a
time don't get anything fancy so let me
go ahead and come on format whatever do
this hard way so wow this is pain in the
butt right now so next we have to write
what we want our programming to do so
let's go ahead and take the total and
right now the total is zero so what we
want to add to it is loop through let me
let me tell you but I can think and type
at the same time and that is our program
right there so what this is going to do
is it's going to go all right you now
have the variable I equals zero so we're
going to take the zero with position
number which is 21 and add it to the
total next we're going to loop through
when I equals one so when I equals one
we're going to take 18 and add it to the
total so whatever 18 plus 21 is and
that's going to be the total next it's
just going to loop through all of that
until we get through all of these right
here so just to output something on a
screen to prove you guys that work go
ahead and printf take it there right yep
oh let's go ahead how we're going to
format this the total number is and I
know I'm spelling everything around I
know ice about number wrong so don't
comment a thousand times telling me
percent D let's go ahead and add a new
one no we won't just get suckered total
so let me just run this real quick and
then um I'll explain you guys exactly
what it did one last time so you guys
aren't totally lost in the dark so it's
going to loop through and it's going to
say the total number is again number is
111 that's exactly what we wanted now
one last time let me explain you guys
how exactly this is working the first
thing we did is build an array with
five elements in it now those arrays are
listed zero through four just because
your computer is weird the next thing we
do is build a counting variable and
built a variable to hold the sum of our
numbers we started with the zeroeth
element in our array and loop through
until we got the number four as you can
say I is less than five which is four
and this is just the loop through it one
at a time we then took each of those
elements and added it into the total
variable so loop through each time and
each time it did it added a new number
to the variable total and at the end you
guys should know this by now what we did
is simply print out that number so again
that is one way that you can use a loop
to loop through the elements in your
array and this is just to show you guys
that array isn't totally useless and you
can actually use it for something so
this is a very simple program I
encourage you guys to build this again I
want to thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe to my channel
again thank you and make sure to check
out my next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
