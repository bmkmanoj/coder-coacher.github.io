welcome to your very first tutorial and
intermediate Java programming now if
you're watching this hopefully you work
your way through my beginner tutorials
and this is just a continuation of my
beginner series but I didn't want to
just keep adding tutorials to that one
series or else I'd be like 8000 Torrio's
long so that's why I'm splitting it up
and we're going to start from there the
end of there and we're going to pick up
on string methods because that's where
we ended up obviously and that's we're
going to be going over today so if you
don't know anything now I'm teaching
today I would highly recommend you going
to my beginner series and I'll put a
link to those series on the right hand
side or actually I probably be too lazy
to do that so you just got to go find
them on my home page or something but
anyways they're out there so you know go
find them so now that we've got all the
basics covered with strings we want to
go over some things and what I want to
teach you in this story is some cool
methods that work
they're called start with and end with
and they pretty much do exactly like
they say they value to loop through an
array or even just look at one string if
you want but that's kind of worthless
and what they allow you to do is pick
out all the words that begin with
certain letters so let's go ahead and
make a string array and let's name it
words why because it's just going to
have a bunch of words in it and I'm
going to name it func um let's see chunk
let's see what else will work for this
tutorial furry and I normally say that
you can create your own words but I use
the words that I'm using because I mean
and Baconator because these are we're
going to compare them and I chose these
for a very specific reason for this
tutorial so copy them just like I did so
now we have an array of four words func
chunk furry and Baconator and they're
stored in an array code words so let's
go ahead and first use the starts with
method and here's how you do this I'm
going to be demonstrating this in
enhanced for-loop
which I should know from
my beginner tutorials and if you don't
well go ahead and watch them go ahead
and type in advance for loop or
something and you'll find it so I'm
going to loop through the words array
and store each of those variables in the
variable W so now what do we want to do
well now that we're looping through this
array we can use each word and represent
as W so now we can use that method let's
go ahead and make a little if if W which
is whatever word we're at at the time
it's going to be equal to funkotron
furry and Baconator and here's how we do
this starts with and is your parameter
just go ahead and type what you want to
start with and we'll go ahead and put fu
so oh I didn't even know that ouch
should I put that yeah I definitely
should put that so now what we should
put is if this word starts with fu what
do we want to do let's go ahead and
system.out.print line and let's go ahead
and just put like some playing W plus
starts with F whew good enough so now
here's what we're doing in this story
since we have this enhanced for-loop
it's going to allow us to easily loop
through this array right here it's going
to take each word representing it as W
at the time and it's going to check all
right if this starts with this and we
passed an fu it's going to output this
if it doesn't then it's going to do
nothing at all so it's going to say all
right and I probably need to put space
right there all right did this start
with fu yes so func starts with fu does
this no so it's not going to do anything
this first start with fu yes so furry
starts with fu and Baconator of course
that doesn't so it's not going to do
anything so let go ahead and run this
and now you can see it visually now you
guys know that I'm not lying to you and
that's actually what it did so that is
how you take a string and you can pass
it in a substring and see if that starts
with that and you can even do that for
one character if you want but I just
want to show you guys that you could do
it too and there's also of course if you
go ahead and copy this
actually just go ahead and delete that
probably book why not copy it
there's also ends with I don't know why
I added a comment I'm going to delete
the Sun two seconds and instead of
starts with you can put ends with
instead of F few sands none these words
within let's go UNK so loop through all
my words in whatever ends with you and K
write that word ends with you on K so
let's go ahead and run it and see what
we get this is from our old method that
we built and now we get funk ends with
UNK and chunk ends with E okay so of
course furry and Baconator did not end
with you on K so that's why those didn't
show up I guess you could say so now
let's go ahead and delete all this and
actually that's pretty good for this
story because in the next story I'm
going to be going over something else
and it's probably going to take a little
bit so thank you for watching this story
on the next story we're going to be
going over how to find characters in a
string and also sub strings in a string
sound confusing well it'll be clear when
you watch my next tutorial but anyways
thank you guys for watching don't forget
subscribe and I'll see that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
