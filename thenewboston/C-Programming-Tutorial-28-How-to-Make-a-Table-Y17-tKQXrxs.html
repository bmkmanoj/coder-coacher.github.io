video and I know in the last tutorial I
was like in the future we're going to be
looking at these for loops and you're
going to be seeing exactly why they are
useful however I thought I might as well
take a break and show you guys a cool
little trick something that I like to do
a lot whenever I'm working with programs
that simulate I don't know like Excel or
spreadsheet type programs and that is
how to make a cool little table using
something called nested for loops a for
loop inside another for loop like for
loop section so of course the first
thing that we need to do is make a
couple variables for INT columns and int
rows now using this program we're going
to be able to tell it exactly how many
rows and how many columns we want to
print out now eventually if we're
reading from a file or something um
we're going to get the number of rows
and columns
from the data but for right now we can
just input however many we want to print
out manually so of course make the first
for loop and we want to add some space
in there now the first thing we want to
do is create the rows so put rows equal
to one that's what you always start at
and for the second parameter what you do
is put less than or it's technically
called the second expression less than
or equal to however many rows you want
to create so let me just pick like six
or something and of course we're just
going to do it one at a time so we can
create six so basically what this for
loop is going to do is it's going to
loop through six times and I'm going to
be printing a new line and I'll show you
do that right now / F new line right
there so pretty much every time this
thing loops its going to bump it down to
a new line that's going to create your
rows so every piece of the information
that we print out is going to be on new
line
aka new row so how do we create the
columns now well we need to add another
for loop and inside this for loop we'll
just go ahead and like print out the
number
so printf and we'll just print out our
not like percent d what are you doing
cursor obviously not the cursor
obviously it was me but you know god
blame it on the cursor for why not so
we're going to just print out some
number right here and now we have to
take care of the columns so just like
before put columns equal to one that's
where we always want to start at and
again just like before we pretty much
now have to say how many columns do we
want to create well we're going to do is
set this less than or equal to I'm just
going to put my on f4 so pretty much I'm
going to have a table that six rows by
four columns so 24 elements in my table
and I'll just put columns plus plus and
I'll just go ahead and print out the
name of the column right here so now
basically what's going to happen is this
rows what I do in put rows for that so
check this out as you can see this first
loop right here is going to run six
times and that is responsible for
printing a newline every time and the
reason that it bumps down is because of
this statement so it's going to run this
and then bump it down so that's why it
gets six lines now on each individual
line all this for loop does right here
is it pretty much prints out a number
one space 2 space 3 space 4 space so
pretty much just loops through and
prints out four numbers with the space
after it so whenever we do that for
every single line it pretty much
visually looks like columns so again
this is way where you can create a fast
table and right now it just as 1 2 3 4
not very useful but whenever you're
creating like I said a spreadsheet
application or a database and you want
to print out to the user this is pretty
much how you say this is how many rows
we want this is how many columns we want
this little script right here creates a
nice-looking table so thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and I'll
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
