Android tutorial for the new boss in
again with me Travis and what we're
going to do in this tutorial is
basically set up a package set up a
project that we're going to work with
from here on out so before we can set up
a project you guys want to go into setup
your preferences for the most part and
locate the SDK that we downloaded in the
last tutorial now if you're running on
Windows you want to go up to the windows
tab that's where I got confused in that
other tutorial and under the windows tab
there should be something called
preferences right down here but on a Mac
Mac computer you want to go under the
Eclipse tab and the Preferences is right
here so you click that and then you go
to this folder called Android that's now
located or now you're welcome
Android SDK you're welcome proceed
alright computers frozen awesome so ok
no it's not but ok so sorry for losing
focus there go into this Android tab or
just click on the Android and all sorts
errors are coming up and now what we
want to do is locate the SDK our SDK
folder that we set up so we're going to
browse and again I told you guys to set
it up in your hard drive so it's pretty
easy to find so just go to your C Drive
or your main hard drive and look for the
SD the Android SDK folder right here
just click on this folder you don't want
to go into anything in here just click
on the whole folder hit open and it'll
load some up or hit apply and they'll
load some of our platforms that we
downloaded again we download the 2.2 in
the Google Maps so we want to select 2.2
because that's where we're going to
start with hit apply or hit ok and now
what we can do is right-click within our
package Explorer now if you guys exited
out of this package Explorer because
you're trying to clean up and now you're
like oh crap we needed that it's pretty
easy to get back down in this bottom
left corner you click and right here is
package Explorer and then we can just
drag and drop this into our workspace
and again right click go to new and
you'll either have an android project
right here if not that's okay I don't
obviously so we're going to go
other and we're going to go to this
Android folder and set up android
project like that now this is basic
setup for setting up a new project we're
going to give it a name we're going to
call it the new Boston and we're also we
also need to select our build target now
our build target is again what platform
we're developing for we're going to fill
for the two point two and here's some
other things that we need to define now
we have an application name this is
what's going to appear on the users end
when they're scrolling through all their
applications this is the name of our
application so we're going to leave that
as the New Boston if you guys want to
change that that's okay the package name
basically we want this to be unique
because when we put our application on
the marketplace if there's another app
that has this package name you won't be
able to upload it so we're going to make
it unique in general generally you want
two identifiers so you're going to say
like TT and that would be two
identifiers for the most part but
generally what people do to make make
sure the application is unique is that
if they have a website they do it
backwards like comm dot the new Boston
dot Travis and that's just going to be
our package name hopefully that's unique
enough for the marketplace again you
need two identifiers and you do that by
hitting the period to create a new
identifier for the most part now this
create activity this is basically the
activity or the class that's going to
start when our emulator or when our
application launches so we're going to
call this starting point like that one
word if you guys have two words it's
going to give you an error and you won't
be able to finish so make sure it's one
word we're going to call this activity
starting point we're just going to
finish and it's going to set up a
project for us as you can see right here
gives us an error because it's still
building the project takes a little bit
all right so there we go we have our
project set up and I'm going to kind of
define what this project holds and how
to add folders to it in the next
tutorial
so hopefully you guys got followed along
and understood how to establish a new
project and I'll catch you guys in the
next tutorial peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
