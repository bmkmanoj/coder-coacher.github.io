video I want to start talking to you
about int and float arrays now there are
actually a lot of differences between in
float arrays and character arrays so I'm
just going to cover those in this video
and probably maybe you in the next video
I'm not sure who the heck knows so what
we're going to be doing is I'm going to
be creating a basic array looping
through and showing you guys the
differences and where you might get
stuck up on them so in Thai that's just
going to be my counter whenever I loop
through them now of course just like a
character array what you do is you put
the data type and I'm just going to make
a simple in turay which is going to hold
imagers and I'm going to name it
meatballs
now in between the brackets of course
you're right how many elements you want
to hold now whenever you want to
populate your array what you do is you
use curly braces and you pretty much
type a list of numbers in here so I just
put seven nine like 4321 now this of
course is called initializing the array
pretty much the spot where you create
the array simple enough now one other
major difference I want to point out is
int and float arrays are different than
character arrays because they don't have
that null character at the end they
don't have that null 0 so that's a more
for their internal stuff but you
probably should remember that because
it's going to come up later if you try
to get the size of the array or anything
like that or you're looping through and
it doesn't seem quite right so just
remember whenever you're working with
numbers in an array there is no no 0
that's just for strings and character
arrays so now let's go ahead and make a
for loop so I can show you guys what up
and in 0 now put I is less than 4 and I
plus plus and in a second I'll show you
guys how to populate an array through a
loop it's kind of different than this
line right here but for now we'll just
printf
and what can we do we'll put like
elements percent tea and then we'll pup
percent D and for the first one we'll
just print our eye which is whatever
loop run in the second one we'll access
an individual element using meatball and
of course just like before we put the
elements name in between square brackets
so actually let me put a new line here
and print this bad boy out so just like
before starts at zero one two three that
means it has four elements total seven
nine 4321 and again no null zero at the
end so I guess we have time for in this
tutorial so now what I want to show you
guys how to do is populate an array
using a loop because even though this is
really simple syntax right here it's not
very useful and also not very practical
sometimes you're going to want to read
through a database or you're going to
want to let the user enter a series of
numbers through the keyboard so I'll
show you guys how to do that so we can
actually get rid of this right here and
let's make up an array with five in it
I'll be a little bit better a little bit
more even for my ad D all right so let's
just go ahead and build a simple program
where we let the user enter five numbers
we store it in an array and we'll say we
will calculate the average or something
so we'll say that the user is going to
enter how many meatballs they ate in
we'll calculate the average of you know
how that means you ate this many per day
simple enough so we got an eye for our
counter and meatballs is going to be how
many they ate and of course whenever
you're calculating average we need total
balls which is going to hold the total
amount just set that to zero for now
alright so pretty much every single loop
will go ahead and give them prompts be
like um how many meatballs
did you eat on day
centi and kick that to new line and then
since this is going to start with zero
what we want to do is put I plus one and
this isn't going to change the value of
I is just going to display whatever the
current value is plus one so it's
perfect it'll be better for the user to
see what the heck is going on so now
that's a give them an area where they
can scan in a number that they enter and
of course we want to store this in
meatballs so in person and I looking
good so basically right now whatever
they enter and they're going to enter
one by one it's going to be stored in
meatballs in first meatball zero all the
way to meatballs four so now we have a
populated array and array full of
numbers so the only thing we have to do
now is loop through the same way we did
before but now we're going to use those
numbers to calculate the average so
we're going to store the total number
right here and for each element of the
array we pretty much add it to total
balls total balls kind of funny funny
variable name all right so say we enter
one two three four five it's going to
add one then two then three then four
then five it's a little total balls now
equals the total amount of balls so now
we have to get the average of those so
int make a new variable for average and
set this equal to of course you guys
know how to calculate average the total
over how many days well we inputted five
different numbers so that means five
different days and now we just print
this crap out on the screen
so the Fertile what can we do we'll just
put something simple put you ate on
percent meatballs total that's arm and
average of percent the per day
simple enough looks alright so the first
one is you eight total give them their
total first and their average is of
course the average you kick that to a
new line because it's bugging me and
actually I want to put this under line
myself a little bit of space to work
with so now if everything looks good all
right think I'm good to go so how many
meatballs DGE on day one Oh only 812 on
day two I ate I was pretty hungry that
day 98 state 3 561 on day four only
eight two and then day 5a 866 so I ate
seven hundred and thirty nine be postal
and this is a actually pretty accurate
because I do love meatballs I get like a
meatball sub every other day average 147
per day pretty sweet and that again is
how you let the user enter or populate
an array manually and whenever you're
reading like from excel file or comma
separated file you're pretty much going
to use this same concept of taking arm
pieces of data in entering it into an
array but it's going to be slightly
different but now that you understand
the concept is going to be really easy
to understand later on so for now thank
guys for watching I'm going to subscribe
check out my website I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
