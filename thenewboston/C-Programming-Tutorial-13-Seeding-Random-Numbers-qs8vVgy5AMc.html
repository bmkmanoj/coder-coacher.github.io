your 13th tutorial and see and in this
story I'm going to be showing you guys
how to make a truly random number
generator and you guys are saying all
right think it teaches that last time
well I did but uh well you'll see it's a
little surprise in store for you
now just to tell you guys pretty much
what I'm going to do let's go ahead and
first let's execute and run this program
now the truth behind computer random
number generators is that a computer is
only a computer there is no way in the
world that computer can truly generate a
random number since it has to follow a
pattern it's just made up of bunch of
electronics it has to be told exactly
what to do so whenever we build a basic
random number generator although these
look like random numbers is actually
following a very precise algorithm to
develop these random numbers
so if you see 41:18 thousand six
thousand twenty six thousand and then
you go ahead and run this again it's
going to follow that exact same
algorithm again which is pretty random
but the algorithm is the exact same set
of ran numbers forty eight thousand six
thousand twenty six thousand exactly
like before and this is pretty much
supports the fact that there is no way
you can tell a computer to generate
random numbers it doesn't have a brain
it can't pick it off the top of its head
so it has to follow the circuits in
whatever it does to follow distinct
pattern so as you can see or I say that
loud onna or what I'm trying to say is
this is not a really desirable thing we
want so the closest thing we can do is
trick the computer or at least not
letting a human being able to predict
the random number of the computer and if
we say all right what's so bad if the
humor
can predict it well let's say you're
building like a slot machine for a
casino and see and you really don't want
to human to predict that or if you're
building a game or anything so to do
this we need to start at a new value
every time and to do this again I said
that I feel like repeating myself today
we need to make something called a seed
now when you seed a random number it
gives it a new value instead of the old
algorithm it's used to in the seed or
random number is s ra ND this means seed
random in what this line of code does
right here is whatever parameter you
type in this can be any number it's
going to use that value and input
somehow into its algorithm to generate a
list of truly random numbers so let's
say let me just put 12 just because the
one and two are close to each other and
I'm lazy and as you can or I'm going to
stop saying that you got 40 last time
than like I can't remember what it was
but it started with 41 now you see it
starts with 77 and gives you a whole
list of random numbers so that's what's
eating a random number does but the
problem with this is it doesn't just
work all the time when you seed a random
number again I ran this program once
more and it gave you the same list of
numbers what's eating a random number
does is take this and use it as a
variable in the algorithm so it changes
it up a bit but it still doesn't change
it so it's totally unique each time so
it just pretty much gives you a
different algorithm so how can we seed a
number that changes every time the
computer runs the program well to do
that we need to think for a second what
is a value that we can put in here to
have it change every time we could have
the we could put a scan that variable in
there and have the user type it but we
really don't want that that's not
be useful so the only thing that I can
think of that changes every single
second is time so let's go ahead and
write our time variable in our parameter
for our seed variable so to do that go
ahead and put time and in your
parameters go ahead and put null because
you don't want it to have any variables
and what this will do is this it'll take
the time which is is it's actually a
number in how many seconds since like
January first so many years ago this is
actually a number that changes every
second and it's going to take it and put
it in your entire seed variable so this
is going to pretty much take a random
variable and throw into this entire
random number generator algorithm so me
you or no one knows exactly what number
it is so this is how let me separate
this so you can see is how you use time
which is ever-changing variable you
don't have to worry about it and insert
it into your seed so you can have a
truly random number generator so let me
go ahead and show you guys going to go
ahead and compile this and the first
time you run it we get nine thousand
eight thousand nine thousand ten
thousand now let's go ahead and run it
again and if this worked out perfectly
they should be different and come on so
we got nine thousand uh that's what we
started last time sixteen thousand
twelve thousand twenty eight thousand
nice so that is how you build a truly
random jump jumper numerator what number
generator jumper number uh correct
myself up so again that is how you do
that by using a seed with your time
parameter to seed a variable in your
random number generator so again study
this tutorial practice it have some fun
with it
both programmed roll dice or something
like that do something fun
it and again I just want to thank you
guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe to my channel again thank you
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
