your 79th java tutorial and in this
story I'm going to show you guys a real
quick way on how to create files using
Java so pretty much if you don't have a
file created and we could check for a
file using what we learned in the last
tutorial then we usually want to run a
program like I'm going to be teaching it
today or in this tutorial to create a
file so the first thing we need to do is
import Java dot util and just go ahead
and import everything from there and now
let's go ahead and the first thing we
need to do is build a formatter variable
so we need to make a final varial
variable format sur type X and you can
name it whatever you I just named
everything X because I'm too lazy to
type anything that's more than one
letter but I'm going to name an X and
what this is going to do a formatter
variable pretty much outputs strings to
a file and it's pretty much like printf
but instead of printing to the screen
your print a file so this pretty much
outputs a string and let's go ahead and
I didn't teach you guys except I didn't
teach you guys about exception handling
but I'm going to have to do some right
now I'll give you guys the quick one to
you pretty much in exception handling
you write try and then you're right what
do you want to try and what we want to
try is this we want to set X equal to
new formatter like that in this is
pretty much the same thing as
instantiated the variable and same line
but we want to try to do it down here in
as the constructor for this is pretty
much the same things put final formatter
x equals new formatter and again as a
constructor it takes the path of the
file so what file do we want to output
to well I'm going to make a file call
like Fred dot txt and here's the thing
if there is no file to output to then
automatically
creates a file on your computer for you
so that is how you can create files on
your computer on your computer using
formatter so again let's go ahead and
now that we created a file we want
something to show up in the command
prompt tell us that we did it so
system.out.print line and let's go ahead
and put you created a file so now if we
try this and it's successful then this
stuff is going to happen however if we
get an error then and again I'll be
going over this try and catch you later
so don't worry too much if you don't
extend it understand it however if you
get an error in this an error and
exception is the exact same thing they
just had to name it exception because
they had to be different if you get an
error then what do you want to happen
system.out.print line you got in air so
this is pretty much your own way of
making custom errors so you know in if
we had an error before then our program
would just start running and we're get a
bunch of error messages on our command
prompt but this is a way if we you get
an error running your program that your
program doesn't just automatically shut
down and you can actually handle those
errors aka exceptions why they name
exceptions I don't know it's annoying
but they did it so I know I didn't teach
you guys about try and catch it but it's
pretty much try this code if you get an
error do this BAM you just learned it in
like half a second so what we're going
to do is let me show you guys right here
on my computer if I search in here and I
search for Fred I don't have anything on
my computer named Fred or anything like
this but now we're going to run this
program right here and it says you
crested a file and I mean to put created
but I did it okay make fun of me big
deal so did we create a file I mean all
we're getting is this command prompt
right here I don't believe you created a
file Bucky well let's go ahead in this
computer
here in search again and now let's
search for Fred and make sure you only
have one day and bam look at this we now
have a file created if we click on the
properties is created see users Gregg
workspace Bucky and that is pretty much
right here and if you're working with
Eclipse you can highlight Bucky click
refresh and under your jRD systems
library you get that Fred text and I
know I just talked real fast and you
guys didn't really comprehend that
probably but I should probably slow it
down pretty much what I'm saying when
you create a file you created it in
whatever directory your program ran from
so if you have this Java program right
in your hard drive then it's going to
create this text file right on your hard
drive if you run this Java program from
a folder called
um like apples or something then it's
going to create this text file in the
folder called apples and you can also
make an absolute path like this and you
know well you guys know how to make
absolute paths from let pass for my last
tutorial to create that file where you
want it like in a folder or something
but again to recap one more time we use
this final format or X variable and what
this did is pretty much stored this
formatter
well it just pretty much created a
variable and again the formatter is
pretty much a way of putting strings
into a file or pretty much writing stuff
in a file so right now our file is empty
but we're going to be putting stuff in
it later and again if it couldn't find
the file then it created it and that's
why it created it and again if we made
an error then Java makes us handle it in
some way so that's why I need to teach
you guys about try and catch um you can
catch different types of errors like if
a user tries to divide by 0 or if they
are supposed to input a number and they
actually input letters or something then
those are the kind of errors you usually
want to catch and you usually want to
send a message back hate it
in put a number no letter but for now
we'll just output you got an error so
that is your real quick tutorial on how
to create files
we're actually be clearing this up and
no makes sense when we create a program
but and also your real quick tutorial on
exception handling try and catch so
thank you guys for watching don't forget
to subscribe if you're a little confused
don't worry
I'll clear things up for you in Mexico
tutorials but again thank you don't
forget subscribe and I'll see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
