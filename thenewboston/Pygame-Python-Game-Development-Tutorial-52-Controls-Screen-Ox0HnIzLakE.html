another PI game tutorial video in this
video what we doing is building up our
controls functionality so controls is
going to run a sort of sequence like our
game intro sequence basically its own
little sequence that runs as long as we
say something is true so with that let's
go ahead and build that I'm just going
to put it right above button it
shouldn't really matter until we
actually call it but basically this
function will be a lot like game intro
so what we could do is we could come
down or even pause but game intro sounds
good since we have a lot of pre-written
stuff anyway so let's go ahead and just
copy game intro so basically everything
except for the game intro definition so
copy that and scroll back up to where
the heck do it I guess we didn't start
writing game controls so let's do right
here so we'll say define game underscore
controls empty parameters and then just
paste all that stuff and then fixed
intro because that's gonna come over
here and now we're ready to change game
controls to be more like what we want
this to be so instead of intro equals
true
we'll just saw call this game Conte so
game controls basically and then wow a
game con r.g Conte what do we want to do
well we're still gonna be asking about
the quit and play events and all they're
really these events here don't even need
to run anymore experiment we got buttons
for that now so we'll just do that and
game displayed up fill white we'll leave
that and then now all we can do is we'll
just say we'll call this tanks pose plus
controls and so that's our large font so
it's our controls then we'll just delete
this here not delete all but we'll say
fire colon space bar then we'll come
over here and we'll say
move turret up and down arrows and then
move tank left and right arrows and that
should be it but we'll also look throw
on a p4 pause we'll just put that right
here actually uncomment this out and
then we'll say pause P now that's it for
that screen this might cause a problem
actually but I think we'll just leave
that there for now because that's 180
displaced from the center it will don't
feel like doing the math in my head
we'll find out in just a moment in fact
let's go ahead and just run this really
quick I'll see how that works
oh we're not calling game controls I
don't think so we'll come back to our
function here this worry defined the
function we'll take that function name
scroll down to buttons and instead of
passing in controls we just paste game
controls run that now let's try this one
more time right so we had here fire
spacebar move turret up and down arrows
move the tank now the pause is a little
too far away so let's go back up here
basically game controls we're moving in
basically 40s so this should be 90 right
4250 is 90 so let's try that one more
time
hit controls now now that looks a little
better so the only thing left and
everything else works right but there
shouldn't be like a link to controls in
the controls menu so I have two options
right we could either have controls just
disappear
when we go to control so then you can
just play or quit or better yet we can
have this be actually a little bit of a
navigation and controls in the Misbah
should head back to the main page I
argue so I figure we might as well show
that so instead of this saying controls
in controls it says the main menu okay
so we could do that and then we could
just say action equals main menu or
whatever now for the most part though at
least for our game we don't actually
need to do that so what would be the
point of going back to the main menu
because at the main menu but the only
things you have are plain quit right and
you have that at controls so when you're
in the controls you're really your only
options are to get out or play so I
don't really see any point in making too
much navigation there so we'll just do
that when we're in the controls menu so
that's that and I guess well let's just
see if this would work out for us so we
can go back to main here action equals
main and then when we're in button we
can come down here and we can say if
action we equals main what do we want to
do well then we would just run game
intro so where is game intro there is so
game underscore intro I just forget like
if I capitalized things and stuff anyway
game intro main let's go ahead and save
and run that now controls and now we
have main we can go back right so we can
go back and forth oh man I just really
made it mad angry didn't I oh don't go
too far that's funny
anyway so you go controls go back to
mean and then play and so you you can't
go back and forth and stuff like that
as you can see if you get too happy with
the clicks you can you can kind of
probably beat pygame back to before it
recognizes what the function is or
something but anyway that's it for
button and adding our controls page I
think well we'll just leave main there
just because it's kind of neat to have a
navigation like that but I'm not really
sure if it's total
necessary anyway so we've got our
controls now and all that and I think
we're ready to maybe start building our
tank so like I said before we're gonna
actually draw the tank instead of using
like a sprite or something like that
because for sure at least the turret we
want to be able to move the turret
because we're gonna aim the tank and I
think it might it's almost easier to
just do like just draw it and then you
can move the shapes and stuff but anyway
that's what's in store for you guys so
stay tuned for that
as always thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
