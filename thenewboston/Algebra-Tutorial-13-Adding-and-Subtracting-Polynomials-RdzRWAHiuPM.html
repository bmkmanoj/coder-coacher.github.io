adding and subtracting polynomials and a
polynomial is this expression right here
and it's an expression that contains
variables with different sorts of powers
so this is not a polynomial it's
anything with a degree higher or equal
to two so when we add or subtract
polynomials what we're going to use is
our knowledge of combining like terms
because you can't combine unlike terms
and these parenthesis when we add and
subtract them they don't really matter I
know that sounds kind of crazy cuz when
we learn an order of operations
parentheses matter a lot but when we're
just talking about adding and
subtracting polynomials it doesn't
because these are just expressions
they're not equations that we're trying
to find an answer to so what we're gonna
do is first we're gonna rewrite this and
what we're gonna do is we're gonna
distribute this positive one to each one
of these terms and we're gonna drop the
parentheses on both polynomials so this
is X cubed plus 2x squared plus 8x that
part stays the same and this is plus 2x
and positive times negative stays
negative 3x squared this also stays
negative 3x cubed and now what we're
gonna do is you can do two different
things and it just depends on what you
prefer better you can write it in
descending order so you have your
highest power and then we're gonna bring
this one over and then your next highest
power
if you want to rewrite it before you
combine your like terms that's fine you
don't have to I personally don't but it
really doesn't matter what you do so X
cubed minus X cubed is zero so those are
gonna go away 2x squared minus 3x
squared is gonna give us a negative x
squared + 8 X + 2 X is gonna give us a
positive 10x so that's all you have to
do it's really just distribution and
combining like terms so we're gonna do
some examples now okay so this time we
have a negative so it's really really
important that we distribute that
negative because if you forget you're
gonna end up maybe adding some things
that you're not supposed to or
subtracting some things that you're not
supposed to so we're gonna copy the
first part that stays the same and when
we take negative one because remember
there's an understood one right there
times X we're gonna get negative x and
negative one times negative one is gonna
give us a positive one so then we're
gonna combine our like terms 4x plus a
negative x is going to give us 3x + 2 +
1 is gonna give us 3 now if you remember
when I introduced these I said that
there in expression and an expression is
just what we call something that doesn't
have an equal sign because if it if this
said equals 9 then that would be an
equation but when it doesn't have an
equals it's called an expression just in
case you see that on homework or any
other kind of worksheets that you do at
home I want I want you to know that
that's all it means so we're gonna do
the same thing down here distribute this
negative and that's really the most
important part is that if you have a
negative or even if say you had like a 2
right here
you'd have to multiply it all out so
that you don't add or subtract
incorrectly so negative 2 y squared plus
8 and a twos not supposed to be there
negative 1 times 3 y squares can give us
negative 3 y squared negative times
negative is gonna give us positive 4y
and the negative times a negative is
gonna give us a positive 6 now we're
gonna combine our terms negative 2y
squared minus 3y squared is gonna give
us a negative 5y squared and then we
have a plus for Y because this there's
nothing else with a Y in it and then we
have 8 plus 6 so plus 14 so if you
notice right here there this is 8 minus
and there's a positive over here and you
might not understand why I added 6
instead of subtracting 6 but remember
when we did some basic algebra and we
said that this is the same thing as
adding a negative
well that negative stays on that 3 it
doesn't go with the 6 so you that's you
really have to make sure that you pay
attention to your signs because that'll
mess up what you get is a final answer
we have one more so we have this part is
gonna stay the same we're going to
distribute that negative negative 6x
plus 8y minus 11 now this time we have
more than one variable but that really
doesn't change anything because we're
still gonna combine like terms like we
would normally would so 7y plus 8y is 15
y plus 4x minus 6x is negative 2x and 9
minus 11 is negative 2 so that's all
we're gonna do with pollen
wheels today but make sure you come back
and watch our next lesson where we're
gonna talk about multiplying a
polynomial by a monomial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
