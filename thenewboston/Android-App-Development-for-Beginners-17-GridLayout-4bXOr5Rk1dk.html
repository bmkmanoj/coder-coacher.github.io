video and in this tutorial I want to
start talking to you guys about grid
layout it's a very simple layout it's a
lot easier to understand than a relative
layout so that's what we're going to be
doing and also I probably should mention
I started a brand new project and I
chose blank activity so do that as well
I didn't think I needed a walk you guys
through a sense I know I already did
like three times I anyways brand new
project Blake activity choose any name
that you want and once it opens up you
should be looking at this screen right
here so the first thing I actually want
to do is just get rid of this text view
because I want to start from scratch so
delete that now a grid layout is pretty
much exactly like you would think if you
hover over it it says a layout that
places is children or allows you to
arrange widgets in a grid now of course
a grid just like a spreadsheet or
anything is made up of rows in columns
so it's really easy to start placing
everything out and probably any app that
you make it's going to use at least a 1
grid layout at least all the apps that I
made I always use grid layout so the
first thing we obviously need to do is
take this grid layout and drag it on
your screen and just put it in the top
left right now looks good now another
thing I want to do before you start
adding any widgets to this layout is
this I only want this layout to fit to
the size of whatever contents it has so
right now it's taking up our entire
screen so in order to pretty much just
adapt to the size of whatever is inside
it what you can do is you can actually
just go up to these buttons right here
and this one says set layout width to
wrap content so click that and the
vertical arrows sets the layout height
to wrap content so click each of those
and now your layouts height in width is
pretty much zero zero so this way it's
going to wrap to whatever stuff we put
inside it aka widgets so let's add a
couple buttons to it
now so actually if you go down to button
right here and drag it over that dot
you're going to see row 0 column 0 and
drop it in so essentially every widget
you add is going to have coordinates of
a row and a column left and right
sorrows top and down this column so
again since we only have one thing in
here this is it coordinates 0 0 so
actually what I'm going to do is if I
have this button selected go down the
text and rename the text on this button
to Center and hit enter so we'll say
that I know maybe we're going to make a
layout with three columns and two rows
and we want this button to be the center
one well let's go ahead and add another
button to the right of this so I'm going
to go ahead click on button again you
start dragging it and as you can see I
can't place it here because there's
already something here I could place it
to the left and it says insert before
column zero what I want to do is place
it to the right and it says insert row
zero which is the first row after column
zero so whenever I do that it places it
to the right and therefore I'm going to
name this one right hit enter and do the
same thing with left real quick drag
this button and place it before column
zero so again before you place it in it
gives you a little like hint of where
you're going to drop it I'm just going
to name this one left and hit enter so
the first thing you probably notice is
that okay
whenever I added a widget I get these
green bars right here and these green
bars they actually just represent the
entire row or the entire column so if
you do something like this take another
button and drag it under the left so it
says after row 0 column 0 which pretty
much means the first
column in the second row then what you
can do is rename this through bottom and
hit enter and check it out so again you
can actually select these green bars and
it's the same as selecting the entire
row so I can take this one right here
grab it with my mouse and drag it above
row one and they switch places so again
that's what that does and another cool
thing that you can do is if you ever
want to delete an entire row what you
can do is you can right-click this and
choose delete and it deletes that entire
row so that's a cool little tip that's
going to save you some time but I didn't
want to delete that so I'm just going to
hold down ctrl Z on my keyboard and I
got it back so this is pretty cool right
now but one other thing that I want to
do is show you guys how to take one of
these widgets and have it span multiple
cells so say that I actually wanted this
right button to take up this cell and
the cell below it so what I can do is
actually select that right button and if
I scroll all the way up in the
properties then I'm going to see some
properties at the very top that say
column span and row span now again
whenever you want to span something down
you need to span across multiple rows
see what I'm saying
so for the row span when I have that
button selected if I add something like
2 in here watch what happens to these
blue gridlines hit enter so now this one
cell is taking up two rows so this row
span is pretty much asking how many rows
do you want to take up well two good
enough now we can actually do this with
this bottom button say that we wanted
this cell to take up two columns so we
go to column span and add to right here
so now we have one cell that's the width
of two columns but the problem that you
guys already see is these widgets or
these buttons they don't just
automatically expand to take up the
contents of the cell so how do we do
that well anytime you want to adjust the
positioning or size of a button or a
widget you actually need to use the
gravity property now select your widget
and go down to layout gravity and expand
this so the first thing that we can do
is if we want to take this button and
center it in the middle of these cells
or the cell I guess it's more
technically as is we can go to layout
gravity center vertical so that's going
to take whatever contents are in it and
Center it vertically pretty sweet but
now if you're like okay that's nice but
I actually wanted to have that button
fill the entire contents of the cell
well we can do that as well again in
your gravity property right here if you
go down I guess you didn't need to go
down but if you go to fill vertical then
watch what happens whenever I click this
it expands vertically to fit or fill the
entire contents of the cell now another
cool thing that I should probably
mention is whenever you fill this button
to pretty much fill the vertical area
you actually don't need to Center it
anymore so you can go to Center and
unset that so centering a widget is only
useful whenever the widget doesn't take
up the entire area right now it would
just be a waste so again fill vertical
is going to fill the entire area
vertically and we can actually do the
same thing for this so right now this
button is only taking up half the area
if we ever want to fill it to fit the
entire area horizontally you guys can
probably guess what's going to happen
fill horizontal so there you go
so that's a real basis basics can talk
today of a grid layout again you can
adjust things or align them in rows and
columns and this is how you span across
multiple cells and also take any widget
and fill it to fit however many cells
that you want so for now thank you guys
for watching don't forget subscribe and
for your challenge or your homework this
is why I want you guys to do I want you
guys to design the coolest layout using
a grid layout take a screenshot of it
and post it on my forum so even if it's
not that great then just go ahead and
take a screenshot of it and post it on
my forum and well once you completed
that challenge you are ready to move on
to the next video
so then guys for watching don't forget
to subscribe and I'll see you guys next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
