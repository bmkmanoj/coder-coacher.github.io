physics video and in this video it's
actually probably going to be a real
quick video because I just want to go
over some terminology real quick some
other variables that we're going to need
whenever we talk about waves and we're
going to be using these in a lot of
different formulas as well so the first
I want to say term that we use whenever
we talk about waves is just the speed of
the wave or the waves of velocity now I
don't really need to explain to you guys
you know what velocity means because if
we go ahead and assume that we're
looking at the ocean
alright ocean so you guys don't forget
what I said and we look at all these
waves right here then of course the
velocity is how fast a wave is traveling
simple enough so a wavelength is the
next property that we look at now
wavelength is a topic that a lot of
people get confused about because if
you're just looking at these waves right
here you back okay do I measure from
here to here or from the bottom to the
top of the wave what the heck am I
supposed to measure
well wavelength is actually measured
from crest to crest so the crest of
course is the maximum height of the wave
which on this wave if it would be here
and on this wave it would be here so
from point A to point B that distance
right there would be the wavelength of
this wave right here now the last term I
want to talk to you guys about in this
tutorial is amplitude so again imagine
that we're looking at the ocean now the
surface of the ocean on the calm day is
nice and flat just like that however on
a really windy day we get some waves so
the waves would be like okay something
like you know the ocean probably doesn't
look exactly like that but it's pretty
close so anyways what exactly is
amplitude well amplitude is defined as
the distance from the tip of the wave in
the tip is technically called the crest
of the wave or some people call it
maximum displacement but anyways it's
the distance from the tip of the wave
which would be
and get new color right here to the rest
position of the wave now the rest
position is basically the position
whenever the wave is at rest or the
water is calm so this from actually I
might as well do a and B since I did in
the last time so A to B would be the
amplitude so again remember the
difference between these two points a
and C would be the wave length and the
distance from a and B would be the
amplitude of the wave</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
