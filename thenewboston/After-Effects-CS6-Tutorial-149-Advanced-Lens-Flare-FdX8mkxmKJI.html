After Effects cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and today
I'm going to show you a trick that I
learned on how to use your lens flares a
little bit better and how to composite
them in your project instead of putting
them directly onto an effect or
something like that so the way we're
gonna do that is by creating a solid and
then applying the lens flare to a solid
and then adding a blending mode to fix
out or to get out like the actual color
of the solid and then by doing this
you're able to do things like change the
color of your lens flare and stuff like
that so you're not just stuck with
whatever you have so I'll show you how
to do that starting now so let's go and
we've got just a regular comp here with
just a logo and a background picture now
I want to add a lens flare to it but
your client wants a different color lens
flare and we got After Effects here that
it only gives us three native lens
flares so what we're gonna do is create
a black solid so let's go to a new salad
and we've got a black solid here use
your color picker to make sure you pick
all the way black or just type in zero
zero zero zero down here in the number
thing so we've got that and we're just
gonna name this one lens flare
and hit okay so now we've just got this
black solid over top of everything and
you want your solid your black solid at
the top because the lens flare is going
to be composited over the top or if you
want it behind your logo you can put it
there so I'll show you the order in a
second so let's go to effect Norse go to
effect I'm right-clicking on these to
bring up these menus and then we're
gonna go to generate and we're gonna go
to lens flare now we've got our lens
flare here so adjust your lens flare the
way you want it I guess I'd do it after
I do this so we're gonna click on our
toggle switches and modes button down
here at the very bottom until we get on
to this set of modes here where we can
change the blending mode and we're gonna
change it to screen and that takes out
all the black because that's how screen
works and now we're left here with our
lens flare and it's basically working
exactly like the lens flare without it
would work except for it's composited on
top now let's go to something like
effect color correction and then we'll
go to hue and saturation and I can move
this master hue or the master saturation
or lightness to change how our lens
flare looks so let's move this and you
can see now we've got a green lens flare
here's a blue so that's how you can
change the color of your lens flare we
got our saturation here we can make a
really saturated lens flare or a
black-and-white lens flare and then of
course the brightness which doesn't
actually work a lot since we're using
the screen color
we're using a screen effect or screen
blending mode I keep on saying the wrong
thing so the lightness is something you
don't really want to mess with so that's
how we do that now if I want to go
behind the logo we'll just drag it down
underneath the logo and now the logo is
over top of the lens flare so I'll show
you that again here's an above and
here's below so I mean that's how that's
how that works it's just a quick tip so
you can use your lens flares more
efficiently and not have the basic lens
flares that everybody will recognize in
After Effects so thanks for watching
this quick tip hopefully it's useful to
you and thanks a lot for watching have a
good one everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
