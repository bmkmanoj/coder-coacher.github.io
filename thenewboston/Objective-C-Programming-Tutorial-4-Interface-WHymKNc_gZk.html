your let's see fourth objective-c
tutorial and in this tutorial we're
going to be talking about some concepts
that are at the heart of Objective C and
that's specifically classes objects and
methods now just like real life your
computer program has classes objects and
methods and let me give you an example
in real life a class would be any
classification that an object belongs to
so for example I'm an object my name is
Bucky I belong to the class of people or
persons and like I said that class has a
bunch of objects you me your friend Tom
your Aunt Sarah um so pretty much
classes are classifications for objects
now in addition to meaning you just
being classified somewhere we also can
do stuff we can sneeze we can breathe we
can eat these would be things called
methods so there are classes which
classify objects and objects can do
things and these are called doing
methods so the computer program in
Objective C is set up exactly like this
so this is what we're going to be
building in not only this next tutorial
but all the tutorials to come it's the
heart the key concept of objective-c
so there are a couple important parts in
anytime you want to build a class the
first thing you need is something called
the interface and what the interface
does it pretty much describes all the
information that's going to be in the
class so let's go ahead and in order to
get started go ahead and press at sign
interface and you see it gives you a
blueprint right here you need to name
the class the superclass which means
where this class came from this is I'm
not even going to touch this in this
story oh this has to do with inheritance
um ivar is where - pretty much the
instance variables and well you'll see
later on though just be easier if I just
type it so we have an interface and this
is pretty much what class do we
unbowed well we want a general class
called person and this is pretty much a
blueprint for every object to follow and
the objects are going to be people like
me and you so we have an interface
called person and just go ahead and
press : put NS object this is the parent
class like I said this has to deal with
inheritance this is the only thing
you're not going to understand this
program but it's concept that we should
not be covering right now so anyways
what kind of traits or variables does
every person have well as general
blueprint for every person they have an
age in a weight so that's the only thing
we care about for this tutorial so go
ahead and put int age since it's an
integer value and int weight there we go
I'll get it eventually so now we have
two kind of qualities about us and these
are called variables we have age in a
weight so when we build objects later on
called well you know like Bucky or Tom
we can give them an aging weight so now
aside from this once we're done putting
in the instance variables we need to put
methods and again like I send methods
are things that objects do so in order
you would usually have stuff like sneeze
eat breathe drive car but for this we're
going to keep it real simple what we
want to do is just have a little print
statement just to check to see if
everything works and we also need a
method called set age and set weight
without this you wouldn't be able to set
the value of age and weight so we need a
method to be like set age of 23 set
weight to 350 so that's where we're
going to be doing in order to create
methods for your interface here's what
you need to do go ahead and print - and
now inside armed parentheses this is
called the return value what do you want
your method to return well this is going
to be a weird concept for you to
understand but we're pretty much just
going to be changing variables and we
don't we're not asking for anything back
so if you're saying alright if you have
like a method called calculate
temperature you would want an integer
value back if you had a method called
what's your name you'd want armed you
guys don't know a string is yet string
back and this would be like letters and
words but we're just going to be
printing something out on the screen and
we're going to be like our air computer
we're just going to change something we
don't need anything back for you so go
ahead and put void right there and this
means we don't need anything back next
we need to name our method and we're
just going to name it print simple
enough so aside from just in by the way
this print is just going to be text on
the screen and it's just going to say I
am blank years old and I weigh blank
depending on what we set our variables
to so now now that we have our print
method let's go ahead and make two more
methods like I say we need to make two
more methods to change or excuse me to
give a value to age and weight so that's
what we need to do right now so when we
do this we don't need anything back so
put void and just name this method set
age and now what we need to do is since
we're going to be giving it a value
we're going to need to put something in
called a method argument so instead of
having a semicolon
this would mean end the method go ahead
and put a regular colon and this is
going to say alright some methods needed
arguments and some don't an argument is
pretty much a piece of information that
it would need so whenever we set the age
we of course need to tell it an integer
value that it would need so go ahead and
inside parentheses type int and you can
name your age anything I'm going to name
mine a so here's what's going to happen
we're going to make a method called set
age and it's going to require a little
bit of information called a and this is
going to temporarily hold the value of a
you'll see later on whenever I create it
is going to be real simple but for now
this is pretty much just the blueprint
so the last thing we need to do is do
this exact same thing for wave whenever
we create this method we're just going
to be giving it away we're not asking
for anything in return so that's why put
void we're going to name it set weight
and the piece of information that we're
going to give you is an integer value
and we're going to name the weight W so
now that we have our interface built on
that's everything we need for persons so
go ahead and press at and and now your
computer knows to end the main interface
or blueprint so here's what we have
setup so far we have a class called
person and it has two qualities a
person's going to have an H and a person
is going to have a weight now what this
person is going to be able to do is
print out a little saying that's going
to say something like I am 23 and weigh
a hundred pounds and why we have set age
and set weight is because we read we
need methods to actually give it a age
and give it away so that's why we need
these two set methods so we have our
interface built simple enough in the
next tutorial we're going to be building
our second and maybe third part of our
class so for now that's all you get I'm
