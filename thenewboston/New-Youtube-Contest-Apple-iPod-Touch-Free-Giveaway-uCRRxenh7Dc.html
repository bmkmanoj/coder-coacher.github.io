another computer contest where I gave
away a computer so congratulations to

give you guys a choice between a new
computer and brand new ipod touch and
you guys voted on my website the new
boston calm and you chose doesn't it it
in a brand new ipod touch for me to give
away so here it is i just got it in the
mail so one of you guys will be winning
this shortly so if you followed any of
my contest before the rules are same as
always a you need to be a subscriber in
order to win so if you're not yet a
subscriber go ahead and click that
little yellow button on the right side
of your screen and once you click that
you're eligible to be in the contest
part to wait for this video to hit
100,000 views once this video hits a
hundred thousand views you need to start
commenting once I see this video hit a
hundred thousand views I'm going to look
in the most recent comment I see is the
winner and that's of course if they are
a subscriber so again i'm going to be
posting the rolls under the description
on your right so if you have any
questions just check there but again to
review you need to be a subscriber wait
for this video to hit a hundred thousand
views once it does just start commenting
in comments and loy and once I see that
the video hit 100,000 views I'm going to
pick the most recent comment I see and
if that person is a subscriber then
they're the winner of the brand new ipod
touch I'm afraid to even take it out of
its case so I'm going to leave it in
here until it gets mailed to you so here
it is this could be yours so thank you
