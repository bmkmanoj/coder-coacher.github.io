tutorial and in this video I want to
talk to you guys about vectors now a
vector and R is a little bit different
actually it's a lot different than a
vector in math or physics because a
vector in our programming is basically
just a list of items so there are a
couple of different rules and it's kind
of weird how to make vectors but they
are incredibly useful and we're going to
be working with them a ton especially
helpful dealing with a bunch of data so
how do you create a vector well you
start out by just creating a normal
variable let's just go ahead and name
this uh I just named B for Bucky so
we're going to make two vectors the
first one is b1 for I don't know
got nothing else to name it and act like
you're making a variable except for the
value you need to type the letter C now
what C does is it's actually a function
to combine a list of items so the first
thing we can do is just make a vector of
numbers or a list of numbers so let's
put 1 2 3 4 5 so this is a vector called
b1 and now let me make another one
called b2 and in addition to making a
list of numbers you can also make a list
of text or words so let's just name this
one let's just put a list of names in
here Bucky Hoss
Emma all right good enough so basically
we made two lists we made one called b1
which stored a bunch of numbers and
another called b2 which stored a bunch
of names now anytime you want to output
a vector you just type the name of it so
b1 b2 highlight it run it check it out
so this is vector 1 this is vector 2 are
a pretty freakin a dumb I mean we can
make a list of items what what's the use
in that well the cool thing about
vectors is you can perform mathematical
operations to every single item and a
vector incredibly simply or incredibly
simple I don't know how to say I don't
know how to talk and what I'm talking
about is this you can do things like b1
and multiply it by let's say 2 and
whenever you run this actually let me
get rid of this we don't need those
anymore and whenever you run this check
it out
it takes that entire list which is 5
items 1 2 3 4 and 5 and it multiplied
every single item by 2 2 4 6 8 10
so instead of having to type you know
five different lines of code in
multiplying each one by two we can do
all in one single line and that's also a
little different than other programming
languages because other programming
languages you need to make something
called a loop to do this and with our
it's incredibly easy now some other cool
functions that you can do is if you use
I don't even know it's called the carrot
maybe above the six on your keyboard
it looks like an up arrow what this is
going to do is it's going to take all of
these items and you can actually use any
exponent right here but it's pretty much
pretty much going to do 1 to the power
of 3 2 to the power of 3 3 to the power
of 3 so let's go ahead and run that
right now
so you see 1 8 3 to the power of 3 is 27
4 to the power of 3 64 so forth and so
forth
so that's pretty cool and
and even cooler one is you can actually
take this vector and throw the entire
thing inside a function so if you want
to do the square root the name for that
is sq RT and you can type b1 in there
and now what this is going to do is it's
going to get the square root of that
entire list the square root of 1 is 1 so
on and so forth
a lot faster than you know if you just
had a calculator or something like that
so that is basically how you create a
very simple vector and how you perform a
few operations to your vector but trust
me we are just we didn't even what's a
call like you didn't get started with it
these vectors are incredibly powerful
and things I'm going to be teaching guys
in the upcoming tutorials they're going
to blow your mind so for now thanks for
watching and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
