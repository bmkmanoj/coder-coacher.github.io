welcome to your 83rd drop tutorial now
we're actually going to be getting back
with gooeys and learning about layouts
again after a short break
learning about files and exception
handling and stuff like that so in this
story I will be teaching guys about
something called flow layout and I know
we used before but this time I really
want to show you guys the details up so
let's go ahead and I'm going to make a
program that has some buttons on the
screen and depending on what button you
click depends on what the full layout is
set as so let's go ahead and make fruit
three variables they're all going to be
private so private J bun and I'll just
name this like left button and go ahead
and copy that and we're going to name
one CB and RB in this gonna stand for
center button and right button so I
change this to CB this is going to be
Center button and this is going to be
the right button right there
so now that we have three buttons or at
least three variables what we need is a
flow layout and a container object so go
ahead and make a private flow layout and
you can neighbor is anything you want
I'm going to name and layout because
it's easy to remember and also we need a
private container object and I'm going
to container just like that make sure I
spelled it right and looks good enough
so now we can go ahead and build our
constructor and my classes name layout
so I'm going to name public layout for
my method and this will be my
constructor so again first thing we do
since we're extending jframe we can go
ahead and build our title using super
and I'm just going to name the title
because I'm that original and next we
need to go ahead and set our layout
object that we created right up here
with flow layout will set layout equal
to new flow layout and this pretty much
means we want our layout to go from when
we put things in there like buttons we
want to be range from left to right kind
of like Microsoft Word would do it so
now that we made our new flow layout and
we're actually going to be changing this
depending on what
on WordPress but for now that's good so
now after this we need to set our
container object equal to something soap
container and set this equal to get
content pane which pretty much means get
the bulk of your window and this is
pretty much just so it knows word put
the stuff so now let's go ahead and set
that layout so we'll set the layout
equal to layout and this pretty much
means layout equal set layout new flow
layout so I mean simple enough now let's
go ahead in we can finally do stuff with
our buttons this is pretty much creating
a window now let's add some stuff in it
so first thing we need is equal left
button set the equal to nu J button and
give it something to put in the button
and what goes in your parameters for nu
J button is the text that's going to
appear on the button so my but I have a
button on the screen now that says left
on it so now let's go ahead and add that
to the screen I just kidding I didn't
have it oh but now I do have it on my
screen so as I just added it so now we
said it gave us some content and we
added it to our screen next let's add
some functionality to this so we do this
by l.b dot add action and look at that
it already made it for us add action
listener now we can either write an
object in here or to make things easier
let's use an anonymous inner class and
you see said method arm well it doesn't
give us yet but it needs to use a new
action listener and this is the class
and this is again anonymous inner class
if I change that and now if you
highlight this it says it must implement
the method action listener action
performed so if it told us to do it
let's just do it
we're easily influenced so let's just go
ahead and put something like well this
better method first before we start
thinking about that public void action
performed and for our parameter type
action event event
and now we can go ahead and add some
functionality to this and what do we
want to happen whenever we click this
left button finally after all of this
adding we finally get to the meet right
here the body of our action perform
method what do we want to happen when we
click the button
well well first of all we want to change
that layout since we click the left
button let's go ahead and set the
alignment and got a nice sort of
shortcut right there and what you set it
to is flow layout dot left and what this
is going to do is take your entire
layout for your window not just this but
not just this button but the entire
layout and change everything to left
alignment so by default it's going to be
in the center of the screen and when you
click this it's going to be on the left
so next the only thing we need to do is
put layout that we just change but
layout container which is pretty much
our container and go ahead and pass
container in this and this pretty much
means rearrange everything depending on
what our layout is so now we did this
for the left now we can just go ahead
and do this two more times and make it
real easy to copy it so I'm actually
going to add a comment so I don't get
confused just pull left stuff in here in
here so now let's go ahead and copy
everything included in that comment and
put Center stuff in here and change this
the center button add center button to
the screen add action listener for
center button and change the flow layout
to Center which is the default but again
we need to do that
now we need to do it for the right so
let's put right stuff in here and add
the right button to the screen add an
action listener for the right bond again
center button and a right button were a
lot quicker so and not that easy house
and now let's go ahead and run this
program so what I tell you guys what I
did after I run it I know you guys are
probably getting antsy so let's go ahead
and run this baby and here's what I got
whoa forgot to change my text on my
button quite embarrassing so this is
left stuff
and I put left-center again don't forget
when you create your buttons to do that
embarrassing so let's go ahead and now
oh my God look at this program here is
my window that I just created right here
and as you can see it doesn't matter if
it resizes it or not it automatically
rearranges from left to right and if you
run out of realist acts under each other
so now if you see if I click the left it
changes it to left right changes the
right and center chooses the center and
you can see even if we do this then we
get right left center so it doesn't
really matter how big your window is it
just knows the flow layout depending on
the size um where do I want stuff
arranged so that's pretty much the
basics of flow layout and one more time
let's see how much time I have on my
tutorial about two minutes so let me go
ahead and walk you guys through this we
created three variables for the buttons
and we actually created a flow layout
and container object because we needed
them this is just housekeeping stuff for
creating a window in your constructor
and let's just go over one of these we
added pretty much some we set the left
button variable equal to a button since
you know why not then we added that
button to the screen and then all of
this pretty much is just saying all
right what do you want to happen when
you click this button and what did we
want to happen we wanted to change your
layout and then we want to just reset
the container using that so and then we
just did it for the center and right
button and here's my main in case you
forgot I included a Java X swing because
that's the window and well you can see
all that you guys already know what this
does already hopefully if you watch my
tutorials so that is that for this
tutorial thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe and I will see
you next time oh by the way we're going
to be creating game soon so uh you know
just thought I'd let you guys know but
anyways thank you guys for watching and
uh don't forget subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
