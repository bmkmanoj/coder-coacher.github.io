and this is a video tutorial for the new
Boston now in this series of tutorials
we're going to be creating a user login
and registration system or rather a user
registration and login system we're
going to create the login process first
then create the register system the
registration system the reason you
should do it this way is because you
want to make sure your login is
processed correctly before you start to
register your users it just works out
generally a lot better this way and
obviously just a few notes before we
begin I'm going to be creating the login
and register system with just two fields
and that is the username and the
password
in fact no will include the first name
in the last name as well the reason I'm
not going to include things like email
address address or whatever you whatever
else you're planning to store for your
users is because if we spend a lot of
time creating extra fields in the
tutorial we're going to be wasting
valuable learning time whereas once
you've completed the tutorial and you
understand how fields are created and
how we can register users then you can
obviously go ahead and input your own
unique field form fields so the first
thing we need to do we're not going to
be writing any code in this tutorial
we're going to be coming over to PHP
myadmin I'm going to be setting up our
table that we're going to store user
data and then what we're going to do is
pop a few sort of piece of dummy data in
there if you like so we're going to
register a couple of users manually
using phpMyAdmin so the first thing i've
done is i've already created my database
in PHP myadmin you should know how to do
this
so I've created my database now I need
to create a table I'm going to call this
table just simply users now we need to
determine how many fields we need to
store so the first field I'm going to
store is let's just blank this so we can
write some notes I'm going to feel the
first field I'm going to store is the ID
this is obviously going to be the unique
field this is going to be
primarykey and it's going to be
autoincrement as well we also need to
start obviously the username the
password it's popped over the first name
and we'll say Serling so these are the
four fields or five fields that we need
to include in our program we can also
include things like register day
registration date but we're not going to
do that for now like I said the purpose
of the tutorial is to show you how to
include everything and put everything
together so let's go ahead and create
these fields let's delete that first of
all remember is five fields so we type
five in there and click go okay so now
to set up each field so ID is obviously
going to be an integer because it's
going to be an auto incrementing value
so let's go ahead we that's int by
default and go ahead and we're going to
set the index to primary because it's a
unique field in our table and also a I
which stands for Auto increment so for
every value that's created for every row
that's created this will increment by
one giving each user a unique number
starting from one okay so the next one
is username then we have password then
we have first-name and also we have
surname and so for the username and
password we're going to pick a varchar'
datatype the same with the first name in
the last name so we can do these well
while we're selecting the others okay so
the username and password I'm going to
give a limit of both 30 characters the
first name and the surname I'm going to
say 40 now obviously you can change
these limits yourself you can change
them to whatever you want I'm just doing
this for sort of ease of use and
teaching but I generally I'd say that a
username or password shouldn't be more
than 30 characters and a first name and
surname should be more than 40
characters just in case we have an extra
long name so we don't need to set any
other properties for these we can go
ahead and click Save down here and we'll
just examine our structure of our table
just to make sure everything's correct
so we've got ID it's underlined to be no
it's a primary key
we've got auto increment on this under
the extra and int is 11 characters
that's up that you find this could be a
small or medium int but we'll keep it
this just in case we need to register
lots and lots and lots of users username
and password of both variable character
variable characters and their length of
30 and first name and surname also
variable characters and their length of
40 okay so with a set up our table let's
go ahead and put some data inside of
here now there's one thing to bear in
mind we're going to be storing our
password as an md5 hash that reminds me
actually let's go back to our structure
and let's change the password field here
so let's click check that and then click
the edit button let's change this to 32
now the reason we're changing this to 32
is we're storing the password as an md5
hash therefore an md5 hash will always
or more or less always most of the time
equal with the length of 32 so whatever
sort of length that passed but it is our
md5 hash will typically be 32 characters
so we're storing a 32 character password
in here because that will be the md5
hash and if you don't know what an md5
hashes or you don't know how to create
one with PHP and take a look at my other
tutorial on md5 hashes and that will
sort of walk you through what how we
relate that to passwords okay so let's
go ahead and insert some data now
there's a couple of things we need to do
with the password we can't just enter a
normal password in here we need to an
input an md5 hash and you'll see later
on when we register our users we're
going to convert the password that
they've entered in a text field to an
md5 hash before we insert it into the
database but for now I'm going to create
a PHP script too quickly and convert a
password that I want to manually put
into here so my username is going to be
Alex
we'll leave the password blank for now
I'm going
put my first and surname in and the
password is going to be equal to the
value password so my password is going
to read password in fact we'll we'll do
pass pass one two three that's a lot
better so we don't get confused between
field name and the actual password so
I'm going to echo out md5 and in here
I'm going to put pass one two three and
this is going to return the md5 hash
okay so I can just copy that and paste
that into my database so obviously you
won't have to do this when you're
registering your users and I'm going to
click go
okay so there let's click browse to make
sure the data is in there okay so we've
got ID of one that's automatically
updated that for us that's an ID of one
use name is Alex password is this hash
which is equivalent to pass one two
three or the hash of pass one two three
first-name Alex and surname Garret okay
so now that we've registered or manually
register the user we are pretty much
done setting up our database setting up
our table rather and inserting this
value so in the next part what we're
going to be doing is logging this user
