thirtieth c-sharp tutorial and I'm
making for the new Boston and in this
tutorial we're going to continue working
on our paint project so the person we're
going to do is allow the user to change
the color of their pen so let's just go
over to our tool strip here and add a
button to it and then let's change the
text of that button to and color and
make it so that each text shows instead
of the image and I'm going to use your
clicks on this button we're it's going
to have a color dialog appear so the
user can choose the color over the pen
so we're going to preview color dialog
here I'll call it CD and send just go to
a new color dialog and then we're going
to check to see if the user actually
select a color and the color dialog so
it's going to say STD - Oh dialog evil
dialog result okay
then we're going to set this buttons
text color equal to whatever color that
user selects in the color dialog so that
they can have an idea of the color that
they're picking so we're going to say on
the tool strip button one text no dot or
color equals CD color and then when the
user goes to draw we're going to say the
color equals tool strip but one dot for
color
so now when the user selects the color
in the color dialog it's going to set
this buttons text color equal to
whatever um color that the user selects
in the color dialog and then when we go
to draw the color that they're going to
use either color of the buttons text so
now maybe bug here and select the pen
sighs okay I'll I'll connect to
something rather big and then we can
change the pen color to something else
like orange you click okay we can see
that that text of that button changed
now we draw we draw an orange and it's
all smooth because in the last tutorial
I showed you how to do that all right
now the next thing that you need to do
is a way to clear all of the things
we've drew
on so right now if you wanted to start
over we'd have to close the application
and run it again well there's a way
easier way of clearing the form so we're
just going to add another button to our
tool strip called ear canvas we're all
right and then we're just going to make
it so again that text is displayed and
in order to clear it we're just going to
use our graphics up here so we can just
say d dot clear and it calls for a color
that we're going to clear and if we put
in white right there then the background
color this would be white well we don't
want that so we're going to say um camel
one Mac color so whatever color or
background color this is set to it'll
just clear it to that color so this way
we can have a user change the color
later on so right now
click to to the pen color I'll choose
orange I guess and draw well if you want
to clear it clear canvas and it just
clears everything we've drawn now the
last thing that we're going to do is
allow the user to choose a color for the
canvas so let's go right here and add
another button and this would be called
canvas color and it's like before we're
going to change it so that only the text
and displayed on the button and we're
just going to go ahead and copy this
color dialog or up here so that now it's
going to have a color dialog you display
when you click this button and we're
just method changes to button 3 because
this is the third button as you can see
and if we go over to the properties
panel it says you can right up there
tool strip button 3 so we want to change
the 4 color of this text to this and
then we're also going to change the
panel's background color to whatever
color that user selects in this color
dialog so we can say panel 1 back color
equals Steve
color alright so now you debug here we
can choose a canvas color so if you want
to make it light now the background
color for our panel is white through the
pen size and color
Al's even black right now we can draw
and now let me click clear your canvas
we can see that it will clear it to
white because when we click clear canvas
it will just clear it to the current
background color of the canvas now if
you're on black but completely canvas
and yet pick through it but you can see
this canvas color you can't really see
that we change it to white but they just
change the text color of it so if we
choose like green or something make a
pen color like round clear it oops
clear it and it's clear the canvas
alright so that's pretty much it for
this tutorial so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
