with a video tutorial for the new Boston
in this tutorial we're going to be
installing a plug-in and using it on our
page here where we have a paragraph of
text now what we're going to be doing is
we're going to be installing this
particular plug-in here found at this
web address just here so if you want to
go ahead and just go ahead and type this
into your browser you can come on you'll
obviously come on to the page and we'll
look at downloading it and installing on
here and the first we're going to be
looking at it in terms of sending a
variable to the particular page for
example at the moment we're on index dot
PHP and we're going to be highlighting a
particular word so for example search
and the first thing that this will do is
it will it will highlight any keywords
with the other word any words on the
page with the search term search so this
word here will be searched will be
highlighted for example if we would
change this to a for example every
letter in here with a would be
highlighted just here so let's go ahead
and first of all look at how we're going
to install this plug-in and then we'll
go ahead and actually create this in
this way we're then going to be creating
a more dynamic search on our page using
jQuery to actually search so we're first
of all going to be using a form that
will submit this get variable and then
secondly we'll look at actually
installing it with a button and an event
handler so like I said if you go over to
this page we can come down here you can
see a demo of this but we'll skip that
just for now and you can download this
file here jQuery highlight is so I'm
going to go ahead and click on that and
this just gives me the code for this
plug-in so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to go ahead and copy that and open
up my text browser sorry my text editor
you can see I've got ext dot J s which
is already included in my page and I've
got style dot CSS which is included as a
stylesheet up here we're going to be
creating our form just here
but first of all we want to go ahead and
create a file for this plugin and also
then include that on the page so the
first thing we want to do is create a
new document and just paste the contents
of this plug-in in we want to go ahead
and save that in our J's folder and I'm
just going to save this as highlight j/s
so now I've saved this file we can
confidently go ahead and just close that
off now but now we need to go ahead and
include it on our page now ext look j/s
is where we're going to handle our
jQuery and so we're going to do that in
just a moment
however we need to go ahead and include
this and include this plug-in first so
let's go ahead and say script type
equals and we'll just close our script
tag off there it's a text JavaScript
type so text JavaScript and the source
we just need to go ahead and include j/s
forward slash and then we saved it as
highlight j/s so now that we've got this
plug-in available to use we can actually
go ahead and use it now what I'm going
to do is I'm not going to include the
original functionality that I said with
regards to highlight equals search I
just feel this is going to be a bit too
sort of long-winded and everything we're
going to need an additional plugin to
read the variables as well so what I'll
go ahead and do is we'll just go and do
the jQuery where I guess that's a bit
more appropriate as well so okay inside
another paragraph tag I want to go ahead
and create my form so at the moment on
my page we just have this sort of
paragraph of text now what we want to go
ahead and do is just create our first of
all a text input type so text like that
and then we want to go ahead and create
a submit button as well or just a plain
button so the type in this case it's
going to be button so the value here of
the button is going to just be find and
you'll see that gives us the result here
we've got a text input field and a fine
button so we're going to go ahead and
type something into here click find and
the relevant information is going to be
highlighted on the page now as part of
this
as part of this plugin we're going to
need to specify a highlight class inside
star dot CSS and obviously this can be
tailored to how you want the particular
word to be highlighted for example you
could just want it bold or you know in
any case it doesn't really matter in
this case we're just going to highlight
it with a background of yellow just to
keep things simple so we need a way to
reference these input fields or you know
this input button as well using jQuery
so we're going to need to go ahead and
give these an ID so this one here will
sorry ID this one here is going to be
search underscore term so we can use
that to grab the value of the text that
we've typed and here I'm going to call
this search underscore button okay so
now that we've done this nothing on our
page has change we just have our text
field and find but we need to go into
ext dot j s to actually pick up and
apply an event handler to this button
which will then in turn grab the value
from this text field so inside ext is
we're going to say document dot ready
this just ensures that our document has
loaded our elements have loaded or our
Dom is ready and available to use so
alternatively you could go ahead and use
Windows load but that's I'm not really
required in this in this case so once
our document is ready we need to set up
an event handler for our button so I'm
going to go ahead and reference or
select our button which is search
underscore button so we use a hash and
then search underscore button and we
want to add the click event handler to
this now inside here once we click this
button we're going to run the code just
here so the code that we want to run is
obviously first of all we need to
retrain our retrieve the value that
we've typed into here so in this case
I'm going to go ahead and create a
variable and this is going to be called
search underscore term which is going to
be equal to selecting search underscore
term and then dot Val so dot val and
jquery just returns the value of the
search term
so I'm going to go ahead and just alert
the search term out just to you know see
if we've got everything working I'm
going to go ahead and type in here
search and click find and you see we
have an alert dialog box saying search
so essentially what's happened is we've
clicked the button once we've clicked
the button here we grab the search time
using Val from this search term text
field here and then we just go ahead and
add an alert that out now obviously we
don't just want to alert out we want to
highlight it so at the moment we can't
highlight anything unless we have a
class set up to deal with the well to
essentially highlight it I'm going to go
ahead and open highlight j/s again just
so we can take a look you see that
essentially what happens when we search
is we create a span element around this
particular sorry around this particular
search term so if we were to type search
in here and click find a span element
will be created around this search and
the class that belongs to it you can see
here span up class name is equal to
highlight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
