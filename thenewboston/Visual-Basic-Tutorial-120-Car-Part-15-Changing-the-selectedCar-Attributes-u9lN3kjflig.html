youtube.com slash on live gamer for the
new Boston and in this tutorial we're
gonna be talking about changing the
values of the car that is selected now
you can see that if we click Honda CRV
and we change the name to some other
name and click OK
and show the info you can see that the
name is still Honda CRV but then if we
go to Mustang GT you can see that the
name has been changed for that one now
the reason this is happening is because
in all of our button click events all we
do is change the default sports car name
so what we need to do is set this to
change the name of the selected car now
this is quite simple we'll just type
selected car dot car name equals
whatever the inbox input box returns now
let's go ahead and help the user out a
bit so we'll just add a new line here so
environment dot new line and then we'll
go ahead and tell them what the old name
is so we'll just type old name and then
we'll add the old name of the car so we
will type selected car dot car name now
this is shown before the value has been
changed so we'll go ahead and minimize
that right here and you can see that
I've done that for each of the other
buttons so selected card out color and
then I so I showed them the old color
and then have them input it and it will
change it for the selected car now if we
go to get power-to-weight ratio you can
see that I have commented commented this
out because the selected car may or may
not be a sports car and if it's not a
sports car then we get an error for the
get power-to-weight ratio so let's go
ahead and run this and see what kind of
results we get so let's create a new car
we will type we will call it a Sierra
we'll set the color to green the number
of doors to 4
I will set the horsepower to 300 we'll
go ahead and click Add and here's our
car right here now we can change the
color of it to let's say black it'll
show the info you can see that we get
the colored black right there and when
we change it again it shows us that the
old color is black now we can change the
number of doors to let's say 2 and you
can see that it's going to update that
there we can also accelerate the car so
we can accelerate it to 45 miles per
hour and you can see that the car is
going 45 now if we change the name of
this car to let's say Toyota Tundra and
click OK it's not gonna update it in our
list box but if we show the info info
it's still gonna update it now there's
an easy way to get around this and have
it update in the list box without having
to go through and reading every single
item in our ArrayList so let's go ahead
and come over here to button set name so
whenever they set the name of that car
what we want to do is update that name
in the list box so we'll start off by
accessing our list box so type list cars
dot idem x' and now what we can do is we
can add some parameters so you can see
that if we arrow down here we get index
as integer so we can access the
currently selected index so we'll type
list cars dot selected index and then
we'll go ahead and set that equal to
whatever the new name is so we'll just
type selected car dot car name so by the
time we're setting this new value it has
already been changed by using the input
box so let's go ahead and run this and
see what kind of results we get so we
won't make another car we'll just use
one that's already existent so let's go
ahead and change the name of the Mustang
so we'll change it to Camaro SS we'll go
ahead and click OK and you can see that
it updates the name in our list box and
it updates the name
whenever we show the info so go ahead
and add this code in for each one of
your click events and once you've done
that go ahead and move on to the next
tutorial and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
