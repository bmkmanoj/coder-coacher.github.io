44 and in this tutorial it's actually
going to be really easy what I have to
do is show you guys how to code the
clothes crap method and remember right
here finally once you're done having
your conversation once you know you
chatted with someone and you had enough
of them you you know close out of the
program and it closes all the crap in
Java it's pretty much the housekeeping
stuff what you need to do when you're
done using streams and sockets all that
crap so go ahead and make a new method
outside or right under your wild chating
method because this is going to happen
once you're done chatting and which name
it actually we need to code this first
closed streams and sockets after you are
done chatting looks pretty good so we'll
name this of course to have many choices
public void closed crap and obviously we
have to build this ourselves
Java would not be ridiculous enough to
name something close crap although I
wish there was a built in method called
close crap because that would just make
my day but anyways the first thing we
want to do is give the user prompt that
says um you know new line closing
connections dah dah because we ain't
done yet alright so this just you know
wow I definitely spelled connections
like that or you can me there you go
that's a little bit better so now we
just give them a nice little prompt that
says you know what closing connections
that were we're doing right now give us
some time to do it
so remember um when I told you guys that
it would be stupid and also not very
good in programming terms to let the
user be able to type when they're not
connected to anyone well that's the
first thing we want to do we want to
shut down their ability to type so able
to type go ahead and set this equal to
false and this is another small method
that we're going to have to build later
on so after this how do we shut down
everything well we actually need to put
it in a try-catch statement try catch
and what do you want to catch IO
exception I exception and if we couldn't
shut everything everything down
successfully we'll just go ahead and
print stacktrace
which pretty much shows us our error
message anyways hopefully we're not
going to see that hopefully what's going
to happen is it's going to allow us to
execute this try block which consists of
three very very short lines of code so
the first thing we need to do is we need
to close the streams when we are done
with it
so remember the name of the first stream
that we could send stuff to them was
output go ahead and close this which
pretty much says okay you don't need
that anymore I'm just going to close it
the input stream which pretty much
allowed us to you know receive messages
from the user input closed right like
that and the last thing that we need to
do is we need to close the overall
connection so the socket that's what I'm
talking about so connection close right
there closes the socket so again this
closes the socket or the main connection
between you know your computer and in
another computer the output causes a
stream to them and the input closes the
stream from them and you basically want
to close things down because if you
don't then it's just going to waste
memory and if you have a bunch of you
know empty servers or excuse me empty
streams and empty sockets sitting on
your server that don't get used then
it's just going to eat your memory over
and over and over again kind of be a
waste of you know memory and resources
on your server or computer so guys good
news that's all you have to do for
closing crap down again what this does
is once you're done chatting closes all
the streams and sockets pretty much good
housekeeping stuff so in the next
tutorial we're going to be getting rid
of you know 90% of these errors because
I'm going to be showing you guys how to
code that send message method which
basically takes a message and displays
it in your chat window so when I thank
you guys for watching or we can
subscribe and I'll see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
