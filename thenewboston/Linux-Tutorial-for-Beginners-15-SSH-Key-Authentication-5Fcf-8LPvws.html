we did is we set up our server it's
running fine if we ever want to connect
to it then what we can do is you can our
SSH root at the IP address and then it
just asks us for a password now like I
said before password authentication is
probably the worst type of
authentication it's not safe that's
hacked all the time instead what you
always want to do is you want to set up
SSH keys now without getting in too much
detail I'll explain in like 60 seconds
exactly what we're going to do and how
they work so in order to have a nice
secure connection we're going to make
two keys one is called a private key and
the other is called a public key now the
private key that's just going to stay on
our own personal computer so it's a way
to identify this computer that I'm
sitting at right now
now our public key that's the one that
we're going to upload to our server so
whenever we try to connect using this
you know special formula they're going
to look at those two keys and as long as
they match well they don't match but
they run a formula and as long as they
fit together then we're going to be able
to connect so it's a lot safer and it's
encrypted so no one can spy on your
connection and it's just awesome that
way so first thing we need to do is
generate these two keys guys probably
think it's pretty hard but check out how
easy it is just open your terminal type
SSH in and remember right now I'm not
connected to my server I'm just on my
own computer running these commands so
SSH - key gen and after this right - T
our sa now it's going to generate these
keys and wherever it sticks it by
default this is where you always want to
put it so by default whenever you try to
login it's going to look in this
directory don't change anything just hit
enter and if you want to protect it with
a password you can but for this tutorial
just going to keep things real simple so
what it did with one command is it
generated both the keys that we need so
this one right here is our private key
that's going to stay on our own computer
in this public one
is the one we got to stick on our server
so we can you know work together and you
know authenticate us so now if I let me
clear this out so you guys can see so
whenever you want to copy that public
key that we just generated to the server
just write SSH - copy - ID not Idi ID so
then you just write route at your
servers address right there and hit
enter so after you type in your password
boom check it out one key added so now
what we can do is this
so Denton on go in you know doing my
thing when out the lunch coming back you
know what feel like connecting to my
server maybe working on my website maybe
I feel like doing work for once so what
I can do now is this and actually let me
copy the IP address I don't know if I
had that copied still alright so now
whenever we type ssh route and try to
connect to our server check out what
happens
we're just connected we don't need to
type in a password or anything and
you're like umm why do you need to type
in the password well remember we have
that key on our computer and that's what
it automatically reads whenever we want
to connect so you know unless someone's
going to break into my house and start
going through all my private keys which
you know people don't usually do then we
are now able to log in easily and not
only is it easier to log in but we have
a much more safe and secure connection
pretty sweet boom roasted</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
