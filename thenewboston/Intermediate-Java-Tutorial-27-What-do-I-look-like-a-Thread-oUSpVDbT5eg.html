really draft tutorial now before you
even begin getting all excited that
we're going to be learning new code
error less tour I'll made a wee little
mistake add a new line after this last
percent D it's going to make it real
easier for you in the future
so in this run method make sure to add a
new line right after this percent D
trust me you'll thank me later so
anyways we created this class called
tuna which evidently made some object
and had this run method in it and I told
you guys I was going to teach you guys
something about threads so let's
actually create the thread so here's our
code how do we create a thread from it
well in order to create a thread here's
what we need to do type thread and then
give it a name t1 and then we need to
set it equal to new thread and as your
parameter for this you're right
what class do you want to make that
thread from and we wanted to create it
from the new tuna class and aside from
this our tuna class has constructor and
this is the name of the thread so I'm
going to name this first thread one and
again you can't pass a class in here
unless it implements runnable so that's
another thing it checks for so look at
this let me take one of those ends of
the way and look this I get an error
right here and says oh hold on you can't
use this class it's an implement
runnable and that's because we spelled
it Runa Bowl so again that's another
thing you want to take note of so what
this does is it creates a thread object
from this class and again all this
thread is going to do is it's going to
give a name give a time and put it to
sleep pretty much the most boring thing
you can do to it through it
so let's go ahead and I told you guys
unlike regular code where you run
something one two three four all of
these things are going to run
simultaneously so let's go ahead
prove that um let's go ahead and make
two three we'll go ahead and make four
threads animal two three four so now we
essentially have four different objects
and each of those are on their own
thread so we have these threads created
but we didn't start them out yet they're
just created when commit they're like
come on come on let me go let me go let
me go so now before we shoot the gun let
them all loose here is how we start them
t1 start and this is how you start a
thread and whenever you let me just do
this first I cannot explain and type at
the same time what do I look like a
thread get it wow that's like that's one
of the best jokes I had so far Wow if
anyone's making like the best of bulky
video I would definitely put that and
because I'm proud of that one and I
probably going to use it in my like the
next five tutorial so just let that sink
in for a moment in anyways so instead
let me go ahead and run this see I keep
thinking ways to make this easier for
you guys whoa easy there Hoss
all right let's scroll up and ah right
so here's where we got we ran this in
order one two three four but now says
three sleeping two is sleeping for
sleeping one is sleeping and again why
is this random instead of order again
like I said unlike before your common
way of thinking that things have to
happen in order everything pretty much
gets shoved in all at once and all of
these ran now check this out each of
these threads is sleeping for a
different period of time see number four
is only sleeping for 22 milliseconds so
this wakes up forced four wakes up first
and let's see number three is only
sleeping for 167 milliseconds so that's
the next wake up and then
- and then it's one so again unlike
before where everything had to happen
one after the other after the other I
mean one didn't have to go to sleep and
wake up and then to defend didn't have
to go to sleep and wake up what happened
is they all want to sleep at the same
time different time random times and
then they all woke up you know when they
were supposed to so let's walk through
this one more time to see the power of
threads what we did is we created this
weird class called tuna that made it
implemented runnable and this means let
me be able to use threads
I promise I'll use the run method so
each of these threads got a name a time
in just a random time pretty much so now
what we did is we passed in these names
1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 and these were the names that
we assign to the threads and we also
assign a random time to them these were
the RAM times
hey when that does that you know what it
is Windows 7 whenever you like drag it
to the side it expands for you all now I
just messed it up let's cool really
quick spanning geez Louise anyways these
were random times so now your thread
says all right I have this information
now what do you want me to do well we
gave you a bunch of information and now
whenever we want you to run we just want
you to print out you are sleeping for
your name and time and then we want you
to actually sleep and then when you wake
up you say all right I'm done we should
have wrote woke up or something clever
like that but we didn't and in here what
we did is in our main Bucky clasp we
created each thread object or thread
itself and we give it a name and then
once you've created it we had to start
it out and start pretty much means
called the run method on it that's all
it means
so I mean in this example it wasn't the
greatest of showing you how threads can
be used because all we did is made some
random things and put it to sleep
but what
never we start creating useful programs
which we don't do very often do we but
once in a while we do then you're going
to see the power of threads so hopefully
you understand this a little bit more if
you don't then just leave me like a hate
comment and tell me how ugly I am and
tell me how worthless I am ah so yeah
that's pretty much it so don't forget
I'm going to be having all of the source
code on my blog for you guys for free so
um that's it so don't forget to check
out my blogs for all the free source
code don't forget subscribe and well I
guess I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
