graph editor tutorial for Adobe After
Effects cs6 this is buddy Blackbird here
and in this part of the tutorial we're
going to be learning about the keyframes
and the different types and how they
affect the graph editor and how to
manipulate the points in the graph
editor so what we have here right now is
just a linear rotation which means the
speed doesn't change and it just goes
from 0 to 360 at the same velocity so
I'll show you what that is well that
looks like real quick so we have
something to compare the other things to
and you can see how it slides at the end
and you can fix that in the graph editor
so the first thing I wanted to do was
change the end keyframe to an easy
keyframe so you can see what it looks
like so I click on that and then you can
see a handle comes out both the points
here and we'll do a ramp review so you
can see what it looks like there's no
more sliding for one
you can adjust these handles here by
clicking on them when the cursor turns
to a black arrow and dragging so when
you have it up here the the graph editor
or the the rotation sorry the rotation
will start off faster and then n slower
with the easies on there if I move it
down here like this now it's gonna be
slower here than it was before and then
faster at the end so watch this you see
how it got really fast at the very end
flipped basically unrealistically so
that's that if you want to reset it back
to a linear real quick you can hold all
and click on it or you can go ahead and
just click on the linear button while
the point is selected if you want to
bring a point back to a point that has a
handle on it
I'm pezzi a handle hold alt and click on
the point and it'll bring a handle out
that you can manipulate if it doesn't
already have one so now I'm going to add
a keyframe in the middle somewhere right
there sounds good right at the top and
I'll add a keyframe in and you notice
that a keyframe has been added in in the
graph editor also with handles on the
end if you try to drag a handle you can
see only one will drag at a time this is
kind of weird so just pay attention a
little bit on this if you hold alt you
can drag them both at the same time if
you let go now you can also drag them
without holding all now if you try to
hold if you hold out and try to drag now
it will break
the handles so you can move them on
their own
so I'll just repeat that real quick
dragging when you just created the point
ork just came into the graph will drag
individually you have to hold out and
bring up the convert vertex tool here to
be able to drag the handles
simultaneously with each other and we're
in relativity to each other now
once you have already dragged with all
and you let go of it if you hold alt
again it will break the bezzie a
you can click-and-drag without holding
out to move them both back again now if
you click and hold all in the middle it
will turn it back into a linear keyframe
that's the shortcut there so that is the
end of part two where I showed you how
to manipulate the keyframe points in the
graph editor and I showed you how they
affected the velocity I hope you guys
learned something from the tutorial and
if you have any questions be sure to
leave them in the comments and I will
try to get back to you and let try to
help you out in figuring out different
solutions because sometimes when you're
working with a graph editor it just
doesn't want to do what you want it to
do so the Vigilant and don't give up on
it
just keep working through it and you'll
figure it out eventually if all else
fails you can convert your point to a
linear point and just start over again
and try to get what you're looking for
so play around with a graph editor see
what different animations do and become
a pro at it because becoming a pro at
the graph at a graph editor makes you a
much better after effects artist so I
hope to see you guys in the next
tutorial
have a good one it's a Cinco DeMayo
today so I'll be out celebrating I will
use the Mexican influence there to
justify my partying tonight so I'll see
you guys in the next tutorial I have a
good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
