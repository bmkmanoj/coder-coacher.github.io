a team deathmatch game on quarry with
the Cylons UMP marathon pro cold-blooded
hour marathon i'm not sure if I got
marathon pro I think either ninja pro or
steady aim there's a quick knife kill
right there and I just wanted to say I
am going to talk about specifically
today the map quarry Rory um like Skid
Row and Bella a bunch of other maps like
that um I'd probably say is definitely
one of the better maps in this game um
I've heard people say that they hate it
that they love it etc etc and this map
it's pretty it can be pretty well
balanced in domination usually it's not
because where I just was where the guys
just shot me in that big open storage
area I don't know what's called storage
house just big house
oh just okay let's just call it the big
house because I don't know what else to
call it noob tubes hate them anyway um
in this game I was using the South UMP
and ok back to talking about Corey this
map is a very good nap another thing I
hate about this game shotguns people who
just use shotguns anyway as I was saying
before before the thing before a quarry
um in domination this game type are in
this map sorry um it can be very very
unbalanced in how what team can do what
and where like for instance it's a very
very unfair when it comes to just
or it's very unfair when it comes to
killing people or not trying to get head
oh sorry I'm just trying to figure out
how to word this just kind of lost for
words first and um it's very unfair
because on the seaside for domination it
can be very you can be spawn killed or
you can be spawn killing it just depends
on what type of team you have if you
have a team that's too laid-back you're
probably not going to end up getting be
and people who play domination probably
know what I'm talking about and for see
that guys like just like spazzed out
through the rock right there if
anybody's just saw that just saying I'm
just saying
Joe steel was what you want and in this
game um okay in this game tight
particularly it's pretty much you can do
whatever you want looking for your mom
um power yours we can currently like see
right here are the spawns I actually say
for this at least for this game type in
quarry particularly it's actually pretty
actually pretty good like I wouldn't say
that there's anything really wrong with
him if I was I'd probably say that I
call of duty spawns suck anyway so I'd
probably be my only complaint
and there's double kill off air strike
there's another faggot new tuber that's
how I call them anybody who uses a noob
tube we're almost anybody uses the new
to people who just use noob tube with
danger close pro if they've got Danger
Close pearl there are new puberty
they're like really like RPGs okay um
i'm going to talk uh i'm going to talk
about when you if you're on quarry and
you're playing Search and Destroy
because that's the entirely different
perspective than domination demolition
team deathmatch it's a completely
different perspective so I'm just gonna
cause you're more stealthy more aware
probably probably even play better when
you play search okay so on this map for
search most people spawn chill I do I
even do because it kills from it um what
you can how I spawn kill on at least um
uh was it called the defending side it's
probably not or its proud actually is a
very clever way to spawn kill because
nobody's expecting it but sometimes you
may not be able to do it it's the only
problem I did or missile ready for
launch I think I'm about to get either
the games and Digger I get my secondary
years I don't remember oh no I don't get
my other second Harriers maybe I do I
just don't remember
either way now the game doesn't okay um
Search and Destroy real quick before the
game ends I just want to say most people
spawn kill or rush so expect that and
that made no sense I'll completely gotta
spray on that guy and he still didn't
die but whatever um when you get when
you usually trying to get a spray on
somebody most people if you don't know
what that means that means like just
like shooting them without going to iron
sites or sites um and I just want to say
real quick about search and destroy our
quarry is one of the maps where people
do go for the bomb so I'm just I'm just
saying oh if you're defending be
precautious if you're not defending uh
be smart because if you're gonna play
search and you're on this map most of
the time you're probably not thinking
very well or you're probably thinking
but you're probably thinking who I'm
gonna kill everybody blah blah blah and
here's the game winning kill I'm sorry
if it ends in a little abrupt Lee but uh
there's game winning kill there's 29 or
21 and nine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
