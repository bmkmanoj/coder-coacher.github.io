Android tutorial for the new boss in
we're going to do this tutorials
basically get those list items
doing something for the most part the
previous tutorial we set up our inflator
got our menu displayed on the screen
according or when we press the menu
button now we're actually going to let
those list items do something basically
you kind of like set up the
onclicklistener but we're going to use a
different method so I'm just going to
minimize again this on create options
menu here and we're going to import our
use another menu or another method from
the activity class so again right click
source override implement methods and
scroll down to one organ it's not in the
list list activity it's under just
activity here and it's called on options
items selected so just look for that odd
on auto on options item selected it
takes a menu item within its class or
with ends parameters hit OK
and it kind of sets it up for us as well
again we're just going to kind of gut it
out for the most part we aren't going to
worry about sending it to the superclass
we're just going to delete this whole
line of code right here and delete that
now what we need to do is we need to
kind of reference this item that's being
passed in again once one of these items
are clicked within our own options menu
it's going to call this method for the
most part so what we want to do is check
the case ID of which menu was selected
that's why we set up those IDs in the
few tutorials ago so we're going to stop
a switch in case and we're just going to
say item which is being passed in and
we're going to say dot gets ID just like
we've used plenty times in the past oh
actually it's not good ID it's going to
be get item ID sorry but sorry about
that and that's going to give us the ID
of an item so there we go we set up our
switching case set up a new pair of
brackets and then do our cases our dot
ID dot about us was one of them
and then we're going to say break and
case r dot ID dot what was the other one
preferences whoops
and then we're going to break as well
and now why it's giving us an heir and
why give us heir in the last tutorial
basically it's a boolean I don't know if
I'm saying that right I always say stuff
wrong because I read in books and I
never know if I'm pronouncing stuff
right so it's boolean I believe and
basically that's going to be a true or
false type scenario and we aren't
returning any data we aren't saying hey
it's true or false so what we need to do
is return something so we're going to go
outside of our switch in case here and
we're going to say return false just
return something or just going to say
hey it's false doesn't really matter if
it wasn't within our switching case so
basically it is neither of those things
it's just going to return false give
give no input back and that's basically
how we set up basically our items and
then we can do something like well I
don't know I don't know if I want to
describe do anything more in this
tutorials pretty quick tutorial for the
most part but again nothing too new just
remember we set up a basically on create
options menu and then once that menu
inflates that's what we've done past
tutorial gives us two items which we set
up in our items resource folder or menu
resource folder we set up two items
within there and then we're just getting
the ID of those items which is being
passed in when we get a click because
those are called menu item or is from
the menu item class it's going to give
us that item some information about the
item then we're just going to pull some
information from that item within our
switch in case we're just going to get
the item ID and then if it's the case of
about us or the case of preferences we
do again whatever is within here so it's
pretty quick tutorial nothing too new
for the most part besides just working
with items within a menu so hopefully
you guys kind of really relaxed you're
like okay we didn't do anything too new
for the most part you learned about a
new method and that's about it
so thanks again for watching guys and
I'll catch you in the next tutorial have
a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
