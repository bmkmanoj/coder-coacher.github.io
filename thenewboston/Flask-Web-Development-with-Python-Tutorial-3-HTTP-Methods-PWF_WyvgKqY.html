video I'm going to show you how flask
can respond differently depending on the
type of HTTP method so the different
HTTP methods we're going to be covering
in this little video is just going to be
get and post
now even though we didn't explicitly say
in the last two tutorials whenever we
requested a URL from our little sample
web page we were using the get method
and that's what we're going to be using
most of the time however whenever you
work with forms and I don't know maybe
you have some form on your website and
you want the user to submit some
information then you're going to need
post so we'll talk about those
differences right now but before we do
we actually need to import one more
module and that is requests so this
module just gives you information about
how the user requested a resource in
this case a web page and we'll just keep
this one right there so we have a little
you know demo a little baseline and
actually for the home page since this
what this function is right here let's
output the type of request
so we'll say method used and then I'll
just write % US and I'll just write
request method alright so what we're
going to do right here is we're just
going to print out whenever they go to
the home page what request method they
use whether it was and whether it was
get post what-have-you so actually let
me delete this so I don't get any errors
and run this and check it out
all right so method used get now
remember by default whenever you just go
to any web page on the Internet they're
delivering that through get however like
I said sometimes we're going to need to
use post specifically or the majority of
the time whenever we're working with
forms so how do we do that well we'll
keep this page right here in women
take another page called like a bacon
and we'll say that this page has some
kind of form on it well the first thing
that we need to do is after the URL in
your route we need to throw in another
parameter and that is methods so
remember what happens is whenever we run
this web server by default bacon can
only handle git however we want to add
post to that as well so we're going to
throw in the list with git and this is
pretty much the default one but we also
want to add post now we're saying this
bacon page right here it's capable of
handling both gets and posts so now let
me actually change the function name to
bacon and I'll write something like this
let's just go ahead and check if this
method is get or post and then print
something out depending on what type it
is so say if request method is equal to
get like we saw right here then what do
we want to do we'll just print out Oh
actually let's check if it's equal to
post first since that's kind of what
we're doing we'll just print out or
return you are using post now I'm just
going to make a else statement because
we won't specifically check for get but
we're just going to assume that if it's
not post it's just going to be get so
returned oh say you are probably using
git re so whenever the user goes to the
bacon page what happens is it looks at
the method and if they're using post
it's going to print this out if they're
using git is going to print this out now
check actually let me restart that and
check it out
so bacon now by default like I said
whenever you just go to in a browser
it's using get right there and through
chrome it's difficult just to submit
post to URL since it's really not set up
that way but what you can do is this I
downloaded this um extension from the
App Store or on even ofits and called an
extension and a half I guess and it's
called postman and it's a really handy
tool for developing because it can now
allow you to throw in a URL and you can
either send it using git as a request
method and you see the output right here
so whenever I do that it says you are
probably using it and then if I want to
use post I just change this to post and
send it again and now it says you are
using post so we really don't have this
drop-down list in any browser probably
for a good reason but sometimes when
you're developing you need to you know
switch up your request methods so that's
what you do and now we can confirm that
this indeed does work so we recognize
post and also get like we saw before and
there you go so that ladies and
gentlemen is how you can use different
request methods and handle them in
different kind of ways so if you guys
don't really know about the different
request methods fear not because in the
up come to toriel's I'm going to show
you guys how to work with forms and how
to you know do everything you need to do
so now that we have our feet wet ready
to hop in to some other topics gonna be
awesome I'll see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
