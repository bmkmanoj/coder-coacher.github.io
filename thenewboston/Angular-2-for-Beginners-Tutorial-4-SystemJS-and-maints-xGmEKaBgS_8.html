what a component is in how to make a
very basic one what we can do now is we
can check out main TS now this is
actually the first file that angular
calls whenever it boots up your
application and it's really simple we
just have one line of code in here and
that is bootstrap and this is
bootstrapping this right here
so what bootstrapping means is just
basically um prepare or load in your
root component so every angular
application needs a root component or
the main component so since we only have
one that's what we're doing right here
and these are here are just imports now
I do want to touch on something real
quick and that is the difference between
the way that we import this in this
right here so of course we already know
what this is app component we're
basically importing this file right here
now this file right here is one that
came with angular and of course this is
just includes the function so we can
actually bootstrap our component but
notice this notice whenever we write the
file pass that whenever we are importing
one of our components that we created we
use this dot forward this is a relative
path that means look in the same
directory as am in right now so this
whenever you don't use this dot word
what angular does is it automatically
looks in this node modules so again
anytime you need to import something
from node underscore modules make sure
not to include a relative path like this
because it pretty much has node modules
in there by default so I just want to
point that out in case you're getting
some errors whenever you import things
so again all this does right here is it
loads in the root component alright so
over in index.html before we start
coding our very first component I want
to talk you guys through what all this
is and 99% of this you guys already know
so this is just the title meta tags the
link and right now I actually just
linked to bootstrap and this is Twitter
bootstrap just so my buttons will look
pretty not to be confused
with this bootstrap function which is
completely unrelated so again this is
just a style sheet to make things look
pretty if you want then go ahead and
delete this if you guys aren't really
big on bootstrap um these are all of the
node modules that we downloaded all the
ones that we need and all of this is
just basic HTML the only other thing
that's kind of weird is this which I
talked to guys through in the last video
so the last piece of the puzzle we need
to explain is this script tag so this is
your system j/s library and what this is
is it's for module loading in other
words all of the code that we write it
gets included automatically and that way
we don't have to go through and include
each of these files and all of the
modules that we need one by one so this
system j/s it takes care of all that
behind the scenes by default and if we
ever need to tweak anything then I'll
talk you guys through that but it's
pretty cool so just to give you guys a
real brief overview of this in just to
kind of explain what's going on in case
you get any bugs or anything this
packages setting right here this tells
system j/s what to do whenever it sees a
request for a new file so one important
thing right here is the default
extension j/s so hop back over in main
TS for a second and notice this see
whenever we're importing or including
other files we don't write the file
extension so even though that we're
including app component TS right here we
don't want to write that explicitly
that's because whenever we're using
typescript it automatically knows to
look with a file with a TS extension
also remember that what we're going to
do is behind the scenes we're
automatically translating this to
JavaScript so if you write TS right
there it's going to look for a type
script file and not javascript file so
since this doesn't have any file
extension whenever javascript looks for
another file it's going to say umm yeah
we actually don't even have app dot
component this isn't even a JavaScript
file so what angular does and actually
what system J
does is actually taxed on that jeaious
extension at the end of all of these
imports and file names right there so
that way we can write typescript and our
browser can use JavaScript and we don't
have to manually change every single
file extension pretty awesome eh and of
course this last line right here all
that's happening is the system that
import is calling your app J s main file
so this is your main JavaScript file in
other words it's just the starting point
for your program so there you go
simple enough now we understand what
every single thing is we got a basic
understanding of how all the angular
pieces work together and in the next
video we're actually going to start
creating our very first component I'm so
excited
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
