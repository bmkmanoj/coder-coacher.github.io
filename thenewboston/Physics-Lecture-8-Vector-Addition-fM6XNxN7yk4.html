of physical lesson and in this lesson
I'm going to show you guys the proper
way to calculate net force other than
the last tutorial where we just threw a
addition sign in between and try to add
them together in our heads this is
usually what you do you use something
called a vector addition basically
adding vectors together graphically now
let me go ahead and show you guys a
graphic real quick and I don't have
graph paper or ruler or anything but I'm
just going to show you guys the concept
how to do it and then you guys are going
to understand everything else so let me
go ahead and tell you guys a little
story I live next to a couple rednecks
and they thought it would be a good idea
the other day if they had a big stump in
their yard this is a stump and they
wanted to get their trucks and push it
into a river and here's the river right
here so they had two trucks the first
one was pretty powerful it was a Ford
f250 so here's the Ford f250 really good
drawing of it right here and they had
another little truck this was a little
Ford Ranger so this little truck was
pushing in the stump in this direction
right here and it was bad it had a force
of 50 tons
however this Ford f250 was a little bit
more powerful this one had a force of
100 tons so they weren't physicists so
they called me over and they wanted me
to decide if he's pushing on this stump
in this direction with a force of 100
tons and this little truck is pushing it
left with a force of 50 tons then
where's the stump gonna go is it going
to go this way is it going to go this
way is it going to go this way towards
the river what's going to happen and I
said listen rednecks you need to do
something called a vector addition and
this is how you do that now remember 50
tons left and 100 tons Northwest so just
remember that because I'm about to well
I guess have space over here to graph it
so in order to use vector addition this
is what you do draw an arrow that's
pretty much well if this is 50 tons draw
an arrow that's 50 centimeters in this
direction now if you have a force of 100
tons in the northwest direction draw an
arrow connected to it that's 100
centimeters in the northwest direction
so again if your force is twice as
strong
make sure your arrow is twice as long
okay so you see this good
so what we're about to do is the next
step is to connect these head-to-tail so
you see how both of these arrows heads
are touching what we need to do is take
the tail and move it over to the head of
this arrow so again we have our original
arrow that's 100 centimeters long and
this would represent the force of the
bigger truck now what we need to do is
take this arrow and take its tail and
move it to the head of the other one now
whenever we do that we have both of our
arrows that are both facing in the same
direction still but now they are tied
together
so now what we need to do is start at
the tail of the first one and connect it
to the head of the second one so this is
our new arrow check it out now I'm am
not quite sure depending on the angle of
this but I'll just make a guess and say
it's 130 centimeters in this direction
right here towards the river so
basically to calculate net force that is
what you do whatever the forces are you
need to draw it to scale the size of
your airs arrows for example if you have
a 50 ton to 100 ton force you can either
draw this 150 centimeters and this one
100 centimeters or you can draw the
smaller one 2 centimeters and this
bigger one 4 centimeters as
long as they are to scale then what you
need to do is you need to connect them
head to tail and draw a new arrow from
the tail of the first one to the head of
the last one and then what you need to
do is make a new arrow and take the
measurement of that and that's why it's
helpful to have a ruler with you and
some graph paper because just drawing it
right here is really inaccurate but if
you had a graph paper then that is what
you do you actually draw an arrow out
and you measure the distance of that new
arrow now this new arrow the distance is
equal to the force which would be 130
tons now not only is the distance equal
to the force but the new direction is
equal to the new direction of the force
so if we ended up with an arrow this way
then the force would be going this way
so that is how you you basically
calculate the net force add vectors
together measure it in the distance
equals the force in the new direction
equals the new direction of the force so
in this case they were successful even
though there's some you know silly old
rednecks they managed to get to stump in
the river because they moved it
north-northwest at with a force of 130
tons so I don't know if I'm going to
show you guys some more vector addition
but we're definitely going to use it
later on if not in the next tutorial
then the tutorials coming up so anyways
for now thank you guys for watching and
don't forget I know some of these topics
are kind of confusing and if you have
any questions about any of them then
please go ahead and ask me on my forum T
and B form com
I'll post the link in the description
below but anyways thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe check
out my forum add me on Google+ and I
will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
