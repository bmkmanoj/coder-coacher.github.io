video I'm going to be talking to you
guys about these lines at the very top
of your program and they're technically
called preprocessor directives now you
know how I told you guys like in the
first video that the reason that we
download this piece of software is not
only so we can type code in it but also
one of the jobs of this piece of
software was basically the take code
that we can understand of course we can
read this this is the word include main
and it pretty much translates it into
ones and zeroes or in other words code
the computer can understand now this
process the technical term for it is
compiling your program so what these
lines are and why I even mentioned that
is because before your program compiles
what it does is it includes or it pretty
much runs your pre-press or processor
directives kind of a tongue twister but
basically it's going to grab the entire
file wherever we tell it to so it's
going to grab stdio.h and stdlib.h and
it's going to substitute them in place
right here now after all your
preprocessor directives are finished
completing then it's going to go ahead
and compile your program and also arm
like this one right here this stdio
stands for standard input/output and
that's what allows us to use that printf
because the output stuff on the screen
so again what this include does is
basically include another file with well
whatever we're on we want to put in it
and I'll actually show you guys how to
make your own file in just a second now
another preprocessor directive you can
use other than include is actually one
called define I'll show you guys how to
use that right now pretty much type in
the I call it hash tag because I'm
stupid Twitter now but the pound sign
hit define and what a constant is is
basically it's kind of like a variable
but its value can never change so
whenever you have a variable like tuna
you
can set it equal to 21 and then later on
you can set it equal to 32 well with a
constant you can't change its value set
it once in your program and it stays
that way forever so if you want to just
make a stupid constant just to show you
guys an example called my name and also
whenever you're making constants make
sure that you make them in all uppercase
letters and this is just so you can
easily distinguish a constant from
variables in your program it's a I don't
know it's just so like something all
programmers do so of course
type the name whatever you want to name
your constant and then after it it's
value so I'll just say my name is tuna
mcbutter
and another thing I want to point out is
that you don't need a semicolon at the
end of any preprocessor directive so now
basically what's going to happen is
anytime we have my name and our program
might as well use it and what are we
going to put something stupid like me
name be and we'll just write my name
right there so basically what this
preprocessor directive is going to do is
it's going to search your program right
here and it's going to look for any
instances of the word my name and
replace them with a string tuna mcbutter
so now if we run this it says 'my name
be tuna mcbutter and of course it did
all of that before your program started
compiling so now let me go ahead and
actually show you guys how to use these
in a useful kind of way so clear this
out and clear this out as well and I
want to show you guys how to include
your own custom made header it will
actually use one of those constants
because why the heck not so the first
thing we need to do if we want to
include another file is well create a
new file so if you go to file new empty
file and it says do you want to edit yes
and now you pretty much just give it a
name I'm going to name mine
Bucky's
info and you also want to put dot H it's
just a header file and it's just some
I'll explain you guys about the
different types of files later on but
whenever we're including this give it a
dot H extension it means something
special to see so hit save and then it
says ok pretty much do you want to add
it yup and another thing I want to
mention is that whenever we named it dot
H what it means to see is a header file
so it creates a new folder called
headers and it organizes pretty much all
your header files for you by default
which is pretty sweet so now we have two
files in our program this first one of
course is the one may not see the main
one we've been working on the whole time
and we also have this new Bucky's info
orcs III Bucky's info dot H now also
take note of these other header files we
include we're also H so you know in case
you didn't notice that now in this one
remember what's going to happen is any
code that's in here it's pretty much
going to be copied and substituted right
whenever we write our preprocessor
directive so we can um write something
like let's just go ahead and define a
couple constants so define my name and
uh put my real name this time no more
that to na mcbutter whatever had a heck
is name is and I'll just go ahead and
define arm age 28 so now and we actually
don't need to save these because
whenever we build and run it
automatically saves all your files for
you so pretty cool you can do it the
lazy way so now we have a little bit of
code in this Bucky's info H and let's go
ahead and include it in our main program
so copy this do it the lazy way and also
delete your entire stdlib.h code right
now and as you can see this header and
this header are brought in using the
brackets and whenever you use brackets
it says it pretty much means search the
default place where headers are but we
can use double quotes and double quotes
means
search in the same directory or the same
folder is our code and it's just a
little bit faster way to bring it in
don't really worry about it right now
and of course type the name of your file
so again it's going to include this one
this one and then it's pretty much going
to copy this and paste it right in here
that's like pretty much what it does
actually I should probably use that
analogy earlier on and then it runs your
program so now that we have this info
brought in let's make a cool program
with it I'll show you guys how to make a
program that calculates the age of girls
I'm allowed today so I'm like alright am
I allowed to date a girl who's like 24
if I'm 28 well I don't know what about a
girl who's 17 probably not so you know
the formula for it is this go ahead and
make a variable called int girl's age
and the formula for this is actually um
and I'm going to do some math and I know
I didn't talk to you about the
mathematical operators of C yet but you
guys will understand this you take the
age and this is my age which is 28 and
you divide it by 2 of course to divide
is just the forward slash and I'll talk
like I said talk about that later on so
now of course this is 14 for me and you
take that and add 7 and that's the age
of girls anyone is allowed state so go
ahead and think of your age right now
divided by 2 and add 7 don't they any
girls younger than that so this should
equal 21 I believe so now let's just go
ahead and add a print statement don't
need to do anything else so I'll just
put something like um s which would be
my name like Bucky Roberts can date
girls who are mmm actually girls do this
percent T or older
and of course now we need to give it
those uh pretty much like pieces of
information that asks for it and this is
what I named it H or the first one is my
name and the second one is girls age so
let's see if this works all right
so Bucky can date girls 21 or older all
right I am finally I got to go find me
some 21 year old hottie now if anyone is
listening and giving a call alright so
I'll talk you guys through this one more
time real quick just so it sticks in
your brain and you're pretty much a pro
at it what we can do is we can write our
own custom header file and any code we
put in here as our program runs it
pretty much grabs this file copies all
the crap in it and paste it right here
and then your program compiles in in our
program what we did is we took my age
divided it by 2 and add 7 to that value
and it gave us the girls age that you're
allowed to date and I got 21 so I'm
going to pause this video go find some
21 year old hottie and I'll see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
