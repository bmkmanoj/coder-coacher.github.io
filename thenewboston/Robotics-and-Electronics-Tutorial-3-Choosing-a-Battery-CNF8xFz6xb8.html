to your third tutorial on robotics and
electronics where we will be building a
robot so now that we figured out how to
use our multimeter I want to talk about
the parts of the robot in the first part
that we're going to be using to build a
robot is going to give the robot its
power and that's a simple 9-volt battery
as you can see here now you can use
pretty much anything power your robot on
any type of battery but I'm going with a
9-volt battery for this one in this is
probably much
probably the most common battery or
you'll be using when testing electronics
and robotics just because it has a lot
of power it's small and lightweight in
those two little things on top it's
going to make incredibly easy to test
electronics and robotics uh not like a
double a battery or triple-a or any
other kind it's kind of hard to get your
probes in your alligator clips clamped
on in there so go pick up some 9-volt
batteries and this is what's going to
power your robot and all your electronic
circuits from now on so with that being
said let me show you guys how to test
your battery using your multimeter get
to use it for the first time all right
guys the first thing that you guys are
going to want to do is hook up your
probes for your multimeter now the first
thing that you're going to want to
connect is you're going to want to put
your black probe into the comm slot your
black probe always goes in the slot
labeled Co M no matter what you're
testing so go ahead and stick that in
there and the next thing you want to do
is look for what you're testing for it
since we're going to be testing the
volts of the batteries the volts is
labeled on this slot right here so go
ahead and take this and put it right in
there
that's what she said and now we have our
probes hooked up and we are ready to
test once you have your probe set up go
ahead and turn your multimeter on and
you're going to want to switch it to DC
volts and in case you don't know where
yours is I talked about
in the last tutorial and now once you
have that switch on you're ready to test
your probes and hook them up to the
better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
