your third networking tutorial today
we're going to be going over something
called network topology the first thing
I want to show you guys is term I'm
going to be using and this is called
protocol now what protocol is is how
data is formatted transmitted and
received so just in case I use that term
it's pretty much just means how you send
data over the network and before we get
started another term I wanted to go over
that you guys are going to be seeing a
lot it's called topology now topology is
pretty much just the design of the
network and physical and logical the
physical means what you can actually see
and the logical means how data is
transmitted so you can't usually see
that and there are four major types of
topologies or how the network is laid
out and those are called bus ring star
and mesh topology the first one we're
going to be going over is something
called a bus topology and what this is
is pretty much you have a cable right
here and on either side of the cable you
have something called a terminator
now what terminators Java is it absorbs
electric signals so when one the data
reaches the end of the network then it
doesn't a mirror back and create a bunch
of noise whenever data reaches one of
these ends it just gets destroyed and
how the computers are set up in this
network is something like this you have
a computer right here and you have a
server right here and you have a laptop
right here and they're all linked into
this network kind of like a chain and
this is kind of like a bus because if
this one wants to send that to this it
has to go through all the other nodes or
all the other things connected to the
network before it gets the here so say
you wanted this computer right here one
to send data to this laptop
it would have to first travel along here
stop at the server then keep going and
go to the laptop then once once it gets
to this terminator right here it
disappears so it can't be transmitted
back and you don't have a bunch of noise
or anything so that's how that works
the next layout I wanted to go over is
called the ring type apology and what a
ring type topology is Jesus keep missing
that up it's pretty much a ring of cable
and re all of your computers are
connected to a point outside the ring
kind of like this so in a ring it's one
continuous path and there aren't really
any beginning or ending paths
so whenever a computer wants to transmit
data to another computer say this
computer wants to transmit data to here
you can either go this way or this way
and as you can see there are no
terminators in this it's a lot different
that's all one of the main reasons it's
different than a bus topology so pretty
much the nodes are attached at points
around the ring and the data goes from
node to node until it reaches its
destination and there can be as many
computers you want on a ring topology so
if again if you want to transmit data
from this node right here to this one it
will first travel along the cable stop
right here
travel along reach its destination and
that's where it ends up and the next
apology I want to go over is something
called a star topology now what star
topology is is actually one of the
oldest topologies and it's multiple
nodes attached to a central device so in
the middle you have something called a
switch and you'll see what that does in
a second that's a pretty good-looking
switch right there and you have a bunch
of computers or servers or anything on
the outside here these are computers if
can't tell by my awesome drawn and
they're all can
to the middle switch or bus or router or
something via cables and this is car
called a star topology again a bunch of
nodes on the outside and the central
device where they all connect to so if
computer one wants to transmit data to
computer - I would first send it to the
switch and then the switch would decide
what computer needs it and then it would
send it out to the current computer in
the last apology I want to go over is
something called a mesh topology
now what mesh topology does is kind of
combine the best of both worlds from all
the other topologies you have a bunch of
nodes on the outside here let's uh make
five of them wow those are some nice
looking computers right there and pretty
much every node is connected to every
other node like this Wow nice
connections there we go
I think I got every one yeah I got every
one so every node is connected to every
other node this one's connected to this
one that's connected this one this one
this one and this is useful because it's
kind of like if any link breaks then
communication is still possible since if
this one wanted transmit data to this it
might go this way but if this computer
gets shut out
then it might go this way in you're
still in business so it's kind of like a
built-in protection so the more nodes
you have in your network the more
communication paths are possible and
because there's so much cable or
communications involved in this then
it's actually really expensive so it's
not use the law and Lance it's used more
widely in Mane's and wanes and stuff
like that so if you can tell through my
rough drawing then this is a one of the
most popular with like wide area
networks and like cities and stuff like
that
but that pretty much concludes my third
networking tutorial I hope you guys
didn't mind my awesome drawings and
again if you have any questions at all
go to my website the new Boston Common
and I'll answer them there don't send me
a YouTube message because my inbox is
loaded and I never check it so sign up
at the new Boston I hope you enjoyed my
tutorial and I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
