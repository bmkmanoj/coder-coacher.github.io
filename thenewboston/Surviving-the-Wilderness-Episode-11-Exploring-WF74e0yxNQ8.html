right after i just talked which is this
here who's to be some herb can lodge in
between the rocks and if i can get it
out I can use it for something glutes a
beer can feast
let's use it
already well now I am headed back to my
camp for the day because it is getting
kind of late I didn't make spear today
if I got that can and I think i'm
actually going to cut the top off and
ice on a show you can take the little
tab off of it and I be able to make some
sort of like fishing hook out of it and
I can use my rope that I have it it
comes apart to like little string so
maybe i can i'm lucky i can use that
it's some sort of fishing apparatus but
i'm still definitely going to make a
spear tomorrow and I'll uh I'll check
back in when I get back to camp so if I
got a little ways to walk right now
alright alright well I just marked the
third day on the tree went down a little
chillier out I got a nice wood pile for
the night I'm gonna
stick it out tonight but I'm gonna plan
on moving camp to the creek tomorrow
find a really nice spot there where I
can I build a new shelter well I really
really need to find some food soon
because I I don't think I can stay out
here much longer I mean if I don't get
some food tomorrow i'm probably going to
make my way out a lot a lot more
difficult than I thought it was going to
be just in that eating part alone is
horrible and I feel real weak all done
and I lost my hat it's my favorite head
to I have no idea where I left it I lost
it like I don't even have a yesterday
actually so I'm going to stick it out
tonight hopefully it'll be a lot better
I assume it will because I got a lot
more wood ready now so nice big fire
give me warmer and I won't have to worry
about stoking it all night and tomorrow
I will make my journey back over to the
creek and set up a new camp there and
hopefully I can figure out some way
Fisher I got a chipmunk with a rock eat
it but oh that's pretty much it for
tonight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
