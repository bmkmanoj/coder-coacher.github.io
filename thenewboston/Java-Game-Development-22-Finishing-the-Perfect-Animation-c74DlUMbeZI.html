welcome to your twenty second tutorial
in Java game development in our last
tutorial in this little mini series I
have about reducing screen flickering
and our very last method we have to
build in the Bucky class and the last
method for this little tutorial is the
draw method and in case you can tell
this draw method that is underlined is
telling us to create a drama that so we
will and all this method does is draws
graphics it's pretty much just going to
draw your background and whatever image
on your screen so let's go ahead and
play public void got name you draw of
course and it's going to take our
graphics object g as it always does and
the first thing that's going to do is
draw our background so with our graphics
object draw image and I know it's going
to do that you little and for the
parameters what do you want to draw the
background where do you want to put it
let's just put it as zero zero and for
the image observer just put null so now
after this we drew the background we
just ruin draw of the face now but
instead of just putting face one or
phase two as the image put a dot get
image and what this does is it gets the
image appropriate for that time so
depending on where you are in your
animation that either gets the image
with its eyes open or its eyes closed
and it draws that image on the screen so
now that we are finally done we can
finally run this and let me see if I
have any errors and I know you guys
screen is black but my screen is showing
a guy blinking his eyes on and off and
it has no flickering or anything like
that is running perfectly so you guys
should do that I highly recommend it and
when you see is so much better than the
other animation no flicker at all and
now we finally are able to animate
without flickering a perfect buffered
class and that's how you do that so let
me do real quick one to walk you guys
through what this method does one last
time
and our main method we pretty much
created an object to use methods from
this class and we called the run method
to start out so when we call the run
method it goes all the way down here to
run and it creates a screen object so
you can use methods from your screen
manager class it finds the perfect splay
mode it sets it your screen fullscreen
depending on what that perfect display
mode is it loads all your images which
when we call this method it comes up
here loads all of the images necessary
and also creates a little animation with
two scenes the net face one and phase
two and when this is done it comes back
down here to movie loop and when you
call movie loop it comes down here and
plays your entire movie for six seconds
and what when you're playing your movie
you're pretty much on getting your
graphic object drawing it to the screen
getting rid of your object and updating
your screen and then it sleeps for 20
milliseconds each time and then once
this is done playing for six seconds it
finally restores your screen and gets
rid of gets pretty much restores it back
to normal size and then pretty much get
rids it gets rid gets rid of it all
together and that my friend is your
entire program that we just built in a
nutshell so that in essence is how we
build the perfect animation to get rid
of flickering I know was a lot of work
but trust me the people who play our
game will thank you that there isn't any
flickering at all and really Java did
all the real work for our Sun
Microsystems so thank you guys for doing
all the work for us and thank you for
letting us build this awesome game and
thank you subscribers for watching my
videos and in the next tutorials we're
going to be learning how to take an
object or excuse me like a picture or
something and have it move around on the
screen and what these are called the
sprites and what spray is pretty much a
single animation that moves around on
your screen and it is really awesome I
cannot wait to get into it it's going to
be amazing but for now that's for next
tutorial
for now I just want to thank you guys
one last time thanks for sticking with
me thanks for learning and don't forget
to subscribe and I'll see you next story</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
