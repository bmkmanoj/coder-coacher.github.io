another After Effects cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and today
I'm gonna show you how to make some
cascading text and I'll show you that
right now
with a simple Ram preview there we go
that's what we're gonna be making and
you don't even need to have 3d layers
and able to make this so that's good and
you don't need a camera or anything like
that so we're gonna be going over some
of the things in the text animator that
I haven't gone over yet such as like the
shape and the offset and things like
that and how to just not use 0 to 100
and all that stuff so we're going to
delete this out and create a new layer
I'm gonna create a text layer and I'm
just gonna type in exactly what I just
had I have a stroke on here and I don't
want it on there so take this off by
clicking on this button right here no
stroke color and I'm gonna scale this up
so we can see it a lot better it's good
that's good enough and the first thing
we want to do is twirl this open and
come to our animator here click on it
and we're gonna add another scale and
we've got our range selector here let's
open that up and what we're gonna do is
we're gonna animate this offset so what
we're gonna do is set our scale to 300
this time instead of 0 and it brings our
letters like way up here and they're
gonna be coming down if I move this
offset they're gonna be coming down so
like this
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna
change our start and end here so that
everything's not on at the same time and
we're gonna animate the opacity so let's
add an opacity real quick property
opacity and we're set that to zero now
you can see what that does now we've got
the letters so they're not like all over
the place and in our face and in the way
so what we don't want is to we want them
to not just come on one at a time here
because that just doesn't look as good
so we're gonna just have them come on
like three or four at a time or
something like that so let's change our
end here to somewhere around thirty and
I found that 33 is what I liked so now
let me move the offset around again and
you can see what that looks like
well it's everything's in the way so we
need to animate this offset correctly
and changed the type of mode we got
going on here so the first thing we want
to do is come down to advanced and we're
gonna change our shape here to ramp up
and that's gonna help us out a lot so I
should have done that before I showed
you guys what's going on so here we go
here's our ramp up now and we're pretty
much almost done so let's go to negative
33 in our offset where nothing is going
to be showing keyframe it and we'll move
up a few seconds and move this to when
it's done there we go and then which is
a hundred percent and keyframe it again
which it will automatically if you have
this stopwatch there and then let's Ram
preview this
ooh snazzy look at that now you might
not be using actual cascading text like
this often but it's good to I wanted to
show you this because it's a good way to
show you how to use the start and end
and not just have them at zero to a
hundred percent all the time so we used
both of them this time and the offset we
learned how to use the offset and in the
advance we went to the shapes here and
showed you how you can do use different
shapes so if we use ramp down it's gonna
come out like this and then I'll just go
over some other we'll just check out
some other ones see what they look like
I didn't even test these out so I'm not
sure what they're gonna do so that's
triangle they're like popping up like
that so if you take off the opacity on
that they'll just pop up throughout let
me go to opacity put that back to 100
and there you go that's what that does
it's kind of like making a triangle like
that runs across behind and pushes the
Fords forward are the letters forward
goes back to zero let's see what round
does probably something around the same
thing yep it's pretty much the same
thing but it doesn't make the it makes
it pushes the words out and I move you
know like a farther like fatter way like
a ball is coming through and then we got
a smooth which is almost like the same
thing as triangle involved but just a
different just to look looking a little
different so ramp up is what we wanted
for the cascading text and there we go
so thanks for watching this now you can
learn how to use the text animator a
little bit better and thanks for
watching thumbs up if you liked thumbs
down if you hated and subscribe if you
need to keep checking on for more After
Effects tutorials and later on when I'm
started using other Adobe program
tutorials you'll be able to keep in
touch with those so thanks for watching
have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
