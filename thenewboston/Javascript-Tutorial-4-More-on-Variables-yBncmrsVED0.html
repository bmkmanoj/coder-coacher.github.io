JavaScript tutorial this story I'm gonna
be teaching guys how to change variables
and use variables and equations so let's
go ahead and start out with variable
remember to declare your variable you
type the variable and then type whatever
you want to name it I'll name mine a
name and I'll set the value equal to
Toni and just as a refresher whenever
you wanted to output on-screen you could
use it as an alert and say if we saved
it just like that and looked at it
Oh to output Toni right on the screen
but what if you're typing along and you
decided that you want to have a new
value for the variable name well since
you already declared it you don't need
to type this var again since you already
did it you just have to type a name and
you set it equal to whatever else you
want
I'll say mine equal to Bob
now since javascript is your reading top
the bottom it says re we got a variable
name name and it's equal to tony so now
i'm going to spit that out
then it says down here it says alright
now this guy wants us to change the
variable name to Bob so from here on out
the variable name is going to have the
value of Bob
so let's alert this just to see what it
looks like so right now as you can see
I'll save this and at first it says Tony
before it gets to the change and then we
press ok and the JavaScript goes on and
then it gets the value of Bob and then
we told it to output on the screen so
let me walk you through this one last
time we first declared a variable and we
set it equal to tony and then we said
our a javascript we have a variable tony
out put it on the screen and then i said
all right now we decided to change it to
Bob so since the variable now has the
value of Bob why don't you output that
on the screen and that's how you can
change a variables value just by later
on using the same instance of the
variable but giving it a new value now
let's get rid of all this and let me
guys teach you one more thing in this
tutorial how you can also use variables
in variables so say we have a variable
named num1 stands for number one i set
it equal to 30
and then we have another variable named
num2 i said this equal to 80 we can
actually include the variables in a
variable so i make a variable called
answer and I'll set it to answer equals
the variable one plus variable two so
now this answer has the value of a
hundred and ten and just to show you
guys I'll make an alert box and I will
alert the answer as you can see when I
save it and now has the value 110 and as
you can see anytime you want to change
any of these numbers so say I'll change
just the 330 this automatically changes
this value right here and it should
change this value down here as well so
let me save this as you can see not only
they change that one variable but it
changed a whole instance of this too so
now the answer is equal to 330 plus 80
and this is just to show you guys how
you can use
variables in equations for another
variable now try to make this clear
things up later on and in the next
tutorial I'm gonna be talking about how
you can actually get information from
the user and it's a lot more useful than
just typing numbers in your computer
because right now we can pretty much
just do this in the calculator so in the
next section I'm going to be teaching
you the first kind of useful thing that
you can do a JavaScript thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
