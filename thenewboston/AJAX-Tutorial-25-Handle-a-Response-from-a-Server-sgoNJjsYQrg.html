boring housekeeping crap out of the way
let's go ahead and start coding the last
function that we need the last piece of
the puzzle handling the server response
so basically we already connected with
the server we sent out a request and
typically the requests are something
like process this generate an XML file
give us a text file so whatever we
requested to do we need to be able to
handle the server response so go ahead
and copy this because we're too lazy to
type it and the function is handle
server response as I just said and I'm
gonna burp kind of had to work for that
one alright so basically what this
program is going to do one more time is
it's going to spit this out and then
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
talk to guys about the different states
1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 what they all mean why you
need a mom so that's what the Ajax is
going to be in this little section and
eventually if everything worked then
it's going to give us this text right
here so before I talk to guys about the
different states let me talk to you guys
about why we even need these states and
why they incorporated them into Ajax now
in order for any conversation to work
and I'm not just talking about two
computers I'm talking about with people
you just can't go up and start saying
crap to anyone you just can't be like
apple pie and nobody New York City Taxi
and then you just walk away in order for
a conversation to be successful you need
some certain protocol you need some
standards or guidelines now this is how
a conversation works with human beings
typically you go up to someone and you
greet them you say hi hello how are you
whatever so I say hi hello that's the
greeting and then you start the meat of
it the conversation um do you want to go
at the dinner
what are you doing today umm I just got
a new dog whatever you guys want to talk
about and once you are finished you say
good bye see you later
so those are the three parts of human
conversation the greeting the
conversation and the goodbyes now that's
what makes conversation between people
so successful and this is also
why you need different stages in a
computer conversation whenever you're
talking about your client talking with a
server so that is basically what I'm
going to talk to you guys about instead
of you know the greeting in the goodbye
we have states 1 &amp;amp; 4 for example so the
first thing I want to do is actually I
just want to reference this because oops
copy that because that's where I'm going
to be you know basically outputting
everything so now what I want to do is I
want to take the D which is going to be
a variable set equal to document dot get
element by ID the D so now the variable
the D right here references this little
div block so now that we got that taken
care of what we need to do whenever we
check for States is we need to set up a
bunch of if statements now you can set
up a bunch of or you can do if else--if
else--if that's probably the easier way
so let me go ahead and put the first if
and I'm going to show you guys pretty
much how you do this now on your object
you just go ahead and copy the name of
that object it has a property called
ready state ready state and this pretty
much gets the state of it you know
communication now the states are 1 2 3 &amp;amp;
4 1 is basically when you just connect
with the server 2 &amp;amp; 3 are when it's
processing 4 is when the request is
ready so let me go ahead and talk you
guys about that in detail right now so
if you are ready state 1 so if the
conversation just began what ready state
1 means is basically that you
established a connection with the server
so let's just go ahead and set the D
print this out on the screen so the D
inner HTML plus equals
kind of hiccuping now so status one
remember that I said that I'll just put
you know server connection established
and hopefully a spot there right
established and since this is going to
be a you know kind of a long string I'll
just go ahead and break it now I want to
say this before I continue remember that
I said that there are four states that I
want to go for one two three and four
pretty much the different stages of
communication between your computer and
the server now what's going to happen is
all of these statuses you know status
one status to assess through status for
they're all going to display on your
browser however</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
