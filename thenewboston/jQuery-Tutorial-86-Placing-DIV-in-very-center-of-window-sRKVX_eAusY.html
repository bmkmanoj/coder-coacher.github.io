do the same again so object height is
equal to very center dot height so now
we can do exactly the same thing we'll
go ahead and allow out the object width
and height and this will actually match
150 and 250 so we need to make sure that
that happens because we need to be
extremely accurate so again we can go
ahead and say width x height X obviously
go ahead and just replace these X
variables with object width and object
height so let's go ahead and refresh and
you see we've got width 250 and height
150 which nicely matches this height 150
with 250 so we know that these values
are accurate we don't really have a way
of testing that these values are
accurate well we do but we're not going
to do it but we can just you know
assuming that we've grabbed the absolute
height and width of this object which is
the very sensitive we know that we've
defined them properties in here so we
know that width and height are working
okay so now what we need to do is
actually calculate where we're going to
place this div so the very center div
needs to be placed in the very center of
the window so what we want to do is we
want to set the very center CSS and
remember I said earlier we specified
well we can specify top 200 pixels or
100 pixels or whatever in here
but what I'm going to do is I'm going to
set top to something here and then I'm
going to go ahead and set left to
something here so we need to set the top
and the left to the very center of the
screen now we can't just go ahead and
supply window width and window height
divided by 2 which we would normally
think would work so let's just go ahead
and try that so I'm gonna say window
with honor this would be height because
it's from the top height divided by two
and the left we can say window width
divided by 2 let's just go and preview
that you can see that we're a bit off
because we've divided the height and the
width by 2 so this corner here is half
of the page width or the page height and
this same corner is half of the page
width but what we need to do is we need
to subtract half of the value of the
height and width of this object in order
to place the middle of this div here at
this point here and then it will be
absolutely central so hopefully that
makes sense hopefully I hope you
explained it properly so for the window
height we want to subtract object height
divided by 2 and for the window width we
want to subtract object width divided by
2 so now when we go ahead and we refresh
you can see that's been placed in the
middle because we've replaced this
corner we've subtracted half of this
object so we now see that the object is
in the very center of the screen now we
only have one more problem and that is
that when I go ahead and resize this it
doesn't actually move because we've set
a static value for the height and the
width of this object so what we want to
do is we want to go ahead and first of
all call this function that will place
it in the middle of the window but that
we then want to create an event handler
for window which is resize and this
event handler or the function inside
here that I'm just going to outline here
everything inside here will be will be
called every time we go ahead and resize
the window so for example if I always do
say alert resize has taken place and I
refresh and then I start you can see my
cursors over here I start to drag it in
resize has taken place and that's sort
of like alerting all that out I'm gonna
drag it back again resize has taken
place so we know that every time we
resize we have this alert box
you know pop-up however what we want to
happen
is move div and that's it because what's
gonna happen now is it's gonna regain or
regrab the window height and the window
width and the window height the object
with a guess isn't really important that
could be moved outside of the function
however then we then we reassign the top
and left values because we're calling
this function every time we resize the
window so now when we refresh and we go
ahead and resize this value this top and
this left value in CSS is constantly
updated so we can you know move this
around however we like but it's staying
in the center of the of the window so
just by using width and height and a
little common sense with regards to
these calculations we can set the CSS
top property and the CSS left property
to these values every time we resize by
just gaining the width and the height of
the window as we actually resize the
window so again quite a messy way of
doing it would be better placed into a
plugin and then we could call the
plug-in on any object we wanted and we
can use this just like here or this like
that you know instead of actually going
ahead and using the reference for very
center but you get the idea if you know
how to create a plug-in why not go ahead
and try to place this into or place this
code or incorporate this code into a
plug-in and it's quite a useful way of
centering things particularly if you're
creating more of a dynamic site that you
want something to stay in the center etc
so quite a useful you know piece of
knowledge of how to send to something
exactly and then resize it or replace it
every time the window is resized</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
