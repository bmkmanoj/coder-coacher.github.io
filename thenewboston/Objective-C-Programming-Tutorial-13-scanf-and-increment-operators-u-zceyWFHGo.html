to your 13th objective-c tutorial and in
this tutorial we're going to be learning
a few more tricks with the for loop and
also I'm going to be teaching you guys
an awesome function that's built into
objective-c is probably the best
function yet um it's a function that you
know we've been making programs where we
just typed a bunch of stuff in the
command line and it runs it's like a big
old calculator but we're finally going
to be building a program with user
interaction where they can type
something and they can determine the
outcome of the program so I know you're
like come on just get started already
well ok talk me into it so let's go
ahead and we need two variables we need
n to I and this is going to be the
counting variable for loop and we also
need a int code user num and this is
going to be this variable user num is
going to store the number that they type
in and what this program is going to do
is it's just going to loop through an
output numbers before but we're going to
ask the user how many numbers do you
want output so let's go ahead and do
that right now but NS log and all this
is going to be right here is a little
prompt so let's go ahead and give them a
prompt so they actually know what's
going on and say enter a number and and
I will print it out and make sure you
have a couple typos in there or else it
won't work I'm just kidding it actually
will but you know just thought it would
be funny on anyway so let's go ahead now
the next function I'm going to tell you
guys is called scan F and scan F is a
built-in function so we don't need to
build it later on Objective C gave this
function to us and what it does is it
takes the input from the keyboard and
it's a way that the user can interact
with your program so before we go ahead
and use this function you need to give
it two armed criteria to meet the first
criteria or the parameter I guess you
would say is what type of data are you
going to be storing so remember don't
put an @ sign for
and that is for objective-c object when
you don't put a sign it's a C string or
to see you know you guys don't really
need to know this is from another
language earlier around that they took
this function from but anyways go ahead
and put percent I so what we're telling
first is alright this user is going to
enter a number now and it's going to be
an integer number so we got that taken
care of now your computer or program
needs to know all right once they enter
this number what variable am I supposed
to store it in well we want to store it
in user num and one other thing you have
to do is you have to put in ampersand or
a + sign before it now I know you guys
don't know what this means yet but it's
actually it has to deal with pointers in
memory and stuff and I'm not going to be
talking about it to you guys in this
tutorial but remember when you're using
scanf drop the @ sign and add the + sign
the ampersand before the variable name
and i'll tell you guys i'll teach you
guys about pointers and memory and all
that stuff later but for now we're just
learning about the function so after
they enter a number it's going to store
that number in variable user numb so now
we can call our for loop just like we
did before so let's go ahead and put 4
and we started out i equals 1 that's why
we need that i before you should you
guys should know how to make a for loop
by now and now instead of i is less than
100 or something just put AI is less
than or equal to the user num so it's
going to go through the loop however
many times they wanted it to and last
but not least you guys are probably
thinking all right I equals I plus 1 and
this is perfectly fine but let me tell
you guys a little trick since I equals I
plus 1 is so common in programming or x
equals x plus 1 or bacon plus bacon plus
1 equals blake and plus 1 objective-c
gave you guys something called an
increment operator and what it does is
it just shorthand to do I equals I plus
1 or anything plus 1 what it does is if
you do plus plus I
or I plus plus they give you two
different options because one people
prefer one over the other
what it does is adds one to I and you
can only do this with numerical like you
couldn't do it if your variable was a
letter or something it's only with
numerical variables such as you know
whatever number they enter you can enter
you can PI I plus plus and automatically
adds one to the variable so it's a nice
little shorthand of putting I equals I
plus one it just makes it a whole lot
quicker so even though you guys aren't
probably used to seeing it like this you
will get used to this and by the way
this is the common way to do this is
what everyone does is in program in the
world so that's why I'm doing it so now
that we got our loop taken care of our
new and enhanced loop we can go ahead
and just print out NS log and go ahead
and put at of course for the NS log put
percent I and then just go ahead and
press I because the user num isn't going
to change its the I that's going to
change so let's go ahead and build and
run this and save it and let's see what
we got you got an air and it said oh
forgot my semicolon right here don't
want a memory leak and all right so
here's our final program enter a number
and I will print it out so what the user
would do let me get this right there
actually let me get away from my face
enter a number and I will print it out
so the user is like all right 21 press
Enter and so the program prints out one
through 21 just like that so they can
enter any number and let's build and run
this again and our number and I will
print it out running um 34 it go has and
runs one through 34 so this is our first
program that we bought that actually
took user interaction and we also learn
about the increment operator which is
going to save us a bunch of time in the
future and it just makes it look a whole
lot cleaner so for now thank you guys
for watching don't forget subscribe and
I'll see you
