and in this video I want to talk to you
guys about something called signals and
slots now what this is is basically a
way that we can have the user interact
with a program because in the last
tutorial check it out
we built this program crap right here
that said game time
pretty cool program but you know the
user can look at it and that's about it
they can't interact with the program in
any way and that's why we need to learn
about signals and slots the first level
of interactivity so first of all instead
of this cue label what I want to do is I
want to include a cue push button and
what this program is going to do is it's
basically going to allow the user to
click a button and whenever they click
the button
something is going to happen so the user
can now interact with this program so of
course get rid of this because this was
for the label and what we want to do
first since you know of course like I
just said the program is going to be a
button on the screen and whenever the
user clicks it does something we need to
go ahead and make that button so cue
push button and I'll just name this
button for simplicity it's actually a
pointer just like the label was and set
this equal to new cue push-button
already popping up for me now just like
the label in the constructor go ahead
and type the text and what this does is
it says what text you want to appear on
the button and I'll just say quit the
program so all this buttons going to do
is whenever you click the button your
program is going to quit just like
hitting the X on your window so now what
we need to do before we display this on
the screen because we can go ahead
button and show this so make it appear
on the screen now if we go ahead and
build and run this check it out we got a
program that is basically one big button
and whenever we click it ok nothing is
happening and that's because we didn't
add any functionality to the button yet
we just built the button and displayed
it on the screen so now this is where
signals in slots come in because signal
slots allow you to add functionality to
the widget or functionality to the
button so before you display the button
on the screen go ahead and type this Q
object colon colon connect and we
already know what the colon colon means
it's pretty much saying okay this
connect function right here appears in
several different classes but we want to
use the Q object connect so we already
know that from the last tutorial now
connect takes several parameters and I'm
going to be focusing on two parameters
out of the four but just go ahead and
type button and signal function and then
go ahead and type am saying app and slot
function now probably in the next couple
tutorials I'm going to be talking about
this first and the third parameter but
well I'm focus on going on now is the
signal and slot parameter right here so
let me go ahead and talk to you guys
about signals and slots before I just
start typing crap on my screen so uh
okay take a deep breath Bucky and okay
so cuteee creates a signal whenever a
user does something so for example
whenever the user is going to click the
button a signal is going to be generated
right here
so again signals can happen whenever the
user does a bunch of different things
slide a slider
choose an option from a drop-down menu
or click the button since we are only
worried about generating a signal
whenever they click that button let's go
ahead and throw clicked into here
this means generate a signal whenever
they click the button now what we can do
is we can use this connect function
right here to associate a signal which
is clicked with a certain function now a
function is called the slot basically
you need to know this whenever the user
does the signal the thing in the slot
happens so what do we want to happen
whenever the user clicked the button
well for the slot or the event that
happens we just want to quit now what
this function does is basically just
quits your program just shuts it down
so basically what
we did in this line is we use the
connect function to associate a signal
with a slot now the signal that we chose
was click the button and the slot that
we chose was quit the program so that's
what a signal and a slot are simple
enough so now let's go ahead and build
and run this and hopefully I don't have
any errors and I do so one second and oh
I see here yep remember I changed your
name um from program so if I go ahead
and just type program right there I keep
changing the names
I forgot I made it change the object
name to make it easier for you anyway so
let's go ahead and build and run this
again and there we go
so hopefully ok let me expand this a
little bit so you guys can say so
hopefully right now unlike before
whenever we click the button it doesn't
do anything
hopefully it quits the program so let me
go ahead and click it awesome my program
now quit so basically one more time
that's the basics of this tutorial in
order to you know have user interaction
you need to have signals and slots the
signal is the event that the user does
and the slot is the code that you want
to run whenever the user clicks the
button so there you have it thank you
