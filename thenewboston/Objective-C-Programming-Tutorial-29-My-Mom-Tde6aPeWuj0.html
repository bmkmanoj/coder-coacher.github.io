I
well guys is Bucky and if you are
looking for an enjoyable objective-c
tutorial then you are in the wrong place
because you know no jokes this tutorial
I've decided to you know just all
business teaching nothing funny let's
get right down to business
alright if you want some jokes then go
watch some other videos but now we're
just learning some objective-c so we
already built this class called Leslie
that inherited everything from nsobject
and by inheriting it means by able to
use all the variables in method but now
Leslie had this baby and it's his name
was Bucky so let's go ahead and make a
class called Bucky at interface I wish
all that crap didn't pop up Bucky I'm
gonna inherit everything for Mosley so
what exactly does this mean well now
that I inherited everything from my mom
and she inherited everything from
nsobject I automatically get all of her
variables all of her methods and all of
NS objects methods pretty cool huh
and variables by the way so now let's go
ahead and build a method of my own and I
will name this void and I'll just do
something simple print thing well let's
see easy enough and N and now let's go
also add a thank God that pops up though
because I hate typing an implementation
just this other stuff didn't pop up that
nice now let's implement my stuff
should just copy this but anyways void
so what does my print thing method do
well what is gonna do there we go
it's gonna NS log and ever saying all
right this is the finally the answer to
all your questions if we never made this
method NS log why were we able to use it
in the less you know 800 tutorials
well since NS log is a method in the
class and us object so since Leslie
inherited all these methods and we
inherited from Leslie that gave us the
permission to use NS log since it got
passed down from generation to
generation now any kids we have are
going to be able to use it so NS log and
it's just going to print out let's see %
I for integer that's dollar I don't do
that don't smell this at home what's
that guy on Blendtec say don't pre this
in guys or something dumb like that and
a so here brings up another point you're
saying all right
Bucky you're gonna get an error I'm
looking at your class right now you'd
never declared a variable called a so
higher you can print this dumb a
variable that's in your mom's class
right here this implementation of Leslie
but guys don't forget whenever I
inherited from Leslie I not only
inherited all her methods I also
inherited all of her variables right
here so anything that she can do I can
do as well the beauty of inheritance so
now let's go ahead and let me prove this
to you guys so now check this out we got
NS object and it has ton of methods
variable is that too many that I can
even list now Leslie my mom has a
variable a and this method called meth
which pretty much sets a 250 now I have
this method called print' thing
and since I inherited from nsobject and
my mom I cannot only use methods from
there but also variables from there
pretty cool huh
so let's go ahead and in our main method
right here let's go ahead and let's see
what we need to do after typing this
stuff Bucky make a pointer I'm just
gonna name my object B I mean why not
and instead equal do C I wish this stuff
filled into all the stuff that I don't
want fills in fills in so lucky allocate
me some memory and initialize that beast
beast ice and now B meth and you're like
hold on
Bucky one last time I'm looking at your
interface right here and you only have
this one method called print' thing you
don't have this method called meth
that's in your mom's class but guys
don't forget since I inherited from my
mom anything that she can use I can use
pretty cool huh
so even though we made this in Leslie
Bucky's able to use it so with that
being notice we can also use my method
print thing and just so I talk to you
guys through this what method does is
pretty much sets a 250 print thing just
takes a and prints it out and then once
we're done with all that memory that
they allocated we got a give it back so
I don't crash my computer and now pull
drain and return zero
let's build and run this and see what we
get save all
there we go I just had to scroll down I
thought someone was messed up
so all it does is prowl so one last time
let me show you guys what's going on
well I already talked about that enough
let's just go this alright there's this
class built in your computer already is
called NS object it has ton of methods
in variables just wanting you to use
them but in order to use them you have
to inherit them and we inherited them
all in a class called Leslie so I'll
give you guys the definitions later and
then Leslie had a child and that child's
name was Bucky not be okie and he
inherited everything from Leslie and
nsobject
so anything and it's object had Bucky
could use anything Leslie had Bucky can
use so the terminology for this is this
anytime a class is above you it's called
your superclass so Leslie and NS objects
are super classes of Bucky and NS object
is a superclass of Leslie now any class
that's under you is called a subclass
that I say super not in it I said that
right it's called a subclass so for
example if you're saying if at your
teacher said give me all the subclasses
of NS object you would say Leslie and
Bucky if he said give me all the
subclasses of Bucky you said oh there is
none and you can get a hundred on your
test thank you and again from super
classes and subclasses a lot of people
also Karim parents and children so for
example the parent of Leslie would be
Ana subject in the child of Leslie would
be Bucky now the parent of Bucky would
be Leslie in the grandparent of Bucky
would be nsobject so you know it's just
different terminology if you ever talk
to a programmer and say you know what's
the parents of Bucky or what's the
superclass is Bucky they'll understand
what you're talking about it means the
same thing but pretty much you inherit
everything from your parents
and yeah that's pretty much it so in
this tutorial one last time
Leslie inherited everything from
nsobject which gave us a bunch of
methods including NSLog she also made a
couple of her own methods called meth
which and a variable called a and then
Bucky inherited everything from Leslie
which was pretty much a meth and all the
methods from nsobject so he had the most
methods of all so whenever he wanted to
call his little thing be meth he was
able to do that and be pretty was he
able to do that too so uh I'm running
out of time for this tutorial but if you
have any uh I don't know fuzziness on
subject again like I said do not message
me on youtube messenger I never look at
it whatsoever if you want to get hold of
me go to my forum I'll put a link in the
description box because I'm always on
there I'll be so happy to answer any of
your questions in I'll also have the
source code for these tutorials on there
so uh one last time thank you guys so
much for watching thank you guys for
subscribing and hopefully I'll see you
in my forum</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
