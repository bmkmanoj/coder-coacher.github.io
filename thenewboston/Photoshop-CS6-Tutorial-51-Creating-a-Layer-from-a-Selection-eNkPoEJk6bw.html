Photoshop cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and today
we're going to learn how to create a
layer from a selection and this is
pretty helpful because you can use the
contents of one layer to up and apply it
to another layer to essentially combine
the layers in a sense there so what I'm
going to show you now starts out by
creating something such as like text or
something like that or anything that you
can use that has transparency in it that
we can use to select so I'm go ahead and
we can turn our background off so we can
see that there is transparency within my
text here so I'm just going to turn it
back on and what we're going to do is
use a technique from the last tutorial
about creating a selection from my layer
and apply that to this tutorial so we're
going to create a selection from this
layer by clicking holding ctrl and
clicking on the thumbnail and now our
text is now selected and you can see
that here that selected around is
transparency also now what I want to do
is I imported this picture here of a
color scheme and you can see what is
going to do now it's going to take this
selection here and cut out the parts
that are selected actually it's going to
keep those parts and delete everything
else it's actually not going to delete
it it's actually going to make a new
layer and that way it can be these
certain colors that I have on here now
so when you have your thing your text
selected click on the layer that you
want to have it cut out of which is for
me the color scheme layer then you're
going to use the hotkey ctrl J and it
makes a copy and it's going to put it
right above the actual your active layer
so ctrl J now if I turn off all my if I
want to turn off all my other layers
just hold down alt and click on the
actual layer that we want to see which
for me is called layer 2 and now you can
see that this layer now has the colors
from the color scheme layer now if I go
look at the color scheme layer real
quick you can see that nothing's been
cut out and has been preserved as the
same image and a same thing with the
select me text so that's how you use the
the colors are the selection to create a
new layer now you can also do this in
other ways by using like selections like
that so let's turn off this layer and
then we'll bring up the color scheme
layer again and I'm going to go over
here to the pen tool here and click on
it and what I'm going to do is just draw
out a selection for us real quick the
pen tool is able to make selections so
click on it and just drag to make some
lines that will make us a selection or
something like that there we go and
click on this selection button up here
in the pen tool options where it says
make and then click selection and then
hit OK
and now we have a new selection that's
been made now we get all we have to do
is make sure we're on color scheme for
active layer and then ctrl J haki
and now we have created this little
boomerang looking thing in here so
that's how another way you can use it
you can use your selection your square
selection tools or rectangular you can
use your lasso to draw your own
selection if you would want if you
wanted to and all that kind of stuff now
you can make a quick copy of an entire
layer if you wanted to by using the move
tool and we can use the Move tool to
just like drag out another
baby for example this is how it works
and it created a whole nother copy but I
want to just add some more stuff to it
so I want to have this select me over
here and I'm going to just merge these
two layers together by having them both
selected right clicking and clicking on
merge layers so now we know we have two
different things now combined into this
one layer so if you have the move tool
selected and you hold down alt and you
drag out it's going to copy everything
that you had in that layer just like
that now this is a quicker way than
going through and selecting everything
and then trying to make another copy out
of it that way so that's how moving that
I was just like a little quick tip that
I throw it in there another way to do
this is to select a layer and then hit
control and then J to move the layer now
my favorite thing are holding the hotkey
ctrl J isn't really my favorite thing
because I can barely reach over there
with one hand so I have to use two hands
and I don't really like switch into two
hands when I'm working so I like the
holding all and moving the move tool a
lot better than that so that's a
tutorial on creating a lair from a
selection and I added some bonus stuff
in there for you so hopefully you guys
can use this information on your
upcoming projects or anything like that
