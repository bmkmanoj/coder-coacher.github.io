this one stands for cyan magenta yellow
and black and it's best for print so
when you're printing out like a photo or
you're printing out like a brochure or a
menu for someone that's supposed to be
look nice and professional the next one
we have is the lab color so it stands
for luminosity and then a and B channels
and I'll go into channels a little bit
more later but this is the best for
correcting images and it puts grayscale
information in the luminosity channel
and then the a and B channels have your
color information so when you're working
with an image I keep on talking about
channels when you're working with an
image it has these different channels
that have the different color
information different shades of that
color in that channel when you take all
the channels and put them all together
it'll create images with the kind of
color that you'll normally see like a
regular color so let me see if I can
bring that up for you guys so if I come
over here to on the right where our
panels are there's a panel called
channels now if I turn off let's see if
I can get this to work now this the the
channels on this seem to be in the black
and white and then this is all of them
combined so they've just got the black
and white colors here but this is the
information of the green and blue and if
we combine two of them then we're going
to get a green and a blue color now
Photoshop puts these into black and
white just so it's easier to see
and easier to see what's going on in
these images
so let's I'm going to go back up and
open this back up again real quick and
go over resolution a little bit so in
the the resolution is the amount of
pixels you can fit into what you're
viewing so the resolution of a typical
monitor is 1024 by 768 and that equals
out if you multiply that out it mow to
around 786 thousand pixels on the screen
so that's how you figure out how many
pixels per inch are in your in your
screen now the higher amount of
resolution you have the better color and
quality of color that you're going to
get and it's going to be nicer and like
less blocky and everything like that
so I wanted to go over the different
types of resolutions that you that you
all want to use it allows you to type
these in if you want but these are the
main ones that you should use use 72
pixels per inch if you're making like
webpages CDs or DVDs and other video use
a hundred and fifty if you're like
printing things on like an inkjet
printer use 200 like these are at home
at home printers use 200 pixels per inch
if you're using a photo printer and then
finally use 300 pixels per inch if
you're going to do some commercial
printing so if you have a photo business
in you're taking pictures of someone and
selling them you want to get the
have your resolution at 300 pixels per
inch and that's going to be the most
color value that you'll get now if we go
ahead and check out some of these
presets you'll see that they'll have
some of these already on there for you
so if I go to web we're going to have a
width and a height that they just came
up with and then the resolution was 72
remember I just said that's what it
would that's what it should be if you're
working with web and the color mode was
RGB like I said before that it should be
now if I come down to photo we're going
to see that the resolution is not 300
and we should change this to CMYK and
that'll be well CMYK will be for
commercial printing RGB will be just for
like regular printing so those are these
are just the here's a mobile device I
mean these are just the couple presets
but most of the time when I'm working I
don't use the preset and I just go to
cut I just type in my custom values that
I got from my client that I was working
with so I think that's a good time to
stop at this tutorial the main thing I
wanted to get through to you was that
you have to pre-plan when you're about
to make a new Photoshop document you
want to remember you want to know what
is going on ahead of time so you don't
have to redo it later into in time so
all the work that you did you don't want
it to be off or nothing so that's pretty
much what I wanted to get through to you
thanks a lot for watching this tutorial
thumbs up if you liked and thumbs down
if you didn't like it
I know it was a lot of information and
not a whole lot of action but sometimes
you got to get to
you got to grind through the the basics
and all that stuff until you and then
you can start making some cool stuff so
that's just how it goes in life I guess
so thanks for watching everybody and see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
