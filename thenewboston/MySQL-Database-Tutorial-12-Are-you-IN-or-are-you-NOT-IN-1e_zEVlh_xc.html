12 and in this lesson where we're going
to be talking about is the in and not in
statements so say we were working on
this awesome database and the police
come storming in the door and they're
like Bucky we just caught the murder and
I'm like what murderer who the heck
murdered anyone he's like don't worry
about it anyways they're in your
database and we know that they either
live in California North Carolina or New
York can you give us a list of all those
suspects so you were like heck yeah
select name and state from customers
we're and we're like hold on we type
that wrong I'm going to have to type
that again we're state equals and we're
like what's your list because we forgot
California or state equals North
Carolina or state equals New York and
we're just going to go ahead and say
okay just go ahead and let me run this
query and bam there is your list it
needs like yep okay oh oh wait wait wait
hold on did you just say something sorry
I fell asleep that query took way too
long to type and check it out we only
have three options here but if we were
to have more states then look at this
query it's going to get very messy and
you know with three options that's all
it took but what if we wanted you know
to include ten or fifteen states then
things would get really complicated so
I'm going to show you guys a shortcut
whenever you need to use a bunch of or
statements you can just use the
statement in and it's going to make it a
whole lot easier so I'm just going to go
ahead and hit select name and I think we
select a state from customers where
states now the very first thing you do
is you give it the condition to search
for word I want to search for a bunch of
different states so I want to search for
a state in now right after in go ahead
and type parentheses and instead of
making a whore
did I just say whore I am sorry I
apologized all the slutty moms out there
shouldn't have said that that's why you
know people don't let my tutorials be
washed in college or high school or
anything because sometimes I just say
inappropriate things like that
but anyways after in we're going to give
a huge list for example CA or what was
my next one and see and I think it was
New York if I'm correct or NY now that's
basically all we do so as you can see
instead of making three different or
statements we just go ahead and say okay
where the state is in California North
Carolina or New York and then we just go
ahead and hit go and check it out exact
same results except we didn't have to
use all of those or statements now
typically whenever you are searching for
a bunch of different things in the list
then you add a condition just so order
it at the end it just makes it organize
a little bit better so we would probably
want to order this by state and now
check it out this is just going to make
it a little bit prettier so as you can
see instead of saying okay search for
all the people who live in California
North Carolina or New York even though
we're sort basically searching for three
different or test we can just go ahead
and make one test with a list of all the
states and it makes it a whole lot
easier now say that the police was like
oh you know what in fact I figured out
that the suspect the one we were trying
to catch he actually does not live in
these three states he must live in the
other 47 states so can you give me a
list of all the suspects who live in the
other 47 states and you may be thinking
oh crap so before we learn about this
nice little n thing we might have to
make a huge or list that says or
Arkansas or Alabama or and we would have
to list 47 or statements however check
this out if we want to say okay search
for all the people who do not live in
these three
Faith's all we have to do is do this
guys this is probably the coolest thing
I ever taught you not in California
North Carolina or New York how awesome
is that so isn't that a whole lot easier
than making 47 or statements basically
whenever we want to search for customers
who do not live in any of these states
then instead of in where would be the
opposite they would have to live in
these states just go ahead and type not
now you're going to see this not not
only when you're working with lists but
whenever you put not before any testing
condition it pretty much reverses the
test so we could have something well
I'll show you guys test later on but now
let me just go ahead and run this query
real quick and check it out we now get a
list of all the customers who do not
live in these three states in other
words we get a list of all the customers
who live in the other 47 states so first
of all that police officer isn't doing a
very good job because you know there's a
lot of people left who live in 47 states
so you know they need to kind of brush
up on the work a little bit but anyways
what we are worried about are these
queries so basically like I said
whenever you want to use a bunch of or
statements you can just use in and then
type a list and parenthesis instead and
it does the exact same thing it just
makes it a whole lot easier or whenever
you want to exclude a list or use
something like not in just go ahead and
type the keyword not in and then make
sure to put all your options in a list
in guys another key thing make sure not
to forget the parentheses because it's
very important so there you go there you
have it that is what in and not in does
basically takes a bunch of or statement
and cleans up makes them a whole lot
easier so thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
