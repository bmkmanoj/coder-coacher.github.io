slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to
continue working on our FTP download so
now we need to do is since we've already
made it where it will show the files in
the directory of our server let's go
ahead and allow the user to download one
of the files so we'll go ahead and
access the download click event and
let's go ahead and show a message box to
make sure they really want to download
the file so we'll type if message box
not show I'll say
are you sure you want to download
and we'll just go ahead and add the file
so we'll go ahead and do list FTP files
dot selected item
so this will give us the name of the
selected item and for the title let's
just go ahead and say confirm and then
we'll do message box buttons dot ok and
cancel so they can press ok or cancel
the download and for the icon will just
do message box icons dot and let's do a
question okay so if this message box is
equal to so if it equals dialog result
dot okay then what do we want to do so
message box is a dialog you should know
this already because when you show a
message box the user can't do anything
outside of that message box until they
click a button inside of it or close out
of it so we're going to show the message
box and if the result is ok then what do
we want to do
we'll use FTP downloaded so FTP
downloader and now we're going to
download file so we will just download
and now this is going to take some
arguments now the first argument is
going to be the source file name so what
we can do is just use list FTP files dot
selected item
dot and then I'm just going to rode it
to a string no we don't need to do that
because that's already a string and
therefore the local file name let's just
go ahead and download it to the
downloads folder
because that is the default for browsers
and any other program you're going to
use now you can also incorporate a save
file dialog but for now let's just save
it in the downloads so like local file
name is going to be my dot computer dot
file system dot git
directories and let's see here we're
going to have to get special folders so
special directories
and what we want to access is downloads
let's see here
hmmm looks like there isn't a downloads
in here so we'll just use my documents
so it's my dog computer dot file system
dot special directories mine documents
and now we're going to have to have a
name for that file so when you go to
access a file in your computer let's say
I go to computer here you can see that
it has computer if I go to C it's C
colon backslash now backslash separates
folders and files so we're going to do
My Documents backslash and then we will
add list FTP files dot selected item
now you can see here that we have my
documents and then the name of the file
now we have another argument that is
going to take and is permit override so
if you set this equal to true it will
overwrite that file if it already exists
now this comes default as false so let's
just leave it as false so let's go ahead
and run this and hopefully everything
will work so we'll go ahead and go to
our home directory and let's download
jackal dot txt go ahead and click
download and it says are you sure you
want to download jackal dot txt we'll go
ahead and click OK and it will download
the file for us and it looks like yes we
did not set overwrite equal to true and
since the file already exists it will
not overwrite it so all we have to do is
put true right there and let's move this
arrow up to the top so it will show the
message box again and we'll run this
says are you sure are you sure you want
to download jackal text go ahead and
click OK and we'll come to my documents
and let's scroll down here
where is it
here it is
let me just make this a little bit
smaller
so here is our Jack elects file that we
just downloaded so we can go ahead and
minimize now that and let's download
YouTube copy to dot txt so we'll go
ahead and click OK and it should
download that to My Documents town let's
see if it's in here and here it is right
there
YouTube copy too so go ahead and put in
the code that will let files me download
and then once you do that go ahead and
move on to the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
