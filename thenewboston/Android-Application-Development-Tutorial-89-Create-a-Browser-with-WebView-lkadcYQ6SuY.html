Android tutorial for the new Boston and
in this tutorial we're gonna build a
simple browser get that going what I've
done is I've created again a class
called simple browser and an XML file
called simple browser I kind of set up
just basically out and edit text here
with a go button and then we got to go
back a go-forward button a refresh
button in a clear history button so
those are kind of the basic concepts
we're going to go through here
in the next tutorial or two so the first
thing we need to do is have a web view
and the web view allows us to kind of
surf the internet it kind of gives us a
view according to whether we have an XML
file we want to load I'm sorry HTML file
we want to load up or if we just want to
use kind of a URL so we need to set that
up so again I kind of you guys can set
up your layout however you want for the
most part but our back button I just put
called be back forward button be forward
be refresh and be history and then for
edit text I have et URL and for the
button I have the reference be go that's
for the Go button and then below that
we're going to just set up our edit text
I'm sorry
text webview so it's pretty simple just
say web view I mean then we just need to
set that up for Android layout width is
going to be equal to fill parent and
Android layout height can fill parent
because we're taking up everything else
that's available here and then we're
also what's going on there
we're also gonna give it an ID so we're
gonna say oops at Plus Ford's F plus ID
Ford / webview browser or something like
that and we're pretty much we're pretty
much good to go here with the tutorial
so as you can see here's our webview
actually that's going to load up our
website and such like that so now let's
go into the first thing we need to do is
we need to go on to the manifest and
give us the permission to use the
internet so we're going to go into the
manifest go to permissions add a
permission uses permissions and then
over here we're going to search for one
called internet all right here so
that'll allow us to kind of use the
Internet pretty hobbies' there and we're
just going to save it and then we have
our wakelock internet and set wallpaper
so far our permissions for this activity
now what we need to do is we need to go
into the the Java code and we're going
to set up that reference as always so
we're going to just say webview our
browser our brow something like that and
again we're just gonna say find oops
webview here find view by ID and then
we're just gonna say our dot ID dot our
browser is on our browser oh yeah it was
a webview our browser and web view
browser there and now what we can do is
let's say we just want to have our
initial web view to load up like for
example my site we could say our browser
or our brow dot low
odhh we can load data which would be
like written in HTML or we can say load
URL so we can just go load URL and then
within quotations we're going to say
HTTP ford slash forward slash wwm I
bring back comm and in quotations and
that should load up just like my website
when we run our application so let's
just check it out so basically all we've
created is a web view and we've learned
about this method called load URL so
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
we kind of set up everything again you
guys need permission for the internet so
I forgot to add it to the menu class
here
I
so in the next tutorial we'll learn a
little bit a few more methods we can use
for this web view type object but let's
just make sure we check out our simple
browser we click on it as of now nothing
is there and then we're hopefully going
to get this to load
yeah it's loading my website right here
and obviously it's you can you can still
pan around get everything going there
and it's fully functional so I will
catch you guys in the next tutorial have
a good one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
