tutorial that I'm making for the New
Boston and in this tutorial I'm gonna be
showing you how to use the screen reader
class a little bit more in depth so all
you're going to need for this tutorial
is a button and text box and you're also
going to need the code that we used in
the last tutorial so in the last
tutorial we only really concentrated on
reading the information to the right up
here just this the circuitous text well
in this tutorial we're going to be
looking at reading these new you're all
plights so in order to do that we're
just going to want to use the s our base
stream dot read bite we're going to look
at that method first and basically what
this will do is we'll just read a byte
and since we haven't specified a
position it will just read the first
byte in right here so it'll be 61
however this isn't 61 how you and I know
it this is 61 and a hexadecimal and
hexadecimal is basically a different way
of representing numbers and hexadecimal
is a number system based off of 15 so
instead of going like 9 10 11 goes 9 a b
c d e f and then 10 so like I said it's
a number system based off bit keys so we
can like as you can see right there this
is 6 a and a 6 B well yeah I can contain
um letters it can take contain letters A
through F so the maximum value for a
bite like I said in not thirty-fifth sea
shark tutorial was 255 well 255 and
hexadecimal is at that so it hexadecimal
will allow every byte to be only 2
characters in length and not 3 we were
to go up to 255 so when we read this by
if we were to read this byte into the
text box right here and use the dot Q
string method to convert it into a
ring well instead of converting into
hexadecimal it will convert it into
decimal so when we open this up and read
this right here it will appear as though
we read the wrong value
well actually we didn't 61 in decimal or
the common number system that we use is
97 so in order for it to be displayed as
in hexadecimal we're going to have to
put an X right inside of there and
basically what this would do is it just
allow us to a roll it would it will
represent the number as hexadecimal so
now when we devolve and open up that
text file to read it yeah we get 61
which is exactly what it should be so
say you want to only or say you want to
read multiple bytes and not just one
bite
well instead of calling this method
multiple times what we can do is we can
use the reed method dot base dream diary
and what this will do is it will need
multiple bytes and right here the first
argument that a calls for right here is
a Boyar a so we're going to go ahead and
go up here to create a new by a right
call it by 1900 call it chocolate and
usually byte arrays are called blockers
or vita' raise you're going to be
reading information into are called
buffers so just something you should
probably know I'm just going to have it
be equal to a new empty byte array and
it will just be a few bytes in length so
now just go up like buffering right
there which is our byte array that we
just created and then this int offset
right here well that is the element in
are quite irate that we're going to have
it start at or start reading information
into it and we're just knowing I would
start at the zero element or the
beginning element in the array and then
the int count is how many how many bytes
you want it to read and we're just gonna
have it read three which would be these
two
lights right here because of the length
or a byte arrays in the three so it's
kind of read three that's all it calls
for so now after it calls this method
our buffer or a byte array right here
should have the bytes 61 73 and 64 in it
well in order to display those in the
text box we're going to use a for each
statement so it'll go through each
element or each byte in this byte array
buffer right here and it will read it
into their rule right into the text box
so we're just gonna call it my plight
I'm going to say in offer or our wide
array right here and then we're going to
have text box once text plus equal this
byte to string but remember we're gonna
have to put an X inside of here so that
in the in the text box it will be seen
as hexadecimal and we're just going to
go ahead and also have it put a space in
between each byte so that we can read it
a little bit easier because otherwise it
would just be a whole bunch of numbers
I'll squish together and that's no fun
to read so now when we debug here and
click button one we open up our file we
should get the bytes 61 73 and 64 text
box yup
now the last thing I'm going to show you
actually no I'm gonna show you two more
things but the next thing I'm going to
show you is how to set your position or
tell the writer what position you want
it to right at well we're going to have
to set something called the the offset
or the position and then we want to read
drop well stay want to start at right
here so say we want to read these three
bytes well what we're going to have to
do is we're gonna have to tell the
reader to start there and as you go down
here you have to see the offset is 4 we
just remember that we'll use that in a
second so what we're going to do down
here if we're going to s our base your
top position and this will set the
position
the reader and we're going to want to
have it start right here and we're going
to use this offset right here and that's
the position in the file that you want
to start at so we're going to have it
start at this four offset say four so
now it should read these three byte that
should read 66 67 73 yup 66 67 and 73
just like an H XD well let's say you
want to have it start over here well the
offset is see how are we supposed to
represent this in c-sharp we can't just
put C right there because it says the
name C does not exist in the current
context well in order to represent
hexadecimal in c-sharp we're just going
to put 0x in front of it and now this
will represent hexadecimal but if you
just put C that would represent C zero
we wanted to represent zero C so now
when we debug it should read these three
bytes right here which is sixty one
sixty six and sixty one again so now we
go ahead open this text file get set yup
261 66 and 61 so that's pretty much it
for this tutorial on stream readers and
the next tutorial we're going to be
getting into your stream writers writing
information so that's it see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
