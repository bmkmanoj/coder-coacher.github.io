the air filter so first of all what the
heck is an air filter and why do I need
it well as you guys know in order for an
engine to run that needs a mixture of
fuel and air so this is of course where
your air comes from this job is to suck
in air from the atmosphere from outside
clean in this little compartment right
here in out put it right here now this
Pike right here goes directly into the
carburetor and the carburetor is
responsible for um pretty much
everything from there so now that this
job basically is to take air from
outside and supply it to your engine how
does it clean it well many of the air
filters especially the ones in your car
or truck they use kind of a paper
pleated filter but this one right here
is a little bit different what it uses
is kind of a foam I know you guys can't
see but there's like a foam padding
right here and also two screens one is
right on the intake and one is right
before the final hose to the carburetor
see if I can pull it out right there so
of all those different things you see if
I move this baby back in so those are
all the different ways that this air
filter cleans the air and oops
now I'm going to show you guys how to
install it on your engine by the way if
you guys are looking for where the air
filter is on your engine all you have to
do is look at the carburetor in the big
it's probably a rubber pipe coming from
your carburetor not the fuel line but
the big really wide one that's your air
filter just go ahead and follow that
until you find a big plastic box and
there it is now the first thing I want
to do is show you guys the process of
how you install the air filter the first
thing we need to do is you need to make
sure that your cover is installed so if
you don't have a paper filter or
whatever type of filter your air filter
uses go ahead and stick one in
then screw on your cover now that that's
complete what you need to do is you want
to take note of everywhere where you're
going to have a hose connection first of
all the obvious is the big main hose
that goes to the carburetor and that's
going to go ahead and attach to the
carburetor using a hose clamp right here
that's what this big thing is for now
you may think that hey that's it once
it's attached to the carburetor it's
good to go but then if you take a closer
look you notice a couple more hose
connections first is this one right next
to that big hose and second is this one
right here now what these are for is for
a system called the PCV system which
helps pretty much remove harmful gas
vapors from well actually what I'm going
to do is I'm going to go into detail
later on about the PCV system and where
to hook everything up but for now and
just remember that smaller hoses get
hooked up here to protect the well it's
the protect the atmosphere and your
engine both but just take note of it for
now so after that we want to do is you
want to take note of where it's going to
bracket to your frame so the main
location of bracket steer frame is in
the rear of the air filter so once you
got everything situated you might want
to actually you probably want to hook up
your hoses first but you want to take
note that it's going to bracket right on
here on the frame using two bolts now if
you notice there's also a bracket right
here in the front of the air filter now
actually you don't want to go ahead and
attach this one yet you want to save
that for a couple videos because this it
doesn't bolt directly on the frame
there's actually a little adapter that
the PCV system uses that goes in between
the air filter in the frame so don't
bolt this one on yet if you bolt this
one on it'll be secure enough so you can
work on your engine and not have any
problems but anyways let's go ahead and
first adapt the hoses to where they need
to be alright so first things first
go ahead and take your main hose and
slide it over an intake section of your
carburetor and then take your hose clamp
and slide it right in position where its
butt it up so it can be tightened
now they usually have just a regular
flathead screwdriver so go ahead and
tighten this so it's nice and snug and
now just give it a little tug test and
your air filter is now hooked up to your
carburetor now all you have to do is
bracket the rest of these bolts on your
air filter bracket for the frame and
you'll be good to go
alright guys now like I said your air
filter is going to bracket on your frame
in three different locations two bolts
in the back and one bolt in the front
but don't worry about the front bolt for
now because we need to add another piece
on there later on so you know no point
taking into bolting something in there
and then having to unbolt it later on so
as you see the frame or the bracket from
the framing the bracket from the air
filter look pretty much similar so what
we're going to do is we're going to use
two rubber washers and they're going to
go like this I'll show you guys the
positioning first you have a metal
washer nut split washer just a regular
metal washer and then you're going to
put your rubber washer right on there
now after that that's when you bolt it
through your air or air filter unit
right like here now in between the
bracket for your air filter and bracket
for your frame add another rubber washer
so you have a rubber washer padding
those two things now just go ahead and
put your nut on and you'll be good to go
I see you'll be good to go a lot
purchase left in then now don't tighten
that all the way because you need a
little bit of a wiggle room to get the
other rubber washer in the other side so
again one more time your bowl metal
rubber air filter rubbers
and that's what I was talking about we
don't have room and then your frame and
then your no now all you have to do is
sit back and behold your final
installation as you can see your air
filter is now properly connected to your
carburetor bolted on the frame securely
now just remember whenever I talk about
your PCV system that you want to put a
hose right here and also up here but we
don't have to worry about that right now
oh and another thing put the PCV
cartridge right there that's where that
mounts but for now we're just worried
about the air filter so mission
accomplished don't know what we're going
to be doing in the next video but it's
going to be awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
