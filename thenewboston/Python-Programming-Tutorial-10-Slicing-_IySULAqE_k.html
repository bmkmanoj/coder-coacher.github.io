to your tenth Python tutorial and in
this story I'm going to be showing you
guys or teaching guys how to do
something called slicing now what
slicing is is pretty much just like it
sounds
unless you slice out or extract certain
pieces of a sequence so um that's pretty
much it so let me show you guys let me
make an example list and I will name an
example because yes that's how creative
I am and let's number at zero through
nine zero one two three six seven eight
nine mess it up at all looks good to me
and now once you have that I forgot two
equal sign go ahead and press ENTER and
it will create your example list
sequence for you whatever you want to
call it now in order to slice out
certain pieces of your sequence here's
what you need to do type in the name of
your list then in your square braces
type the first element that you want to
include in your extraction or slice so I
want it to begin with four next add a
semicolon and we have to do after this
is add the number that you want here I'm
just going to show you guys what it is
four to eight gives you four to seven so
this four right here is the first number
that you want to include in your
extraction but this 8 right here that's
this and that's the last lump less
number that you don't want to include so
again this first one is what you include
and this last one is like kind of your
once it gets to that don't include
anymore
so again if you extract for some for
colon eight it gives you an extraction
of four through seven so just keep that
in mind so this presents the problem
alright what if we want to extract all
of these so would we do four through
nine well let's see how that is example
E and four : nine well this gives you
four to eight but we can't do four three
10 because 10 is not even part of this
armed list at all or is it so let's go
ahead and try that out so 4 : 10 and bam
this will give us our end of our list
and that is one way where you can um use
a slice to extract all the pieces to an
end of your list
just add one more to the rest of your
list so if this list goes to 9 then add
10 but there are a lot easier ways to do
this so for example you could do it that
way in another thing that you can do is
extract a negative or let me show you
guys another problem that we have if you
have a long list and you want to start
from backwards and extract this way
could you do something like negative 5
going negative 1 so this should give you
all this right well let's see
nope it still is missing that 9 so how
can we um kind of expand that negative 1
px and feel the example maybe if we go
negative 5 to 0 maybe that'll work
no that's definitely not what we want so
I wish there was a shortcut that we
could count backwards but also include
the end of the list hmm
Bamm roasted toasted Bucky you are
genius I think I just thought of
something and I thought of something I
mean I learned this and I cheated how we
can do this is something well I don't
know what it's called but you pretty
much leave your end empty and what this
means is continue to the last element so
you just put example negative 5 that's
the beginning of your range and the end
of your range is empty and this is going
to continue on the entire list and just
get all the rest of it so press ENTER
and look it does all the work for you
and you can also make it for the
beginning empty and make your end what
you want so let's go put Adam for
example on let's go ahead and put 3 : oh
wait a minute we just did that SM bear
that's embarrassing I mean : 7 and it
will start at the beginning and give you
all your list to that checkpoint so
that's how you can do that and that's
how you can slice without knowing the
very first value but only going to the
end of whatever you want you guys really
need to play around with this in another
thing I want to teach you guys before I
let you guys go
what if you do that and you don't
include any values well this is a little
shortcut to get your entire list so
again when you're slicing you need two
values the first one is the first one
you want to include the second number is
what you want to go to you can also do
it backwards and again if you don't
include one of the numbers then it's
just going to go all the way to the end
and include everything now I said that
that was the last thing that I'm going
to teach you about a lot there's also a
third element that you can have and let
me show you guys how this works now the
first two elements where your starting
point in your ending point but there's
also a third colon that you can add and
the third number and this is how many
let's say how much you want to increment
by so let's say I start at one and a
seven and I know type two a and go by
twos this is how you would extract every
other number so let's go ahead and we
see one three five seven so as you can
see there's also a third parameter here
that you could use so now we have the
starting number the ending number and an
optional number right here about how
much you want to increment my or how
many numbers you're going to skip before
I get to the next one and you could also
go from right to left and to do this
let's get our example list again we will
need the upper most number the bottom
most number and if we want to go from
right to left we need a negative number
in here so once we have that you can see
all right now we're counting backwards
so this last number right here
only skips every other number but it
also allows you to count backwards in a
list or sequence when slicing and this
is going to be real useful in just so
you guys can cheat if you guys ever get
lazy I just want to tell you guys that
there you can also use the shortcut for
this and what this would do is include
everything in your list and also count
backwards so let me do that and it'll
give you the same result so if you
include if you want to do your whole
list that's the only reason this will be
useful you don't have to set the
parameters but again this is a little
shortcut to count backwards from your
entire list and I know this can be kind
of confusing slicing but pretty much
just watch this tutorial again follow
along with every example and by the end
of it I promise you'll be a pro at
slicing and be able to extract any
information you want from your list so
that is the basics on slicing I hope you
guys learned something I guess I'll just
see you next tutorial that's all I have
to teach you this time so I'm looking
forward to it I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
