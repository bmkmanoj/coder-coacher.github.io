c-sharp tutorial that I'm making for the
new Boston and in this tutorial we're
gonna hopefully finish working on our
CAPTCHA generator alright so the first
thing we have to do here is have a
folder browser dialog be displayed and
when the user clicks on this choose
folder button and after the user selects
a folder for all four captures to be
saved into we're just going to have this
labels text change to that path all
right so let's just go ahead and double
click on this choose folder button right
here and we're gonna stay folder browser
dialog FBE equals a new folder browser
dialog and then we're gonna check to see
if the user actually did select the
location in their folder browser dialog
so we're gonna say if FG dot show
dialogue dialogue equals dialog result
okay then we're just going to have that
labels text change to that location so
we're going to say label one text equals
FD d selected path and selected path
property is basically just the path that
they selected in the folder browser
dialog alright so let's just go ahead
and test this out here so when you click
on this choose folder button which
you're gonna pull their browser dialog
yep you can select a folder it's my
output folder where all the CAPTCHAs
will be saved into when I click OK this
label stuck in change to that location
yep it gets a little bit cut off right
there but it's okay alright and one more
thing that we have to do before we move
on to actually saving the images we're
gonna have to move this random above the
for loop because if we don't all the
images will be the same since all the
random numbers generated will be the
same so we just have to have one
instance of this random class right here
alright so before we just had a for each
statement saying for each images or for
each image and all these images that it
returns we're just gonna have a message
box show well let's just go ahead and
delete that and stay image array images
will generate CAPTCHAs and then the
amount that we want to generate user
inputs right here so we're gonna say
convert to + 32 which can just an
integer and then Xbox one step actually
just want to convert that into an int
and then have that many capsules be
generated alright and then we're gonna
create an integer G right here and we're
gonna need that because we need to
access the string that G's index and
string will basically just be the name
of the image and remember strings holds
basically the md5 hash of the string
that's in the CAPTCHA alright so now
we're just gonna say or each image image
in the generated images the images array
so images then just want to basically
save that image so we're just going to
say image save and the location that we
want to save it to is legal ones text
because remember we change the label
ones text the number of user selects the
path so I'm gonna say label ones X plus
slash slash and we have to put two
slashes because if we put one it will
just cancel out this quote right here so
to put two and then we want to add to
that or the file name will be this md5
hash of the string inside of the CAPTCHA
so it's gonna say string at the GE index
alright and then we're just gonna want
to make the file extension be PNG so
it'll be a PNG image alright and then
after it does this we just want to
increment G by 1 so that it will
actually get the corresponding on string
for the image alright so let's just go
ahead and test this out here and make
sure that it works so when we bug and
choose a folder can't use my output
folder right here she was in the mouth
this makes five captions but start just
go here and to make sure that made five
CAPTCHAs yep there are all five CAPTCHAs
each name is the md5 hash of the string
inside of the image so the name of the
file is the md5 hash of c3d to to our
alright so that's pretty much it for
this tutorial and that's how you make a
captcha generator so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
