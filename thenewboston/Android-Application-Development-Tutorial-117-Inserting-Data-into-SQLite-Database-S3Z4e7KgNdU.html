117 Android tutorial for the new Boston
and what we're going to learn today is
how to actually write the data at set
data base and for a brief moment I want
you guys to reminisce about when we
worked with bundles again we like put
some stuffs in into the bundle and then
we finally send it off to the next next
activity for it to be open but you know
we kind of put some stuff in there and
then we finalized it and that's kind of
the same way that the database works
SQLite database works
we basically need to set up instead of a
bundle something called the content
values and then we put some stuff in
there and then we just kind of finalize
it or insert it into our actual database
so that's what we're going to do in this
tutorial and we're just going to set up
this create entry method so the first
thing that we need to do is we need to
set up a content values so we're going
to say content values and this is kind
of like a bundle like I was just talking
about and we got to import that we're
just going to call this CB for content
values and then we're going to set this
equal to new content values
so just get everything kind of
initialize there and now what we need to
do is we need to put some information in
so as you can see we're getting passed
in two strings from our previous class
again the first was the hot air the name
and the second was hotness so what we
need to do is we need to say our CV and
we're going to put some stuff in there
we're going to say put and then as you
can see it takes two parameters first
the key and then the value just kind of
like our bundle again so first for a key
we want to reference basically where we
want to save it in our database so for
the first one we want to refer to our
key name again that's the name column of
our database and for the value we want
to have it the value of what's being
passed in our string here so we're going
to say name because again the key name
is the text type as you can see here and
we're getting passed in a string so
we're going to basically put the string
in that column and then we're also going
to say keep CV dot put and we're also
going to refer to our key hotness and
again refer to the string that's being
passed in for hotness there we go we
both we have both of our put methods and
now we just need to insert it into our
database so again this method is being
called after our create method or open
method I'm sorry so basically we have
our helper and then our database is
basically accessed and we're going to be
able to write to it so all we have to
refer to as our database here we're
going to say database we're going to say
our database dot insert as you can see
it takes three values for its parameters
the first is what table we want to write
to again we have our table name up here
that we defined earlier so we're going
to refer to that we refer to that so
we're going to say database underscore
table
again our value that we set up earlier
and that's the table we're writing to
and then for the second parameter we're
just going to say null and for the last
parameter we're going to put our content
values so we're just going to say CV
here and that's basically going to
insert all of our puts that we set up
there into our actual table that we want
to refer to so again you just have to
make sure that this table has been set
up that has these columns within it
otherwise it's going to crash but again
right here and our on create method we
have our table name that we set up and
we have both of our key our name and our
our hotness set up and when this method
is called basically we want it to return
this statement here when we actually
write to our value or write to our
database so instead of saying void which
means it's not going to return anything
we're going to change this to long which
is just again a type of variable and
just giving us the error because we
aren't returning anything so we're
actually going to return this statement
here all right that's it for this
tutorial guys we kind of learned about
how to write to a database and I'll
catch you guys in the next tutorial so I
have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
