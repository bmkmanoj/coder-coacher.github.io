New Boston I know I have been out of the
YouTube action for like a month and a
lot of you guys probably thought I've
been kidnapped or something like that
but I haven't I've been actually just
incredibly busy more busy than I've ever
been in my entire life I have been
vacationing and traveling all around the
United States and by that I mean only to
New York but anyways I've been on
vacation and I have also been spending
over the last month working on my
website finally but you guys have been
asking me for like the last two years
Bucky you need to make your website the
New Boston calm so I have listened to
you guys I finally made it the website
is finally complete it has all of my
tutorials in an organized fashion one
has been by far the biggest requests
from you guys to organize all my
tutorial so if you go to my website all
of my tutorials i have ever created are
organized for you guys in a nice neat
fashion and also there's a length of my
forum which by the way my forum now has
over 3,000 members so i'm super excited
about that could not be happier so thank
you for everyone who has signed up for
my forum participated in it and um again
thank you so much uh what else did I
want to talk about I have a little sheet
of the things I want to talk about right
here just check a couple of these things
off website vacation okay my excuses for
not making videos oh say forum and oh
yeah for all of you guys who have been
waiting for my c++ tutorials i started
making them like a month go but then I
start going on ok Shane working on my
website so i took a little break from
those tomorrow i'm going to be posting
five new c++ tutorials so again if you
have been following along you know that
a couple things were weird with my c++
toros first i was using the old compiler
in a lot of you guys said Bucky you need
to update your compiler this is old one
I know it was an old compiler but it had
a emotional attachment to me it's a
compiler I grew up learning on so
um that's why I was using that one but
anyways I have taken your advice in I
downloaded a new compiler so I'm gonna
begin using the new updated compiler for
all you guys and also a lot of you guys
are saying quit using system pause it's
not the best way to use things use C and
get I know also that this is the better
way to use stuff but system pause when
you're first learning c++ and you don't
even know what functions or variables
are system positives pretty much the
only thing that you can understand so
set throwing everything at them that's
why you system pause but now I'm going
to be changing to see and get and if you
guys aren't following my c++ tutorials
and have no idea what I'm talking about
then just forget about everything I just
said so anyways after this video I'm
gonna go buy some beer get drunk and
then make five new C++ Orioles post them
tomorrow so anyways I just wanted to say
that in the last thing I want to say is
the last update i think i told you guys
my starcraft 2 name and if you guys want
to play you can add me but i forgot cell
you guys my character code and whenever
you go to add a friend as contact you
need the character code along with their
username so my username is the new
boston I think that's my name yep my
username is the new boston and my
character code is 150 150 so if you want
to play starcraft 2 with me I don't suck
totally anymore I'm actually halfway
decent now um go ahead and add me as
friend just send me a message anytime
and we'll play a couple games I already
played a couple games with a lot of my
subscribers and uh it's been pretty fun
so anyways that's the main things I want
to tell you guys I know you guys have
been wondering where the heck I was if
I've been kidnapped or shot or anything
or just moved to india but no i'm back
here safe done with vacations done
working on the website so anyways I
built the website thank you guys for
everyone who has joined the forum new
C++ videos coming out tomorrow and also
if you want to add me on starcraft 2 my
character code is 150 in my name is the
new boston don't forget to add me so
anyways that's all i have for you guys
for right now um I probably forgot
something
but you know I'll make another video
later later if I forgot something big so
anyways thank you guys for watching
