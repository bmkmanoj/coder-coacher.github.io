what we did is we created the most
boring interface on earth grey with a
grey bun that says nothing on the button
so let's go ahead and spice this up by
adding some color and actually adding
some text to the button so anytime we
want to work with color we actually need
to import Android that graphics dots
color so now we have the ability to use
color don't don't
alright so the first thing I want to do
is actually just change the color of my
layout or the background so adding
properties is actually really easy
choose whatever you want to add a
property to in well the properties are
different but I know that this one is
set background color now since we
imported from this graphics library what
we can do is call color dots and it
gives you a bunch of default ones but uh
I don't know what's a good one green
probably standouts although I think that
this green is like lime like very bright
green so it'll definitely stand out in
the thumbnail so I guess that's good now
we have a grip or excuse me a green
background in that gray button so
actually want to change this to red
since we didn't name it red button it
would only be fair now before I do that
actually want to set the text so of
course whenever we use the set text
method it's just going to add text at
the bun and what I want to set it to
okay all right I'll just really click me
off all right looks good actually I
don't want that mark it looks a little
too much if you ask me so now of course
we need to set the background color
Vista red so red button set background
color and color
red alright so now our background is
green and our button is now red and it
says click me house on it so let's go
ahead and run that didn't test it out
alright so there we have it looking
pretty good and for some reason this is
reminding me of a ninja turtle right now
Raphael okay so I kind of dig in this
green color with the red anyways the
next thing I want to do is I want to
show you guys how to take this button in
position it in the middle of the screen
right there so right after your layout
and right before your bun give yourself
some space you know hot pocket like two
hours ago and every time I burp it
smells like a hot pocket so you know I'm
sure you guys are interested in that but
essentially what we're gonna do with
this button if I could pull this back up
is we need to give it some rules in the
rules are gonna say okay position
yourself in the center of the screen or
both horizontally and vertically so it's
gonna appear right here so the first
thing we're actually going to do is
we're gonna make a container to put it
in and then we're gonna pretty much take
that container in position in the middle
you guys are gonna see in just a second
so if you actually called this relative
layout dot layout params these layout
parameters are just rules for something
you want your layout to do so since
these are gonna be applied to the button
I'm just going to name these like button
details and set this equal to relative
layout layout params now inside here
what you need to pass in is the height
and the width for this container so what
we can actually do is take relative
layout layout params and we're gonna
call a property called wrap content now
what this does is it automatically gets
um the height in the width of your
content
so who just finished this real quick and
then it'll be easier to see what's going
on so again since we need to pass it in
the height in the width and actually
this is giving me an error because of
course since we're setting this equal to
it an object we have to call new all
right so we're passing in the height in
the width so what we're gonna say is
just get whatever content is your new
container it's only gonna be this button
we're gonna be sticking in there and
then get the height in the width
automatically so we don't need to pass
in like a fixed value or anything it's
really easy that way so now what we want
to do is we want to say okay take this
and position it in the center of your
screen so now that you got everything
set up you can position it wherever you
want it and in order to do that just
take that object button details and the
rule for it again this is pretty much a
rule of how you're gonna position it is
relative layout Center horizontal and
we're gonna add other one to Center
vertically and then Center vertical and
then of course that's going to take it
and put it in the dead center now in
order to actually apply these rules to
your bun what you need to do is whenever
you add your view right now this is just
adding the button wherever it you know
goes by default however if we want to
give it an explicit position we just
pass in button details and it says ok
this adds the button to the layout and
this right here is saying how you want
to add it so pretty sweet let's run this
and make sure we didn't mess anything up
all right looking good so in this video
now you guys know how to add color how
to set some properties for your widgets
and also how to position them at least
vertically and horizontally on the
screen so in the upcoming tutorials I'm
going to show you guys how to have a lot
more control and how to create some more
awesome layouts it's gonna be awesome
again if you want the source
for any of this it's gonna be on my
forum so yeah I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
