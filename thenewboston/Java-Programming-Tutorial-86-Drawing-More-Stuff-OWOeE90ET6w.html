86th Jeff tutorial and in this store I'm
going to teaching guys how to draw some
more shapes including like ovals and 3d
rectangles but you know when I say 3d
wait till you see this you are not going
to be impressed at all it's pretty
pathetic but you know it they had a
thing called 3d rectangles so I had to
figure out how to draw it so let's go
ahead in you know let's go ahead and get
started
public and make sure you extend jpanel
not jframe I think we might have done
that last time but go ahead and get your
public void paint component again just
like that and for a parameter graphics G
and now with our paint component we can
actually paint things on the screen so
let's go ahead and well I guess we first
need to call the super dot paint
component just like that in G parameter
already filled in for us to call the
super classes paint component method and
next let's go ahead and set background
color might as well make it white I'm
going to make mine while you can make
yours whatever you want set back around
and put color dot watch watch just like
dodge toggle on corner and now let's go
ahead and the first thing I guess I can
teach you guys how to do is draw a basic
align on the screen so G dot set color
just like that and we'll set it to
something like blue color dot I mean
it's one of my favorite color so
moonlight in case you were wondering and
now let's go ahead and put G dot draw
line and see what we got for parameters
look at X Y and x/y now you know that in
order to draw a line you need two points
on the screen this first line this x and
y is going to be a coordinates for the
first point this x and y is going to be
coordinates for your second point in
java will automatically draw a line from
point A to point B so let's go ahead and
put 1025 for the first point which
should be somewhere 10 over 25 down
and for our second point is put like two
hundred and forty five so it's going to
be a downhill align look something like
this and now we got a line on screen so
what else can we draw um G dot set color
we'll set this one to color dot red
because you know got to mix it up a
little bit and now let's go ahead and
put draw or excuse me G dot draw correct
and what this means is unlike last time
when we drew a solid rectangle using
fill rect this draws a an empty
rectangle and it takes the same
parameters as before let's go ahead and
put ten over fifty five down it will be
one hundred wide and it will be 30
pixels tall and now let's go ahead and
I'm going to teach you guys how to make
ovals now now in well let's go ahead and
do this first set color what color you
want to make it guys
great you said all right color dot green
so we're going to have a green oval g
dot we'll make this one solid fill oval
and anytime you have fill and draw
they're pretty much interchangeable
depending on personal preference
now this fill oval parameters it takes
the exact same parameters as the
rectangle but what it's going to
automatically do is round your corners
for you so if we want to make an oval
that's the same size as this let's go
ahead and move it down a little bit so
we'll do ten let's see fifty eighty five
so we'll put it in ninety five that
should give us ten pixels padding and
we'll make it a hundred wide by 30 tall
now this is going to be the same size is
this rectangle right here but instead of
a rectangle it's going to be rounded off
at the corners aka and oval so now we
got a line a rectangle in and over in an
oval not over E I apologize so the last
thing I'm going to teach you guys is
something called a 3d rectangle and what
this does is is pretty much a rectangle
that's filled in
but it has a little on bevel on one of
the sides to give it a slight appearance
that it's like pushed out a little bit
so puts G dot set color and what do you
want to change the co2 let's pick good
one color dot let's see that was kind of
good on orange BAM that's what I'm
looking for orange and now let's go
ahead and put G dot fill vamp 3d
rectangle just like this now our
parameters this is a little too easy
let's put it 10 over 160 down
that's positioning the width can be 100
just like everything else the height
make this one a little bigger 50
now what this raised means since this is
3d rectangle it has the option of being
raised pretty much means do you want to
give it 3d look or not and of course we
do true because 3d is awesome you can
also put false to give it not 3d look
but we want this baby looking 3d and you
guys are about to be disappointed
because this doesn't give you nearly as
much 3d Z like but if you go ahead and
run this program I already fell - I'm on
parameters if you guys need to do this
just go ahead and pause but I did this
about 80 times before so you guys should
not do that go ahead and as you can see
we drew line from point A to point B we
also figured out how to draw a rectangle
let me go ahead and get my good code up
here our rectangle using draw rectangle
instead of fill rectangle again fill
rectangle would fill this all in with a
red we also filled an oval in using
green using the same parameters as our
rectangle and last but not least let's
scroll down here we also made this 3d um
rectangle using fill 3 direct now again
I don't even know if you guys can tell
on this tutorial because you to probably
take some quality away but there's a
little line right here along the edge
and it's a little darker than normal and
this is a little
than normal on this edge and what this
does is give you guys the 3d effect now
again it's not like 3d like you're
making a 3d button in 3ds Max or
something it's just a little subtle
button like you'd see on a like a very
old webpage but you know it's a it's
subtle but it's there so that's how you
make 3d and I'm moving my fingers like
went quoting right now but that's how
you do 3d rectangles and that's what it
means basically so we've learned how to
draw a bunch of new stuff on the screen
lines rectangles overs and 3d rectangles
it was awesome and so you know it's been
fun but that's all the time I have for
this tutorial so don't forget to
subscribe and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
