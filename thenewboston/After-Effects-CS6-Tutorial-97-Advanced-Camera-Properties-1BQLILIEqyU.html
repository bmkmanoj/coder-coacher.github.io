you about the different camera settings
in After Effects see it cs6 like when I
double click on the camera here and it
brings up all these different settings
so I just want to remind you that my
name is buddy Blackford real quick and
before I get into the camera settings of
course I've got another story so I was
at subway today and I just ordering a
sub and there was this lady ax ahead of
me and she seemed to be in kind of a bad
mood and was giving the sub maker some
sass so she ordered a sub and I can't
remember what kind of was there just a
regular sub nothing nothing too fancy
but when she got the bread she made the
she made the sub maker take the middle
of the bread out like scrape out extra
bread and throw it in the garbage and
she said I don't want that crap it's too
fatty so I was like okay so she gets her
starts making her sub and then gets down
to the end and of course she puts a
whole bunch of ranch on it and then it
proceeds to get to the cash register and
order a bag of chips and a diet soda now
i'm pretty sure chips are very fatty way
more than bread and diet soda is even
worse for you than regular soda so I I
don't know where this lady is coming
from but I really wanted to tell her to
shut the hell up but I didn't because
that just causes a confrontation that
nobody needs but I just felt like
sharing that story because it kind of
annoyed me let's get back to the camera
settings and let's go over these uh
other ones that I haven't gone over with
you yet so we've got the zoom here and
we've got angle of view
and film sighs now there's also the
focal length area that I went over
already so there and i want to show you
that there is this button right here
called lock to zoom now i'll show you
what's going on here these these
properties here are connected to each
other especially when you have the lock
to zoom feature added now I've got the
preview button check down here so when I
move some of these properties they're
going to show up in the in our comm
panel here so first I'm going to move
the angle of view I'm going to decrease
it and then just watch the pink cone
here so we can you can see what's going
on so I'm going to decrease it first
stupid auto save and a decrease it and
you can see that the angle is actually
changing but the the farthest the
furnace or what you should call it is
increasing the focal length I mean is
the focal length is increasing it's
coming way out here instead of back
where it was this is going to give you a
lesser angle of view obviously now I'm
going to increase the angle view and now
you get a wider shot and the focal
length is also lessened eight
now we can come over down here to film
sighs and I'll show you what that does
the changes the focal length and error
changes the angle of view and the zoom
so instead of changing the focal length
when you change the film size it changes
the zoom and there you get an idea of
what the film size does I'm going to hit
cancel real quick so we can get back to
our original settings because you can't
hit ctrl Z when you're doing that so
double click on your camera to bring up
the camera settings again and i'm just
going to switch from a 50-millimeter to
a 15 millimeter and then you can see how
the camera and all these settings change
let's head to one hundred and
thirty-five millimeter and now you can
see how all the settings are different
and just remember the angle of view and
the zoom and everything like that when
when we go through that and the zoom is
here you can edit remember you can edit
the zoom in your camera properties if
you right-click on the RFU twirl down in
the camera in your layers panel so let's
go back to the 50 millimeter here now if
you enable the depth of field here and
click on this check box you get the new
focus distance aperture f-stop and blur
level now this stuff is good for
creating blurriness it relating to how
you can actually see so usually if
something's really close in your face
you it's blurrier than whatever is
farther away especially when the point
of interest is look like farther away so
if you're focusing on something that's
farther away it's going to be less
blurry than what you're focusing on and
1 i'll just show you that i'll increase
the focus distance here and it is locked
to the zoom which i did not want to do
head back to what i was at I'm going to
uncheck this lock to zoom that way it
doesn't mess with the zoom right now so
I'm going to increase the focus distance
and now you can see up here that does
the zoom and the focal length here is
right here and then at the end the thing
that's extruding is the focus distance
so this is now where you're focusing and
now i have the focus right on the green
the green guy now if i increase man what
did i do if i bring it back out real
quick i must hit the buttons on my mouse
if i increase the aperture here you can
see that everything that's not being
focused on it's starting to get blurry
we've got guy in the front and the guy
in the back now when i move my aperture
my f-stop also follow suit the f-stop
will go up and the aperture will go down
now you can increase or decrease this
blur level here to increase the
intensity of when you move your aperture
or eps top so i'll just increase this up
to like 234 is what i put it at and if I
just increase this a little bit instead
of a lot it's going to blur even faster
now the unit's here you can change your
different you can change the way that
these units are labeled I guess I don't
really see why you would really want to
do it unless someone brought to you a
bunch of camera settings and had them in
a different set of units everything is
usually measured in millimeters because
that's what film size is usually
measured in and the horizontally
vertically and diagonally I just keep it
on horizontally every time so I'll just
cancel and I'll show you one more thing
real quick if you twirl down in your
down here in your camera options you
also have these settings you've got the
depth of field you got the zoom you've
got the focus ditions aperture and you
can use those to do different kind of
camera moves like rack focuses and
things like that so that's a that's an
overview of your camera settings and now
hopefully you understand how to use your
settings a little better to figure out
what you need in your camera so thanks
for watching this one and I hope you
guys have a great day and make some
awesome stuff see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
