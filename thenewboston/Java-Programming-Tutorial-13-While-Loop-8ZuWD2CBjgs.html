tutorial and in this story I'm going to
show you guys how to do something called
a while loop
now what while loop does is it allows
you to execute a certain block of code
multiple times but only write it one
time so pretty much it saves you a bunch
of time writing a code and let me show
you what the syntax is for this the
first thing that we need is a variable
and I'm going to name my encounter and
I'm going to set it equal to let's go
ahead and set it equal to zero to begin
with now the syntax for a while loop is
just the word awhile and this means
begin your wild loop and what your while
loop is going to do is whatever is in
the body of your while loop or curly
braces it's going to execute this code
and let's go ahead and say
system.out.print line and let's go ahead
and just print the variable counter
nothing special here so what this is
going to do is it's going to execute
this line of code multiple times
so you're saying alright how many times
is it going to execute well that is up
to whatever you put in the condition
so let's write while counter is less
than 10 we want you to output counter so
right now here's what would happen it
says all right what's counter zero print
counter what's counter zero print
counter so this loop will kind of go
forever so we need a way to end the loop
somehow so we need a way to change
counter so let's go ahead and use the
incrementing operator that we learned
less time and just put counter plus plus
and let me run this real quick and show
you guys what it does run okay and in
our little run box we get 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 just what we wanted now let me
show you guys one more time what this
does we had a counter variable to begin
and it started it is 0 the first time we
told Wow is all right while this counter
is less than 10 we want you just to
write whatever number it is on the
screen
so the first time it looped it was zero
so outputted 0 and then it added one to
it so then it was one so now it looked
at it again is counter less than ten yup
let me put that on screen now it's two
is counter less than ten yup and it did
that again and again until it got to ten
and when it got to ten is 10 less than
ten nope
so I'm just going to not do anything so
that's how you use loops to execute a
block of code many times without having
to write it over and over again if we
didn't have this we would have to write
um print our prints they met 10 times
and as you can see this saves you a
bunch of time so again the syntax for a
while loop is wild and then put your
test condition in um what are these
called parentheses and then put whatever
you want to execute in curly braces
right here and whatever you execute is
going to do that however many times you
say so that's your quick tutorial on
loops on the sawaal loop there are
different kinds of loops where I'm going
to be probably going over in the next
tutorial but this is your basic while
loop so thank you guys for watching I
hope you test this out a little bit and
play around with it and you'll be expert
in no time so again thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe to my
channel and I will see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
