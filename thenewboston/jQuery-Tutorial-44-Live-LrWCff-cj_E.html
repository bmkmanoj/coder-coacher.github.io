gonna select this duplicate class
I'm gonna go append on the live event
handler now inside here I want only
specific events to you know be taken
into account so I'm gonna set the click
event and I'm gonna say this
in fact sorry we need curly brackets in
here and we'll just go ahead and bring
this down and I'm gonna say on click
event I want to run a particular
function so on the click event I'm gonna
say alert you have clicked so now what
we're doing is we're running click
inside live as almost as a is an event
within this function if you like but
we're running it sort of as an option so
we're saying live click and we can we
can add more down here so you could come
and separate these and go ahead and say
dbl click for example and you could
append moron again that's written in the
jQuery documentation so when we click
now this is going to have exactly the
same effect when we click this button we
get this alert box appear the only
difference now is when we use the same
as we did before with this dot after and
we read sort of we add more you know
code in so I'm going to say input type
equals button the value equals click and
we'll go ahead and add the class in as
well which is duplicate now what's going
to happen is because we've appended the
live event handler on as opposed to just
click this will be able to pick up new
elements that have been added sort of
inside of this event handler so now when
we refresh when we click we have the
same message up and we click OK we have
the same thing happen as we did before
but this time because we're using live
when we click this we get the same
message and we can just continue
literally generating buttons so
obviously in this sense with generating
button after button it
it's not doesn't really make sense but
you could apply this to things like a
good example would be to apply this to
input type input types with file now you
might want to say in fact let's go ahead
and we'll write it out
we'll say input class equals file type
equals file and we won't use a value
okay so now let's just go ahead and get
rid of this code here and let's go ahead
and refresh
we've got choose file and I can go ahead
and select a file here any file that I
want now what I want to happen is is I
want a new one of these or a new input
type of file to be generated once I've
selected a file from this one so we'll
go ahead and we'll reference dot file
because we've given it a class of file
and then we'll say dot live and in here
I want to go ahead and just specify
change and when we when this changes ie
when a file is selected I want to go
ahead and say this dot after I want to
create a new file a new file input so
type file and class equals file
okay so this isn't like completely full
foolproof I guess because if you think
about it you know we're gonna go ahead
and choose a file now Tartan dr. APJ
that's changed once we select this in
and another file box has been generated
I can then go ahead and choose another
file and the new ones generated so we're
applying like the same action to each
class and we can only really do that
using light oops sorry we can only
really do that using life as we saw the
button example but if I was to go ahead
and change this file here to something
we get another one as well so I mean
this is a quick example of how we could
use it with generating these also you
are going to have the problem with names
as well you need to give it a unique
name here but obviously because this is
just an example I'm not going to go
through and explain all of that but
that's something to think about with the
live event handler and how we can
specify events within it but apply it to
the same class as we initially selected</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
