Photoshop cs6 tutorial and this is buddy
Blackford here I'm gonna teach you about
learning how to merge adjustment layers
and you can have several adjustment
layers on top of your photo or your
design or whatever you want and it's not
uncommon to do that because adjustment
layers can only hold one set of data
they don't have any like pixels in them
or anything like that it's just
mathematical data when you try to like
merge adjustment layers just like if you
just pick a few adjustment layers and
then you try to merge them it doesn't
work you don't have they don't go
together they just create a transparent
layer so we have to figure out a way to
get around that if you ever wanted to
like free ups from some of the layers or
like minimize the amount of layers they
have or something like that so I'm gonna
teach you a method here on how to do
that so what we need to do first
just open up any picture that you can
find so it doesn't matter what it looks
like it's preferably better to have a
picture that looks nice or something
like that but up to you and what supply
some adjustment layers to it now you can
pick your adjustment layers from up here
where it says add just add an adjustment
right above the layers panel or down
here I like to get pick mine from down
here in this little menu here that way
there I mean all the names are there so
it's up to you do you do you like
pictures or do you like text so either
way up to you so I wanted to add like
kind of like a vintage II kind of look
to this image you can see that as just
like taken regularly it's kind of like
the colors are kind of bland and
everything like that so we're gonna
spice it up a little bit so I went over
to brightness and contrast and let me
click the double click on it and it
brings up the properties here and I
added contrast 252 I'm just going to
turn that on
and you can see that it added some
contrast to the color so before so
here's the after picture and here's the
before a little more pop to the picture
there and then I added a photo filter
here and I added the warming filter and
then this orange color and the density
at 48% and I'm going to turn that on and
I'll go over what these filters and
adjustments all do but for now what we
really want to do is just add like we're
just gonna add some stuff so that we can
merge the layers and the last thing I
added was this color balance adjustment
layer and click on it and I changed the
tone to the mid-tones here actually I
think I turned it to shadows yeah I put
it on shadows and I changed the bottom
one here to go more towards blue at plus
24 and I'll turn that on and then you
can see how that effect did this so it
kind of looks like it kind of looks like
an Instagram photo now
like one of those Instagram filters so
let's go ahead and I'm gonna select
these layers here right click on them
and then you can see merge layers I'm
gonna merge these layers real quick and
you can see what it did was just create
a blank layer that has nothing so I'm
turning it on and off right now and it
does nothing so let me go back to before
I emerged hour before the layers got all
merged here so I just went up to my
history and went up to my or my delete
layer so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna merge all these onto the photo
actually so I'm gonna duplicate my
background layer I'm gonna drag it down
here
and duplicate it and I turn off the
bottom one just that's just something I
do so it doesn't like show up later on
and you're like hey what's going on I
don't know what's going on so select all
these layers together and we're going to
merge them with the background copy
layer here let's merge and now of our
adjustment layer
have been added onto here but the only
thing you can do now is you can't you
can't go back and like adjust and adjust
the pictures or a picture or anything
like that you can adjust the adjustment
and layers is what I was trying to say
so remember that when you're trying to
do this and it also names the layer to
the top layer that was on there so just
be sure you remember to change the name
of the layer but that's how you merge
adjustment layers and that could could
have been something that may have been
tripping tricking some people or
tripping you up or anything like that
so that's just a quick tip that I wanted
to show you and I just want to thank you
for watching and give us a thumbs up and
check us out on Bucky Rue Morgue and
that's about it I guess I always have a
hard time ending these things I never
know what to say but whatever so see you
guys later in the next tutorial have a
good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
