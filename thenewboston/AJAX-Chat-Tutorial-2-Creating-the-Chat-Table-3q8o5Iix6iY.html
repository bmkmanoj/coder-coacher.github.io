and in this tutorial we're going to be
creating that table that's going to
store all of the messages so we can do
this in a couple of different ways the
first thing that we can do is we can
just make it all through PHP myadmin
you know go ahead and press all the
buttons and select the columns that we
want or a better option is actually just
creating an SQL file and importing it
because that way if you ever want to
give someone the source code all you
have to do is hand them off the SQL file
they can go ahead and import it boom
roasted and it's also good because you
know you learn a little more about how
to create tables through kind of in SQL
language so go ahead and create a new
file and press save as and I'm just
going to save this as chat dot SQL now
it needs to be a SQL so you can import
it properly and the first thing you want
to do is put create table and the table
name for this one will just be chat now
it whenever you create an SQL file you
pretty much have to say what you're
creating and we already said we're
creating the table and then you have to
identify each column that you're going
to have so our table is going to have
let's see five columns I think the first
one is message ID and this is just the
primary key so we can identify and
organize all of our messages easily so
this is of course going to be an integer
it's pretty much the ID number of each
message and not null obviously you can
have a blank you know message and auto
increment because of course it's going
to go one two three you know you don't
want two messages with the same ID
number so that's why we have not now
Auto increment so that's kind of the
most important column now we can go
ahead and do some other ones posted on
and this is just going to be pretty much
the date whenever the the date and the
time when the message was posted so then
if you opt to display the time
like you know most chat rooms and
private messengers do so this is where
we're going to store that and of course
this is also going to be not null and
the next thing we want to store is the
username and this is pretty obvious what
this is so I'll just make this a
varchar' of a 255 I don't think anyone's
username is going to be bigger than that
not null as well now the next thing is
the message now this is the body this is
the text that the user is going to be
typing so for the message the data type
that we want to store this is in is just
text not no because you can't send a
blank message what's the point now after
this I'm going to have a column for
color now this is the column where the
user chooses their color so whenever we
store the color in the database we don't
want to store the name of the color we
want to store the hexadecimal value now
of course a hexadecimal value is 6
numbers or letters but you also have
that pound sign so it's like CC 0 0 0 0
that would be red so of course 6 plus
the pound sign that's 7 characters so
char 7 and we can also give a default
value of black and those are zeros not
capital o's and now the last thing we
want to do is we want to set the primary
key now a primary key is pretty much
saying what's the unique ID number for
this table and you choose one of your
columns and for mine it's just going to
be message ID it's the only one that
really makes sense now remember actually
I got in the mood of programming you
actually need arm not curly brackets
whatever these things are called print I
don't even know what the frick they're
called these things and end it with a
semicolon because every statement and
this is a SQL statement it needs to end
with a semicolon so now go ahead and
save this and as you can see it's saved
in well I'll show you guys users Buckey
desktop chat tutorials chat SQL and now
in the next video I'm going to show you
guys had
import this into your table or excuse me
your database so thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
