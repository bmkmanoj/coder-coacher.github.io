c-sharp tutorial that I'm making you for
the new Boston and in this tutorial
we're going to continue with be in our
hangman project and basically what we're
going to be doing is just finishing up
drawing our labels in this groov box
right here so the first thing that we're
going to want to do is set the location
for our label so I'm going to say labels
to access our label list and then the
index is going to be I so that we access
the label that we just created and then
we're going to want to say the location
of that is equal to a new point since
the location all we got to be equal to
the point and then we're going to send
an x-axis it's going to be I times
between which we calculate self which we
calculate up here and then we're going
to want to add 10 to that and then we're
going to want to say on the y-axis it's
going to be 18 and we're always going to
want it to be 80 so that they're on the
same line alright so let me just explain
this here so let's say that between is
equal to 40 so I'm going to write this
over here between equals 40 so we would
do 0 times 40 cents on the first loop I
is obviously going to be 0 so 0 times 40
and then we're just going to want to add
10 to that so it'd be 0 Plus 10 is 10
and then on the Y it's going to be 80 so
the first point is going to be about
there and I add loops and I add 10 to it
so that it's a little bit off this form
right here so it's actually on the groov
box because if I didn't do that it would
just be right against here up on the
plot form alright and then the second
time through it's going to be 1 times
between which is 40 so 1 times 40 which
is 40 and then we're just going to add
10 to that so we get 50 and then the Y
remains the same so it's always 80 so
just go right there and then the next
time through we would do 2 times 40
since I would be to this time and then
we'd add 10 to that so we get um
90 as 80 plus 10 is 90 and then on the
why it's so obvious but over here so
basically in between each label it's
always going to be on this between
whatever
so if between is 40 it's going to be 40
in between
label so this way the labels look even
is spaced all right so now that we have
the location all set up let's set the
text of these labels so we're going to
want to make the text of these labels
always be an underscore to start out
with and then let me use your guesses a
letter will change that later on but
right now let's make it to be an
underscore so labels I to access the
label that we just created I'm going to
say the texture that is equal to Justin
on your store alright so now that we've
set the text of the control we're just
going to want to set the parent of the
control to this group box so this going
to say labels I for the label that we
just created and then we're just gonna
set the parent control equal to group
box two which is this group box right
here and then we're just going to want
to bring this control to the front so
we're just going to say labels I bring
to front and bring to front basically
just brings the label on top of every
other control so if it's behind other
controls they'll just be brought up to
the top on top of this roof box and then
we just I want to create the control so
I mean say labels I create control and
this'll is basically create the control
and show it on a form alright so let's
just do bug here to make sure this works
yep and I guess this word has four
letters in it and now you can see there
is a label for each letter let's just
change its text to this label to say the
words length is four so we're going to
say bottom our label that is so it's
just selected label 1 so we're just
going to say label one's text equals
word length plus the length of the word
so I just want to say characters length
minus one because remember we don't want
to count that on slash end here and
we're going to convert this into a
string so that to string all right so
now let me debug you should have a
different number of label because it
generated a different random word and
yet there you go so one two three four
five six
perfect alright so that's pretty much it
for this tutorial so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
