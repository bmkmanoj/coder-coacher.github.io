tutorial that I'm making for looming
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to use the partial
keyword so all you're going to need for
this tutorial is a button and a class
and inside of our class right here we
have two fields we have a string name
which equals mr. Smith and we have an
integer age equals 38 say we wanted to
finish defining this class in another
file well in order to do that we have to
make this class partial to make your
class partial you just going to type the
partial keyword before your the keyword
class so now if we're to create another
partial class with the same name it
would combine the two classes together
to make one class and you would be able
to use on the things inside of both of
the classes so if we go over here and
create a new class file and we have a
partial class with the same name as the
other one and it has two more fields
inside of this one it will combine these
two classes together and inside of my
class we now have a string hair color
and we have a Google Glasses we also
have on a string name and we have an
integer age so if we go over here and
create a new instance of our class we
should have aged glasses hair color a
name so as you can see it just combined
the two classes together you can also
use the partial keyword on methods
so we're degree a partial method here
and I will just display a message to the
user then when we create a partial
method we cannot provide implementation
for it meaning we cannot put curly
braces down we have to do that in
another partial class so if we go over
to this other partial class here and we
another martial method called string or
we have this partial method with the
same signature meaning it has the same
name and the same parameters then we can
um just actually provide implementation
for this class so we can have a display
a message box to the user and I found
this really cool way to type out message
box instead of saying or instead of like
typing out like system that windows that
forms message box you can just type out
M box and then put tab twice and we'll
type that out all out for you all right
so now we want it to display a message
box with the same string that the user
provides so it was not a messaging
however you cannot put access modifiers
on partial methods so we can only use
this method inside of this class but we
could create another public method that
will display this message to you so you
can have it call as loiter here and then
display the message she uses so we'll
say message we'll call this void and
then have it display the message that
user provides so in order to have a
partial method that does have
implementation must first create a
partial method that does not and both of
these methods must have the same
signature meaning they must have the
same arm name and the same parameters
and as you can see they do also remember
you cannot have any access modifiers on
a partial method meaning you cannot put
like public here or protect it or
something like that we'll get an area so
they will always remain private so as
you can see here we created this public
method that will call this private line
so let's test it out see if it'll work
so let's just create a new your instance
well the MC show message so now I'll
have it split my name I guess and yet it
should be good so go here click this
button and it should just get a message
boxes of that yeah so that's pretty much
it for this tutorial
partial key word so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
