this video I want to show you how to set
up and configure a firewall for your
server now I know what people heard the
term firewall before but they aren't
really sure what it is
they just know yeah okay I probably need
a firewall on my computer because it
protects me from something somehow
whatever well I'll explain a real quick
what it is a firewall gives you control
over the connections to your server so
what you can do is you can say okay I
have this server right here and I'm
making a chat room for me and my grandma
so what you can do is you can get your
IP address and your grandma's IP address
and set up your firewall to only allow
connections from those two IP addresses
anytime anyone else any other traffic
tries to connect to it is going to be
blocked so pretty much like I said gives
you complete control over who and how
people connect to your server now since
we're going to be using this server for
a website we really don't know every
single person's IP address that's going
to try to connect with so instead of
filtering it by IP addresses we're going
to be filtering it by ports or services
so we already know one we're going to
have four SSH and that seven 777 so
let's do that right now so sudo since we
need to run a root command and Ubuntu
comes with the tool called ufw and this
is a tool to manage firewall settings so
if you're at ufw allow what we can do is
we can allow a certain port so seven
seven seven seven and remember this is
just the default SSH port so we can
actually log in to our own server and
after this you right slash TCP now I
actually don't even remember if I talked
to you guys about TCP but this is a
broad protocol that you use when
connecting to things over the Internet
so port number slash TCP that's one that
we want allow and type in your password
and all right what's another one we want
to allow well sudo actually here's
another cool trick if you press up
in the terminal it's going to get the
last command you type so we want to
allow these ports so it might be a
little bit faster so regular HTTP is
just 480 so if you have any website you
always want to allow port 80 and another
one is if you buy a certificate and you
get HTTP then that's port 443 so
whenever you're just browsing the
Internet through a secure connection
through a browser 443 and there you go
now we might allow some other ons later
on but for right now these are the ones
that I know that we're going to need so
again we can edit it later but for right
now these are fine if we ever want to
review the changes then just do sudo ufw
show added it's going to say ok right
now you have 777 80 and 443 set up this
first ones for us and the next two are
for the visitors to our website
hopefully we get a lot because we have a
really popular website but who knows now
now that we have the settings set up we
just need to enable the firewall one
more command sudo ufw enable and hit
enter command may disrupt connections
are we ok with that
heck yeah we are why firewall is active
and enabled on system startup so as soon
as we start the server we now got a
firewall nice and safe now since I have
a little bit of time and this tutorial
is pretty sure I'll show you guys one
other thing and that is you may want to
change your servers time and to do this
you sudo dpkg and reconfigure and it's
t'see which stands for timezone data in
there is a freaking dog barking alright
alright I don't know if you guys hear
that but I'm gonna go dropkick that dog
two seconds not really okay not really
but you know I picture it in my head
alright so America looks good
New York looks good of course you can
change what other ones you want but I'm
in New York so there you go
so let's check it out local time now is
Saturday June 6 2013 19 and yes it is
8:30 so there you go and yeah we set up
a firewall and also we set up the
correct time zone for our server and in
the next video we're going to start
installing lamp Apache MySQL PHP so it's
going to be pretty cool I'll see you
then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
