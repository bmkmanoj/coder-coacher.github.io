dividing monomials now if you remember
from all our factoring work a monomial
is just a single term so when we divide
my nine monomials we're gonna have two
single terms over one another so we're
gonna divide the like factors just like
when we add and subtract like factors
you can only divide like factors so we
need to divide this we're gonna divide
18 by negative 3 X to the 6 by X cubed
and Y by Y to the 5th so 18 divided by
negative 3 is going to be negative 6
when we divide monomials we're gonna
subtract the exponents so when we have X
to the 6 divided by X to the 3rd we're
gonna subtract the exponents so 6 minus
3 and we're going to get X to the 3rd so
negative 6 X to the third and we're
gonna do the same thing Y to the first
divided by Y to the fifth it's gonna be
Y it's gonna be 1 minus 5 so negative 4
in order to show that that 4 is negative
it's gonna stay on the bottom so it's
going to be negative 6 X cubed over Y to
the fourth so let's do some examples
this is supposed to be to the 6 so when
we have the variables with different
exponents we're going to subtract the
exponents and we're going to get m to
the first on top so again we're going to
divide only the like terms so 46 divided
by 4 sorry I meant 56 divided by 4 is 14
s squared minus s is gonna be 2 minus 1
which is 1
so since it's positive the s goes on top
t cubed minus T it's gonna be three
minus one gives us two so that stays on
top as well we have a couple more
examples so we always divide only like
numbers so 22 divided by negative 44 is
gonna be negative 1/2 2 X 2 this x
squared divided by X to the fourth is
gonna be 2 minus 4 it's gonna give us a
negative 2 so if you remember that means
that the x squared stays on the bottom 3
minus 4 is gonna give us a negative 1 so
that Y's gonna stay on the bottom as
well and 4 minus 2 is going to be
positive 2 so that Z squared is gonna
stay on top so we have one last problem
that we're gonna do 8 divided by 16 is
1/2 X to the first minus X to the third
gives us x squared on the bottom 2 minus
1 is gonna give us 1 on top so we're
gonna have Y over 2 x squared so like I
said that's all we're gonna do with dive
with dividing my monomials today make
sure to come back and check out our next
lesson where we divide a polynomial by a
monomial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
