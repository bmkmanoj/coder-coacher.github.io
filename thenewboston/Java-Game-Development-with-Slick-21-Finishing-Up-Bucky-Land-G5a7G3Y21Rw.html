tutorial in in this lesson we're going
to be finishing up the last main part of
the game and that is that menu that pops
up whenever the user hits escape so
remember whenever we're playing the game
we can move up down left right do all
that good stuff and they hit escape hmm
no menu is popping up so that's not good
so let's go ahead and change that right
now well in order to get the menu to pop
up what it does is it says okay if quit
is equal to true then pop up the menu on
the screen now by default of course
whenever the game first starts out quit
is equal to false because you know as
soon as you start playing the game you
don't want to quit it or else you
shouldn't I mean the game is in that
batter right so let's go ahead and add
some functionality to pretty much listen
for whenever they hit the escape button
on their keyboard and when ever they do
that we want to set the quit variable
equal to true so make sure that you are
right under this little write if
statement but still inside your update
method now escape if and I might as well
just copy this because I'm lazy Frick it
might as well just copy this whole
entire thing
laziness prevails once again alright so
obviously this is the right arrow and we
want to listen for escape so it's escape
so what do we want to do whenever they
hit escape well that means that they're
thinking about quitting the game so set
quit equal to true now remember whenever
quit is equal to true then the menu gets
rendered on the screen or drawn on the
screen so if we were to play this game
right now play this game oh I'm having
fun I'm having so much fun oh wait a
minute my mom made hot pockets for
dinner so I'm going to hit escape the
menu pops up on the screen do you want
to resume the game do you want to go
back to the main menu or do you want to
quit the game if you're on a resume
press are my pressing are right now
nothing's happening main menu press em
or quit press Q nothing's happening so
you know we got the menu to pop up on
the screen which is half the battle but
now we have to add functionality to
listen when the menu is on the screen
listen for these keys are M and Q and if
the user hits one of these keys then do
something
further so let's go in order where do
our first then ah M which takes to the
main menu then Q which quits the game
all right
so whenever you hit the escape button
then it turns quit equal to true and the
menu pops up on the screen now when the
menu is up this is the code you want to
run so you first need to test for if
quit is equal to true which is basically
saying is the menu on the screen that's
the only time quit is going to be equal
to true when the menu is on the screen
now when the menu is on the screen you
pretty much make three very simple if
statements the first if statement
listens for again copying this because
I'm lazy the first if statement listens
for key which was our version the second
if statement listens for C it was
resumed M for main menu and the third
one listens for Q which pretty much
means quit the game so whenever you just
want to resume the game this is really
easy property the easiest one just go
ahead and set quit equal to false like
it was by default so whenever you're
playing the game obviously you're not
quitting the game so change that to
false and obviously this would make the
menu disappear because the menu only
gets drawing on the drawing on the
screen when it quit is true okay so our
is taken care of let's test that out
make sure we don't mess anything up as
we go all right so I hit escape I want
to resume I'm going to press R the menu
disappears and you could walk around
still awesome so excuse me I got kennel
cough from a dog okay so now in order to
go to the main menu that's another easy
one we already know how to do that all
we need to do is since we're in the
place state we need to go to the menu
state so SBG enter state in that ID
number of the main menu is zero so let's
go ahead and test that one out right now
play now walk around hit escape main
menu em awesome we're at the main menu
we can go ahead and you know play now or
exit whatever you want to do at the main
menu now to quit the game again very
easy whenever the user is in the menu
and they hit Q they must want to quit
the game so in order to quit the game
just shut down the entire program system
exit with the status of zero which means
that everything exited properly even
though the user quit the game why they
would ever want to quit I don't know
because you know it's probably the
coolest game ever created but if they
want to quit for some silly reason then
this is the code to do that so now let's
go ahead and might as well test that out
play the game walking around oh my god
what's this a tree ah this is so cool
I'm having so much fun what's this a
building oh my god but you know what mom
made meatloaf again got to go quit and
eat some of that
so hit escape and hit Q on your keyboard
and it quits the game for you so there
you go there you have it that is how you
make a very basic role-playing game
again some cool things that you might
want to do and you know I just want to
teach you guys the basics everything
further than this is pretty redundant
you may want to have you know collision
detection on this building and I don't
know maybe make it um a market where you
can buy things or you know um you know
buy items or fight people but basically
now that you understand how collision
detection works and how all the
listeners work where you can have menus
and all that good stuff basically the
rest is up to your imagination what kind
of game do you want to make it what do
you want the character to be able to do
what kind of objects do you want oh
excuse me what kind of objects do you
want in the game so on and so forth so
there you go I have now armed you guys
with the very basic knowledge in the
upcoming slick tutorials I'm probably
going to be making a more advanced style
of game different than a role-playing
game so that's what you have to look
forward to I'm not sure what I'm going
to get these tutorials pumped out but
for now I'm sure this is plenty enough
to keep you guys busy so
again one last time thank you guys so
much for watching and uh supporting my
videos if you have any questions then
just go ahead and ask me on my forum and
one less time thank you and I'll see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
