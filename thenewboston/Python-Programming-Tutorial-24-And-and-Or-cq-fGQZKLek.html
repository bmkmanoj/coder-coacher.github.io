24th tutorial and Python and today I'm
going to be talking to you guys about
something that's going to help you
compare um it's a little different than
last time unlike opera just pay
attention you'll learn something so the
first time I want to you guys is besides
the numbers you can also compare strings
of words and when you compare these
they're compared in alphabetical order
so let's go ahead and write dog is less
than cat as you can see it comes out
false because the word dog comes after
cat and alphabet and it's not less than
so that is I'm going to come in handy
later on and it's a whole nother world
when you can compare strings of text
instead of just playing on numbers and
the next thing I want to talk to you
guys about is something called an and in
an or now last time I told you guys if
you have an if statement right here and
you want to check that decision make
another decision you can write an if
statement inside it like right here but
there's an easier way to check two if
two conditions are true at once and
that's to use a keyword called and and
what and does is check if both
conditions are met so let me just show
you guys your quick let's get an example
variable and I'll make it equal to the
string actually it might as well just
make it equal to number five now I have
a variable example equal to number five
so if you want to check if example is
let's part if example is less than three
and then we said we want to check that
in the last hour I showed you guys if
you want to check it again just right if
example is greater than ten which I
guess less than three greater ten that
wouldn't make sense so that was how you
would do two decisions on the same
variable but let's go ahead and let me
show you how to make two two or just
make it compact conduct if example is
greater than three so any number greater
than 3 and example is less than 10
then we can print number is between
three and ten so that is how we can use
on two different tests in the same line
of code and this helps nesting if
statements in certain cases so this
example work will only print if this
condition is met and this condition is
met if one of these test fail then this
will never go so let's go ahead and
press ENTER and it says number is
between 3 and 10 so what if we had one
of those test conditions that were false
but one was true so let's go ahead and
write if example is greater than 3 which
is true and example is less than 4 which
is false I'm sure you guys what would
happen print X as you can see nothing
prints and this is because if only one
test condition is true in the end the
piece of code doesn't get printed now
let's say you want in a way to not only
have both contestants test conditions
have to be true for you to print but why
not only one of the test conditions had
to be true in order to output the
statement so let's go ahead and do that
and you do this using instead of a hand
you use the or keyword so let's go ahead
and write if example is greater than 3
or example is less than 4 let's go ahead
and print this works so in the or
keyword unlike the hand only one of
these has to be true for this to print
right here or this code to be executed
so let's go ahead and press ENTER and
says this works now if both of these
were false just like the end nothing
would get printed but what happens if
you use a or and only one of them has to
be true but both of them are true well
let's see if
I think I'm gonna sneeze soon Oh Lord
bless me bless me anyways back to basics
if example is greater than 3 or example
is less than 10 which is true and I use
the semicolon instead of : if so let's
do that one more time and I also teach
these guys never used to my colons when
you should use colons if example is
greater than 3 or example is less than
10 : what are we going to print print
hey now
so in this can it in this excuse me in
case both of these test conditions are
true but we're using the or statement
where only one of them has to be true so
what's it do it prints it out hey now
and again just to recap one last time
and and when you use a hand both the
tests have to be true on either side for
the code X cube when you use a or this
one has to be true this one has to be
true or both of them can be true and
then your code is executed and in both
cases and in if either one of these are
false or an or if either if both of
these are false then it never gets
executed
so that's your basics on I don't know I
guess they're called in or ORS or
something like that and also comparing
strings so in the next story I'm going
to be going over loops but learning this
tutorial learn how to use the end in or
and also how to compare strings maybe
you do these tests with strings or
something and once you got this down the
basics of this you're ready to move on
next tutorial so don't forget to
subscribe to my channel and uh I guess
I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
