slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
continuing our calculator now if you
have if you don't know what you're
looking at right now then you probably
need to move back a couple tutorials to
see what's going on so let's go ahead
and get started now like I was saying
the last tutorial what if the person
adds two numbers and they get the answer
and they just want to keep adding
numbers to it well the way we can do
this is by creating a global bulan so
we'll just go ahead and type private is
adding as bullying and we'll go ahead
and set it equal to false so what this
is going to do is going to check and see
if they're continuing adding to their
answer so what we're going to do is
we're going to add another hand right
here so an is adding equals false then
go ahead and do this stuff so now what
we're going to do is we're going to add
an else if go ahead and take this then
out
okay so we're going to we're going to
add an else--if to see if they're
continually adding so else if is adding
then now by using just is adding so it's
basically saying else if true then so if
is adding is true then do this you don't
have to add an op something to check the
value you don't have to say else if is
adding equals true you can just do else
if is adding so now what we're going to
do is we're going to call add again so
we'll just type or we'll declare another
variable so dim and as double and we'll
set it equal to add and then we will see
type text someone dot text to a double
and then we'll just go ahead and get the
text from the answer field so text
answer dot text and we want to convert
that to a double now what we're going to
do is text answer dot text is going to
be equal to answer dot to string then
we'll go ahead and set this one to dot
to string to okay so now if we go ahead
and run this you're going to see that it
has first number and second number and
answer so if we type in a first number
23 plus 10 and click Add we've got 33
now we can add 3 to this
and you can see that we get the value 13
now the way that we can fix this is by
setting is adding equal to false unequal
to true whenever they do their first
edition so now if we run this again you
can see that we've got first number 23
second number 10 we can add we get 33
and if we add 3 into that we get 36 and
we can just keep on adding stuff to our
final answer and we can clear that out
when we want to okay so this is fairly
simple code it may not be the most
efficient or the best way to do it but
for beginners this is very easy to
understand and you can get good results
from it so now what we're going to do is
do the same thing for subtraction so we
can just come down here and I'll start
it off for you and what I want you guys
to do is go ahead and do it for yourself
without having to watch the tutorial so
we'll go ahead and start off with if
text num1 dot text dot length it's not
equal zero and text num2 dot text dot
length there's not equal zero and now
we're going to do is we're going to come
up here and we'll create another boolean
variable so private is subtracting as
boolean and we'll go ahead and set that
equal to false and then and is
subtracting is equal to false then go
ahead and do something so that should
give you guys a good start and now one
thing that I want to tell you is that it
will always it won't revert back to the
way it's supposed to be
if we click clear on this and now what
we need to do
is go ahead and find our button clear
which should be right down here so
whenever they clear we're just going to
go ahead and call the call the sub
revert boolean so we'll just type revert
bool and I can see that we're going to
get an error because we didn't create
this so we'll just go ahead and create
the revert bool sub so private sub
revert bool we don't need any arguments
and so it will set is adding equal to
false is subtracting equals false so
what this is going to do is if any of
these are equal to true then it's going
to go ahead and set them equal to false
so that they can use this part right
here now if we don't reset those back to
false once we do it this part of the if
statement will not run because is adding
will be true for the rest of the time
that we run the program so if we go
ahead and run this type in our first
number second number we can add and we
can keep adding and then when we click
clear it will let us use both of these
again so I'll go ahead and do the button
subtract click you can even move on to
the other buttons I'll be going through
the subtract real quick app in the next
tutorial just in case you couldn't
figure it out and then I'll do the rest
of the buttons and thanks for watching
and stay tuned for the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
