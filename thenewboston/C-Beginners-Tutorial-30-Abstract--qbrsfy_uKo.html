tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to use the keyword
abstract so all you're going to need for
this tutorial is a button and a class
and inside of our class right here you
have two public static fields and we
have a public static method so we do not
have to create an instance of this class
in fact there's no real reason to create
an instance of this class because we
cannot even access anything inside of
the class because everything inside of
it is static so we can just access it by
doing a class name and then dot and now
we can access everything inside of it so
to prevent someone from being able to
create an instance of this class we can
mark the class's abstract in order to do
that you just want to put the abstract
keyword in front of the class we're just
doing abstract right here and now if we
try to create an instance of this class
we're going to get an error saying we
cannot do that and it says cannot create
an instance of the abstract class or
interface my name is based on my class
so this is we expected since this is
abstract we cannot create an instance of
this abstract class and as you can see
it's very useful when you have out on
everything inside of it being public and
static all right so that's pretty much
all there is on abstract classes however
I'm going to show you how to apply it to
members so you can create abstract
members such as methods on properties
indexers and events so if we were to on
make an abstract method right here let's
call it show message then since this is
abstract we must provide some sort of um
access modifier on it cannot be private
so we have to make it either public
are protected so I'm going to make it
public for right now but you could mark
it as protected as well also since this
is abstract you cannot provide
implementation for it so if we try to do
this we'll get an error saying not
declare a body because it's marked as
abstract and the body is just these
things inside the parentheses right here
even though there's nothing inside them
we still cannot do this or instead we're
going to use a semicolon
so now we build you shouldn't get any
errors you know and usually what this is
used for is to be overridden in a
derived class so if we were to create
another class here called my second
class and inherit from the space class
myclass
then we could override this this method
right here and as you can see it shows
up right there so now we just click
enter and it will type it all out for us
and it will auto type out the signature
right here so we know we don't mess
anything up and now we can provide
implementation for it
we'll just have it display a message box
and then I would display a message box
of the string that the user passes
through also if you have any abstract
members inside of your abstract inside
of your class the class must be marked
as abstract we try to delete this right
here and build we're going to get an
error saying it's abstract but it is
contained in a non abstract class so
that means this must be marked as
abstract now mobility should get any
areas so that's pretty much it for this
tutorial on abstract so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
