seventh Android tutorial for the new
Boston again we're working with the XML
parsing you know kind of boring stuff
like that but just show you guys an
example we're gonna set up our parser
within this tutorial or at least part of
it and we'll add to it as we go within
the next few tutorials so we created the
you know list for full uri with the help
of our string builder to match our city
and state which is what we're gonna need
when working with the google weather api
and now what we're gonna do is we're
gonna set up a website within a tri
bracket and we're also gonna do all our
parsing within this tri bracket because
you know things sometimes tend to go
awry and we're gonna just you know
surround it with a try and if things
don't work out we're just gonna say
catch again exception just a standard
exception call it e and all we're gonna
do is we have this textview which is
supposed to display our weather but if
this exception happens we're just gonna
say textview set text to air so there we
go now if things don't work out we have
a back-up plan
ya always need to have a back-up plan
and then what we're gonna do is we're
gonna set up an actual URL instance so
URL and we're just gonna call this
website this is gonna be equal to new
URL and we're gonna pass in our string
that we created with our string builder
which was called full you full URL like
that and we just have to add our imports
and there we go now we have a URL called
website what we need to do to parse the
data is use a sax factory our execs I
said sax with an a factory type variable
and then we're gonna get down into the
XML reader now what sax and what sax
stands for his simple API XML and then
we're gonna say parser
and then factory so this is just this is
just a variable we're gonna call SPF
something like that and then we're gonna
say this is equal to our sax parser
factory and a new instance of that so
all we do is just dot new instance kind
of gives us the default sax parser
Factory and then we can just kind of
specify that a little bit more we're
gonna create a sax parser and this is
just going to be equal to SP and all
we're gonna do is we're going to relate
to our SPF our sax parser Factory and
then we just say dot new sax parser
again kind of just a default that we're
working with lastly and most importantly
since we're reading XML we're just going
to create an XML reader and we're just
going to call this X R for XML Reader
set this equal to our sax parser SP dot
get XML reader because again we're
reading XML stuff so you know an XML
reader would be nice and you know you
might just want to leave a comment even
though you know whatever we're just
gonna say getting XML reader parsed data
just a reminder you know because you're
like sax parser factory sax parser XML
reader what's going on
well it's uh you know it's pretty simple
if you guys just kind of think of it for
a second it's just kind of a default sax
parser Factory and then we get a new
instance of the sax parser and then we
just get the XML reader it's all coming
from the same thing which actually comes
from the sax parser factory class so
there we go we have our XML reader and
then what we're gonna do is we're gonna
use our handle which we called handling
XML stuff so we're just gonna set up a
variable handling XML stuff we're gonna
call this doing work cuz you know it's
pretty much handling all of our business
I'm just gonna set this equal to new you
know handling XML stuff variable or
instance and there we go
and then one a couple more lines of code
we're gonna refer to our XML reader now
we're just gonna say dot set content
handler you know I go Handler and
handling stuff yeah well that's the
connection that we're making and we're
gonna call this doing work which is the
instance of our variable that we just
set up there and it's given us an air
right now because it's like hey you know
I don't know how I feel about this cuz
you know I'm supposed to be receiving a
Content handler but you're just telling
me do work or so you know what's what's
going on there well we again we haven't
defined this class we haven't set up
what this instance means we're gonna get
to that and a few tutorial or in the
next tutorial probably but that's what
we want to look for and that's the
method how we use this XML reader to
look for the things that we actually
want to look for and then again we're
gonna set up this this variable which is
a handling XML stuff type variable to
look for the stuff that we actually want
or you know or city and temperature and
all that stuff and then what we're gonna
say is our
XR reader XML reader dot parse and then
as you can see it takes some sort of an
input and what we're gonna do is we're
gonna say new input source and we're
gonna refer to our website or URL and
then dot open stream and that's probably
it for this tutorial I know we went
through quite a few things here and I
didn't really explain much but it'll
make more sense as we go and I'll
probably do a review of this get of this
stuff because again I told you guys I go
slow but all we did is we wanted to get
to an XML reader so we can read some XML
stuff so we referred to the sax parser
Factory class basically just to get the
default instance and then we even
specified it a little bit further by
creating a sax parser and all that's
gonna do is create a new sax parser out
of our sax parser Factory and then we
wanted to get to this XML reader which
again we just specified a little bit
more specifically that we wanted to get
the XML reader and then we're going to
use that reader to look for the things
that we want to look for and then we're
gonna parse that that data from this
website so again it's a little bit
confusing for now guys but I promise
I'll explain it in the next few
tutorials and I hope to see you guys
then hope you have a good one and peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
