Illustrator cs6 tutorial my name is
buddy and today we're gonna start
understanding the layers panel and the
layers panel is one of the most
important panels in Illustrator because
it helps you organize your project and
you can get a good overview of what is
actually going on in your project by
using the layers panel so the layers
panel is over here on the right and it's
gonna have these two squares stacked up
on top of each other if you don't see
that go to window and go to layers and
click on it now the first thing that
we're gonna do let's create some objects
so we can have a few layers so I'll just
create some squares and creates ellipses
now if we look at the layers I created
everything under one layer even though I
made a bunch of different objects now
the thing that you'll have to do is
you'll have to end up creating new
layers and the way you do that is by
this button down here it says create a
new layer so this layer that I just
created contains a bunch of different
objects now I can put things on this
layer that I have now if I select it let
me put on some polygons now this layer
contains a few different options or a
few different things so it's good it's a
good way to organize now if I wanted to
be really organized I'd want to probably
put all the rectangles on one layer all
the ellipses on one layer so let me do
that you can do this by clicking and
dragging onto other layers if you click
on these triangles it'll expand or lower
the layer so let me go over a couple of
things that you might see in the layers
panel the first thing is on the left are
these eyeballs and this is going to show
and hide your layers if you just click
on them that's all you got to do and
then up here to the right is the layers
option where you can have a bunch of
different options I'll go over there
over those later
and go back to my selection tool so I
don't have to keep on doing that to the
right you've got the circle this is the
target and that can you click on that
and it use it to apply and edit
appearances to the right is the
selection square so if I go ahead and
select something with the target it's
going to appear with the selected and
you can see here and it gets selected by
the color that your layers are assigned
to so you can see the bounding box is
also the same color and now the paths
are it helps distinguish things and so
you can see what's going on so now
everything is the same now when you have
a layer and then it has a couple things
underneath it those are called sub
layers so this layer has four sub layers
to it they're also called nested layers
some people call it that now there's a
section here that looks like it's empty
but if you click you'll get a locks icon
and this locks and unlocks layers and
when you lock a layer you're not able to
do anything to it well that's what we
got here we've got this trashcan icon
here so if I click a layer the trashcan
icon here will allow you to delete your
selection if I click that and hit OK
it's gonna delete everything I'm gonna
hit control Z to bring it back up the
next one is the new layer button this
one here is a new sub layer button so if
I click on this and I create a new sub
layer now I've got a new sub layer
within the layer and I can add something
like text on to it or something like
that and then within that I could have
more objects we've got a create clipping
mask making release clipping mask button
and if you haven't learned about
clipping messia I just made a tutorial
right before this about clipping masks
when you have a layer selected you'll
see this triangle up in the top right
and that's your current layer that you
have so then you know which one you have
selected
and when you have a layer that is on top
such as these layers here the first ones
these are called top level layers so
this is a top level layer like the one I
have selected any of these three and
then you go into it and then here's your
sub layer so that's just some
terminology for you now let's go ahead
and make some things in a group so I'm
gonna group up these rectangles and now
you can see that there is a there's a
group now and it says group on here and
sometimes you can name them and stuff
and the group contains paths in it or
other artwork to the right is are down
here there's a magnifying glass and
that's the locate object button and
that's new in cs6 and you click it to
locate a selected object in your
document in the layers panel so if I was
let me close these up if I click on this
square right here and I click on locate
object it's going to show you in the
layers panel where it was don't think
that you can go into your layers panel
and then click on like this path and
then hit locate object it won't show it
to you in here it's only for selecting R
objects on your artboard and finding
them in the layers panel it makes it
easy once you get a ton of layers
because some of these things that you're
gonna be working on are probably gonna
have hundred like a hundred layers or
more when you get into like big projects
you get like little pieces and stuff
going in your groups and all that stuff
so now you got an overview and an
understanding of the layers panel and we
can move on in the next couple tutorials
on how to mess with the layers panel
more and use it to your advantage so you
can work more efficiently so give the
video a thumbs up and be sure to
subscribe if you are looking to see more
illustrator tutorials or even any other
tutorials that we're going to be posting
on here so thanks a lot for watching
everybody see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
