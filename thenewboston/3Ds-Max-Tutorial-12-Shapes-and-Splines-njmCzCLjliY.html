3ds studio max tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm going to show you guys how
to create 2d shapes now you're probably
wondering why we're creating 2d shapes
instead of 3d shapes because this is a
way with creating 2d shapes you can turn
a 2d shape into a 3d shape really easy
but first we need to know the ins and
outs of 2d and also when you're working
with like flat surfaces like a wall or
something then you probably want to put
some 2d images on that but for now we're
going to learn how to create shapes and
later we're going to learn how to create
them into 3d objects and this is a
pretty advanced way of doing it so pay
attention so to create standard shapes
go to your create palette right here and
instead of a geometry go to shapes and
what this allows you to do is to create
all different kinds of shapes now you
probably already know the basics like
circle don' all of these the only
probably probably one you don't know is
this end gun and this is pretty much a
polygon with any number of sides you won
on it so go ahead and click end gone in
with the sides
click 8 turn it to an octagon now you
can go ahead and create a shape just by
clicking and dragging just like we did
before and I'm actually going to go to
my top view so it's easier to see and
I'm going to turn off my grid so it's
probably a lot easier to see now so
again any time you want to create shape
just go click on the shape and drag now
another point is if I select this and
delete it is whenever you're creating a
shape you get this little checkbox that
either says start new shape or don't
start new shape whenever this is checked
any time you create a shape you can see
that there are different colors and I
can modify these differently and they
don't affect each other but let me go
ahead and select all of these and delete
them and now when you click like
something like circle and click don't
start new shape or uncheck that
what does is it turns into all one shape
so now you can see that they're all the
same color when created so
if I click away from that you can see
that this is all entirely one shape I
never started a new shape so now I can
edit all that as a whole by either just
moving in like this or doing whatever I
want to it so aside from that let's go
ahead and delete this and move on aside
from that what we can do is the probably
only other shape you're going to have
confusion on is this line right here
this line is pretty much like the pen
tool in Photoshop you go ahead and click
a point and then cook another point to
create a line and you can keep clicking
to create more and more lines the thing
is whenever you click and drag it
creates a round bezzie a point so click
and drag creates a round point and if
you go back to your beginning and click
it says close a spline go ahead and
click yes and you got yourself an entire
shape so that's the basics of using the
line tool I'm gonna go ahead and delete
that now in order to make these shapes a
spline we need to convert them to
editable spline so I'm going to go ahead
and make what should I make how about a
star and right there and I'm also going
to make a circle right here and I'm
going to pause this while I remember I
can't right-click on my computer on my
screen recorder room what's up I'm going
to pause these right-click these and
convert them to editable spline you
should know how to do that from last
Thoreau so I'll see you in a second
alright guys now I converted this star
in the circle to an editable spline so
now that we have to editable splines
instead of just regular shapes I can go
ahead and teach you guys something about
these now the first thing I want to
point out is if I try to render these
items go ahead and I'll hit click away
and hit F okay well evidently when I hit
f9 on my keyboard it stops my screen
recorder so I do that but anyways what I
want to show you is if you try to render
these out you're not going to be able to
render it unless you go to rendering
right here and enable in renderer
they're so click that I guys I can't
show you what it does so I guess you're
just going to have to see for yourself
if I try to show you my screen recorder
will shut off so sucks for you so now
another thing I want to talk about is
how to create a new line
most of the stuff we're going to be
working with in shapes is under this
geometry so let's go ahead and select a
subject object of vertex by clicking
your editable spine and vertex and
anytime you create a new line it's going
to add to that same shape just like that
so that's how you can add to your shape
when you're in editable splines
by creating a new line another cool
thing you can do is break a point to
create two separate endpoints so go
ahead and let me just select the
endpoint right now you can see that this
is one endpoint that just moves along if
you keep that vertex selected and click
break what it does is break it apart so
now you can see if I select it like that
and break it press the break button and
now is broken into two separate
endpoints so again anytime you want to
take a connecting vertex and break it
into two endpoints select it and hit
break in your geometry and that will
break it into two endpoints now the last
thing I want to talk to you guys about
is this attach button right here what
this does is take once line and attach
it to another one so let's go ahead and
select this entire spine right here or
this entire object and you see the white
brackets around it right there and we
want to attach the circle to it so it's
all one shape well in order to do that
while this is selected go ahead and
click attach and now when you hover over
your circle you see this weird goofy a
crop circle looking thing just go ahead
and click that and now this entire
circle was attached to this shape so
again in order to attach an object to
another spline just go ahead and click
attach with the object selected and then
click the object you want to attach it
to
so that's F for this tutorial in the
next tutorial probably going to be going
over either the rest of these or how to
change these 2d objects into 3d so thank
you for watching now see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
