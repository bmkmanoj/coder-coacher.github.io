exciting Illustrator cs6 tutorial today
I'm going to show you how to apply
colors and I'm going to show you a whole
bunch of different ways that you can do
it some ways give you more control than
others and others are just really quick
ways to do things so the first thing you
want to do is make a shape use your one
of your tools here a rectangle tool or
whatever you need to do I use the
polygon tool and just drew a shape out
now you'll get something with some color
in it if you have colors already picked
out or you'll just get a white box and
nothing will be there click on your
shape and then go up here into your
options panel up here control panel I
think and you can click on this left box
with the arrow here and you should have
some different colors you can click on
these colors to change the fill which is
the inside color of the object go ahead
click on it again and to the right of it
is called the stroke and that's that
outside line around the edge you can
click on this to change the different
colors of the fill or of the stroke of
my bed that's the stroke now if you look
over here on the tools panel you can see
that these things same two colors are
filled in so click on your object you
can change the colors from down here as
well this time when you double click on
the color you get a color picker you can
start picking colors out that way you
click on the back one it'll come to the
foreground that's the stroke so I can
change that to like some kind of black
and there and now I have different
colors again once there's even more ways
that you can do this
there's the swatches panel the color
panel the color guide panel let's go
over here to the color panel and that's
up here on this artboard click on that
and here is your color panel well we
want to make sure this is selected
and we can see we can pick one of these
colors here and that's for the stroke
now if I click down here on the fill and
then start clicking a color it's going
to change the color of the fill and you
can tell which one is being picked on
what's in the foreground the stroke is
always going to have this little square
in the middle and the fill is not and
you can see the hotkeys are X if you
press X it's going to switch between
those and I'm pressing X right now so
that it's something you can keep in mind
if you just want to keep switching the
next one is the color guide panel and
this just gives you some shades in tints
of different colors that you've got now
you can pick more colors by clicking on
here and coming down to some of these
other colors and then you've got all
these different colors you can pick from
I'm going to select my object first and
then I could pick one of these colors
and then if I press X you'll see down
here on the left it'll switch now I can
pick another color and I've got the
outside there we got a couple more
colors here from the member I picked
down here I went to scientific went to
complementary and I picked that and it
changed my colors I can click on this
here and I've got a bunch of different
colors as well that I can use and these
are like kind of like complementary
colors and if I come down here to maybe
I go to art history I'll go to ancient
and now I've got some a new color
palette so it's just giving you
different color palettes that work
together the next one we're going to
show you is the swatches panel and
that's this button here and that's
basically when I brought this down this
was the swatches panel and this is just
going to keep some colors up here for
you to use and here's a bunch of
different kind of swatches and then you
can use swatches from this as well
here's
another set of swatches if I clicked on
earth tones and it brought it out here
I'll exit out of that but you can select
the different swatches right now I'm on
the fill or I'm on the stroke and if I
press X and change and now I'm on the
fill and I can just pick from these so
there you go you've got that and there
was one thing I wanted to show you again
down here coming in the bottom you see
this little arrow here you can swap the
fill in the stroke if you messed up
click on your object and you can swap
them by clicking on this button here and
then if we press this button to the left
the fill and stroke which is the hotkey
D it's just going to change it back to
black and white and that's the default
so there you go now you know how to
apply colors like a professional and
that's it for this tutorial you know all
the you know a few different ways to
apply color and I guess that's it for
this tutorial

new stuff and I guess I just thank you
