11 days now I finally found some sign of
life my very first trail as you can see
says what does it say state of New York
throw marker so that means that I am on
a hiking trail somewhere in the
Adirondacks now what I have to decide is
do I want to go right or left and I know
a lot of these trails some of them are
short as a couple miles long bother ones
they're like overnight trails in there
like 20 or 30 miles long so I'm really
hoping that this is a shorter one but
nonetheless they usually always come out
to roads or just parts of the highway
where you park and walk so I guess the
only thing I have to do now is decide
whether to go left or right and I have
no idea how I'm going to decide that and
then follow it until I find someone or
something to get me home
well after walking for about I don't
know I'm guessing three miles a couple
hours at least I ended up turning right
because it'll look like it was downhill
more and it would have been easier to
walk plus I know some trails go up
mountains so I figured down would lead
me to people instead of the top of the
mountain which I is someplace I don't
want to be but anyways I don't know if
that was the right decision because I
haven't found anything yet
no people I have found more of those
markers so I know that I'm still on the
trail but uh no water still no people
and actually here's another one of those
markers coming up I'll show you but uh
as you can see there's no water really
anywhere just a lot of these things
let's trail marker still so even though
I still haven't found anything I'm still
in a well pretty good mood considering
that you know I'm pretty thirsty pretty
hungry I guess I'm in the best mood that
I can be for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
