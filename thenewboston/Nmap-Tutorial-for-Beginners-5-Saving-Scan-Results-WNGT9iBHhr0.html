this video I'm going to show you how to
save your skin results to a file and
this is actually useful if you're
running a really long scan and you know
you don't want to sit there and wait and
look at the results so you can run it go
off go do something else and just save
it to a file so what I'm going to do is
I'm just gonna run a fast scan on my own
just type this first the New Boston comm
so I'll show you guys the results of
this first so this is me without saving
anything to a file what it does is it
returns all of this information now if I
ever want to save that to a file then
what I can do is after this minus F flag
is I can write minus o capital n now you
can actually save files in a couple of
different formats and is just a regular
text file there's also if you write - Oh
X ox
well I don't think they say ox but this
will save it to an XML file but I just
want to in a regular text file so I'm
just going to write - o n and then you
just write the location in name over
whatever files so desktop I'll just name
this results dot txt but you can name it
whatever you want
so what this is going to do if I hit
enter it's going to go through the scan
again and I'll show you guys something
cool so let me minimize this and I know
you guys can see it's off of a recording
area but it just created this file right
here and if I open in leafpad then you
see it took all of the results and
plopped them in a nice file for us so
you can do whatever you want with that
let me pop this up again now another
cool thing I want to show you guys since
I have time is if you ever want to
display a verbose or pretty much updates
in real time this has nothing to do with
like affecting the performance or
details of the scan it's just kind of
cool to look at you can write minus V
and
the new boston.com and this just kind of
like I said if you guys know what
verbose means I always like looking at
this because I don't know something
likes to look at that with just a
blinking cursor while it scans so boom
roasted there you go over boasts more
information in the terminal easy enough</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
