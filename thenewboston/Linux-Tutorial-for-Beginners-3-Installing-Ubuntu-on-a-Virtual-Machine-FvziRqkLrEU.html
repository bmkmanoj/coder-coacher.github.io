and just so I can make things a little
bit easier what I'm going to do is I'm
actually going to take it and moving
into a separate file that I have some
routes and that's because I just don't
want it in my downloads folder so we're
just going to take this and drag it you
don't need to do this I just like having
things real nice and neat anyways this
is the file so now let's go ahead and
install it on our virtual machine so
open up VMware Player and from here
we're going to hit create a new virtual
machine and it says ok what you can do
is you can install it from a disk if you
burn it to a disc in it's on a physical
DVD you can stick it inside your DVD
drive but we just have it is a regular
old I so since we downloaded it off the
internet so I'm going to click on this
and that is the file and just hit next
so we're going to create a virtual
machine a virtual computer using that
operating system abouttwo so next and Oh
am I going to personalize the links give
it the name Bucky and we'll talk about
user accounts within a boon to later on
but right now my user name can just be
Bucky and make any password so and make
sure you remember this because whenever
you have your operating system installed
and asks you to log in it's going to ask
for this password so hit next and
alright it doesn't really matter what
the name of it is I'm just going to say
a boon to I'll say YouTube so I know
which one and hit next the default
location is where you always want to put
it all right so what you're doing like I
said is you're pretty much creating a
virtual computer a computer a simulation
of computer within your computer so it's
going to take up a bunch of files and
it's also going to need a certain amount
of memory or ram in order to run so for
all of the files I'm just going to storm
is one single file keep everything nice
and neat and hit
and also it says okay so for a virtual
computer do these settings look alright
so it's going to have a twenty gigabyte
hard drive in one megabyte of RAM well
you can change the size of this if you
want this looks fine 20 gigabyte but I'm
also going to bump up the RAM so if I go
to customize in my memory I want to
boost this up to about 4 gigs so I said
1 megabyte but actually meant a 1
gigabyte when I said that just a second
ago so I'm going to change it to 4 gigs
close this and you just don't want to
crank it up all the way because what
this virtual machine is going to do is
it's going to borrow resources from your
host computer in in my instance for my
main Windows computer so I know that I
have 16 gigs of ram installed on my main
windows operating system on my main
computer so this is going to borrow for
whenever running this virtual machine
and all that other stuff looks good so
I'm just going to hit finish and it's
going to start installing from that ISO
from the file we downloaded and since I
uninstalled this and then am
reinstalling it for this tutorial
just going to hit download and install
we shrink this so you guys can see in
this file all this this does take a few
minutes so don't freak out it's taking a
long time installing an operating system
take some time nothing you can do about
that
alright so we now have a Mbutu installed
on our virtual machine and just type the
password that you made whenever you
first install this in hit enter and you
should login so this is I can stretch
this so you guys can see it a little bit
better so this is what the default
desktop looks like for Ubuntu and just
so whenever I'm recording these videos
all of this is a little bit easier to
see I'm going to click on this button
you guys don't have to do this don't
worry and this is just the system
settings or the preferences and I am
going to go to appearance and these
buttons right here I just want to make a
a bit smaller so you guys can see them
all so I'm going to bump this down to
umm I don't know like 40 that's pretty
good and if you want to change the
desktop or whatever then you can do that
but this is the starting point now a
boon to comes with a couple programs
that you don't really need or I'm not
going to be teaching in this video I
want to teach you guys about Linux and
you know not how to use like um the
pretty much Microsoft Word for a Mbutu
so I'm also going to right-click and
just unlock or undock the use if you're
an Apple person so unlock from launcher
unlock unlock and also this Amazon one
and there you go so that's our starting
point if you guys want to you know play
around with this a little bit then feel
free to explore and just remember
anything you do in here don't worry
about breaking because if you you know
just go in and accidentally delete all
these files for a boon to it's never
going to affect your host operating
system there's nothing you can do inside
your virtual machine that's going to
mess up this stuff right there
so if you guys want to play around feel
free and in the next video we'll
continue learning more about Linux</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
