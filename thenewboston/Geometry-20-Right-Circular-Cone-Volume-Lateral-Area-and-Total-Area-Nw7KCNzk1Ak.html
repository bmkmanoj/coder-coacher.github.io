little bit and talk about the right
circular cone and like the other kinds
of 3d objects we're going to talk about
its volume its lateral area and its
total area so the volume of a right
circular cone is equal to 1/3 PI R
squared times height now remember when
we talk about the height we're talking
about this height that is drawn in
perpendicular to the base so say this is
the center of this circle and it's drawn
perpendicular from the top of the cone
to the center of the circle okay so to
solve the volume of this cone we're
gonna take 1/3 PI R which is 3 squared
times our height which is 4 so V is
equal to 1/3 9 squared is 9 pi times 4
1/3 of 9 is 3 so 3 pi times 4 so the
volume of this cone is that should be 12
pi and if this had said centimeters it
would be centimeters cubed because
volume is always a three-dimensional
measure okay so to find the lateral area
of a cone you take pi times R times your
slant height and this gives you you know
those little paper cups that come with
the water bubblers pretend that's what
we had and that's our cone if we were
finding the lateral area it would be us
unrolling that paper cup and laying it
flat and finding the area of the
triangular shape that we have left
so to do this it's pi times R which is
three times our slant height which is
this height right here it's the height
that makes a right triangle with the
regular height and the radius so to do
this we're going to have to use our
Pythagorean theorem to find out what our
slant height is so 3 squared plus 4
squared equals x squared 9 plus 16 is
equal to x squared x squared is equal to
25 we take the square root of both sides
we get X is equal to 5 so this is 5 so
for our lateral area it's pi times 3
times 5 so we would have 15 pi and if we
had units it would be units squared
because whenever we find an area we're
finding a two dimensional measure so to
find our total area we have to take what
our lateral area is which we find by
taking pi times our radius times our
slant height and we're going to add it
to the area of this circle so PI R
squared so pi times our radius which is
3 times our slant height which we just
found a minute ago to be 5 plus PI R
which is 3 squared so our total area is
equal to 3 times 5 15 pi plus 9 squared
is 9 or excuse me 3 squared is 9 so our
total area is equal to 24
pi
units squared that's actually all we
have today dealing with the right
circular cone but make sure you come
back to our necks and watch our next
video which is all about logic and
certain statements we use to prove
things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
