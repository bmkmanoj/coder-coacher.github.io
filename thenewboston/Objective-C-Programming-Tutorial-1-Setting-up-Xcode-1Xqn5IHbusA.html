you can see I just got my brand new Mac
and you know what that means we can
finally begin programming in Objective C
now if you're watching this store just
cuz you clicked on it and you're like I
don't even know what Objective C is
Objective C is the language that allows
you to develop programs in on not only
the Mac itself but also the iPhone and
iPod touch
so that's what I really care about but
in order to just you can't really just
jump right into iPod and iPhone program
you got to learn Objective C in the core
language behind it first so that's what
we're going to be doing in this first
tutorial we aren't really going to be
writing any code but we're going to be
setting up the program that allows you
to write the code so I'm not sure
because I already downloaded the iPhone
SDK which is the program to make iphone
apps but I'm like 90% sure that the
program Xcode which is the program that
we need already comes on on your Mac
operating system Snow Leopard or OS 10
or whatever they call it so in order to
get to the program called Xcode and this
is the program we use the write
Objective C go ahead to your finder
right here and then go ahead to your
Macintosh hard drive then go ahead and
click a developer now again if you don't
have Xcode then just like go Google how
to get Xcode and they'll give it to you
but anyways once you're under a
developer go ahead and click
applications and then go ahead and
double click Xcode and now you see if we
X out of this Xcode out of it we get
this little thing called Xcode at the
bottom so go ahead and well you can
double click it but it's open already
you can either create a new project or
you can exit this in under Xcode or
excuse me file you can click a new
project either way it does the same
thing I just want to tell you if you X
out of that box then you know you still
have options how to get there but
anyways you have a bunch of different
things you might not have this the
iPhone operating system but you
definitely will have this the
Mac os10 so go ahead and under the Mac
os10
we're not going to jump an iPhone
development yet but we will in future
under application make sure you have
application and click command-line tool
now don't just go click and choose yet
what you want to do is under the type
make sure you have foundation selected
by default at C we want to change it to
Foundation C is another language
foundation we can write Objective C so
go ahead once you have application
command line and foundation go ahead and
click Choose and now we want to name our
new project something I'm gonna name a
tutorial so go ahead and click Save and
now you see our tutorial is set up now
we're saying alright so where do I start
writing code and what am I supposed to
do and where do I go from here well what
we want to do and this is just to test
out the program I'm not going to be
teaching you anything in this burg
excuse me this tutorial just go ahead
and click tutorial dot and dot M is the
extension of arm pretty much Objective C
program and you know like it's dot C for
C and like dot CPP for C++ well dot M is
exact Objective C so by default they
already give you a program that's built
and all that is is it's text on screen
that says hello world so if you want you
can go ahead and change the text M
beside or excuse me in between the
quotation marks but we don't really want
to do anything except set up a program
and learn how to run our programs
because that's what this story is about
in the next tutorial I'm going to teach
you what all this means and how to code
it and all that fun stuff but for now we
just want to make sure this runs so go
ahead up here and click build and run
and if you didn't mess anything up then
it should say alright debugging of the
toriel ended normally which is good and
you say alright so how do I see my
program well you may have a window
pop-up if you ran Xcode before but for
those of you who just watching this for
the first time and have never run X go
for what you should start with me what
you want to do is go up the run right
here and click console in this console
will kind of give you an input to your
program now right now you see all this
stuff right here and this is just I'll
talk about later on but what you are
focused on is this black right here
excuse me the bolt it's all black and it
says hello world if you see this and it
says succeeded down here then you know
you're good to go for the next tutorial
and you have Xcode set up properly you
know how to open projects and run them
and they build compile and run properly
if you mess something up say we'll get
rid of the semicolon try to build and
run it make sure you save and it set
failed that means that you mess
something up so if you get failed too it
means failed with two errors I think it
means
so anyways go ahead build and run like I
said save it and then go to run and
console to see your actual program so
that's what consul means actually see
your program work and if it says X
exhibited with status value zero you
know you'll know if it runs because you
won't get any errors but that's pretty
much the basics of what objective-c is
how to set up a Xcode project and where
we're going to be beginning again if you
don't know how I got here then rewind
this tutorial and watch it again and
also let me ask you guys do you like
seeing my face in the bottom right hand
corner or would you rather view these
tutorials without my face it's up to you
guys so leave me a comment in this
tutorial and let me know which one you
like but I hope you guys have learned a
little something at least how to set up
your X Xcode and you know that's about
it so thank you guys for watching and
well I guess I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
