the maximum and minimum widths and
Heights a bit later on anyway okay so
for the rest of the options I'm going to
remove the bigger box just so we can see
everything a bit better so I'm going to
get rid of the bigger box from here and
now again we're just left with the
smaller box that we can still resize so
let's go ahead and take a look at some
of the other options that we can define
in here now the first one we're going to
look at is animate and we can set this
to either true or false by default it's
false so what's going to happen here is
when we drag we don't actually see the
drag happen but when we release it
resizes to the size that you've defined
now there is a problem here that you
can't actually see where you're dragging
to so I could you know drag over here
and it will animate nicely but we can't
actually see where we are actually
dragging it to before it animates so to
fix this we use the ghost option and by
default this is set to false but now
we're going to set it to true will
actually see a lower opacity version of
the div that you are or the element that
you are resizing before the animation
happens so you can see that at the
moment I'm dragging that there you can
see the opacity set much lower and then
that will resize to a particular area so
you can see the ghost of the div or the
element before you actually decide to
drag it or before the user actually
drags it with regards to the animation
we can set a few different properties
here so for example we could set animate
duration and this just is the speed of
the animation in milliseconds we can
also specify things like slow medium and
fast or sorry not medium normal and fast
so for example if we were to set the
animation duration to slow when we go
ahead and resize it its well that's
that's classed as slow if we were to go
ahead and change this to fast you can
see that you have a much faster effect
when it resizes so it's quite quicker
or you can go ahead like I said and
define this in milliseconds
so we could say 50 for example which
would be extremely quick and when we
resize it almost snaps to it so
depending on what kind of effect you're
looking for you can do this obviously if
we work out something like three seconds
which is 3,000 milliseconds you can see
it you know slides a lot quicker at
slower sorry and with regards to
animation as well we can use animation
easing techniques so we can also define
anim animate easing and you can set it
to by default it's set to swing but you
can set it to linear so let's just check
out swing that's the default option you
can see particularly when it's very slow
that as it gets towards the end it slows
down so it's almost like a graph that
starts low so when the animation starts
it starts slowly it speeds up and then
it slows down again this is the swing
animation easing effect if we were to
use linear it will resize exactly the
same speed every time you can see then
it just stops so depending on again the
how you want it to look this will just
slide at a constant pace as opposed to
swing so I'm just going to remove this
animation duration and remove this
animate easing so we can see some other
options now another useful option is the
aspect ratio if you'll try to maintain a
particular aspect ratio you can go ahead
and turn this on so for example if I was
just to say true what will happen now is
I can't resize out of the actual aspect
ratio the original aspect ratio of the
object or the element so now that I've
set this to true I can't actually move
it for example I can't resize from the
sides the aspect ratio is maintained
however with the aspect ratio you can
also predefined an aspect ratio that you
want it to adhere to so for example you
could do this in
in a point something form so for example
0.40 this would just keep it in this
aspect ratio here and then now that
object is bound to that particular
aspect ratio you can also define a
fraction for example 2 over 5 or 2 by 5
and this would also allow you to do this
so for example you could do 9/10 and
then this would keep a 9/10 aspect ratio
so it's 9 width and 10 height so that's
the aspect ratio just keeping it to true
though will maintain the initial aspect
ratio that it holds so let's go ahead
and get rid of that okay so back on is
more a more aesthetic option we're going
to go ahead and enable auto hide now
what auto hide does is it hides the tiny
triangle that you can see in the corner
of this div until the mouse is hovered
over the element in which you are
reciting so if we were to set auto hide
to true and we refresh you can see that
the triangle has actually disappeared
however when I hover my mouse over this
particular element the small triangle
appears again so I can now go ahead and
resize this so that's quite useful if
you don't want to show this on let's say
you had a lot of resizable objects you
don't want to show this on every single
object and if it's obvious that a
particular element can be resized you
might not want to show this however be
careful because if you don't show this
initially it does just look like a grey
box the small triangle in the corner
often represents something that can be
resized so it's entirely up to you on
whether you were to keep it there I like
to keep also hide off generally but
again if you had lots of elements that
are able to be resized it tends to look
better when you enable auto hide okay so
another thing we can do is we can
specify a grid now we saw this in the
draggable interaction in the jQuery UI
as well and with the grid we can specify
a numerical value with l2 numerical
value
within square brackets that represent a
grid that the element will snap to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
