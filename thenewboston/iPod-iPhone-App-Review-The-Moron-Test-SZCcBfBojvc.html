another app review and this is an app
for something called the moron test now
I got this a while ago and actually my
sister told me about it and now I'm
addicted to it and what it is it starts
out you see three things and they all
say incomplete because I couldn't pass
any of them and these are pretty much
three separate tests and it says the
moron test because it's like a not like
a regular test it's like a test that has
a bunch of questions but some of them
have liked Rick answers so they started
out pretty easy this one says press the
red button to continue so go ahead and
do that where are you right now earth
and now the instruction is change now
touch a son don't worry it's not hot
touch the planet and now it says touch
plus sign so as you can see the
questions start out rather easy but they
give trickier and trickier as you get to
the end of the test so let me go ahead
and answer these questions press a red
blue and green biggest duck and now
here's your first one that says touch
with the beat to continue and there's a
letter B and also a be the animal so I'm
going to go ahead and touch the B and
again that was your checkpoint right
there so you can either return the
checkpoint or start over and again like
I said this app is pretty cool because
it will keep you busy for a actually a
long time especially if your get
confused easily and another thing is it
has three different tests so I mean this
is a pretty cool app because you can
tell all your friends about it I always
bet people at work that they can't
finish it and i won like two double
cheeseburgers and a dollar so far so I'm
doing pretty good but anyways for my
rating I'm going to write this app 7 out
of 10 because it's a pretty fun can keep
you busy and it's not one of those apps
that you own these ones you can use it
over and over again and it should keep
you entertained for a while so thank you

review just leave a message on this
video and our villa for you so on this
