v w/h tutorial and this tutorial I'm
going to be going over some more ways to
get input from a user so let's go ahead
and get started in the first thing
unlike last time where this check the
box you're going to have times where you
need them to enter a little bit of text
like their name or birthday or something
like that so for this the easiest way is
a little dialog box with a little text
box so they can enter it and type okay
so to do this go ahead and create an
object I'm going to name my box
feel free to name yours whatever and you
need to write WX dot text entry dialogue
and what this gives you is a little
dialog box where you can type text in
now pay attention to the parameters on
this because they're important the first
one is the parent and the second one is
the question or prompt you're going to
ask them say like what's your name
what's your name my little question mark
there now the third parameter is the
title of the box so I'll just write a
title and the fourth parameter this is
the one that's a different to this one
this is the default text for your text
box so default text this is what answer
is going to show up before they even
start typing anything so those are your
four parameters that you need to know
for a text entry dialog now after this
you do something a little different than
you did before so pay attention to this
as well what you want to do is when you
create this text box it's going to show
okay and cancel at the bottom now if
they want if they hit OK then you're
going to want to store whatever they
type but if they hit cancel you're not
going to want to store whatever they
type because they cancelled away from it
for whatever reason maybe their cat was
meowing or the baby was crying or
something so you want to write if they
clicked okay then store the answer so
here's how you do
it if box dot show modal or model I
don't even know how to say it if someone
knows how please type it in the comments
and let me know W X dot id underscore
okay and under your if actually you
probably need one of these in my
probably I mean you do
we're on let's go ahead and put a
variable called like answer or something
since it's going to store the answer box
dot get value there we go so let me show
you guys how this works and then we'll
move on it says what is your name again
move this to the side this the parent
parameter and show up this first
parameter which is second parameter
actually is the question the third one
is the title and the fourth one is the
default text so you can type what
everyone in right there press ok it
stores press cancel it doesn't store and
that's where my last tutorial so um you
guys should know how this works let me
show you guys how this works what this
does is this show modal its value is
whatever you click so its value is
either going to be ok or cancel so
you're going to say alright if this
value when you click a button is equal
to okay and only two okay then I want to
store that variable whatever they typed
in if it's equal to cancel then you can
just forget about it then I don't want
to store it so that's how you store a
piece of text using WX Python in the
next story I'm going to be showing you
how to create a list like um not like a
check box but just like a list pretty
much and it's going to be awesome so
don't forget to check out my next
tutorial and I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
