illustration cs6 tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm gonna show you how to
create clipping masks or clipping paths
and what a clipping mask is is it's an
object whose shape mess out everything
except for the contents behind the shape
so what I've got here are the clipping
mask which is the the words are the
letters here and then I have the what
I'm gonna have as my masked object now
the clipping mask can only be a vector
and the masked object can be anything
that it wants so I'll show you what this
is so that makes a little more sense
select both of your objects go to object
and then clipping mask and then go to
make and then you can see now what a
clipping mask does I can move this
around and it's only gonna show what is
what was behind the clipping mask now
you can do this with gradients you can
do it with fill objects or anything like
that you can also do it with pictures so
I've got this wheat field here it's just
an image that I pulled out of my off my
computer and then this is just simple
text now you always have to remember
that the clipping mask has to be in
front so just to make sure that it is
you go to your layers panel and check
and make sure that it's on top select
both objects and then go to object
clipping mask and then make and now the
fill of my object is the actual clipping
mask that it was I move this around you
can see that it's not moving around the
picture and it just keeps whatever was
behind it so if you've been watching the
other tutorials you probably noticed
that the same way that we've been doing
stuff lately is going to and pressing
make so I would might assume that you
would want to hit release
to undo it and that is true and now you
can actually move this around to
wherever you want and go ahead and make
another clipping mask if you want so I
say you didn't have it in the right Pat
our part that from before there you go
let me go back let's undo that oh my bad
I hit the zoom tool I was wondering why
things were all wonky let me go to fit
the screen and I select that object
clipping mask release oh if you're not
sure what's behind your object a good
thing to do is lower its opacity that
way you can see what's actually behind
it when you're making your clipping mask
it's not too big too big of a deal when
I'm doing I like this but if you have
something that's like taking up a lot of
space and you can't really see what's
actually behind it you want to make sure
things are in the right spot this is the
way to do it just lower the opacity I go
to make and then the opacity as you can
see goes back up to a hundred you get
done doing it so that's all I'm gonna
have to I need to show you about
creating clipping masks actually there
is actually there is more I forgot about
editing the clipping set that you made
so once you create a clipping mask go in
here and you've got this clipping group
this is called a clipping set so let's
go ahead and edit that go to object
clipping mask edit contents now you want
to go ahead and grab your direct
selection tool you can grab this and
move it around so the clipping mask goes
to different parts of the area the only
problem with this is that you can't see
what you're moving around or where
you're moving to it's kind of like
guesswork you can also modify the
in path if it has actual shapes but this
is text um the other thing that that you
can do here is you can apply fill and
stroke to the clipping path
let's see they're not apply to that
apply to fill I didn't want to do it
Phil I wanted to do a stroke
let's switch them there we go and now
I've got a stroke around the edge so you
can do that when you're at in your
clipping mask so now that's all I wanted
to show you about clipping sets and
clipping masks and clipping paths
they're basically all one thing are all
about basically the same thing so thanks
a lot for watching look forward to
seeing you guys in the next tutorial
that I make</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
