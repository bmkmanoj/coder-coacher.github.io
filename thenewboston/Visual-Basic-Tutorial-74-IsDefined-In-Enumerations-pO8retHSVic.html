slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're gonna be
taking another look at enumerations so
let's go ahead and open up the projects
from last time it is the one the sports
analyzer that has the two list boxes and
analyzed sport so what we're gonna learn
in this tutorial is how to check and see
if a certain value is defined in an
enumeration so the way we do this is
let's come out here to button analyse
click we're going to add some code here
so we're gonna declare a boolean value
up here so we'll just type dim is define
bool as boolean and we'll go ahead and
set that equal to false and now what
we're gonna do is let's say below this
one we're going to we're going to show a
message box and see if a certain
enumeration value is defined so the way
we do this is we're going to type well
instead of assigning it down there let's
go ahead and sign assign it up here so
it's divine bool as boolean and we'll
set that equal to system the system
namespace dot enum the enumeration class
dot is defined now is defined will take
two arguments so the first one is the
enumeration and the in the enumeration
type so what we're going to do is we're
going to type get type so it returns the
system type object from the specified
type name so we're just going to get the
type of sports and now what we're gonna
do is we are gonna put a value in so
check to see if this value is defined so
we'll just type in baseball
and so this should give us a value of
true so I'll just type message box dot
show is defined bool dot to string okay
so now if we go ahead and run this here
is our program let's go ahead and pick a
sport here we'll pick basketball click
analyze sport and it says true let's see
all the way hello
let's pick baseball and it's true yeah
so I'm sorry about that
yeah it'll say true no matter which one
you select because it's not checking
what we've selected there so basically
what it does is the system is I saw in
them that is defined so it's the the
function is defined or the method we
pass the type of the sports enumeration
into it by using get type and then we
check to see if baseball is defined now
if we do something like I let's do
soccer so if we check to see if soccer
is defined we can go ahead and pick
anything in here it'll still give us the
same answer each time click analyze
sport and it gives us a value of false
because soccer is not part of our an
enumeration so um this is very simple
you may not find a need for it at the
moment
but you probably will later on so it's a
good thing to know
and every time you learned something
even if you not gonna use it right away
it's always good to know it in case you
need it so thanks for watching guys and
stay tuned for the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
