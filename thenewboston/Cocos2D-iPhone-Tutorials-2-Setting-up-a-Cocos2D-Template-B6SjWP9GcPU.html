watching my first sorrow you probably
noticed that my dump screen recorder
just decided to cut me off in the middle
of my tutorial so i guess i will finish
talking about what i want to teach you
guys in this tutorial so what did we
talk about unless sauriol basically what
we did is we downloaded the file that we
needed and we opened a project that
already existed and viewed a bunch of
samples but my guess is you just don't
want to download this to view a bunch of
samples for the rest of your life you
actually want to create a project on
your own and use this framework as an
addition to enhance your games so there
are two different ways we can go about
this one is really hard and confusing
and one is easy if you want to do it
really confusing and hard what you can
do is you can go ahead and build your
project in normal Xcode and then include
the file separately the cocos2d files
you want and then integrate them all
weird like or the easier way to do this
is just a setup cocos2d templates and
then use these templates to build your
games right from them don't know what
I'm talking about we'll listen to this
go ahead and your finder and let's see
if I can find this go ahead into your
like I don't know applications right
there and go to utilities and now double
click your terminal to open it and what
I like to do is actually when it's on
your dock right here just click right
click it and press options keeping dog
so now you have returned mental in your
dock whenever you need it but anyways
check this out well every directory here
in now you don't want to be in that
directory so do I don't really want to
get into talking you guys about how to
use the terminal but what you need to do
is you need to change the location of
where this terminal is pointing to the
folder itself so CD means change
directory so go ahead and press CD from
wherever you're at just as soon as your
terminal opens then press space
now if you know the file path to where
you have your folder stored on your
computer you can just go ahead and type
that in like whatever / user / Bucky but
there's an easier way to do this and
this is why I store the file and my
desktop so check this out just go ahead
and grab your folder after you press CD
space and drag it in your terminal in a
release and whenever you drag anything
in your terminal what it's going to do
is it's going to create the path for
this and just paste it in there so now
what you want to do is press ENTER and
now you see the path has changed from a
white blue 1942 to cocos to the iphone
your folder so now you are looking at
pretty much a terminal is this before
they had a bunch of cool icons and stuff
for the computers and folders people had
to do everything from just txt space so
this is pretty much go back in time it's
pretty much everything is pretty much
your text based computer so anyways
that's your background on the terminal
so now we are at the folder right now so
what we need to do from here is do one
simple well it actually isn't a simple
but it's one command now follow on
closely and if you miss what I'm saying
or if you forget a character I'm
actually going to be posting this in the
description box below so you can just go
ahead and copy and paste this in but
anyways here's what you need to do press
period /i NS ta ll install minus
templates dot SH and then you need to
press spacebar and pres- you I think the
stands for user and go ahead and press
Enter now it says it's going to do that
for me because I already ran this
program once but it should run through a
list of it just is just going to look
like the matrix or something and it's
going to install a bunch of stuff on
your computer and when it is installed
it's going to say
you know arm installed successfully or
something like that but anyways that's
what you need to do you need to change
your directory to wherever your folder
is like I showed you how and then once
you're in that directory you need to
install your templates using this
command and again i'm going to be
posting this under my description in
case you know you accidentally put back
/ instead of forward slash or underscore
instead of minus or something but
anyways you're saying alright that's
installed what the heck that I just do
is that even going to help me check this
out go ahead and open Xcode and go ahead
and press create new project now you
know how you had your Mac os10
applications in your iPhone applications
and libraries before check this out now
under user templates you go ahead and
click cocos2d and o.m.g we now have a
bunch of sweet templates we can use so
just go ahead and choose this and go
ahead and name untitled two or something
and go ahead and name it whatever you
want and check this out it automatically
includes everything you need so it takes
away all the pain of having to do this
every time we create a project so as I
said before there are two different ways
to do this you can go ahead and create
your normal project which is all this
stuff and then drag the folders and you
need or you can just do this one time in
any time now for the rest of your life
you want to create a cocos2d application
just go ahead and select the template
how awesome is that I said save you a
bunch of time I can save you a bunch of
money on car insurance Iration it's kind
of corny but anyways so that's all we
need to do so if you want to make sure
everything's working just go ahead and
highlight your project click build and
run and all the templates by default
they just give you a basic hello world
so you shouldn't get any issues or any
warnings with this because it's just
your basic template you shouldn't change
anything right now so that's your splash
screen and um look this hello world pops
up and another thing I want to teach you
guys is check the
so you see this little icon right here
and when you click it well it art it's
already loaded but a little splash
screen pops up and this isn't part of
the tour oh just some extra because I
have some extra time on tell you under
your resources you have two files one is
named icon with the capital i dot PNG
what this does is it gives you a custom
icon on your main screen pretty much you
you know the icon you click the open
your program in default ping whenever
your program is loading but it's not
ready yet this is called a splash screen
and any time you want to add a splash
screen to your application just include
a file named default ping with a capital
D and you know you don't have to include
any code in it in not your app delegates
or anything like that the first thing
your iphone does when it opens an
application is it looks for this file no
coding included so anytime you want a
splash screen you saying all right
where'd I put the code for that no code
whatsoever so there's a neat little tip
on how to get icons and a splash screens
but hopefully my dumb screen recorder
didn't cut me off this tutorial and now
you know how to create templates and
again if you want that little line of
code installed templates the sh- you all
included under my description so just go
ahead and copy that so you don't mess
anything up but anyways now that we got
our templates we can actually begin
coding I know you had to wait to the
third store to actually write some code
but I'm sorry you know I'm actually not
sorry I just that's the way it is that's
life so uh I hope you enjoyed this
tutorial thank you guys for watching
over get check out my form either if you
have any questions and uh yeah that's
all i gotta say i will see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
