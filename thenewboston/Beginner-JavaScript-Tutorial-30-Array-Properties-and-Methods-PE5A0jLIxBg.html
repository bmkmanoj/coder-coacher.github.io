your 30th tutorial and like I said
before arrays are indeed objects and
since they are objects and that we know
objects have properties and methods does
this mean arrays have properties and
methods well yes it does so let me give
you an example of both the first thing
we need to do is obviously create an
array so let's go ahead and create an
array called dudes and it will just set
this equal to new all right and we'll
make this the easy way and we'll just go
ahead and put like Bucky arm Dan for Dan
Henderson and Randy for Randy Couture if
you know who this people are then let me
know thumbs up so we go ahead and we
made an array so let's go ahead and take
a look at some of the properties there
are several built-in properties but
probably the most common property that
you're going to use when working with
array is the length now the length
property is just a number telling you
how many items are in your array so
document rights of course put the name
of your array which is dudes and in
order to access the property just like
anything else when working with objects
use the dot separator and the name of
the property which is length now if you
want to take a look at all the
properties then there's probably a web
site you can go to but like I said the
length one is it's basically the only
one I ever used when programming and
it's the one that you're going to use
most commonly so you see right here it
says three because I have Bucky Dan and
Randy there are three elements that's
all it does so we know that array has
properties such as length but what
exactly are the methods associated with
this object I mean how many different
things can we do to an array well in
order to use some of the methods you
typically need another array and that is
because a lot of the methods deal with
either combining the arrays or adding
one or a to another one or sorting
through an array so let's go ahead and
create another array right now so we can
go ahead
and take a look at an example so we
already have a array called dudes let's
go ahead and make another Reiko chicks
and set equal to new easy caps like new
array and set this equal to three girl
names um Lisa um Aaron and also Hannah
so now we have two arrays dude and
chicks
so the first method I want to show you
it's probably the easiest method to
understand is called the concat and I
think that is short for concatenate and
pretty much does this it takes two
arrays and adds them together and it
creates an entirely new array so let's
go ahead and create a new array called
people and we're going to set this equal
to it's pretty much going to combine
this array with this array but you're
saying alright how do I know what order
combines men and how the elements are
listed well it's going to take one array
and stick it on the end of another array
so what array do you want to be at the
beginning so I want dudes to be at the
beginning and in order to use this
method again use the dot separator which
is concat and as your parameter you list
what array do you want to stick on the
end of this and I want chicks to be on
the end of this so what this is going to
do is is going to take the dude's array
and stick chicks on the end of it so now
we have a new array called people with
six different elements in it Bucky Dan
Randy Lysa Arryn Hannah that's our brand
new array stored in people so we already
created that so let's just go ahead and
print out something on the screen like
document dot write and let's just go
ahead and write the last element of
people
and that would be the fifth because
remember this is index 0 1 2 3 4 5 so
this should if I'm correct print out
Hana and check it out it did just like
that so now you're saying all right I
get the idea of concat but what if I
wanted this array first and this one
second well all you'd have to do is take
that chicks and add dude to the end of
it or dudes excuse me and now Randy
would be the last element so let's go
ahead and refresh and check it out Randy
so that's an example of one method that
we can use when we take a look at arrays
so now I just wanted to stress in this
tutorial that arrays are indeed objects
and every objects or excuse me every
object has properties such as the length
and it also has methods that you can use
and we took a look at one method which
is concat and all concat does is it
takes two arrays sticks them together
and puts it into a brand new array so
pretty cool huh so that is what I want
to talk to you guys about in this story
in the next tutorial I'm going to be
talking more about some other array
methods and they're going to be a lot
more useful and trust me there's a lot
to learn when it comes to writing
methods so you definitely don't want to
miss out on it so thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and I'll
see you guys in next door Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
