pygame tutorial and in the last tutorial
I showed you guys how to make user
events so if they pressed a key down key
left key right up down then I take that
ball and move it in either direction but
what we also want to happen is if they
lift up their finger from that key then
we want the ball to stop moving so we
need an event for this if we don't then
they're just gonna hit a key and when
they lift it up the ball is gonna keep
moving in that direction and we probably
don't want that so what we need to do is
make a simple um else statement let me
move this up and we just this so you can
see a little better so we have if event
type equals key down but we also want to
say if it if they lift the key up then
for it to stop moving so if event type
is exactly equal to KI up then what we
want to do is take all of these and set
them equal to zero so let me just copy
that and there we go and now just change
all of these values from negative one
plus one just change them all to zero
zero zero zero zero so that was easy
enough and now I got a wrist size this
once again so I could show you guys what
I'm about to do next and even
earth-sized a little more that's
embarrassing so now that we have um all
right this is getting annoying and there
we go
there oh my god
sure good all right enough all right now
that we have our basic loop built what
we can do is add some functionality to
our program so let's go ahead and make
sure that this is line up right under
the fourth in your main limb event loop
so right about there so what we want to
do is tell our program where the
coordinates need to be so we need the
x-coordinate and again this is the
coordinate of the mouse or that little
red ball not the background so X is
equal to move X and Y is equal to move Y
aka movie so the next thing we want to
do is book background in the mouse on
the screen so screen equals bullet and
this means just add the pretty much add
the background in the mouse to the
screen so again what do we want to add
the screen the background and what do we
want the coordinates to be zero zero and
after this what do we want to add this
screen can't type mouse underscore C and
this is just the ball and what do we
want the coordinates of this to be we
want it to be that x and y and now you
can finally see what's going on pi game
displayed update and actually I'm gonna
run this for you guys and then I'm gonna
tell you guys why exactly this works and
I'll promise it'll clear it up for you
as long as I don't got any errors so
let's go ahead and run this module and
hopefully everything works out like it
does and as you can see starts out in
corner let me press it right on my
keyboard down up left up left see I'm
just pressing all the buttons on my
keyboard right now
not my mouse at all you can see my mouse
cursors right here so that's the basics
of what we just built now let me explain
you guys why this works um pretty much
the key is right here you know what we
did up here
and when we bleed the image to the
background this is pretty much all you
need to know right here because this is
crucial what it says is copy whatever
this position is in these coordinates
the x coordinate and the y coordinate so
every time you um scroll this down every
time you press left the coordinates
change by negative one and the x axis
every time you press right they change
by positive one on the x axis every time
you press up it changed by negative one
causes it to go up every time press down
changes it by negative that and what
this does right here is just allows you
to whenever you um lift up on your key
it doesn't keep adding coordinates to it
so that's why I needed zero in for
saying all right how does that equal
this well every time all that looks for
is the X&amp;amp;Y coordinates so here's your x
coordinate right here so every time you
have positive one that equals move X in
equals positive one and it changes that
x coordinate by positive one and every
time you have something like a negative
one it changes that y coordinate by
negative one so it's a lot easier just a
look at for five seconds then I could
even explain but pretty much every time
you change the coordinates get new
coordinates then it spits them out press
another key change coordinates get new
coordinates spit them out so that is
your basics of an event and again
every single event and PI game has a
type
pretty much anything the user does has a
type so what we do is find that type
finally what they did and find the key
of what they did and then put an event
to go along with their event and just a
copy all this code right here if you
follow it along with me then it's going
to be a lot easier and once you learn
the basics of events then you're ready
to move on in my next tutorial and it's
a lot more useful when we add something
besides moving a ball around the screen
but this is your basics of how to
interact with the you
pretty much so um pretty much just pay
attention in these coordinates hopefully
you understand it better than I could
explain it but anyways thank you guys
for watching in the next tutorial I'm
Lee oh I don't know what I never know
what I'm gonna be doing next tutorial I
just follow my heart so thank you guys
for watching and don't forget to
subscribe and I will see you next time
or we continue developing our awesome
game</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
