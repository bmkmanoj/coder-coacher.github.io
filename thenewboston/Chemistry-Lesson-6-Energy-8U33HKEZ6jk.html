welcome to your six tutorial in
chemistry and in this tutorial we're
going to be talking about one of my
favorite things whoo energy look at that
looks mystifying it's actually a pretty
awesome topic so anyways I know before I
said that energy is basically what
little kids get when they drink Mountain
Dew but it does have a formal definition
and that is the ability to do work so I
know that you probably work with a lot
of people before or maybe you know some
people in school that do not have a lot
of energy that means that they do not
have the ability to do work and we all
know people like that but it gets a
little bit more technical whenever we're
talking about chemistry
so basically energy comes in two main
forms I mean it comes in a lot of
different forms that you and me may be
familiar with like wind energy solar
light heat we talk about electrical
energy a lot especially now that we're
using computers and smart phones but
what chemists did is they kind of needed
a way to classify it in the two main
groups and energy is really hard when
you think about it to classify because
unlike matter it has a totally different
set of properties you can't see energy a
lot of the time you can't feel it you
can't pick up energy and say okay this
is what it is so they needed kind of a
weird system to classify it so what they
did is they put it in two main
categories that being kinetic and
potential okay this is kind of getting
weird now I know what solar energy is an
electrical energy but what the heck is
kinetic and potential I heard a
potential before but what the heck okay
let me go ahead and explain first let me
go ahead and explain kinetic energy the
main I don't want to say the main
category but it's the more interest in
category I'll give that kinetic energy
is defined as energy of motion okay go
on an example of this would be like
throwing a rock at your brother the
harder you throw that rock in the faster
that rock is going going the more energy
that rock is going to have so basically
when ever you have something that's
moving its going to have kinetic energy
so just remember that whenever things
are moving they have kinetic energy now
a couple cool rules that we may want to
remember first kinetic energy can be
transferred from one particle to another
what does this mean let me give you an
example instead of talking about little
particles and atoms let me go ahead and
give you a big example say you had a
baseball in your hand and there's a
glass bottle sitting on the sidewalk if
you took that baseball and you whipped
it at the glass bottle as soon as it hit
that bottle the kinetic energy or the
moving energy is going to be transferred
from the ball to the bottle and that is
why that bottle is either going to move
a little bit if you just threw it softly
or it's going to shatter if you threw
that ball really hard because the energy
from the baseball is going to be
transferred to that bottle causing the
bottle to move in one of two different
ways either shatter or just you know
roll around a little bit
so all that depends on how hard you
throw that baseball how much energy is
in that baseball now this last level
thing says can also be converted into
other types of energy so we can take
kinetic energy and it can be transferred
into other types for example if we have
kinetic energy like wind energy we can
make windmills and wind turbines and
convert that the wind energy to
electrical energy same things if you
live next to a dam or if you ever saw a
hydroelectric generator then they pretty
much take the moving water the kinetic
energy from the water or river and
transfer it into electrical energy so
basically through kinetic energy we can
convert one form of energy to another
pretty cool what we're most interested
in is usually converting it to
electrical energy because you know
electrical energy is pretty cool you can
use a it for stuff like looking at
youtube videos go to the New Boston comm
going to Justin dot TV slash the New
Boston that's pretty much all you would
use it for I can't think of anything
else at the moment but that's pretty
much what everyone in the world is
working towards going to my awesome
website so anyways you sent
kinetic energy is energy in motion I
understand that why is there even
another kind of energy it doesn't make
sense well let me go ahead and explain
that potential energy is the different
side of the coin it's stored energy
whenever you have potential energy let
me go ahead and give you example if you
have a bullet there is a lot of energy
in that bullet before you fire it of
course we know there's a lot of energy
as it's going through the air and you
know before it is a deer or person or
whatever the heck you're shooting at but
before you fire it and you have that
bullet in your hand there's a lot of
energy in there it just hasn't been
converted into kinetic energy yet so we
call this energy that hasn't yet been
converted into the kinetic energy
potential energy it's pretty much the
potential to become kinetic energy so
another thing is that you may be a
little bit more familiar with this
hopefully I'm not too familiar but your
body also you'd a lot utilizes potential
energy whenever you eat food you store
that energy in your body which is in the
form of fat you know you may be more
familiar with that it stores in
different ways but mostly fat in that
way we don't have to eat constantly we
can store that energy in our body in
whenever our body needs energy to do
it's different stuff we can just go
ahead and use that fat and some people
are really really good at storing
potential energy if you know what I mean
so to sum it up well I don't want to
someone up is I forgot I have to talk
about temperature so temperature is one
of the ways that we can measure the
kinetic energy of air particles I know
you can't see this but there are a bunch
of tiny little atoms in the air there's
like oxygen like string hopefully to you
know some helium maybe hopefully not too
many harmful ones but there's a bunch of
oxygen let's just say and those oxygen
particles are moving around zipping
around the air really fast they have a
lot of kinetic energy and the faster
they move the more kinetic energy they
have so therefore
the higher the temperature so we're
going to talk about temperature later on
but I just wanted to touch on that now
because temperature
whenever you say okay how hot is it
outside that's how you usually think of
temperature but what you're actually
doing is you're measuring the kinetic
energy of the particles in the air
pretty crazy huh so anyways that's
basically all there is to cover with
energy for now again there's a lot more
concerning temperature and heat in
energy joules calories we're going to be
talking about all that stuff later on
but for now that's all you guys get so
thank you guys for watching and just
remember energy and matter are the two
things that make up the universe matter
is the stuff you can hold and feel and
energy is the stuff the power the force
you can't see it you can't pick it up
and hold it in your hands but it's there
I mean I guess probably if you took some
drugs maybe some magical mystical
mushrooms or some acid then you can
probably see it but most of us we can we
can't so we're stuck with this makeshift
diagram so anyways thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and I
will see you guys in the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
