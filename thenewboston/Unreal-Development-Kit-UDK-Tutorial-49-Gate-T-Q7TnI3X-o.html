49th tutorial in the UDK and in this
tutorial I'm gonna be teaching you guys
about something called a gate so in
order to use a gate as you can see I
deleted that little delay go ahead and
right-click new action in under
miscellaneous you're gonna have this
oxygen called a gate make sure you don't
choose the and gate that's something a
little bit different just go ahead and
choose normal gate now what a gate is it
basically represents a real-life gate so
it usually goes in between an event and
the action that you want to happen now
by default most of the time you're gonna
be able to walk right through your gate
and hit your action so for example
whenever we touch that light switch it's
going to go in the gate right out the
gate and it's going to turn on that
light so by default if we go ahead and
exit out of this right now and hit play
from here
we're gonna go hit that light switch
turn on the light just like normal
so we're saying alright that's kind of a
useless why would they even have gate in
there we'll check it out this gate also
has the option of being closed now if
you look at this just like real life and
this is a path if this gate is closed
whenever you touch this light switch
right here and try to get to this action
over here at this case closed you're
never going to be able to get this as
this action so if you're saying alright
so gate can be open and allow it's
passed through or closed and allowed the
event from ever hitting the action so
how do you close this gate
well this gate and all gates have a
variable called be open now if it's set
to true then your information is just
going to pass right through one side and
now the other just like normal however
if this be open is set to false then
that means your gate is closed so true
means your gates open and everything's
just running fine false means the gate
is closed and this event is never going
to kick off this action search saying
all right
makes sense so how do you close this
gate well there are a couple different
ways that you can close this gate
the most common way is to put an auto
close count and this means that your
gate automatically closes after it has
been activated a certain number of times
so let me go ahead and change this to
two or something like that you can
change it to three if you want or maybe
even four or five if you're in that you
know go ahead but anyways I'm just going
to go ahead and put two and what this
means is basically this is what's going
to happen in my game the users gonna hit
the light switch and since this is the
first time using the gate the light's
going to turn on just like normal the
next time the user is going to hit the
light switch and since this is a second
time using the gate the light's going to
turn on just like normal however the
third time the user tries to use the
gate is gonna say uh-huh my gate is
closed now so this light ain't turning
on house so let me go ahead and exit out
of that but before we do you're gonna
see what problem right now we have
functionality to turn on the light but
we don't have the functionality to turn
off the light so that may look a little
weird whenever you're playing our game
so go ahead and hit untouched and turn
off and now X out of this in our game
should work fine so go ahead and right
click play from here and check it out
first time I hit my switch one it's
gonna work fine now back away now the
second time I hit it - it's gonna work
fine back away now the third time I hit
up my gates closed so let me go ahead
and hit this umm not working I'm not
getting through that gate and that's why
my final action of the light turning on
never happens right here so that's
basically the beauty of a gate and again
this basically prevents things from
happening multiple times for example if
you only want the user to enter a
certain room like three times or you
only want an enemy to spawn five times
or something like that then this is what
you would use a gate so I think that's
all I might as well go over these
options real quick open opens the gate
close close the gates and toggle
that open and closed and again the
output is you know just like I said I
can't explain any better
so that is gate and in the next story
I'm probably going to be going over some
more common actions and kismet so thank
guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe and don't forget to send me
$1,000 on my donations button so thank
you guys I know I'll see in the next
