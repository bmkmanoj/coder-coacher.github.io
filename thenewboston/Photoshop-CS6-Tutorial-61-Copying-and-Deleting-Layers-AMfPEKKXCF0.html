Blackford here with another Photoshop
cs6 tutorial in this tutorial we're
going to learn how to duplicate and
delete layers so it seems pretty easy
and it is but it's a basic that you need
to know and able to are in order to work
quickly in Photoshop there's a couple
ways that you can duplicate a layer and
duplicating a layer is good in case you
need want to add in effect with a
blending mode on top of your original
layer or you want to edit a photo in a
non-destructive fashion aka not messing
the original up but then you can like
work on the other one so it's a has its
uses and I personally use duplicating
layers all the time
the first way that you can duplicate a
layer is to select a layer and I make
your active layer go to the layer
options and click on duplicate layer
then you can put in the name and
basically here's your other options you
can make a new destination but just keep
it in your original document if you want
to keep it there obviously so I'm gonna
hit OK and that created a duplicate
layer for me exactly the same so another
way you can do this is by dragging your
active layer over the create a new layer
button and then I'll create a duplicate
again for you I'm just going to show you
how to delete these layers now down here
at the bottom there is a trash can and
that is the delete layer button you can
have your active layer selected and
click on that and I'll you'll be able to
delete the layer yes or you can drag on
top of the trashcan and then it will
also go there is a couple cool tricks
with deleting layers that I want to show
you you can delete hidden layers in the
layers panel if you go to your layer
options there is
delete hidden layers button and that
would delete any layer that you have
hidden and if you want to delete any
layers that are just empty and clogging
up space in your in your layers panel
you can go to the file menu and then we
can go to scripts and then delete all
empty layers and that will delete all
the empty layers for you so that's all
there is to know about duplicating
layers and deleting layers and it's
simple enough tutorial but it's a basic
that everybody needs to know so thanks
for watching and I look forward to
seeing you guys in the next tutorials</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
