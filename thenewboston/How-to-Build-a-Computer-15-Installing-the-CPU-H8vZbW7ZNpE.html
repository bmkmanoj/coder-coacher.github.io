that's the underside of it with all the
pins and this is the and this is the top
of it
that's what you that's what needs to be
on top these pins fit into these holes
now on let me hold us so you guys can
see on your processor you're gonna have
a little arrow on one side huh I don't
know if you can see it but there's a
little gold arrow on one side and
there's also on your socket there's a
little arrow on one of these corners
what you want to do is take where your
arrows are on our CPU and line them up
with the arrow on your socket so here's
how you put in this little lever right
here you're gonna want to take this
you're gonna want to pick it up and what
this does is it frees your socket take
your CPU set it in gently so that all
the pins line up please please do not
drop it in once your processor in the is
into place you're gonna want to go ahead
and close this bar right here it's kind
of tight so make sure it's nice and snug
and tuck it under this little tab right
here this is going to make sure that
your processor is locked in place and
it's ready to go
so now that we install it our processor
the next thing that we want to do is
install our processor fan so I'll put
that in next door door</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
