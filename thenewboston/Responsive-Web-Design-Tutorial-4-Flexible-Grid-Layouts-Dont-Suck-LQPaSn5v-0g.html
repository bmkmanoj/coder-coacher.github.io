tutorial what I want to do is I want to
show you guys how to make a flexible
grid layout and it's probably the most
important tutorial in the series because
after you watch this and after you
understand it it's actually really easy
to understand but after you understand
it you're going to know like 90% of how
to make responsive websites so with that
being said let's go ahead and get
started now I deleted all those divs
from the last row inside the body and I
also cleared out the CSS file so what
I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be
making a menu bar at the top and it can
actually have as many buttons as you
want on it but I'm just going to show
you guys how to do with four buttons
because I know it's the first thing that
came to mind so I'm going to make div
and I'm going to make the main class
first called menu bar now of course this
is just going to be one element and it's
going to sit at the top of your website
or I can even sit at the bottom or the
side wherever and all my buttons are
going to go in here now each of my
buttons is going to be its own div and
they're all going to have the class of
button so we'll make four different ones
what do we usually have buttons for run
website home button is usually the first
one and for all right so I have a home
button first and then it will have like
a I know we'll have a button so you can
look at your friends my profile and
we'll say this is a room so we'll say a
section for my videos so this is all the
main page is going to consist of pretty
simple stuff so now let's hop over in
your CSS and learn how to style it to
make it flexible or responsive so the
first thing I want to do is actually
just style this main menu bar not going
to be adding any actual responsive
properties I just want to give it some
styling so we can see what's going on
distinguish it from
the rest of the elements so I'll just
put the text color is going to be white
since I'm going to be making the buttons
of color so black font might show up
kind of weird on it and I also like to
center align all the text on the main
menu bar so this way we don't have to do
on every single individual button so now
the only other thing we have to do is
actually style these buttons right here
so of course the class was button now
since our background is white and we
want to actually see these buttons we
need to give these a background I'll
just make it 7 7 7 7 7 7 this is kind of
like a light gray kind of like an
average gray now for the width remember
we never want to use pixels what we want
to use is a percentage now we have 4
buttons 1 2 3 4 so what we could do is
we could give each of these a percentage
of 25 and it'll be fine
however if we do that what's going to
happen is they're going to have no space
in between them they're going to be four
buttons butted up right up against each
other nice and tight so it's going to
look like one main one long button
instead of four individual buttons so
instead of giving each of these a width
of 25 what I want to do is I want to
give them a width of 24 percent and then
I'm going to add spacing of 1% on each
side 1 so how do we do that well let's
go ahead and give them a margin of 0.5
percent so what this does is it sets the
top in the bottom margin just to zero
just what it was by default and it gives
you a left of half a percent in the
right of half a percent so the main
width of 24 percent plus 1/2 on the left
of and 1/2 on the right that gives 25%
to each button so now we have 4
individual buttons and also they have
some padding in between them and I don't
want to say padding because that's
something else they have
space in between them so now the only
other thing I want to do is I want to
float these to the left and that'll just
make sure that they appear to the left
and right and step stacked on top of
each other so now let me save this and
refresh and check this out we now have
four buttons one two three four and they
each have a width of 24% so what what
ever this parent is we shrink this so
you guys can see it
whatever this main parent is each of
those take up 24% and also may be kind
of hard to see but there is pretty much
1% space in between each one now the
cool thing about this is no matter how
big or how small we shrink they're not
fixed in stone as they would be with
pixels since we gave them a percentage
it doesn't matter how big or how small
this window is they adapt perfectly
unlike my crappy website that I showed
you guys in the very first video so that
is how you make a menu bar or any grid
design that you want flexible responsive
adaptable frickin beautiful so again the
one thing you have to watch out for is
this is perfect for a four button layout
and you can of course tweak it as long
as it adds up to 25% however whenever
you have something like I don't know
three buttons or five buttons or six
buttons you always want to adjust these
values so that whenever you add up all
your buns they add up to 100% so that's
something you got to look out for other
than that your device is going to take
care of all the hard work or all of the
calculations it's going to always give
you a nice looking website so in
upcoming tutorials what I'm going to do
is I'm going to show you guys how to
work with images they're a little bit
tricky sometimes and also you know how
we saw in the first example when we get
to a certain width what happens is these
buttons can stack on top of each other
so we'll say all right once you have
like less than 600 pixels with
only put two buttons on each row I'll
show you guys how to change that in the
upcoming tutorials but for now that
ladies and gentlemen is how you make a
cool flexible grid responsive web design
layout whatever you want to call it but
I think you guys for watching don't
forget subscribe and I'll see you guys
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
