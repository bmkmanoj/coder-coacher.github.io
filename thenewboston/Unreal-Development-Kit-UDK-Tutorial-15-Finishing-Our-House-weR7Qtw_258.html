tutorial and in this tutorial I'm
finally gonna be finishing up the basic
shape of our house so once we finished
the basic shape we can begin learning
about other fun stuff but for now this
house needs a roof so what I'm going to
be doing is what I could do before is
just copy the floor and drag it up but
remember we added that porch extension
so we need to account for that whenever
we're creating the roof so what I'm
gonna do is change my grid size to 32
for easier measuring and I'm gonna
measure the new length of our house and
let's see what it is sixteen hundred so
that's the new length that we need our
roof to be and I already remember from
whenever we created our floor that it's
1024 it's 1024 in this direction wide so
let's go ahead and make our roof right
here using the red builder brush hop out
of cylinder if you're still in that and
for the cube but just go ahead and right
select that and as you can see the Y
property is the length so we want to
change Y to 1600 we want to change Z Z
is gonna be the thickness so change that
to 32 and for X X is the width so go
ahead and change that to 1024 and now
that we got that set up go ahead and
click build and X out of that so now all
you have to do is position this red
builder brush over our house precisely
so let's go ahead and position that
exactly where it needs to be and also
pull it up so it's right on top of our
house right like that and now all we
have to do is add some mass and get that
red builder brush out of the way so now
as you can see in our perspective view
we now have a beautiful roof but our
house looks more like ice cream shop or
a museum than a house so one thing that
we can do is we need to add a pitched
roof so in order to make this polygon
kind of more triangular let's hop over
to geometry mode and remember like I
said anytime I work with the geometry
mode I like to hop over in brush
wireframe mode it gives me a better idea
of what I'm looking at
so hop over to brush wireframe mode and
go ahead and hop into geometry mode and
this lets us at all the vertexes all the
polygons and stuff like that so i'm
gonna be teaching you guys is how to
make this really quick and easy
triangular so what we're gonna be doing
is i'm gonna be selecting this edge in
its I know it's gonna be a pain in the
butt since I'm recording this right
there it only took me two tries it
usually takes me about 87 so what we're
gonna be doing now that we have this
edge selected we're gonna hit this
button right here split what this does
is it takes that edge and it splits it
directly in the middle it pretty I mean
I can't explain it as good as you guys
can see it so that's what it's doing
it's taking the shape and it's splitting
it so it gives us a bunch of new
vertices to work with so now what we can
do if we go in the side view which is
actually the front well let me go ahead
and move this out of the way a little
more so now what we can do if we go in
the side view which is actually the
front of our building is we can select
these vertices and remember if we select
this top vertex it actually selects both
these vertices as we can see in the
perspective view and now all we have to
do is move these up so move them up
until you get a nice look and picture on
your roof I think that looks pretty good
go ahead and check it out in side view
and also in perspective view and
actually let's go ahead and hop out in
geometry mode and into camera mode
before you do something we don't want to
actually turn this into unlit mode and
remember you don't see any changes right
now because you didn't rebuild your
geometry so if we go ahead and build our
geometry again and close this we now see
those changes
pretty cool huh so one thing that we
could do after this is I want to make
sure that my lighting is centered so
let's go ahead and center that light and
actually I just moved my window so
actually my lighting looks pretty good
right now so let's go ahead and test our
our final level of course we didn't add
any textures and stuff yet but for this
sake of this tutorial
I'm
go ahead and say this is final and it
says lighting needs to be rebuilt you
sob so let's go ahead and build all and
it's gonna go ahead and build my
lighting it's probably gonna take like
20 seconds or so so yeah so anyways
there is a UFC tonight that was pretty
cool
Frank Mir be really nice and and anyway
he's nothing me talking let's go ahead
and play this level so go ahead and play
from here and now we get there play our
new level in our shiny new house so
check it out there's a little lighting
issue outside the house and if we want
to we can go ahead and fix that by doing
this in our top view remember I know I
didn't talk to you guys about lighting
or anything yet but anytime you want to
copy something just go ahead and hold
alt and drag again like I said this is
not a lighting tutorial just for the
sake of this tutorial I want to light up
the outside so if you want to copy your
lighting just go ahead and select the
light that you already added hold down
alt and drag and slide this one to
outside so then our entire house is lit
up and of course we need to rebuild all
and as I say there's a UFC tonight and
rampage one rampage beat who do Matt
Hamill and okay nothing be talking and
close that was just little filler talk
to keep you guys entertained while my
lights were building and now check it
out our house is perfectly lit up inside
and out oh nice pillars wonder who
installed them pretty cool huh
so there you have our basic 3d model
that's all I'm gonna be doing one that
comes the basic 3d modeling in the next
tutorial I'm gonna be covering textures
and a bunch of other fun stuff so now
that you have a basic shape model it's
ready to move on to next ceftaz Orioles
expand our knowledge even more so for
now thank you guys for watching and
don't forget to save your file I'm
actually gonna save mine right here and
I guess I'll see you guys in the next
