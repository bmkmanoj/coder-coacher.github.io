Blackford here with another after note
Photoshop cs6 tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm going to show you how to
mess around with your windows so you can
work on multiple windows at the same
time if you if you would like and how to
arrange them in a couple different ways
so it's going to be like what I have on
my screen now so usually when you start
it's going to be just a bunch of tabs so
to be able to move these tabs around you
can click on it pull out and don't be
perverted guys and put in the tab into
this area where it turns blue and I'll
just come back into tabs alternately you
can come up to the window here go to
arrange and consolidate all to tabs and
as you can see before when I went to
arrange it has a bunch of different ways
that you can set up different image and
windows so if I click on two up vertical
it's going to put two of them
side-by-side now I'll just open up
another something that I had on here
let's go open up this one and it's just
going to open up in another tab within
one of these windows but go to window
now I can start working with these
different vertical or three sets of
three here so three up stacked and I
might going to work like this way now
when I use something like when I use my
zoom tool and I go to zoom all windows
you can see everything will zoom at the
same time and you can see it a little
better than when you just have like tabs
so that's how you mess around with those
windows there you can take these also
and drag them to the corners of like the
windows so if I go over here you can see
now that a blue line
and shown up and I just tried to point
with my finger to show you guys where it
is but obviously you can't see that so
that's goofy and let go of it and it'll
put it in that area for you so that's
nice so go to window arrange consolidate
all the tabs to get it back word is now
you can float your windows out if you
would like so you can either pull them
out and let go and I'll float a window
out like this let's put it back and you
can also come down here to float in
window if you would like and that just
does the same exact same exact thing so
I'm going to put these back in the tabs
again every time I do that just go to
arrange consolidate all to tabs so
that's cool and when you're doing these
different arranges and stuff like that
you can come down here to match the zoom
of each one that the location and a
rotation or all if you would like so
I'll click on match zoom now everything
is zoomed in at a hundred percent so we
can look down here in the bottom left
you can see hundred percent 100 percent
100 percent and you can also see how far
it zoomed in by this we're right above
where my mouse is it says at a hundred
percent so that's also zoom you can see
that so sometimes when you're working
and you're doing something such as
retouching an image you need to like
zoom in and work with the image all
zoomed in but you also want to see it
zoomed out so you can see how it looks
in the final quality so you can create
another image window based on the same
exact window or based on it's the same
exact document that you have open so I
might as well just do that instead of
like clapping my Josh
I'll just show you guys so have whatever
you want to open up selected go to
arrange new window for and then whatever
the image is called that you have and
it'll create another image for you and
then I could make this smaller if I
wanted to to to work on this so if I
like need to zoom in here on the shirt I
want to zoom all windows on again I
don't want to zoom this out so if you
take a look at her shirt here I'm going
to just do some mess around with it and
maybe I'll just erase it it actually
works on the final image so you can work
on this and I'll do the same thing to
this so that's pretty nice if you got to
work and zoom in on something to get the
work done so that's about it for working
with multiple windows and multiple
documents pretty pretty sweet when
you're working I guess when you're
working in documents you can hold down
control and press tab to quickly switch
between the different documents which is
a pretty nice I guess
and one last thing I want to show you is
how to move layers between your
documents so I'll set up my windows so
that we can see a decent amount of of
our work that we're working on so I got
three up stacked here and I'll click on
this one and I have text here that I
want to move over to this layer so click
on your move tool here grab the text and
click on it and drag it over to the
other area that I want and that way the
text will automatically just get copied
over onto the scene so that's very handy
and P
we use it all the time so yeah now we're
done with the using the different layers
or using the different windows and
working in multiple windows so thanks
for watching this one give it a thumbs
up if you liked our thumbs down if you
hated it and subscribe for more
Photoshop tutorials that will be coming
up soon thanks for watching everybody
and have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
