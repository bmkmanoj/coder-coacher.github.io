dorg and this is another video tutorial
for the new Boston now in this tutorial
I'm going to be talking about
object-oriented programming in PHP and
specifically constructors now we've
already looked at we've already looked
at the basics of classes method
properties extending extending classes
and also using constants so these
constructors that I talked about now are
is basically a method inside of your
class that will automatically run when
you initiate a new instance of your
class so let's go ahead and create an
example so I'm going to create a class
called example and inside here I'm not
going to have any properties I'm just
going to have a method and this method
is going to be sorry public function say
something ok and inside of here we're
going to echo something so you already
know that if we were to come down here
and create a new instance of our class
by using new example like that about the
ethicist so we've created our class
example we've created a method called
say something which says something
literally we've created a new instance
of our of our class and we refresh
nothing's actually going to happen
because what we haven't done is we
haven't said example say something like
that so let's refresh and see and it
says oh no ok say something ok yes sorry
I haven't included the greater than sign
there let's refresh and it says
something now what happens for one or
more reason if you want this method or
some predefined you know a predefined
block of code to run as soon as you
initiate or create a new instance of
your class so at the moment when we just
create a new instance of the class
nothing happens now we use something
called the
strucked now construct works the same
way as if you were declaring a method
although you write it like this so we've
got public function then we have two
underscores so you've got two
underscores there and then just
construct see that's turned blue my text
editor has turned that blue and then we
just put two parentheses on and we put a
block in there as well
now the construct can take arguments so
you can take arguments through your
example like this so I'll demonstrate
that in just a moment so let's go now
and we want to say this say something so
what's going to happen now is as soon as
our our class's initiated or or create a
new instance of it here we're going to
run whatever is inside this construct so
what we're going to do is we're going to
be calling the method say something so
now that we've just created a new
instance of this let's go and refresh
the page and you can see that we get
something so just by adding this
constructor in here which is called a
constructor we are you know so we are
running or calling this method if you
like so what happens if we want to take
in parameters when we create a new class
for whatever reason we can specify them
here so I'm going to write text or in
fact I'm going to call it something so
in here this say something I'm now going
to say say something and I'm going to
say something and then here I'm going to
take a value something and I'm going to
echo out something so now you can see
when we refresh we've got a a missing
argument error because we haven't
defined anything in here if I was
defined say some text here and I refresh
you can see how we've passed by creating
our new and new instance of our object
or our class we've passed in this
variable here in our constructor because
remember
is run as soon as our program or our
class is initiated we've passed that to
our method say something now we've
picked this at what's been passed up
twice now back into say something and
we've echoed out so this is a slightly
delving into why it may be useful when
you initiate a new a new part of your or
a new instance of your class you can use
this constructor method to perform a
block of code that you want it to and
remember you can take in arguments as
well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
