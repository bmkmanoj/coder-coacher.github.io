tutorial that I'm making for them in
Boston and in this tutorial I'm gonna be
showing you how to use the streamwriter
class a little bit more so all you're
gonna need for this tutorial is two
buttons out of text box just exactly
what we had in the last tutorial and
you're also listening to have your
streamwriter open here and make sure
dispose of it now the first thing that
we're going to be looking at is writing
a single byte so we're just going to do
SW a screen right button and then inside
of here this calls for a byte value so
we're just going to need to give it a
value but we want it to write and
remember to represent hexadecimal and
c-sharp you're just going to put in 0 X
in front of it and then we're just gonna
wanna pull off by you what value you
want to write I'm just going to have it
right 0 0 so now we go here it's going
to debug open our text file right here
you just look at our text file right
here the first byte is 0-3 so let's
remember that now we click right now put
the 1 we go back here it should say 0 0
0 now if we wanted it to write these
bytes at a different position we're
going to do SW bass string dot position
and study equal to the position we'll
just have it write the value F 1/2 which
is the maximum value for a bite right
here and the offset is to be we're just
going to put 0 X to be right there
and then we're going to have it right
the maximum value is FF so now only bug
click right now at the offset to be you
should see the value F F yup to be up so
now we're going to take a look at
writing multiple bytes so in order to do
that we're just not to do the write
method and right here it calls for a
buffer or a byte array and then those
will be the values that is going to
right so we're just going to create a
bio right here I'll just call it buffer
and set it equal to some buttons and
we're going to have to be three bytes
inside of our body right we're going to
make a first one now no zero eight the
next one zero nine next one zero a
because instead of going eight nine ten
it goes eight nine ABC song so then
we're just going to not have it right
this buffer then it calls for the offset
which will be the element that it starts
at and this by dre right here or it's
going to have to start at this one so
it's going up at zero and then we're
going to want to have how many bytes you
want it to write it out of this byte
array we're just going to have it right
all of them or doesn't have a right all
three and since we specify the value to
the position of our writer to be at to
be the offset to be when we go over a
year you should see the values zero
eight right there zero nine and then
zero a it's written right along here
because we have these three bytes right
you want to write so now let me bug open
our text file click write should see
right there yep zero eight zero nine
zero a and that's exactly what we
specified right there so that's pretty
much it for this tutorial on using a
stream wider class just a little bit
more again we're just looking at writing
bytes so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
