tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
show you some mathematical operators so
all you're going to need for this
tutorial is a button and once you have
it on your form just go ahead and double
click on it alright so the first
mathematical operator that we're going
to be looking at is just addition so
adding two numbers together so we're
going to go ahead right here and create
two integers and say int a equals 5 and
int B equals 3 all right so the first
operator that said we were looking at it
was just addition so we're just going to
display in a message box a plus B or 5
plus 3 6 a message box show and then
we're just going to do a plus B and now
we're just going to convert that into a
string all right so let me explain this
right here so basically what I did is
put a plus B in parentheses so that what
it will do is will first add a and B and
then convert the sum of a and B into a
string so it'll add 5 and 3 right here
and then just convert 8 into a string
which is the sum of a and B all right so
we should just get 8 inside of a message
box yeah perfect all right and for
subtraction you're just going to want to
do a little - so now it's a minus B and
we should get 2 in a message box since a
represents 5 and B represents 3 so 5
minus 3 is 2 and if we get 2 and you
don't have to do just two integers or 2
variables you could do like a minus 4
right here and then we get 1 since a
represents 5 and 4 minus 5 is 1 yep
perfect for multiplication you're just
going to want to do an asterisk so right
here we're doing a times 4 and a
represents 5 so we're going to get 20 in
a message box yep and you could multiply
a and B so a times B should be 15 since
5 times 3 is 15 and yep we get 15 and
you could do division as well and for
division you're going to want to do a
slash so now it's a divided by B so 5
divided by 3 and we're going to actually
make these even numbers so I'm just
going to do like 6 divided by B and we
should get 2 since 6 divided by 3 is 2
and yep and just do two regular numbers
so if you wanted to do like 12 divided
by 2 then we should just get 6 since 12
divided by 2 is 6
yep perfect all right so that's really
all there is for mathematical operators
now we're going to get into something
else all right so what if we just wanted
to add on like 3 or 4 if you wanted to
add 4 to this integer right here well
what we could do is we could say a
equals a plus 4 but there isn't it way
easier way to do this what we could do
is we could just do a plus equals 4 and
doing a plus equals 4 the exact same
thing as doing a equals a plus 4 so what
it's going to do is just add 4 to a and
since a is 5 right now this is going to
add 4 to 5 and we should just get 9 so
let's just display on a and a must boxer
is going to messagebox show and then a
you just have to convert that into a
string so it's going to be dot to string
right there and now we should get 9 in a
message box because a initially equals 5
and then we're just adding 4 to a so we
should just get 9 a message box yep
perfect alright and you can do minus
equals as well so what this will do is
it will just subtract 4 from a so since
a is 5 it will just subtract 4 from a
and or 4 from 5 and we should just get 1
and an S Fox yep you can do
multiplication as well so if you can do
a x equals 4 so we'll just multiply a
times 4 and then set
equal to a so we should just get 20 in a
message box yep alright and this
division equals as well so we can just
do arm let's actually set a equal to 20
so it will do 20 divided by 4 and then
store the result in a so since 20
divided by 4 is 5 we should get 5 in
message box yep perfect alright and let
me just show you one last thing here
what if we wanted to just add 1 to a
well we could do a plus equals 1 you
could just do a plus equals 1 but
there's a much easier way of doing them
even this we can just do a plus plus and
a plus plus will basically just
increment a by 1 so no matter what a is
it will just add 1 to it and a is 20 so
it'll just add 1 to 20 and then store
that value in a so we should get 21 in a
message box yep and you can do decrement
as well so we can just do - - right
there and then I'll just subtract 1 from
a so we should get 19 and message box
since 20 minus 1 is 19 and yep alright
and there's one other thing you can do
with this so you could put the minus -
before a and what that will do is it
will just do this first so if you had
other things on on this line right here
like if you were to do - minus a and
then convert that into a string we would
get 19 in a message box because what it
will do right here is it'll just do this
first and then it will convert it into a
string so we should get 19 in a message
box yep well if we were to put the minus
- after it it will actually do that
after it's done showing the message box
so we're going to get 20 in a message
box because it did that last and same
goes for plus plus
so if weird it is - plus plus after it
then it'll do it after this line is
being executed or done being executed so
we're going to get 20
messagebox bill yep but if we were to
put the two pluses before the a then it
will do that first and you should get 21
in a message box that will add 1 to a
and then it will convert it into a
string yep perfect
all right so that's pretty much it for
this tutorial so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
