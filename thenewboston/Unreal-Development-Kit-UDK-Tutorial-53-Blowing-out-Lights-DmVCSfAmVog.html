53rd udk tutorial and in these upcoming
tutorials I'm going to be teaching you
guys how to make a really cool effect of
the user shooting a light with gun and
blowing out that light so there are a
lot of pieces involved so you guys
definitely want to stick around and
follow this story because it's going to
be really cool so the very first thing
we need is of course a couple lights so
let's go ahead and pop open our content
browser and make sure we have everything
cleared out and I'm just going to be
looking for a cool static mesh of a neat
looking light so let's see what we got
here this one's pretty boring this one's
pretty boring this one looks pretty cool
I guess right here so go ahead and of
course we don't just want to use the
static mesh we want to use the interp
actor so go ahead and make sure it's
fully loaded which in my case it is and
make sure it's selected now go ahead and
exit your content browser and wherever
you want to plop it down and go ahead
and right click and hit add interp actor
wall light 01 and now what i can do is i
can just copy this my i'm just going to
go ahead and add another interp actor
because i add it too because what we're
going to be doing is we're going to be
keeping one normal you see how it's kind
of glowing and pulsating blue light and
we're going to be shutting the emissive
property or the blue light off on this
and then whenever we shoot it we're
going to hide this one and make this one
appear so it looks like we shot it out
however it's not as easy as you guys
might think so the very first thing we
need to do is we need to keep this one
the same and we need to shut off that
blue pulsating light in this one so in
order to do that the easiest way we can
do that is just to edit the material so
with this interp actor selected go to
materials and find the material in the
content browser this takes you to
whatever material is applied to that
inter back to right there so what we
want to do is just go ahead and make a
copy of this by right-clicking and hit
create a copy and then give it a new
name like underscore
busted so it's basically the same exact
material that has a new name and it's
going to take a couple seconds to load
and make sure you're working with your
new busted material and by the way you
need to make sure that your packages are
saved for you to see any changes so I'm
going to go ahead and save it right now
and I just want to you know save it
because I like to save it frequently now
go ahead and double-click you're busted
light and remember this is going to open
up your material editor so the only
thing we need to do with this material
is shut off that emissive property so go
ahead and whatever is connected to a
missive hold down alt and click and
that's going to shut off all the
emissive properties so now you just have
a regular plain old light that looks
like it's off perfect that's exactly
what we were going for so now X out of
this and it's going to say would you
like to apply basically would you like
to save press yes so we're going to save
it there and also we need to save the
package as well a lot of people forget
to do this but go ahead and right click
and save this package as well so now
check it out we have this regular light
right here that was applied to this
interact ER and now when we want to
apply our busted a material to this
enter factor go ahead and I guess we can
go ahead and drag and drop but another
way you can do this is just go ahead and
select the material right click and hit
materials a sign from content browser
and then whatever material you have in
your content browser it's going to
assign it to this interact er right here
pretty cool huh so now if we go ahead
and first of all I want to rebuild
everything just to make sure it's
working right and this is going to take
some time so as well tell you guys a
story I was at the post office today and
this guy kept coughing on me he was
standing behind me and he was like
coughing on the back my neck and I was
like dude what's up anyways that's my
life so that's my nice little five
second story while my lights are
building so now all I wanted to do is go
ahead right click hit play from here and
just go ahead and verify that you have
this material is glowing and missive and
again whenever we shoot it we're going
to want it to blow up and we're going to
make this material visible however we're
going to be doing a couple other things
as well not just switching them because
if you think you're ready to move on to
the next tour oh and you can just skip
it you're wrong because I'm going to be
adding some other properties and other
lights as well and making it a really
cool-looking system so don't just skip
ahead because I got a lot more things to
cover and by the way a couple of
troubleshooting things if you guys
aren't seeing changes in your material
please make sure that your package is
saved and also you save your material in
the material editor those are probably
going to be your two most common
downfalls and once you have those little
points saved then you should be good to
go so again if you have anything that
you're messing up and you need to ask me
go ahead and ask me on my form the New
Boston calm and I'll be happy to answer
them for you there so well thank you
guys for watching and I'll see you next
