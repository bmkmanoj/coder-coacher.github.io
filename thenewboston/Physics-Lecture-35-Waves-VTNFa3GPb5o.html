physics lesson and in this lesson I want
to start talking to you guys about waves
now unfortunately I'm not talking about
surfing I'm talking about the waves that
relate to physics now in order to
understand any concept like magnets
light sound electricity and a lot of
other physics related topics we need to
understand the concept of a wave and
waves motion so probably the easiest way
that we can understand this is to look
at a simple pendulum now I know a lot of
you guys already know what a pendulum is
but for those of you who don't imagine
this imagine you have a point it doesn't
really matter you know what it is but
from that point you have a string and at
the end of the string you have some sort
of weight right here so here's your
weight some people actually call it a
Bob when it's on a pendulum but that's
all a pendulum is a weight hung from
some point that can swing freely back
and forth now of course in these
examples just go ahead and pretend that
the string which is right here pretend
that it has no mass whatsoever and also
that you know you're not losing any
friction you know from the weight
hitting the particles in the air or you
know the string rubbing against this
point this would be the idea of a
perfect pendulum now of course building
this perfect pendulum would be
impossible to build in real life but
just to demonstrate these concepts in
physics it's important to understand
that the string and weight are well the
string is massless in the weight doesn't
cause any friction so the first thing I
want to talk to you guys about is a
period now probably all you girls
already know this is they talking about
that in health class but in physics
class a period means something else the
period is the time it takes for this
pendulum to basically complete one swing
back and forth so that's basically all a
period is is pretty much just a
definition that we have to remember
because I'm going to be bringing up the
term period a lot and I don't want you
guys to think like it's something else
so a fun fact you guys have to remember
is the
longer the string the longer the period
or the more time it takes to swing back
and forth so again that relationship one
more time is the longer the string the
longer the period
aka time it takes to complete one swing
now another relationship that you have
to remember is actually more like an
interesting fact
now this weight right here actually has
no effect on the period at all so if you
you know you put a pumpkin right here or
you put a baseball or you know maybe a
blueberry it doesn't matter at all the
weight of the OP object doesn't affect
the period or the time of the swing
whatsoever pretty interesting so now
that we understand you know what a
pendulum is assuring the way the period
let's go ahead and I want to talk to you
guys about a few calculations that are
going to come in handy now in these
calculations I'm just going to symbolize
tea that kind of looks like a F I'll
drop my tea a little bit better t equals
period and the reason that we can use
tea is because period is basically time
so that's why I use T L equals length of
the pendulum now whenever you are
measuring a pendulum remember I said you
have a point right here and you have a
big weight you think in do I measure it
from the top of the weight right here
the bottom of the weight you actually
met measure it from the middle of the
pendulum right here so this is the
correct spot I'll name this the G spot
because that is the good spot G stands
for good so this point point A to point
B or the g spot is where you measure the
pendulum and that gives you your L and
last but not least you got g and g of
course symbolizes the gravity so T is
the period or length of time it takes
for the pendulum to complete one swing
back and forth L is the length of a
pendulum from A to the G spot in G is
the gravity so I probably shouldn't name
that G spot may confuse you guys but now
let's go ahead and look at a formula
to calculate the length or period that's
T all my T's look like freakin F T
equals two pi or two PI's if you're a
baker the square root of L over G so we
already know two of the values whenever
we want to calculate T right here and
remember T is basically this is the
formula you use whenever you want to
calculate how long a pendulum takes to
complete one swing so well let me go
ahead and throw in some figures first
say that we want to try to find the
period of a five meter long pendulum
question mark so let's see what values
we have so far well T that's going to be
a question mark because that's what
we're trying to figure out 2pi of course
two is two and pi is 3.14 and L is a
length so that's five meters and we
already know G as well that's 9.8 m/s^2
so if we want to go ahead and calculate
this what would you do well we would
just go ahead and really the only thing
we need to figure out right now is this
right here L and G so the square root of
L which is five and G which is nine
point eight first you do five over nine
point eight and then you take the square
root of that and you find that this is
equal to point seven one four so that's
what this is in the blue circle so now
all we have to do is take this value
0.714 and times it by two and times that
by pi which is 3.14 at all those numbers
and when we multiply all these together
we get four point four eight seven nine
seconds so if anyone asks you and trust
me they do ask you this a lot hey Bucky
how long is the period of a five meter
long pendulum OMG if I had a nickel for
every time anyone asked me that
I would ok I'd have like two nickels
because you know only okay to tell you
the truth I would have no nickels this
is useless don't ever use this formula
again if you're not in a physics setting
but anyways if someone does ask you that
then you can say proudly the length of a
period or the time it takes a five meter
long pendulum to swing back and forth is
four point four eight seven nine seconds
so there you go that is what a pendulum
is and that is also what a period is and
now that we are armed with this
knowledge and also the formula of how to
calculate the length or period of a
pendulum we can now move on to the next
topic understanding more concepts
