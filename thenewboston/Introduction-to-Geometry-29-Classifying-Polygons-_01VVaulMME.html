classifying polygons and polygons are
named based on the number of sides they
have so of course a three-sided polygon
is called a triangle four-sided polygons
it was called the quadrilateral five
Pentagon six hexagons seven sceptic on
eight octagon nine nonagon ten decagon
and twelve is a dodecagon other polygons
that don't have a special number of
sides are just called you put the number
of sides i have and then put gun so
that's how you would write that so an
important thing to note is that if you
have a regular polygon it means that all
sides are congruent and all angles of
the polygon are also congruent so now
we're gonna do a little practice with
classifying each polygon so the first
thing we have to do every time is count
up the number of sides it has because
that's how we name it so obviously this
is it this has three sides so it has to
be a triangle okay so this has one two
three four five six sides so if you
remember it's called a hexagon
so this right here is called a hexagon
so this has one two three four sides and
the correct name is a quadrilateral I
know it looks like a square and it could
be a square but a square is a regular
polygon and we don't know that these are
all the same size and that these angles
are all the same measurement so we can
all we can call it as a quadrilateral
right now so this has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10 so this is a decagon because I have
10 sides this has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so it's
called the septagon and lastly this has
3 4 5 sides so it's called a Pentagon
so now we're gonna do some practice with
regular polygons and if you remember a
regular polygon has congruent sides and
congruent angles so this is asking for
the measure of angle V well if this is a
regular hexagon that means all the
angles have equal measure
so that's 120 degrees and they want the
measure of V M or the length of segment
V M so it has to equal 5 meters so this
is a regular triangle
and a regular triangle is a special kind
of triangle and it's called an
equilateral triangle now if you remember
when we learned about equilateral
triangles we've said that they had
congruent sides and congruent angles so
that's what we call it if we have a
regular triangle a equilateral triangle
so the measure of AC has to be 3
centimeters the measure of C has to be
60 centimeter or 60 degrees so this we
know is a regular polygon and like I
said before a regular quadrilateral
because it has four sides is called a
square squares have all their angles are
right angles so so the measure of angle
are so if all of squares angles are
right angles that means each one of its
angles measures 90 degrees the length of
RL has to be 7 inches because
they have congruent links so be sure to
watch the next video which is going to
deal with angles of polygons and
figuring out some problems with those</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
