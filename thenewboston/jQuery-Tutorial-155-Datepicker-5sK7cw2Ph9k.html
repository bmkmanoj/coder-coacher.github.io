representation of the day if for example
you wanted to go ahead and store a
timestamp in a database table you could
use back-end functionality say in PHP to
actually deal with converting this date
to a timestamp as far as I'm aware the
widget doesn't allow timestamps to be
displayed but it's always better to show
this in here and submit this data and
convert it in the backend of your
application so now that we've done that
we need to think about what happens if
we want a minimum and a maximum date now
at the moment we can go back for as long
as as long as possible and obviously go
forward for as far as possible but let's
say we wanted to only allow a date to be
chosen from today onwards now we can do
this using the min date function of the
min date option so min date now we
specify this as an either as an integer
or we can specify inside text and I'm
going to show you how to do that in just
a moment for now I'm just going to say
zero and when we click here now you can
see that we only are allowed to select
the date from now onwards so we can
select today tomorrow and that will go
ahead for the rest of time so now that
we've specified that we can also go
ahead and specify a max date
now the max date might be easier to
implement in textual form however we can
in fact say for example max day 3
now that would allow us three days on
top of the current date so we've got 1 2
3 and then we can't click any further
because we've only allowed 3 dates so
this is extremely useful if you only
want to allow specific dates either from
today or a few days back or a time
period in the past to a specific amount
of dates onwards now we have a supply
three and that is taking into account
the actual days we can also do a textual
representation of this so for example we
could say plus one month
and that would only allow one month
onwards so let's refresh you can see we
can go on here and we've got one month
onwards from this particular day so the
28th of this day to the 28th of next day
and we can then go ahead and also supply
a particular amount of days so maybe two
days for example so we use plus one
month and plus two days will lead us to
the 30th of August so we allow we're
allowed to do this in textual
representation as well as well as the
min date as well you could say for
example minus five days what this would
then do is allow you to go 5 days 1 2 3
4 5 days backwards as well so with both
these options you can specify either an
integer which represents the amount of
days or you can specify it in a textual
form as well ok so the next option we're
going to look at I'm just going to calm
and separate this and come down a bit so
we can fit everything on to the text
editor is the show button panel now show
button panel is default set to false
however we can go ahead and set this to
true and what this will do is this will
show a panel at the bottom so for
example selecting today and done now in
this case when we select a particular
date we automatically activate the done
function in essence and this will
automatically close the date picker
however if you implement this in another
way you would in fact be able to use
these buttons so for example if a date
it was selected say the next day onwards
you could then press today and that
would jump to the current date so for
example if you were I'd know wanted to
show yeah like I said show then tomorrow
as the default date you could then press
today to select the day and then if you
wanted the user to select these but not
close the box you'll be able to click
done and that will just remove the box
it's useful to have it here anyway just
in case the user decides to say select
the 29th and then say oh I don't want to
select that anymore they can either
press done or they can click outside of
the date picker
area and that will close that date
picker widget okay so the last thing
we're going to take a look at is the add
animation types now by default it is set
to show we're going to go ahead and
specify show annum so show animation and
there's a lots of different options we
can give this they're all listed in the
jQuery UI documentation for example we
could choose bounce instead of the
default show and this will bounce in the
box here just depending on how I guess
how animated you want the effect to look
for example we could also choose fade in
and that would just fade in the date
picker like I said by default is show
and when we refresh and click show that
will just pop out like that if you
wanted no animation whatsoever and you
just wanted the data picker to appear
you can leave this blank here and what
that will do is it will just show it
like this probably for more corporate or
more important you know websites I guess
however you want to describe them the
show option is a good idea because it
just shows the date picker rather than
including too much animation and making
it look fake so that's the date picker
widget in the jQuery UI as you can see
is extremely easy to implement by just
using the default date picker widget on
top of the form field that you want to
show you can easily implement this to
attach to an input field</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
