fourth Android tutorial for the new boss
in and thank goodness we're done with
all that opengl stuff because it's time
to go into something a little bit easier
you know kick your feet up relax a
little bit as you can see this board
were pretty much doing you're like what
you ruined it you ruined our application
it's white now or what you do you just
set the background to white well kind of
this is a theme and you know we can
apply different themes to different
activities which we've kind of done with
there about us if you guys remember with
our about Us section when we did our
menu and then about us or whatever that
was a theme that we applied and this
tutorial I'm going to talk about pretty
much the other themes that they have
such as like the text play whoa
transparent there's not you can still
see the background of the activity
behind this activity and this one still
works you know we can do all of all of
our commands and stuff still hit back
and there we go we can also do let's see
here forgot which ones I applied it to
yeah black background pretty much the
same stuff or pretty much looks the same
there but let's get into it it's going
to be pretty simple pretty easy so look
forward to that and what we're gonna do
is we're gonna be either pick out a few
applications or we can actually apply
the theme to the whole application I'm
sorry we can apply a theme to a specific
activity which we've done with our about
us activity or we can apply it to our
whole application so you can keep that
in mind as well so we're just going to
pick out a few such as the menu we're
going to set up this to be the white or
the light theme so again how we do this
is we're just going to go within our
opening bracket here so make sure you're
within this part of the activity line
and then we're just going to say Android
theme is equal to at Android
: style swagga as they call it and then
we just apply our theme by going theme
dot light for example light is the white
background that I just showed you that I
applied to the whole activity I think or
the whole application I should say so
again just to do that you can just cut
this line here err cut it and paste it
right within again our opening
application line here so again give
yourself some space paste it if you want
your whole application oops
spoiler alert geez alright so this will
will basically apply this light theme to
our whole application instead of
individual activities so you could do
that I'm not going to but let's let's
see some of the other ones so again I'm
just going to copy this line of code and
we're going to go into our starting
point activity and again give us some
space within the opening bracket here
paste and what is another method called
well we have translucent really hope I
can spell oh man I knew I should not
recopy that light one all right so there
we go there's the translucent one that's
the clear background you can see behind
it all that good stuff and lastly um at
least lastly that I know there's one
called just black which is basically
just a black background sometimes by
default people depending on which which
platforms are running on will have kind
of a grayish background and this will
just make it black so that's why you
might want to call that command but
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
guys uh I'm gonna delete this because I
don't really like the look of it the
light but you know it can be pretty cool
and certain certain uh activities and
such so it's always good to keep that in
mind to customize your apps a little bit
differently than everyone else on the
marketplace so hopefully you can do that
with some themes and I'll catch guys in
the next tutorial see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
