welcome to another amazing tutorial and
in this tutorial we're gonna be talking
about a new data type now as you can see
I already deleted all the extra crap
that we didn't need in our other
tutorial all I have left is the two
object declarations and releasing the
objects but for now let me just type
some crap in here so I can explain now
we already learned about some other data
types like int that holds like integers
like 1 3 54 and we also learn about
another character data type which stored
like letters like W and you know why in
characters like that and there's also a
whole bunch of other data types most of
them work with numbers like some work
with numbers with decimal points some
work with smaller numbers big numbers
but the data type we want to talk about
today is a data type that's very
important to polymorphism it's called
the ID or some people call it a data
type now the it data type is kind of a
generic data type it can store pretty
much anything you wanted to store so put
it variable it can pretty much store any
variable you want so again it can pretty
much store data of any type its generic
that type now since it is a generic data
type it not only can work with variables
but you can also you know create methods
that can say you have a method called
method and you passed it in a value
called apples it can also have a return
type of it so again like you see this
data type can pretty much you know
pretty much do anything it's really
dynamic but why am I telling you this
and why is this useful for this tutorial
well not only can a store you know
variables and be used in methods but it
can also be used to store objects of any
type
it can be used to store objects so let's
check this out let's make an it variable
called tuna see math tuna is it equal to
anything but I say that it can store
objects of any type so let's set it
equal to the object N and remember n is
an object from the numbers class so
since now tuna is equal to n does that
mean that we can use tuna to call
methods from the numbers class like
print hmm let's see if this works
go ahead and say that and whoa check it
out now we just made this weird it data
type that could pretty much store
anything called tuna and now we made it
into a numbers object and they can
actually call methods from the numbers
class that is pretty cool right there
but say we were tired of that and we
want to set tuna equal to an object from
another class I want to set it equal to
member from the characters class so does
this mean we can actually change it
halfway through our program and call
methods from the characters class that
would be crazy if we can do that let's
go ahead and build and run that save and
whoa check this out halfway through the
beginning of the program the same object
belong to the numbers class and then
halfway through it switched and now it
started calling methods from the
characters class that is pretty cool
right there that is some pretty awesome
stuff so I know you're saying alright if
you put tuna print and it did this and
then put tuna print and did something
else how does it know exactly what print
to do I'll check this out whenever you
call a method from any object it's built
into your system what class that object
belongs to so currently right here this
object belonged to the numbers class so
that's why I called the numbers print
method and later on when we changed it
the C from the characters class this
tune object now belonged to the
characters class so that is why it
called print from the characters class
so the cool thing about this is with
polymorphism
and ID or it type this one object can
access methods from as many different
classes as you want it to and you're not
only restricted to one object accessing
one classes methods and variables so
that is the beauty of polymorphism
working along with AI D it type so um
let's see if there's anything else I
wanna yeah I mean that's pretty much it
so I mean this isn't really useful in
this program right here this is because
I just gave you guys like the most basic
bare-bones example I could but we're in
the real world program in which you use
this well let me give you guys a quick
example say you have a bunch of
different classes for a bunch of
different shapes and you say Circle
Square triangle rectangle octagon all of
those classes had methods in them called
draw and when you called the method draw
it would either draw a circle on the
screen or a triangle or a rectangle
depending on what method or what class
you are using it on well the cool thing
about this is you could set tuna equal
to objects of each of those classes and
just by putting tuna draw in my draw
circle tuna draw in my draw rectangle
tuna draw in my draw triangle or an
octagon or anything else so later on you
can see that instead of having a bunch
of different objects to it it's gonna be
easier just to have one object loop
through and call that one method and it
will do a bunch of different things
depending on what class it belongs to
and I know that's confusing right now
but you know I thought I'd give you guys
an example but for now thank you guys
for watching don't forget subscribe I
know this may seem confusing but when we
get programming later it'll clear it up
for you so if you have any questions ask
me on my forum below there's a link to
all the source code from this tutorial
below in the link um thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and I
will see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
