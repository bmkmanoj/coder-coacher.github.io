tutorial in this tutorial I'm going to
be teaching you guys how to do a while
loop now what a while loop is excuse me
and got whooping cough what a while loop
is it's pretty much a for loop without
all the beginning variables in it it
pretty much is a naked forward loop it
pretty much just has the test condition
in the body so the first thing that
we're going to want to do is declare
variable just make it a basic integer
variable and set it equal to a whatever
you like I'm going to set mine equal to
one and the next thing you want to do
after you declared variable is start
actually making the loop now unlike for
the syntax for this is while and what
this is pretty much going to do is
you're going to have a test condition in
the parentheses and it's going to be
something like when X is less or equal
to 10 and then this thing in parentheses
is called the test condition so it's
going to run whenever X is less than or
equal to 10 so now that you told it when
to run you got to tell it what to do
so it says all right when X is less than
or equal to 1
editor semicolons what do we want you to
do we can make you do anything we want
so let's make you output on the screen
there we go see out boom that's right
hey there Bessie so we want you to
output hater Bessie and then let's just
end the line and now unlike the for loop
you don't automatically increment up
here so right now we have our a integer
X is equal to 1 and if we just keep
running this and running this it's going
to be equal to 1 the whole time and it's
always going to be less than or equal to
10 so this is going to be infinite loop
and it's going to keep running and
running so since we don't want that we
want
change X so we say all right after
you're done running this we want you to
make X equal to X plus 1 and what this
is going to do is allow you to increment
X by 1 each time so it doesn't just keep
running and running and I'll show you
guys what this does later but again to
recap you have your syntax for your
while loop this is called your test
condition right here and the this in the
semicolons this is called the body the
body is pretty much the instructions for
your loop or what you want it to do so
enough talk let's see this baby in
action execute compile and run hopefully
I don't got any errors and hopefully if
everything goes right it should say hey
there Betsy 10 times so again says hey
there Bessie hey there Bessie yada yada
yada and again like the for loop I'll
show you guys by plugging X in the
variable instead of a string why do you
execute compile and run right now in
this case it outputs one two three four
five six seven eight nine ten and this
again is because we change the variable
and increment it by one each time
instead of just um keeping it one so um
the difference between a while loop is
while loop in a for loop is pretty much
that um it's pretty much district' of
all this at the beginning and you
increment it in your body instead of
your test condition so that is the
difference between a while loop and the
for loop and another thing I wanted to
note if this is false at the beginning
for example if your variable was 11 then
anything in the body isn't even going to
run at all so in order to this to run at
all this
condition needs to be true if it's false
your body isn't going to run at all but
I'm sure you guys could figure that out
so um those are pretty much the syntax
in the basics to a while loop I hope you
learned something study this practice
making a while loop and once you did you
can move on to my next tutorial so
