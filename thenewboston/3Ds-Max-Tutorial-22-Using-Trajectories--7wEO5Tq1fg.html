tutorial in 3ds max and in this is where
we're going to be going over
trajectories and this is actually the
22nd tutorial so in the lessons order we
learned some basic animation learned
what frames and keyframes were and if
you notice whenever you made a keyframe
you saw the different colors on the
keyframes and by default they're red
green and blue and these colors actually
believe it or not they mean something
just not random colors the color on the
keyframe symbolizes what is being
animated the position keys are red
anytime you see green it means rotations
being animated and anytime you see blue
it means that the scale is being
animated or the size of it and the
parameter keys are going to be dark gray
and aside from a solid color you can
also have like if a color is red and
green that means that it's two different
things are animated on the same exact
key so that gives you a little
background of what the colors mean and
keyframes so let me go ahead and now
that we learn how to do a basic
animation and may something like
position alone or size alone let's go
ahead and clear and get a new animation
and I can teach you what the heart of
this tutorial is about and that's
trajectories now before I even go into
that let's go ahead and put new open up
a new one just place you have anything
uh in your thing already and then go
ahead and reset your workspace so we're
all on the same page here what a
trajectory is is is pretty much a path
that animation can follow so this is
most commonly viewed as a spline and
that's when I review like video game
creations you see all those dots around
or when people are on a green screen and
they have those dots on them for motion
paths that's what this is and what it is
is each node is going to show up is a
frame and the keyframes are going to be
shown in white squares so it's better
actually if I just create one and you
see what I'm talking about so let's go
ahead and go ahead and create pretty
much any object you want it doesn't
really matter
go ahead and create a teapot real quick
because why not and in your front
viewport right here just zoom out a
little bit and it's probably the best to
get that select object tool so just zoom
out and put the object towards the
bottom right of your screen and then
from here what we need to do is again
make sure you're in your front view
create alignment spline and the spline
is going to be the path that this object
is going to follow so let's go ahead and
in our crate create shapes splines make
sure you drop down and click spot
splines excuse me and then go ahead and
click a line and you can pretty much
make any path that you want I'm going to
make a loop because it's really easy
when I demonstrate rotation just to see
a loop so pretty much click something
that looks like that it doesn't have to
be exact but anytime you want to
deselect your spline just go ahead and
right-click it like that now what you
want to do is select your teapot because
what we're going to be telling 3ds max
is are say alright take this teapot and
put it on this path and that's the path
that needs to be follow so go ahead and
select your teapot and you'll note
select it because it'll turn white and
then go ahead and in your motion path
right here click trajectory and again
like I said at rect your trajectory is
the path that it's going to follow so
what you want to do with your teapot
selected or whatever shape you created
go ahead and press convert from and what
this means is all right I'm about to
give you a path to follow
so now hover over your spline which mine
is named line 1 and click that now as
you see the teapot automatically snaps
the beginning of the spline and if you
scroll along your arm time bar at the
bottom you see that it begins animating
and by default it starts at the
beginning of the spline and by default
it ends at the end so now if you scroll
you can watch a play just like that so
go ahead and what we want to do is we
want this to actually rotate along with
the spline so when you scroll like this
you see it's staying the same thing the
whole time
and so go ahead and press key filters
and we only want to select rotation and
this is going to say alright we can only
edit rotation so go ahead to somewhere
like right here and go ahead and click
your select and rotate and you can just
go ahead and rotate it like that and
press set key and scroll head a little
further to the top of the loop and go
ahead and rotate this even more click on
on yellow set key set key now go ahead
to about 3/4 away and go ahead and
rotate this even more right about there
and go ahead and set another key so now
you see whenever we look at it it
actually Scrolls along with the path so
that's how you can animate two different
types of animation at once so that's all
the time I have for this tutorial thank
you guys for watching and don't forget
