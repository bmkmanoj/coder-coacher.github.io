tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
to show you guys a cool way to add new
methods to a class without changing the
code or sub-classing pretty cool this
thing is called categories what we're
going to be creating and say for example
we have something like this we have this
numbers class that we created before and
it has some methods in it set numbers
add the numbers together print them but
you know we really need to like subtract
two numbers and multiply two numbers so
we want to add some more methods to here
the problem is I created this class
myself and I don't want any of my
employees or no one messing with a
source code and I also don't want them
to create a subclass from it for
technical reasons so there's a lot
easier way to add methods to the same
class very easily so go ahead and I mean
we could be doing this in separate files
but just for the small demonstration I'm
going to put everything in a one file so
the first thing that we're going to need
to do is import the numbers class so
import numbs H I think it was with Z yup
and now since we imported it we have
access to all the instance variables and
we just pretty much have general
information about that class so whenever
we come across an object it knows that
it came from that class so here's what
we need to do in order to make this
thing called a category and again a
category is a way you can add new
methods to that class without changing
the class itself so go back ahead to
your main program and the syntax again
is this at interface nums and after that
in parenthesis put the name of your
category I'm just going to name mine
more meth it stands for more methods not
not a drug term that's what you think at
least and anyways that is a syntax for
it and then go ahead and put at and and
in between here this is where you add
the pretty much header files for
are the new methods you want to create
so let's go ahead and add two new
methods we'll add one that subtracts one
number from the other subtract and let's
go ahead and put in a probably need to
put that like this int a and int B so
what this method is going to do is it's
going to take a number a and subtract
number B from it so 50 minus 30 in
return 20 or something print out on the
screen
and let's just go ahead and copy that
right there copy and let's make one more
method just so you know why the heck not
mu L T and this will multiply a times B
so easy enough so the cool thing about
putting everything is one file is we
already have the interface for this
category we can go ahead and add the
implementation right under it so go
ahead and put at implementation right
like that in the class name all you have
to do is put nums and then your category
name right in parenthesis pretty much
just like what you did for the interface
except you put implementation instead of
interface so go ahead and put more meth
right in there and look it's already
started filling out put the methods
right here all right we know where to
put the methods so let's turn that up
just wee tidbit copy these right here
and we begin implementing or building
the bodies to our methods
so for subtract all we want to do is put
something like NS log we're just going
to you know print something now on the
screen for both the methods so what do
we want to log out on these numbers
tracted are and make sure you spell that
wrong percent i and for your integer all
you wanted to do is put a minus b take
whatever two numbers they pass in in the
subtract a second from the first easy
enough and just go ahead and copy this
because we're going to use it in just a
wee tidbit and for your multiplication
method just go ahead and paste that in
mayor put these numbers multiplied are a
times b so you know really simple
methods up again the toriel isn't about
building complex methods just about
showing you categories so check this out
all we did so far is above our main
method we imported num sage because we
needed that class information we built
an interface for this category and it
looked pretty much the same as the
interface for regular class except it
had the category in parentheses and also
same thing with implementation regular
implementation except the other category
and parentheses and take note
we didn't affect the source code for the
numbers header or implementation file at
all this is in a completely different
file so now that we have that let's go
ahead and begin using this well you'll
see nums start and create an object you
know this is just like you're creating
an object from the numbers class and
nums alloc init so a regular n object
and now we can go ahead and begin
calling methods and multiply and let's
go ahead and put like six and eight i
always multiply six and eight together
because i know 48 i don't know why i
remember that but you know no calculator
needed thank you thank you so n subtract
two numbers let's subtract like a
hundred and take like 50 away from it
actually 40
I don't like the answer is to be one of
the parameters as well so once we're
down to that I really wish it would stop
- wow that is super annoying release
there we go
not em and all right so I think we got
everything covered and check this out
the cool thing about this is you call
methods on here in no special way just
like they were coming from the interface
and implementation files straight from
the numbers class it can't tell the
difference whether it came from right
above or the numbers class and that's
the beauty it's so easy so let's go
ahead and build and run this if we got
any errors we need to correct nope and
check it out the numbers multiply to our
48 the numbers subtracted our 60 with a
bunch of typos definitely necessary so
pretty much what I'm trying to stress is
a category lets you add new methods to
this numbers class without having to
touch any of this code at all and you
see we didn't even create a subclass
either so we created a new category from
the numbers class named more meth that's
the category name and again we could
have put these in separate files but I
mean this is a small example check this
out might as well just put it in one big
file in case you guys want to go get
source code so uh that's it
for this story oh that's how you use
categories pretty simple pretty
straightforward so uh yeah if you want
this source code I'm going to go ahead
and copy it right now and paste it on my
forum link below thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and I'll
see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
