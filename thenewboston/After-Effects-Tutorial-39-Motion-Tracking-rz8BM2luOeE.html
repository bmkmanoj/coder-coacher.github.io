and After Effects and in this tutorial
I'm going to be going over something
called motion tracking
now what motion tracking is is it lazy
it it allows you to take one layer such
as text right here and have it follow
along with something on a screen and
what I'm gonna be doing is taking the
movement of my head this bobbles all
around the screen and attaching this
text to it so follows along with it and
this is how they use special effects to
let's say you have a video clip of
something and you want to edit something
in like a 3d animation or a text like
I'm doing or any solid object this is
how they do that so it's incredibly
difficult to explain through just
talking but once you see it you're like
oh nice because it is nice so let's go
ahead and the first thing you need is a
video clip and I got this video clip of
me talking to the camera about something
and I also have a solid object that is
my name and a hot-pink for viewing
purposes so once we have a video clip
which we're gonna track and solid that
we want to attach to it we also need
another null object layer so go ahead up
to layer new null object and what this
is going to do is create the information
or store the information to track it's
pretty much gonna hold all the keyframes
what you've seeing a little bit next you
want to go ahead and open your tracker
control panel right here and go ahead
and select the layer that you want to
track now this is the layer that moves
they want to store the position from so
it should be your main video clip and
once you have this selected go ahead and
click track motion now you can see that
everything else disappears like your
text layer and everything else this is
because you don't need that now you only
want to work with the track motion from
here so as you can see you got your
composition panel right here in this new
layer that you can track motion so go
ahead and get this little track point
and highlight it all and move it over to
a point that you want to track now I
don't want to track
my eye or anything because my eyes gonna
be blinking and closing and I don't want
to be tracking anything in the
background that my head's gonna cover up
i'll untracked something that's gonna
stay the same the whole time so either
my eyebrow or my nostril which I'm gonna
or maybe my chin or something something
with high contrast so Adobe can pick it
up easily now let me go over what these
boxes mean this middle box right here
that you can move around is gonna get
the data that you can track pretty much
in this outside box right here this is a
search box this is going to search for
all the pixels again you can make it
really big but it's gonna take a longer
time to chart so you usually want to get
it as small as you can to give a small
search area so it knows where to look so
now that we have I'll go over these
boxes more in a little bit but pretty
much you need to know to put this point
where you want Rick this is a quick
tutorial don't don't forget and now once
you have that set up go ahead and click
this play button and it's going to go
ahead and track that motion it go ahead
and click it it's called analyze forward
so click it and as you see then the box
moves along with my head now go ahead
and after a little bit or however long
you want just press stop and now we have
this huge path that detracted pixels and
if there's one pixel sometimes one pixel
gets like way off maybe I would track my
eye for like a half a second just go
ahead and move that keyframe back but
this one looks pretty good so we got the
motion path just like we would if we
keyframes it all out but this is a lot
easier way to do this now how do we
apply this motion to own to our no
object layer well what we want to do is
go ahead and put Edit target and by
default it's top layer but if not go
ahead and click your no layer then click
OK and now go ahead and once you have
that target selected go ahead and click
apply and go ahead and click OK and now
once you see in our null object layer we
get this new position let me minimize
this right there we get this new
position tracking right here so now as
you can see our null object now moves
along with that frame or excuse me that
a path right there so if you're saying
all right we got the null object and
move along with my head but how do we
get the title to move along with my head
well that's easy anytime you want a
title to stick to a null object all you
have to do is have like title right here
and click parent and click whatever you
want it to parent to so let me go ahead
and and now I'll show you our final
composition so look up here and I will
play this animation for you it's playing
it didn't cut the position yet and now
once it hits it our title now moves
along with my head just like we wanted
it to and then that's where I stop
keyframe and that's where it stops so
that is how you can pretty much add
special effects to move along with an
image after you're already shot it again
let me play that one more time
not keyframe net and now it's attached
to that motion track and watch how the
title moves along with my head so
instead of having the keyframe that
frame by frame and creating a real
annoying path this is a real easy way
called motion tracking and again don't
forget tracker controls track motion
when you uh gear no object edit the
target to the null object and then apply
it and then it puts that position
keyframes in your null object and this
is real useful because when you do this
you can put a bunch of things parent
into that no object so again we're
probably going to be going over this a
little more in the next tutorial but I
just wanted to give you guys a real
quick tutorial on how to do it so thank
you guys for watching shouldn't hit my
microphone there but thank you guys for
watching and don't forget to subscribe
it and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
