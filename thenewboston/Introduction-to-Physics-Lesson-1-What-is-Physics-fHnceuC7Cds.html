Roberts and welcome to your very first
tutorial in physics now in these
upcoming tutorials what I'm going to be
doing is I'm basically going to be
treating this as an introductory physics
course if you were to take it in high
school or college or anywhere else I'm
going to be teaching you the basic core
principles to get guys started in
physics and by that I mean I'm going to
be teaching you about mass force
velocity you know the properties of
matter all that fun stuff so that's what
I'm going to be doing that's what you
guys have to look forward to but before
we started making any weird calculations
or anything like that I think it's
important to understand the definition
you know the proper definition of
physics and that is the study of matter
and energy now there's no like one
proper definition of physics but you
know if you look around the web in all
your textbooks this pretty much sums up
what physics is studying matter and
energy and how they interact with each
other pretty much studying all the
things that you can measure so you're
saying all right so it's pretty much the
study of like everything on earth whoa
not exactly saying all right so what are
some of the topics that physics doesn't
touch on well we're going to be talking
about topics like love physics is not
going to cover passion I'm sorry but if
you're here looking to study passion
you're in the wrong place
courageousness well I might touch on
that a little bit but it has nothing to
do with physics so those are some topics
that you know we can't measure with
physics what we can measure is like
volume the speed of light you know all
that boring stuff but by the way if
you're looking for love and passion
tutorials then I might be making some of
those pretty soon by anyways that's what
physics is that's the you know formal
correct definition that's what you
should write on your test so now let's
go on to the next step and that is well
whenever scientists are working with
physics and they're working where these
huge numbers such as you know how many
atoms are in the Sun what's the speed of
light well first of all I need to
explain to you guys that these numbers
are huge
they're like you know billions and
billions of billions of atoms inside the
Sun numbers that I can't even really
comprehend right now but we just can't
write these numbers out like you know
you to write how many brothers you have
or how much you weigh because if you try
to write the number of how many atoms
were in the Sun it would take you like
six years just to write it out on a
piece of paper so what scientists did is
they came up with a really lazy way to
write really big in really small numbers
and that is through the use of
scientific notation now my definition of
what scientific notation is is it's
basically the way lazy scientists write
big and small numbers now the technical
definition is basically if you ever
heard of power of 10 notation it's
pretty much taking a number and timesing
it by ten times a certain power and well
let me go ahead and throw you guys into
a nice example right here so let me go
ahead and get my new stylus out what
color am I going to choose blue looks
pretty good so let's say we had a number
like twenty eight thousand and seven
hundred and we wanted to express that
using scientific notation well what we
would do is we would write two point
eight seven and by the way I know my
handwriting is really bad you guys are
just going to have to deal with that so
two point eight seven times 10 to the
fourth power so this is basically the
basics of scientific notation you have a
number on the left here and you multiply
it times 10 to a certain power and in
this example the power is 4 but you can
have any positive negative integer and
you can also have 0 and I'm going to be
showing you guys all those examples
right now so all right how would we
solve this problem so I told you guys
that this number basically means the
same as twenty eight thousand seven
hundred don't believe me well I'm going
to show you guys how to do that so you
have two point eight seven times ten to
the fourth power alright so we need to
solve this baby right here so two point
eight seven
times 10 to the fourth power is 10 army
excuse me it's one with four zero so one
two three four so 10 to the fourth power
is 10,000 and I'm not going to explain
you guys how to do powers and you know
exponents and stuff like that because
I'm assuming you guys already know I
don't think we need to jump back of that
far so two point eight seven times
10,000 is twenty eight thousand seven
hundred and by the way I'm going to show
you guys a really lazy way to do a
scientific notation and that's this let
me go ahead and clear this so we can go
ahead and make all those steps like
convert 10 to the fourth power to 10,000
and times this by 10,000 but you know
that's one extra step and like I said we
are scientists now and we are lazy so
let's go ahead and look at the easier
way if you have that same problem two
point eight seven times 10 to the fourth
power and you want to figure out you
know everyday terms what this number
meant what we could do is say alright
whenever we have a number that's like 10
to the fourth power all we have to do is
take this decimal point and move it to
the right four spaces so two point eight
seven equals times 10 to the fourth of
course equals one two three four
and whenever we don't have anything we
just go ahead and throw in zeroes and
check it out this is twenty eight
thousand seven hundred pretty cool huh
so it kind of saves you a step you kind
of draw these things that look like
boobs kind of but you know oh well so
let me go ahead and edit and clear that
out and now let me show you guys
remember when I told you guys that the
exponents can be negative two well
whenever they have a number in they
times it by 10/2 like the negative fifth
or something like that that means that
you have a really small number so say
you have something like let me go ahead
and change my colors up um let me think
of something five point two six
times 10 to the negative 5 well the very
first thing we need to do is 5.26 times
and convert 10 to the negative 5 so
again I'm not going to talk you guys
through how exponents work but 10 to the
negative 5 is point zero zero zero zero
one so five point two six times point
zero zero zero zero one is point zero
zero zero zero four zeroes five two six
so that's your answer right there I kind
of drew over my decimal point so again
if we want to do this the lazy way
because remember we're scientists now
have to do everything lazy 5.26 times 10
to the negative fifth equals five point
two six and whenever we have negative
just go ahead and move your decimal
point to the left five spaces so one two
three four five well I got to work on my
curvature there anyways just go ahead
and fill in those zeros where you moved
it and check it out point zero zero zero
zero five two six so that's kind of a
lazy way of doing things but hey it
saves us this step right here so now the
last example I want to tell you guys is
about that zero with exponent because
remember I told you guys you can have a
positive integer or negative integer for
your exponent but you can also have zero
so if you have something like six point
nine times ten to the zero of power the
very first thing we have to figure out
is all right what the heck is ten to the
zeroth power and if you remember from
like fifth grade math anything to the
zero of power is one so this pretty much
means our a six point nine times one and
again anything anything times one is
itself so this answer is six point nine
again I don't really have a lazy way of
doing this because pretty much this is
really lazy in itself any time you have
times ten
zero of power just get rid of all this
and that's your answer right there six
point nine so that is your very first
physics tutorial I hope you guys liked
it and again I'm going to show you the
lazy way I'm going to show you like the
technical correct way to do all this
stuff and then I'm going to show you
like you know the lazy way where you can
get away with it so it's going to be
real fun and yeah I'm going to work on
you know moving my decimal places get
them giving them a little bit better and
up you guys stay tuned for the next
tutorial is going to be awesome so thank
you guys for watching and I'll see you
then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
