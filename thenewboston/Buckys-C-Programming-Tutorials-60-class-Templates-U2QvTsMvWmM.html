C++ tutorial and in this tutorial I want
to talk to you guys about class
templates so before we learned about
function templates but in this tutorial
I want to tell you guys aside from just
functions being able to use templates
entire classes can use templates as well
and again by template all I mean is a
generic data type so let's go ahead and
build it right now so just like before
the way you make a template definition
doesn't change you go ahead and write
template and then inside your angle
brackets you write class and I might as
well you know start good programming
practice and use what people typically
use and that's just one capital letter
instead of you know a word you can use a
word I like using word but since I'm
teaching you guys might as well get into
a good habit so now after this now we
basically made a generic data type we
can begin making our class so go ahead
and name a class I'm going to name mine
Bucky and let's say that well let me add
my semicolon before I got before I
forget Bucky is going to have two
variables now we don't know what those
variables are yet whether they're in
stubble so I'm just going to name them T
my generic data type one is going to be
name first and one's going to be name
second so now let's throw a couple
functions inside Bucky so they're both
going to be public might as well go
ahead and make our constructor Bucky and
in our constructor let's just go ahead
and for two numbers set first and second
equal to whatever numbers we pass in so
T a and T B basically we're passing in
two numbers which we don't know what
type of numbers they are yet so now
let's go ahead and set first equal to a
and second equal to B so now these two
numbers and Bucky are going to have a
value so that's what's going to happen
whenever we first build a Bucky object
so now after this we can go ahead and
you know just add another method like t
bigger and all this is going to do is
it's going to find out which number is
bigger will actually keep this
constructor definition right in here
well we'll take this bigger function and
we'll build outside because there's a
couple different rules I want that you
guys whenever you build a function
template what I say function template
what the heck is that whenever you build
a function member outside the
Declaration of class template so let's
go ahead and do that right now and make
sure I have all my semicolons in the
right place I looks good that's good one
down there looks good so far I guess
we'll find out later on when I run it
but okay now the first thing I want to
know is that even though we made a
generic type of data right here whenever
you have a function member outside the
Declaration of the class and remember we
said we're going to be building a
function called bigger that belonged to
the class Bucky but we're going to be
doing it outside the class we always
need to have that function definition
again so go ahead and copy this and
paste it I don't know why they made it
where you need it again but they did so
before every single function you need to
have that now here is how you start out
building your function members outside
the Declaration of the class template
you first write your return type and our
return type is of course T just our
generic return type and then just like
before you write what class you're going
to be working with so I'm going to be
working with Bucky and I'm going to be
building a function called bigger but we
just can't go ahead and type you know
the function body right here we need to
do something first
right after your class name you need to
add angle brackets and add your T right
here too and this is because we need to
tell C++ at the
functions template parameter is the same
one that we're going to be using for the
class so in order to do that we need to
specify that T inside angle brackets
right after we class name everything
that's kind of weird well I agree with
it it is kind of weird and it's kind of
stupid too but if you think this is
stupid and complicated you're going to
have to take it up with the people who
made C++ I just teach it for the record
I don't think it should be made this way
but you know after the class name you
need to include that function template
parameter again I think it's a stupid
way of doing it but hey I didn't make
C++ I just teach it so now we can go
ahead and you know what well of course
this function called bigger is just
going to take the two numbers that are
in the Bucky class first and second and
it's going to find which one is bigger
so it's basically going to be the
opposite of what we did last time so
just go ahead and return and we'll
compare if first is bigger than second
then return first else return second so
this looks good go right now now well I
think that's all we have to do for a
class so basically we have a class
called Bucky now Bucky has two variables
in it a first and a second variable now
whenever we make a Bucky object that's
when we give the first and second
variable their values so first is going
to be like 10 and second is going to be
like 20 and now we have another function
just to find out which number is bigger
so whenever we call the bigger function
it's going to take the first number and
the second number which would be like 10
and 20 if 10 is bigger it's going to
return 10 if 20 is bigger it's going to
return 20 so now let's go ahead and make
our Bucky object and run this and let me
show you guys how it works so if you
think you guys know how to do this you
don't because there's one other little
weird thing that you have to do you go
ahead and make your Bucky object that
just as you think you would
making Bucky Bucky object and since this
is a constructor that takes two
parameters first and second we need to
give it its two
numbers like 69 and 105 and now after
this we can go ahead and you know see
out bo the bigger and remember this
bigger doesn't take those two numbers as
parameters since this class already has
two variables in it it's just going to
go ahead and grab those variables so as
you can see in this bigger function we
don't need to pass it in those two
numbers it already has it so let's go
ahead and build an around this and say
all right what the heck is this why are
we getting an error message that's
because whenever well let's read the
error message I'll show you guys what it
says missing template arguments before
Bo whenever we're working with the class
template we need to explicitly tell it
what type of data we want to substitute
for T and we're going to be working with
integers because 69 and 105 are integers
so between your class name and your
object you need to pass in I and T in
angle brackets so like I said before
before we go ahead and start making
these objects if you think you know
where you're doing you don't this is
what people typically forget so in the
last couple tutorials we could have done
this it was optional I decided to
exclude it well in this tutorial we
absolutely need to have it and whenever
we do this we're basically saying all
right this is what we're going to be
substituting for T so if this was double
and we made our class object anywhere
this class saw T it would plug in double
right here these two numbers are doubles
when our constructor is made we're going
to passing in two doubles whenever you
run the function it's going to be a
double instead of a T well since we're
going to be working with integers we're
basically telling our class anywhere you
see a T substitute integer for it so
that way we can work with you know
different types of objects and you know
maybe we'll make one class an integer
and one plus a double and well let me go
ahead and first run this and show you
guys that it indeed works 105 is indeed
the bigger number and if you don't
believe me I'll just change this
you know 258 and run it again and show
you guys that our program is working
correctly so basically there are a
couple weird rules the first rule I want
to tell you guys is every single
function you build you need to precede
it with this function template it's kind
of weird but it's what you need to do
also you need to have the blank generic
data type after your class name and this
pretty much tells your function that we
are indeed working with the classes
template parameter which is this one and
also the last thing you guys got to
watch out for is whenever you make your
objects you need to explicitly tell your
object what type of data to substitute
for T and you do that between your class
and your object declaration right here
so there are a couple of weird rules
again I want to say this if you guys are
stuck on templates and this is just way
too confusing for you guys all the
substitution forget about them you don't
need to build it it's just if you want
to build a program that takes less code
and makes it a little bit easier then
you have the option doing this but it
isn't a requirement so if you don't
completely understand it don't worry
about it you can move on and you know
you're not going to be lost in C++ so
anyways thank you guys for watching
