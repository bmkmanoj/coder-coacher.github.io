fascinating tutorial this is gonna blow
your mind
actually not really but anyway so I
thought you know I've kind of built it
up a little bit and in this video I want
to start off talking about strings in
variables and how to make multiple line
string variables
sounds pretty fun huh so basically we
know that we can have strings as
variables and you know you can also set
variables equal to strings and use them
in method so let me go ahead and show
you as an example let's make a variable
called B and aside from just writing a
number or value we can actually set this
equal to the string bacon now instead of
just you know using a string with a
method on it we can actually use that
variable such is this puts you are
correct explanation point if B reverse
double equal sign
what's bacon no cab do you guys know
that that bacon in reverse was no cab so
basically unlike before where we just
used that string and then put a method
on it we can now use the variable which
represents the string and we can run an
inside program so we're saying okay
print out on the screen you are correct
if the reverse of bacon equals no cap
does it yes it does so there you go and
you know that's just a simple
explanation of how you can use strings
as variables but you guys probably knew
that already well I want to teach you
guys in this tutorial is how to make a
multiple line string variable so
whenever you want to make a string
variable in it's really long like maybe
a paragraph or something that takes up
multiple lines you can use the double
less than sign to take out multiple
lines so I'm go ahead and show you guys
an example so say we made a variable
call tuna Y because I love tuna but we
know that this string variable is gonna
take up multiple lines so in order to
give it a starting point in the ending
point we need to use the double less
than sign to mark the beginning and the
end of the string so go ahead and write
a mini marker I'm just gonna name mine
mark you don't have to you can name
anything you want in this word mark is
mark the beginning and the end of our
string so go ahead and hit enter and
check it out it gives you these little
parentheses and these parentheses pretty
much symbolize the beginning so right
hello my name is Bucky I love ham and
bacon and then whenever we want to
pretty much end our variable just go
ahead and type in mark again now
whenever it sees the word mark it knows
okay this is my symbol to pretty much
end this variable so now our variable is
hello my name is Bucky and I love bacon
and by the way you're saying whoa whoa
this looks pretty good but what the heck
are these backslash and things well in
computer programming backslash n means a
newline so basically whenever you see
this it pretty much means okay go to a
new line so let me go ahead and just put
Wow spelled that wrong
puts tune on the screen and check it out
it says hello my name is Bucky I love
ham and bacon and there you go so just
remember that whenever you want to make
a multiple line string variable you need
to give it a starting point and ending
point and you do this by symbolizing the
word that you're going to use for your
starting point and ending point with
double less than signs now after that
just go ahead and write whatever
variable you want to use and then
whenever you use it it marks the end of
your string variable so there you go for
this tutorial hopefully you know well
I'm pretty sure I confuse the guys
enough for now so I'll give you a break
and once you decided that you want some
more damage then go ahead and to move on
to my next surah where I'm gonna be
talking about interpolation using
expressions inside strings so anyways
thank you guys for watching I'll shut up
now and I'll see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
