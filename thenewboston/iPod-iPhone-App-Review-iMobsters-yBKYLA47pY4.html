welcome to another app review and this
one is for imobsters so let's go ahead
and review this this is pretty much a
mmm if I was compared it to a computer
game is pretty much like pirate quest or
it's pretty much browser-based I don't
know what you call it on an iPod but
it's a well efforts tutorial you'll see
what it is um it starts out with this
little intro right here and after you go
through a quick tutorial I think of you
begin this is your main screen and this
is a screen you're going to be seeing
for pretty much a whole time now you see
a bunch of different buttons and they
can be pretty confusing at first so
that's where we're going to be going
through now the point is pretty much to
level up get new equipment and complete
new missions and be the most powerful
mobster you can be so let's start with
most important part missions right here
now these missions on what they do is
they earn you money and experience
there's a bunch of different types of
missions and they go up you get more
unlocked as you level up now some
missions here's the cost they cost one
energy this one and see this one costs
for energy in a lead pipe or whatever
and how you do it is just click it do it
right here and now you see if you do it
you get money and you also can loot
items from it so that's what mission is
to do they pretty much get experience
first and foremost that's the most
important thing you want and they also
get you money and loot and they do a
bunch of other stuff depending on what
mission is I'm not going to dwell on
that too much so aside from mission you
see another key button is attack right
here this attack is pretty much another
way that you can get experience in again
once you get experience you go to the
next level again growing your mobster
making them more powerful so attack is
pretty much like fighting people and you
can fight people in other mobs or just
other random people so let me go ahead
and attack this guy and says alright we
want to fight now how do you win a fight
and how would you lose your fighting
depends on a couple things one how many
people you have in your mob and i'll be
going over that later to the weapons you
have like if you
clean mission and you loot a weapon then
you can use it and another thing is
attack in defense and these are pretty
much skills or attributes that you can
use so in oh and one more thing as you
can see you also get money and
experience which also helps your money
and also helps you level up but now
let's go back to home as you see they
got common buttons down here and let's
go to equipment now equipment um
basically weapons protection vehicles
you know these these are good for
fighting um you need more attack and for
defense you can go ahead and click
protection and then you get your defense
right there I mean these are all
self-explanatory that's where your
equipment from now profile if you go to
your profile right here this where it
tells you that attack and defense I was
talking about I've six skill points so I
can go ahead and attack increase my tag
increase my defense if I wanna this will
help me for fighting and this is where
you can increase all your attributes but
again self-explanatory not too confusing
now on one thing that might be confusing
is real estate now as you can see I get
money and that's my bank right there and
it says 0 X dot ahead bun and what this
real estate is is pretty much
investments that you can do to get more
money and I don't have enough money to
buy all this yet but i can buy like a
convenience store and this will help my
income you see the countdown of my
income right now i'm earning forty eight
hundred dollars every that amount of
time and the more investment properties
i have more income i can get so that's
one of my favorite features with this
game just because you know i just love
no no reason really i just love doing it
and the last thing you want anytime
someone attacks you they can take your
money and if you want to keep it safe
you can put it in the bank right here so
that's all the bank is whenever someone
attacks you they can't take your money
now let's see else we got the godfather
right here what the godfather is is he
pretty much provides various services
like refill energy change your name
reset your character
but these costs points and you can buy
these points or you get them from
playing the game so that's what that
does and the last thing oh here the more
common buns down here I forgot to tell
you about the last thing I want to tell
you about is recruit now again like I
said fighting heavily depends on how
many people you have in your mouth and
these aren't made up people these are
actual people like me and you who play
this game so if you want to join my mom
enter this code right here e a 9 x 3 k
and what we can do is we can build our
mob and also make it so you know we'll
as a mob everyone watching this youtube
story will be harder to be in fights so
i mean aside from that everything is
pretty self-explanatory it's just a game
that you can keep playing forever and
ever and you can't really get bored
because you keep letting them keep
getting new missions new equipment new
real estate that you can invest in and
it's pretty much an awesome game so
that's why i am berating this game along
with the fact that is entirely free a 9
out of 10 just because this one of those
games you can just keep coming back two
and back to and I mean that's about it
so don't forget to join my mob I hope
you guys enjoyed I'll let you guys play
this with yourself in I bet you'll soon
get addicted to it so thank you guys for
