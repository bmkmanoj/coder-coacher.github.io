video in in this video what I'm going to
be doing is I'm going to be showing you
guys how to install the engine now
usually in these videos what I'm going
to be doing is I'm going to be
explaining to you guys what exactly each
part does and breaking it apart and
taking you guys through why you need it
but the engine is a whole different
beast if I start taking apart this
engine then it's going to be like 15
videos just explaining the engine so I'm
going to give you guys a real quick
overview of what the engine does now
usually the engine and the transmissions
are separate but this is all since this
is such a simple engine just a go-kart
engine they tied it together in this
really nice 150 cc engine basically the
job of any engine whether it's for your
car or you know a truck or go-kart dune
buggy this job is to take gas explode it
and use that power to create a spinning
motion now the engine part that spins is
right here now the reason that you need
to create a spinning motion is of course
that gear right here is going to be
connected via chain to this gear on my
rear axle so of course when the engine
spins a chain turns this rear axle and
then of course this rear axle is going
to be connected to the tires and make
the go-kart move so that's the basic of
you know how you can use gas to make a
go-kart move through the engine
now before I bolt the song let me go
ahead and show you guys where I'm going
to be mounting this on to the engine
this gets mounted on the engine using
two main bolts one that goes from here
to here it bolts onto the frame of there
and also another bolt right here to here
so two heavy-duty bolts make this engine
mounts on the frame because of course
you need to mount it on somehow so
doesn't just you know fall over so let
me go ahead and show you guys how to
mount this baby right now so like I said
Engineering here is built to mount on
your frame in two locations one using
the ball on top and the other one using
the ball on bottom now whenever you
build your own custom frame what you
want to do is you would want to first
measure these two little locations right
here and about brackets onto your frame
specifically to fit this engine but this
frame like I said I already bought it
free loaded so those already built
specifically for this engine so if we
just go ahead and plop it in there there
are already brackets in here to fit it
so the only thing we need to do now is
as you can see the back of this frame
pivots right here so what we do is we
actually put this engine in upside down
and when we pivot it or rotate it back
the engine is going to be right side up
so let me go ahead and show you guys how
to do that right now
hopefully I don't drop it on my toes so
go ahead and make sure you have your
bolt ready
and this little bearing is going to go
through the bolt and then it's going to
screw on by one knot and once we have a
top bolt that's the hardest one the
second one or the bottom one is
relatively easy so I'm going to go ahead
and stick those in my back pocket grab
the engine and another thing you also
want to make sure that there is no oil
in your engine because if you already
put engine oil in then it's going to
leak all over the place whenever you put
upside down so let's hope there's no one
here so right now as you can see I
already slipped the bolt through the
bracket on the frame the bracket on the
engine and also that tube that came with
a bowl now the only other thing I have
to do is line it up with this side and
finish mounting the ball through so
hopefully I can do that without dropping
out on my toes
so there you go right there the topo is
all the way through all right so now
that topo is on there nice and stuff now
we can get to the easier part now that I
don't have to do any more heavy lifting
we just have to line up this bottom bolt
and then our engine will be mounted
so hopefully this bottom is a little bit
easier find the hole go there's one side
I'm gonna have to grab the old trusty
hammer yep oh yeah nothing a little
hammer can't take care of just put the
nut on and tighten up and then this
baby's demerit and flip now if your
engine is already up right then go ahead
and pat yourself on the back you're
ready to move on but if you give one of
these pivoting frames and I really like
this update idea because it's really
easy to pour into whenever you need to
then just go ahead and lower it into
place and there are also two brackets
one right here and one right here and
you just have to uh screw the nuts on
these make sure that your engine does it
you know pull it back up whenever you're
driving or anything but just go ahead
and tighten those two secure brackets
and once you do that you're ready to
move on to the next step so
congratulation your engine is now in
solid I'll see you guys in the next
