11th video and in this video I want to
finish laying out the website itself now
in my website of course it's 1000 pixels
wide and we also are going to have two
main sections we're going to have a
left-hand section which is going to be
the links and the main section now right
now there's a picture in here and some
other little boxes but the key thing we
have to focus on is the left section and
the main section or the side section in
the main section now let's go ahead and
work on that side section first then I'm
going to go this go ahead and in this
main aside because the html5 element is
named and aside now let me go ahead and
take care of the width first now the
width of this is going to be two hundred
and eight pixels now the width is
critical because we have to take no of
all these values because between the
side section in the main section we
cannot exceed the complete with of our
wrapper which is 1000 pixels if we do
everything that's going to look really
messed up so our width is 208 pixels now
aside from the width I also want to add
some margins to this if it was budded
right up against the top of the search
bar it'll look a little funny and also
if it was pressed right up against the
right-hand side of this main section it
would look funny so that's why I added
this a little bit of white space here
and here on the top and in the right
hand side so it just separates it and
makes it look easier on the eyes so in
order to do that I'm going to go ahead
and hit margin top 10 pixels and also
margin right which I just can do this
little copy and paste trick I learned
margin right 10 pixels and like I said
that gives that the little bit of space
on the right-hand side and on the top
now after this what I want to do is you
might not be able to tell but there's a
thin red border all around this and it
just makes it kind of pop out a little
bit so that's what I want to do now add
a border width of 1 pixel now check this
up whenever you have a section like
we're creating right now the width is
not only the with you determine rate he
you have to take a bunch of other things
into account the first thing is of
course the width 208 the second thing is
any margins on the left and right so at
first you look and we have a margin rate
of 10 pixels so since that is part of
this entire section are now the complete
width of this is now 20 8 plus 10 pixels
on the right so 218 so just remember
that we have to 18 right now now in
addition to all of that we have a border
that surrounds this entire thing that is
one pixel wide on each side left right
top and bottom now further with its only
the left and right so two pixels on a 1
pixel border so 208 plus one on the left
plus another one on the right for the
border plus a margin rate of 10 pixels
gives you 220 pixels total so just
remember that we have 220 pixels total
that we have to work with right here
that means whenever we create our main
section since our total width of the
website is 1000 we cannot exceed 780
pixels why because 780 + 220 right here
is going to give us our thousand now the
last thing I want to do is float this to
the left and what that's going to do is
take this and push it up against the
left because that's where we want it now
that we have our side section created we
can go ahead and make our main section
now the first thing I want to do is also
put a margin on top of here because we
already added some space on here in
order to get it aligned with this give
this one a margin top of 10 so I guess I
might as well go ahead and copy this
baby right here now I also want to give
this a margin bottom if of 20 pixels so
let me just go ahead and copy that
margin bottom
of 20 pixels and that is just because
whenever the main section ends I really
don't want things on button up against
the very bottom of it or else it's going
to look kind of weird so that's why I
decided to give up Marge bottom of 20
pixels and whenever we create the footer
and add some links down there you'll see
but it's kind of hard to explain now and
the last thing I want to do well not the
last thing but I want to float this to
left and you're saying whoa whoa whoa
this thing is already to the left so why
are you floating this to the left if we
want it on the right-hand side well it
doesn't really float both of these
things right up against the left-hand
side it just moves this to the left and
then instead of just you know having
this flow over here or in the middle it
just bumps it up as far as it can to the
left without overlapping this so they're
nice pressed up together like you know
fitting the pieces of a puzzle together
so I'm going to float that left in the
last thing we need to do is we actually
need to give this a width because
clearly it has no with yet so remember
this the total width of our website was
a thousand pixels this main side section
was 220 pixels so the width of this in
order to fit perfectly on our website is
780 pixels so just go ahead and remember
this if you don't remember anything else
from this story not only when you're
determining the width of boxes is the
width of factor but also your border
your padding and your margin so don't
forget all those things so the last
thing I want to do is I actually want to
work on this footer right here what's
right now there are only three links but
you know this might be the frequently
asked questions or the contact us might
be down here or maybe the terms of use
copyright all that good stuff so let's
go ahead and just style that right now
main footer and the first thing I want
to do is add padding top of about 30
pixels we can adjust that more of or
less whenever we start creating our
website and now what I want to do is
clear both now if i can type this
correctly what clear both does is
is it pretty much means no floating
elements are allowed on either side of
this so let's say that um I don't know
this wasn't a hundred percent with so
something might float to the left or
right but we don't want that we want the
footer to stand out all alone so that's
why we want to clear both since these
two elements were floating just making
sure and aside from that I want the font
size to be a little bit smaller so let
me go ahead and set this equal to 10
pixels and that is because the footer
isn't really a main part of your website
you don't want to get it confused with
the main content you want to clearly see
that it's just additional information
that may be the not most important
information but it's there if you want
it so that's why I made the font size
slightly smaller just for design
purposes so anyways in the next tutorial
what we're going to be doing is we're
going to be styling the inner workings
of the search box and also all of the
buttons for the website now I want to
mention this before you guys start
freaking out that this is taken way too
long just for this one file I know this
is taken long to style this one file but
this isn't one file this is the styling
for the entire website once we style
this stuff we don't have to style any of
this anymore so there you go i hope that
gave you a little bit of confidence
because i know it takes a long time but
you know it's very important so anyways
thank you guys for watching don't forget
to subscribe in the next tutorial
hopefully we'll be finishing up this
