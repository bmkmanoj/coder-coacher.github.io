welcome to your fifth intermediate draft
tutorial and in this story we're going
to be finishing up the program that we
started on last time so what we did end
it up is we actually ended up for now
list two but I changed it back to list
one and now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to go ahead and write a method
called edit list and this is a method
that we're going to be building in this
tutorial and we're going to be passing
list one and I named this more things
and let's see yep
list one and list two there we go
embarrassing let's do so this is a
method that we're going to be making so
it says create method you're going to
get air that's alright for now so next
we're just going to put system.out.print
line and we're just going to pin brake
line put point and break your line print
a blank line there we go and then we're
going to print out list one again so
you're saying all right what exactly is
going hunting here well in this method
what we're going to do is we're going to
edit list number one and take out items
so what we want to happen here is we
want it to print out eggs lasers hats
and pie and then it's going to run this
method right here that we're going to
build and then it's going to print out
eggs and pie because it's going to
delete these two so you'll see in a few
seconds what's going on so now we get in
this error
create method all right we will so in
this method let's go ahead and make it
public static void and we name the Edit
list and of course it takes two
parameters which are collections list
one and list two so it's gun takes a
collection and you couldn't passage um
excuse me a list but for polymorphism
you usually want pie Pasi the highest
thing possible so let's go ahead and
pass it a string we'll just name this
one L one that kind of looks like a 1 1
or 11 very confusing but I like
confusing things collection and it
passes string and we'll just name this
one l2 for simplicity and in our body of
our method let's go ahead and let me
introduce something very important
elections and especially this named an
iterator iterator and of course I
imported this earlier on so um dice
about that all right yep and pass it in
what do you want to iterate it through
and of course if you don't know what a
iterator is it pretty much goes through
each list item by item wow that's a
really good explanation I just did that
on the fly pretty good pretty proud of
myself so we wanted to go through string
data and I'm going to name my iterator
it because you know give it a cool name
so it's going to loop through list one
and then you just need to put iterator
just because you know lo Java thing and
now you have an iterator that can loop
through list number one and of course
you've got list number one is eggs
lasers hats and pie
elissa number two is lasers and hats so
again what we're going to be doing is
taking out the items from list number
two from list number one so anyways we
have an iterator let's do it so next
we're going to need to make a while loop
to actually do this stuff so while it
has next and what this means is all this
statement means is loop through until
you reach the end of the list
so while has next while I have something
next to go to Wow another good
explanation by me I'm very proud of
myself so every item you get to you're
going to check if it contains list
number two so if the list number two
contains just put it right there on it
that next and what this is saying is
this is if so here let me remove there
we go so what we're going to be doing is
saying RA if the list number two that we
passed in which there's only two items
if it contains anything that we loop
through let me explain it this way we're
going to loop through item by item right
here and in this if statement we're
going to be checking if that item is in
the list number two and if it is in the
list number two we're going to remove it
from list number one so that's all we
need to do and this might be
easier if I put now is pretty easy right
now so let me go ahead and run this and
that's our project so what we did first
is we printed out all the items in list
number one eggs lasers hat spy when did
we do that right here
Prerna items on list number one eggs
lasers hat spy then we ran a program
called edit list and my program I mean
method and what this did is remove all
the items from list number two in this
number one and then the printed a blank
line just so you can return the next
line and it printed out the items again
so now it removed lasers and hats which
was list number two and printing out the
list again
and how did this edit list work well how
it worked is you pass the end to list
which was this list and this list make
this a little more even and you made a
iterator objects so just so you can loop
through item the item in list number one
and then you set alright while loop
through each of these items this this
this this for this item
see if list number two contains it nope
for this item this is actually list
number one I don't know what I'm doing
for this item is this in list number two
yep so I'm going to delete it for this
item is this in list number two yep so
I'm going to delete it for this item is
this in list number two nope
so we can keep it so that's why eggs and
pie were able to be kept and that's the
pretty much the power of a list again
dynamic pretty awesome and that's it for
this tutorial so thank you guys for
watching and don't forget subscribe and
I'll see you next door</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
