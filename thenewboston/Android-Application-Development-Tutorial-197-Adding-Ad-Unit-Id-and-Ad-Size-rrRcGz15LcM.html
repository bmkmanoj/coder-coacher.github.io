tutorial for the new Boston again we're
going to be working with AdMob and
obviously we're getting some major
problems here so we're going to clean
those up in this tutorial and then we're
pretty much gonna be done I might show
you guys how to you know put an ad
through Java alone not using an XML
layout like we are here but then we're
pretty much done with AdMob so I'll
probably do a quick overview of
everything that we've done at the end of
this tutorial just to make sure you guys
are running properly and you can hit
those key points there so as we can see
our ad view is missing the required XML
attribute called ad size so we're going
to switch back over to the XML layout
and set up our ad size we're going to
set this equal to be is adds colon add
size because again that's what we're
missing equals and then within
quotations banner all up case and then
we pretty much have our ad size laid out
as you can see this is what's being
displayed to show you know how big our
ad is and all that great stuff so that's
how it's going to appear again if we
wanted to do like relative layout we can
move it around and all that stuff that's
about the size that's going to take up
for application now the only other thing
we need to do is add a reference to
actual AdMob account through the ad unit
ID so we're going to change this text
here and it's just going to be you know
something like I don't know something
like that we're just going to open up
again in our browser AdMob comm go to
the market place and then just click on
the sites and apps I'm just going to
shoot down again below here and skip
over my earnings and all that stuff and
then we have our project that we set up
a few tutorials ago here called the New
Boston basics or whatever you guys
labeled your project as and we're just
going to go to manage settings and right
here is where our publisher ID is I'm
going to block it out because again it's
probably against the terms and
everything so I'll just copy and paste
that code so we're just going to copy it
there and we're going to paste it here
I'm just going to make one up like
like that and make sure when you guys
copy if there's like a space here a
space at the beginning make sure you
delete those spaces otherwise your ad is
not going to work so just make sure you
copy and paste it and I'm just going to
quickly talk through everything and then
I'm going to paste my real code and try
and run it on the emulator and talk
about that as well so again all we have
to do is we have to add our jar into our
project it should be under this resource
libraries in Google AdMob SDK then we go
into our manifest we want to make sure
we have the internet permission we also
want to make sure we have the access
network state permission then we also
have to define an activity within our
application that has the Android name
and then you know this name here and the
hitting the configuration setup as well
and then we just go into our XML layout
or wherever we want to set up or add and
we got to have all of these variables
with an ID it's reference in Java if we
choose and height which is both wrapped
content and then we have a unit ID and a
load oncreate so it's going to load our
applica it's going to load our ad within
the create method of whatever
application we use this layout as our
set content view and we're also going to
set the ad size the banner so now I'm
just going to cut our paste my real code
and run it on the emulator so we're
going to go to our first activity here
called starting point we're going to
open that up and hopefully we have an ad
set up and the first time you run it
it's going to take a couple minutes
before your ad appears so just make sure
you note my time and hopefully we'll see
when that appears and again I'm just
going to clip the video all right guys
well AdMob says it takes about two
minutes for the first time you run it
but it looks like it's obviously taking
longer than that so I'll probably just
catch you guys in the next tutorial
and if this still isn't working by like
tomorrow I don't know if it's because
it's like 2 a.m. or something it's going
to take longer I don't know what's going
on but if I realize I messed up on
anything I'll let you guys know and
it this video I guess there should be a
little Porsche at the end but I believe
it would load up it just register with
AdMob but I'll catch you guys in the
next tutorial have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
