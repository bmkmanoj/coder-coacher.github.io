need to do is we need to download and
install Xcode which is essentially that
software that were going to be writing
all of our code and it also has some
other cool tools for visually designing
your app dragging buttons on quickly
like changing the background colors of
stuff and just a bunch of awesome tools
so go to your iOS development center if
you're not already there if you're
watching my last tutorial then this is
the link right here or you can just
click like back a hundred times and I'll
bring you back many ways once you're in
there go down to this section and click
the download Xcode 6 button now we can
either just download 6.1 at the again
this version is going to change
depending on when you're watching this
video but I don't like to download the
beta because I really don't need it for
anything and I'm afraid that there may
be a few bugs in there since it is beta
so I'm just going to click this one the
stable version and it brings us to the
App Store since the app store is where
you have to download all your apps for
your Mac so you click install and it
starts installing I apparently have to
click it twice alright cool
so now let me enter my ID and it starts
downloading and installing and actually
if you go to purchases then you can
pretty much see the status of it so it's
a pretty big program this one is two and
a half gigabytes so it's going to take a
while I have an estimated time of 12
minutes right now so instead of just
sitting here and tell you some stories
for 12 minutes what I'm going to do is
I'm going to stop the screen recorder
and I'm going to come back to you guys
whenever this is done alrighty then very
nice very nice it looks like it is
downloaded and installed and since we're
going to be using quite a bit you might
as well just stick on your dock so if
you close out of this then you can go to
your finder which is this little face
button right there and if you go to your
applications then that's where
everything is pretty much all your
programs and Xcode just drag it and put
it right somewhere on your dock
all right so now let me close out a list
and let's open it and make sure that it
exists all right so let me of course
agree to something else all right so
here is the home screen if you don't
want this to open up every time that you
open Xcode then you can click this
little check mark show this window when
Xcode launches and eventually when we
start developing projects they're going
to appear all the recent projects on the
right-hand side but for now if you see
this then you guys are good to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
