another backgammon tutorial in this
tutorial I'm going to be doing is
teaching guys another technique and this
technique is called hitting them to kind
of slow down their momentum I know it's
kind of a long name but just deal with
me so anyways what we have set up here
is white already made their first move
so what they did is they move their
seventeen point three or sixteen point
and they also take it off their twenty
four point under your five point so what
we need to do now is play our role so we
being brown rolled a two and A one now a
noob might do something stupid like this
you might play as two two twenty two and
your one to twenty three to get his
twenty four checkers out there but what
a better play is is this for your two
you're going to want to go ahead and
play your 13 near eleven in Tier one
you're going to want to take a checker
off your six and hit them on the thigh
right there and this is going to send
their checker on the bar you're saying
all right Bucky why would it be better
for me to move these two chips and leave
them susceptible instead of advanced in
my last two twenty four checkers just
like that well there are a couple of
reasons why you'd want to hit them in
this case then just going ahead and
advancing your last few checkers the
first reason is this what what is trying
to do is they're trying to build a point
on your five point now this is a
critical point not only when you're
trying to bear up but when you're trying
to just advance your checkers and land
on your five point so you don't want to
give up this point without fight so
that's why it's useful or hit them now a
sack format what you need to do is and
this is the whole point of this sorrow
is you hit them whenever you want to
slow down their momentum and what that
means is this whenever white makes his
next role check this out he got a one in
the two instead of just moving some of
these checkers one and two or this one
through spaces or whatever even though
he can't even do that he need to spend
an entire dice just getting off the bar
so instead of having two rolls or excuse
me two moves to make he can only make
one move that's actually beneficial to
him and the other move he just spends
getting
not the bar so anytime you can make your
opponent spend time getting off the bar
instead of doing something useful that's
beneficial to you and the last point I
want to make is while you're saying re
Bucky but if he's on the bar and you
left this ball open to get hit then
isn't that susceptible for him to hit
you if you're old five then you end up
on the bar well this is something that
you typically don't need to worry about
early on the game first of all like I
said you want to fight for these points
in fighting for crucial points is more
important than worrying about getting
hit early in the game and I'll tell you
why because it early in the game right
now remember when you enter you enter in
his home board look at it right now look
how open it is pretty much unless you're
old double sixes you're going to be able
to play this checker it's going to be
really easy in the opening
turns to get your checker off so the
easier it is to get this checker up the
less you have to worry about getting hit
it right now any roll one through five
you're going to be able to move this
baby off right there so that is why in
this case hitting would be better than
just advancing to normal checkers from
behind</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
