Roberts and in this video series I'm
going to be teaching you guys how to
build a go-kart so what I have behind me
if you guys can't see it is a go-kart
frame doesn't even have an engine and
wheels nothing in yet so what I'm going
to be doing is I'm going to be taking
you guys through piece by piece part by
part start from scratch how to build a
go-kart so any guys are you know
interested in learning how to go to a
go-kart or maybe just want to learn how
to work with small engines then I think
you're going to enjoy this series so
thing gets for watching in let's go
ahead and get started alright guys so
this is what we have to start with the
frame of the go-kart which is basically
just the skeleton of the go-kart the
go-kart without any pieces yet so this
is your guys first code and you guys
don't even know how to get a frame you
can either make one yourself which in
order to do that you just you would
obviously need to know how to weld by a
bunch of metal tubing and weld it
together into whatever style that you
want but what I did with this is I
actually duct well my friend bought it
online but we got this one online and
whenever you get them online you can get
them pre-welded so this one came just
like this in the only piece that came on
it is the rear axle right here this big
gold tube and this is where you stick
the back tires on basically so that's
all we have right there to start with
what we have to do is put the engine in
first and then I'm going to be working
with the transmission all the tires all
that crap over there and also on my
workbench over there so yep obviously if
you can't tell already we got a long
ways to go so in the next video what I'm
going to be doing is I'm going to be
getting started by dropping the engine
in it and I'm also going to be taking
guys through not only showing you guys
where the pieces go but I'm going to be
explaining you guys why you need the
pieces and you know just talking about
them in general so that's what we had to
look forward to it looks like a lot of
work right now but uh I'm ready for it a
few guys are so thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe for
all the latest videos and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
