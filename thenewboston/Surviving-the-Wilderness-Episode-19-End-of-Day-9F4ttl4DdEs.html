I got a little bit longer and I should
be coming up on like that Road or
something like that I mean I'm not
seeing much of anything that I saw
before but I mean it goes I don't know
it should be there I know that I'm
really hungry right now I actually get a
little bit thirsty already but my pants
are soaked from walking through water
and all this do on the ground hurry and
just enough to keep the ground soggy so
that sucks but I don't know I can't
really even feel it but my opinion I am
almost to where I started I think so
getting kind of close yeah all right
well I'm taking a little break I've been
walking for like three hours I think
come to the conclusion that might
actually be lost cuz pretty sure that's
about how long it took me to walk to get
where I was total and I haven't seen
anything that I recognize really just
wanting that here so I think I'm just
gonna keep going south and the West
because I know I'll go east and heading
deeper into the Adirondacks which is you
got sort of all I want to do mmm
so both those directions will bring me
farther away so sooner or later I got to
find a road town I don't care anything
that's not woods
hopefully somebody that I find has a
double cheeseburger with them that
they're not hungry enough to eat and at
least a gallon of water
well I'm going to sit down for a couple
more minutes
and probably just keep any
now
and
then
there's got to be something somewhere
close
but right now I really have no idea
where I am it off so it's kind of
exciting actually I'm
pretty freaked out right now so
see how the next couple of
hours go and where they're gonna take me
and that's pretty much it
you
all right at this point I am lost I have
no idea where I am at all it's been
several hours since I've taped I don't
even care about it anymore really I I
kind of panicked and I was moving a
little too much and tripped and twisted
my ankle a little bit so just as a
little icing onto my cake right now I
don't know what I'm gonna do I'm not
gonna move around at all anymore tonight
it's almost dark as it is and there's no
sense in me messing I'll be even worse
trying to get out of here before it gets
too dark to move so it looks like I'm
screwed for the night again camped out
here I should have been home hours ago
hours should have been at my house
already this is the worst experience of
my life I only hope that I can find a
way out of here tomorrow so don't have
to live out here and then die out here
so at this point I'm gonna have to call
it a night feel like I'm starving to
death actually and I'm getting kind of
thirsty
and but kind of I mean extremely I don't
see how I could have gotten so lost
where I haven't found anything I
recognized in a day of walking
probably was the worst decision I've
ever made to make this bet by far it's
not even close to worth the money from
all the strain I put myself through
right now I don't know just kind of
sucks not over
or what I'm gonna get home
so hopefully
I find something that leads me to people
or somehow bump into someone
or at this point pretty much rude so I
don't know if I'm going to tape again
tonight probably not I don't have the
energy to even turn the camera on and
talk I'm gonna try and just not move as
much as possible
so
I guess it'll probably be a morning chat
and I'll put my last will and testament
yeah all right that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
