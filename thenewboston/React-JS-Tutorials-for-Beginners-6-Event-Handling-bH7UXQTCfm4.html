this video I am going to show you guys
how to use event handling with react so
say that you had this component and your
component had some buttons on it of
course whenever the user click one of
those buttons you would want to be able
to handle that event or in other words
just do something depending on what the
button said so that's what I'm going to
be showing you guys how to do aka event
handling so in the upcoming tutorials
I'm going to start making a very simple
app to kind of demonstrate a bunch of
stuff and I think it's a little bit
easier to see how all of these you know
concepts are together in a simple
project instead of just showing you guys
a bunch of weird demos so what I'm going
to be doing is I'm going to be making
kind of a sticky note app where the user
can add new notes or delete or edit
notes and I don't know they can write
whatever notes they want like walk the
dog arm I have a note for their favorite
movies just pretty much a bunch of
comments that they can edit delete I
don't know it's the first thing that
popped into my head so let's go ahead
and make a new component and I named it
comments now all this is going to be is
essentially a block that's going to have
some text on it depending whatever your
comment is and will have a button for
editing it and another button for
deleting it so very simple so react
great class
alright so of course the very first
thing I do whenever I make a component
is no matter how many different features
I want to add to it no matter how
interactive it's going to be I just go
ahead and I make the plain HTML and then
I just add dummy data so maybe this is a
component that has a photo that changes
all the time well when I first make it
I'm just going to put in some image um
just some static image just to make sure
that it works and is displayed how I
want it to so for a render remember this
is just going to be equal to a function
and it's just going to return some HTML
so I actually have a bunch of the CSS
already styled so you can style this
however you want um you know this isn't
really a CSS tutorial but if you want
the same styling is me then go
in the first video um get that repo
downloaded and the CSS file is right
here so there you go but again if you
don't have the CSS then just style it
however you want it to look so this
entire thing is going to be in a div and
I already made a style called comment
container so for the class name you set
this equal to comment container just
like that now that brings me to another
point and that is this right here you
can add um attributes just like you
would in normal HTML using JSX
however the reason that we can't write
class right here is because class is
already a reserved keyword in JavaScript
a JavaScript class actually means
something so that's why in JSX we have
to write class name so most of your
other attributes are going to find just
right normal HTML but sometimes if they
class your javascript then that's what
JSX did and I'll keep a heads-up in case
I come across it again
but anyways inside this comment what
we're going to have is basically a div
and two buttons so the div is just going
to be the text of whatever OPA for
whatever and two buttons all right so
this first one is just going to be for
editing the comment and the second one
is just going to be for deleting
actually let me just go ahead and name
that remove all right now I already
styled these as well so the text it
actually has a class name of pretty
creative way to hear it comment text and
all the styling does is it makes it a
little bit bold and it adds some spacing
between the text and the buttons
that's all and um these button classes I
already style these as well so I made a
class called button primary which is
blue and another one that is red called
button danger so now our edit button is
blue and our remove button is red I
thought that was kind of appropriate
alright so what we want to happen is
whenever the
user clicks these buttons then something
happens so before we can add an onclick
attribute we actually need to make
functions because essentially we're
going to say whenever you click this
call a function in this component now we
already have this function right here
called render and this is a function
responsible for drawing or displaying
some HTML but we can actually make our
own custom functions in named them
whatever we want so I'm going to make
one called edit and again this is just
equal to a function now this can do
whatever we want um we can lock
something out on the screen we can just
make some alert pop-up and right now
keep things simple we're just make an
alert pop-up that says edit name comment
now we're going to make another function
and eventually um whenever we call these
functions we're going to be able to edit
the comment and it's actually going to
delete it but for right now I'll just
say remove we'll just make an alert
pop-up to show you guys that hey you can
actually have event handling with your
components so right now we have these
cool functions an edit function and a
remove function and whenever you call
them they display a pop-up that says
editing or removing comment but we
didn't link these buttons to these
functions in any kind of way so how do
we do that how do we say whenever we
click this button to call this function
or this function well what you do is you
actually add another on click attribute
now this is going to be equal to this
function so whenever we click Edit it's
going to call on click call this
function so how do you do that well
since this is a function from the same
class we just need to write this and
then a dot separator and then the
function name so whenever we click the
edit button just call this classes or
components edit function just like that
now the same thing with a remove
whenever you click the on or remove
button just go ahead and call this
components
remove function or method I guess it's
more technically called so there you go
and now we actually need to render this
so let me clean this up so it's nice and
neat for future tutorials alright so I'm
taking all these comments and I'm
surrounding them inside a board and all
this board is is some styling to give it
a nice light blue background as you guys
can see right here so whenever I want to
make a new comment and all I have to
write is comment just like that and
right hey now and check this out so
whenever i refresh this we can actually
test these right now if I click Edit we
get our alert popping up whenever I
click remove we get our another alert
popping up so we know that our event
handlers they are working properly but
again like I said one thing I want to do
from here is instead of just having the
static text just like this I actually
want to take whatever text is in between
these comment eggs and I want to display
that for the comment so let me just
write something like South write a a my
name is Bucky for one comment and then
for another one I'll write of beans
something stupid and then for another
one I'll write tuna just so we have
three different comments so right now
whenever i refresh this and take a look
at my application all of these comments
are the same because we just said
display text we didn't say do anything
with this so how do we access the data
in between these tags so we can actually
use it in our component well this is
actually a built in property called
children so again the children property
is just any data that's in between the
opening tag and closing tag so remember
that I said in like two tutorials ago
whenever you want to use properties you
just use this props and then the name of
the property in this one
is just children so whenever i refresh
this check it out
it gets whatever is in between these
tags which are the children which is a
static text in this example and for each
component render it displays it in
between this div tag so I know I threw a
lot of you guys but again what we
covered in this video is first of all
event handling now event handling I
can't even talk right now is how you can
pretty much make custom functions in
your component and you can call those
with on click and there are other event
handlers as well but unclick is the most
famous one and also whenever you want to
pass data in between these tags you can
access it through the children property
so pretty cool way and yeah I think
that's it that's enough info for this
lesson so then guys watching I will see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
