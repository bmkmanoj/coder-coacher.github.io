made it through the very first Ajax
example now we can go ahead and see if
this frickin thing works so it says
enter the food that we would like to
order well let's see if they have apples
I'm sorry Punk we do not sell no apples
oh that's kind of rude but okay let's
see if I can order any tuna of course
they do have tuna and let's say let's
see if they have a bacon they don't have
any baked on once we finish typing it we
do have bacon alright this HX program
and also this food store is freaking
awesome so now let me go ahead and talk
you guys through one more time exactly
how it was made the very first thing we
did is we just created a very simple
interface for the user
now this interface also linked to the
JavaScript file so here is the interface
right here and this is the only thing
that the user is able to see now
basically what happens is they go ahead
and type in something like bacon now
what happens well it links to the
JavaScript file so in the JavaScript
file the very first thing that the
JavaScript file does is it creates this
xml httprequest object now what this
object does is it allows you to
communicate with the server behind the
scenes it's actually a very powerful
object so basically whenever the user
types something it takes whatever input
they typed in this instance bacon and it
sends it off to the PHP file now the PHP
file is just going to go ahead and check
in the store or on the server to say
okay do we have bacon and it's going to
send back a message either saying we do
or sorry we don't sell that and it's
going to send it back to the JavaScript
file in the form of XML document now the
JavaScript file again whenever it gets
that message back what it's going to do
is it's going to dissect the XML
document and it's basically going to
find the message and then
set some element on your HTML file equal
to that message so that's basically
what's happening behind the scenes again
this is what the user sees and your
javascript file in your PHP file are
going to constantly talk back and forth
the JavaScript file is going to send a
request then the PHP is going to send it
back and answer in the form of XML
document and whenever it gets the answer
it's going to update your HTML file so
that is how a very simple program and
Ajax works and in the next couple of
toriel's what I want to do is I want to
talk to you guys about security and also
show you guys how to build you know all
one of those things from Google where
it's like it guesses what you're trying
to query and I also want to show you
guys how to validate forms and I want to
do a bunch of other stuff and also I
should mention this I'm finally going to
be showing you guys how to add the
functionality to the website I was
talking guys about whenever you like a
status or you want notifications to show
up on the right-hand side of your
webpage and trust me this tutorial
series is going to be awesome
but for now thank you guys for watching
and I guess I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
