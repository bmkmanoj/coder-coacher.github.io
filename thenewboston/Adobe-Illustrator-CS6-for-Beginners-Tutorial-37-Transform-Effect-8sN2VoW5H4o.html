illustration cs6 tutorial today we're
gonna learn our very first effect in
Illustrator cs6 and this is called the
transform effect and it's pretty cool
you're going to be able to create
multiple transformation copies across
your image so let's go ahead and get
started go ahead and so make an image
and select it and we want to do is go
into effect and then you want to go to
distort and transform and then go to
transform now this is gonna pop up the
first thing you want to check is preview
so you can see what the hell you're
doing so what I want to do is I want to
create this object moving across a
screen a few times while it's getting
smaller so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna make this scale smaller
I'm gonna go 75 and 75 and it made it
smaller this outside blue is your old
image and then what I want to do is move
this to the right and I found that 220
pixels is good for moving this object
that I made and the rest of it it's
gonna be actually really easy we're
gonna go to this part which says copies
I'm gonna hit 3 because I found out that
this makes enough copies to go across my
page and this is the kind of effect that
we're getting now I could add some angle
to it if I wanted to this is gonna
rotate its angle and if I hit something
like 20 it's going to make like a little
swirly going pattern going on there if I
did maybe some higher you can see what
it's doing it's making even more of a
kind of swirly thing so you can see that
and that's just some of the things that
you can do with this we've got random if
I click that now it's just gonna make
these things random so if you select
that box it applies random
transformations using the values in your
dialog box so when I have that like this
this is what I get let me add some angle
in there and see what happens I hit
random and it just looks like it's
coming closer
maybe I gotta add some vertical in there
or something
we'll see you just mess around with
these kind of things and see what you
can't can get with these randoms
reflecting and you could just do a whole
bunch of different things and see what
your effects that you like and see if
they're like things that you want to use
but that's how you use that and then
when you're done go ahead and hit OK now
if you want to do the same thing twice
that you just did go up to object it go
to transform go to transform again it's
gonna make the whole the same exam exact
thing twice and you can go ahead and
select these with your selection tool
and move them around as you can see
there I think they're in a group no
they're just all one path which is kind
of cool but it's an effect you can't
actually I can't seem to be able to
manipulate these points let's see if we
can with a direct selection tool no
cannot see so if I go ahead and move
this it's gonna move like that if I I'm
unable to actually move the actual
points just so you know and then that's
pretty much it for this tool it's pretty
handy and you can create multiple
iterations of your object on here and
you can do like create multiple patterns
if you're if you're trying to create
multiple objects across the whole entire
screen this would be a quick way to do
it and then when you're moving things
you only have to move the first object
and it's a lot easier and it's a whole
lot easier than duplicating and copying
things all the time and then it's just
faster so thanks a lot for watching the
tutorial you learned your very first
effect which is the transform effect
it's a pretty basic effect but it has
its uses and it's pretty handy if you
liked the video go ahead and give a
thumbs up be sure to subscribe if you
have it yet and leave some comments if
you have any suggestions for any
tutorials that you want to that you want
me to make so thanks a lot for watching
everybody everybody have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
