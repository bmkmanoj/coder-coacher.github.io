video I want to talk to you about your
capture settings now this is probably
going to be one of the most important
videos because it's how you fine-tune
and tell Wireshark exactly what you want
to listen to on your network so like I
said in the last video from the welcome
screen you can go ahead and choose your
interface and do it that way but a
better way in my opinion is to go up to
this capture menu and click interfaces
so this is going to give you all of the
interfaces on your computer that you can
listen from now a lot of people whenever
they first get started they don't know
what one to choose and I like this
because it gives you a little
description first of all so we can see
that okay first of all these ones aren't
even real in the sense that they aren't
physical they are just virtual Nick so
you know I don't really want those so
now I'm left with this local area
connection local area connection - well
what usually you want to do is if you go
to Google and just like in what's my IP
that's the easiest way to find out you
can get the IP address of your computer
in how the internet sees it basically we
can see okay this one 0 0 0 0 probably
don't want that one so this is my main
Nick so this one is actually built into
my motherboard it's on board and like I
said I'm just using my desktop right now
I have an Ethernet cable plugged in so
that's the connection that I want to
listen from now if you want you can just
hit start right here but I am going to
recommend going into your options and
this is going to allow you to access all
of your capture options and give you
more control over all of your settings
now one very important thing that a lot
of people don't even pay attention to is
this right here make sure you have this
checked and that's going to enable your
interface to listen in promiscuous mode
now if you don't know what promiscuous
mode is I'll explain that first and then
I'll explain why it's so useful
so say that you decided that you wanted
to go to Starbucks so you brought in
your laptop the Starbuck
and you want it to look at everyone's
traffic now by the way don't do this
because it's illegal
I'm just saying hypothetically you know
this is how you do I'm just trying to
explain promiscuous mode guys that's it
so you're in Starbucks you decide you
want to sleep on everyone's traffic so
you open your laptop open Wireshark and
you start looking but hmm something
weird is going on you can only see the
traffic from your own computer and not
everyone else's it's kind of weird I
thought that uh you know Wireshark was
supposed to help me monitor traffic how
come I can't see everyone else's well
the way that most wireless devices work
and wireless interfaces you know in your
phones and your tablets laptops is they
only pay attention to the traffic that's
for them so even though everyone is
connected to you know the wireless
access point in there spewing all of
their data through the air whenever that
data comes back from the wireless router
to you your device usually ignores it
unless it was meant for you so what
promiscuous mode does it says you know
what you know how it's usually a good
idea to just pay attention my traffic
then I don't have to worry about anyone
elses activity it's usually a good thing
but in this instance I actually want to
listen to everyone else's so that's
going to enable your interface to listen
to everyone else's traffic now the last
thing I want to point out is the way
that Windows especially works and some
devices is they don't even enable
promiscuous mode so it's pretty obvious
why they you know what block this so you
can't like hack into people's systems
but if you have interface card wireless
ones especially that block promiscuous
mode then I'll show you guys the one I
Bob so I went in Amazon and I bought
this one and if you go online you can
find a bunch of different reviews of
good ones but I use this it was only
twelve bucks and I actually use it on
Linux where you can pretty much control
other permissions yourself so if you
guys want to use this one or go online
and find a better one
then there you go but when you have that
little set up then your
going to be able to look at anyone's
conversation what they're doing what
websites they're going to so there you
go and I just want to reiterate this I
probably should have said this in the
first tutorial but you just can't go to
any you know Starbucks or a library or
whatever and start looking at everyone's
traffic it's actually illegal so make
sure that you have permission even
though you aren't like breaking into
their computer it's called a passive
attack and like I said it's illegal for
obvious reasons so just make sure even
when a company hires you to analyze your
traffic that you have written permission
and not yeah so that's my little
disclaimer now let's move on to the fun
stuff so there's a couple other settings
here but you guys won't understand
filters until I show you how to use
filters and all that other stuff so
right now I'm just going to hit start
and there you go so now my traffic is
coming in and if I start going to you
know uh whoops I go to that one
whatever then we're going to see it and
you can hit this to stop it
so okay whenever you start and stop this
is all the packets that you capture in
between so now let's go ahead and look
at this toolbar right here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
