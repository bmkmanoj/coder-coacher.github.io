43rd tutorial and in this tutorial as
promised I'm going to show you guys how
to modify only certain lines so here's
our document we have so far it's called
a and it says this is a new line the
salon 2/3 line last and final in line so
let's go ahead and get rid of that and
let me show you guys how to modify
certain lines in that document so before
we can modify the lines we need to take
all the lines or read them in so let's
go ahead and create a new file object
and of course like before we want this
to be a read object so look in your
finder path
see if I remember it test a text and of
course it's a read object so go ahead
and press R and now we have a file
object that you'll read and what we want
to do is create a list that using read
lines remember when you put red lines it
returns all of the lines to you in list
format so let's go ahead and do that
and we want to take that list and store
it in a temporary variable so let's go
ahead and make a temporary variable call
it list me you can name it anything you
want I'm going to name unlist me so you
know it's a list I can't have list
because list is actual keyword so let's
go ahead and put list me and set it
equal to F OB which there's a file
object dot read lines and don't forget
it needs to be plural and that's it
just put list me equal to f OB read
lines now go ahead and press ENTER and
list me is now equal to as you can see
equal to a list of all the lines in that
document a text so now we can go ahead
and close this since we don't need it
anymore and what we want to do now is
modify this list so we want to modify
let's say the third line in it so let's
go ahead and write list me and let's go
ahead and press 2 because remember 2 is
a
third line since it starts at zero and
let's just change this line so listen to
me two equals I sure love bacon so just
to get something out of the ordinary so
now we have a list of the files and then
and this is the old one the new one is
the exact same thing except the third
line says my sure love bacon so now once
you print out a list me we get that new
one that says my share of bacon in this
third one the problem is we didn't
actually save this to the text document
yet so even though we read from the file
the original file and made a new list we
didn't save that list into a new file or
we didn't write it yet so let's go ahead
and write that and I'll show you guys
what I mean right here computer see a a
right there as you can see this is our
document we didn't change it yet so even
though we change it I'm using our
program we didn't change the actual file
yet it still says this is third line and
we don't want that so let me go ahead
and we need to make a new file object
and we'll make this one an open object
and excuse me a write object so let's go
ahead and as our first parameter you
guys should get good this test eight
text and make this a right since we want
to write obviously so the next thing I
want to do is use a little function
called write lines and what write lines
is going to do is allow you to do just
that so let's go ahead and file object
and put write lines and as your
parameter not write line actually that
brings me to a point there is no write
line function because if you there was a
write line function it would just be
right since I would show if you're doing
right in line there's only a write lines
function in order to write new lines so
what we want to do add as a parameter
write multiple lines well all we have to
do is
put the name of our variable list me
since we already have a list of brand
new lines so let's go ahead and press
ENTER and what it does is once we close
this that right here
it took this parameter which was a list
of new lines and it wrote new lines to
whatever our object was which was this
text file right here and then we just
closed so now once we did that we should
have some new lines in our document so
let's go ahead and see show you guys
what I'm doing here test a and it says
this is a new line this is line two mmm
I sure love bacon this is a lesson final
line and I'll show you guys why I said
why this didn't go to a new line because
I forgot to do something um let's see X
out of this when I put I sure love bacon
I should have done this mmm I sure loved
bacon and I should have put a new line
but I didn't as you can see back slash
and from before is the newline character
and I forgot to put that so that's why
it was the old line but again that's how
you use a list from reading from list
and the red lines functions to get a
list and also the right lines function
to import a list and write it as new
lines in your file so again don't forget
your new line character like I did but
if you didn't it still works either way
so hopefully you understand a little bit
what I did I try to clear things up for
you in the next couple tutorials but
that's the basics of how to edit a
certain line so thank you guys for
watching if you have any questions you
can just send me a message otherwise
just thank you guys make sure you
subscribe and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
