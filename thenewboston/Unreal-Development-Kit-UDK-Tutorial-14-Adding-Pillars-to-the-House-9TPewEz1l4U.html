UDK tutorial and in these upcoming
tutorials I don't know if I'm gonna be
able to fish it in this tutorial or it's
gonna take to tutorials but in these
next few tutorials I'm gonna be doing is
adding the pillars and also the roof to
my little house so you guys can probably
figure out how to do this but if not you
guys are welcome to follow along with my
tutorials so the first thing I'm gonna
be doing is adding some pillars on his
front porch right here so I'm actually
going to be doing that using the
cylinder so go ahead and right-click the
cylinder and it's going to bring up your
cylinder properties now the Z is pretty
much if we look right here the Z is
gonna be the height of our pillars now I
already remember
our walls are 576 tall so that's how
tall my pillars are gonna be obviously
now the outer radius well let me explain
you guys this first if you want you can
go ahead and make a cylinder that's
hollow by checking this hollow box and
you have an inner radius and an outer
radius whenever you have something
hollow its kind of like a pipe but for
these pillars we don't need them to be
hollow so the inner radius isn't gonna
matter the only thing we need to worry
about is the outer radius so again
whenever you have a hollow cylinder you
need to set the outer and inner but
whenever it's solid you only need to set
the outer so let's go ahead and set it
to 32 I think that's gonna be a nice
size for a pillar and go ahead build X
out of there so the first thing we need
to do is probably position this so go
ahead and select your red builder brush
and I'm gonna position this right here
and let me just scroll in and I only
want that like one one block away from
the outside wall so that looks pretty
good right there the only thing I have
to watch out for now is make sure it
sits right on top of that floor so let
me scroll in and my position in looks
pretty good so I'm gonna go ahead and
click add CSG right there and now we
have a nice-looking pillar so now what I
can do is I guess I might as well just
go around and do this with all of them
so let me go ahead and position this
exactly where I want it I'm gonna want
this one right there
so go ahead and click let me make sure
it's positioned correctly add we got
another pillar right there and now for
this one just go ahead and make it right
there I'm gonna go ahead and click Add
for this so go ahead and click add and
now since we have the three pillars on
that side go ahead and get that out of
the way and now it will probably be
easier just to copy these so go ahead
and remember in order to copy it hold
down alt and drag and now we get a copy
of that one and in order to copy this
one
let me see you hold down alt and drag
and now we get a copy of that one looks
pretty good and last but not least copy
this one holding down alt and drag so
now all my pillars look good I just want
to go in one of my views up here and
make sure that they all are indeed
sitting on top and of course since
they're not showing up in perspective
view we need to rebuild our geometry and
go ahead and close out of that and now
if we start flying around here we can
see that indeed our pillars did get
built successfully so that's how I'm
going to be doing in this tutorial make
sure that you build your pillars exactly
like mine and in the next tutorial I'm
gonna be doing is adding a roof and I'm
actually gonna be going over something
so make sure you watch the next tutorial
because I'm gonna be talking about
splitting and also selecting well you'll
see in the next tutorial but I'm gonna
be talking about some new stuff so thank
you guys for watching don't forget to
check out my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
