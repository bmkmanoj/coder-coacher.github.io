slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
taking a look at subs now you've seen
these before you've seen our main sub
and you've seen our subs that hold the
events for let's say if you click a
button in this tutorial we're going to
be creating our own subs so let's go
ahead and get started we'll create a new
project and we will just call it subs
and make sure you've selected windows
forms application and go ahead and click
ok so let's go ahead and resize our form
and we'll come over here to our tool box
and we'll add a button and we'll set the
text to run sub and we'll go ahead and
change the name property to button run
sub now let's go ahead and double click
on run sub and you can see here that it
opens up the event handler for button
run sub now if you still don't
understand event handlers that's
perfectly fine we're going to be
covering them a couple of couple
tutorials after this one so what we're
going to do is we're going to come down
below button run sub and we're going to
start off by using the keyword private
now basically what this means is that
this sub cannot be accessed by any other
class outside of the form 1 dB so if
somebody made an object of form 1 DB and
show their own form 1 they couldn't call
the sub that we're about to make so
we'll just do private sub ad number so
we're just going to have a couple number
numbers here we'll add MD parameters
because we aren't going to need a new
right now so let's just go ahead and
create a couple variables so let's just
do dim num1 as integer we'll set it
equal to just a long number like that
dim num2 as integer and we'll set it
equal to another long number or here so
something else and now what we're going
to do is we are going to
messagebox show num1 plus num2 okay so
now that we have the sub we can use it
throughout this class so let's go ahead
and under our event handler for the
button clicked
whenever the button is clicked we want
to run the ad number sub so we'll just
go ahead and type ad numbers and you can
see it pops up for us so we can go ahead
and just press tab and then put our
empty parameters right there so now if
we go ahead and run this program our
form 1 pops up and if we click run sub
it's going to give us those two numbers
added together now I'm going to talk a
little bit more about what private it
means I think I stopped myself there for
a second but I'm only this class can
access it nothing outside of it can
access it and so what this does is it
pretty much protects your protects your
sub from being run anywhere else because
you don't need it to be run anywhere
else if you wanted it to you can use the
keyword public so that it can be used
outside of that class now we're going to
be using this keyword a lot when we go
into creating classes and other stuff
like that but for now when you're
creating subs inside of your forum 1
class go ahead and call them private and
you can see that all subs end with an N
sub and when you type out the your
private sub and then the name of your
sub and press Enter it's going to
automatically add n sub and now the name
of your sub can be anything you want it
to be this is just something for you to
identify what it is and for you to call
it later on so I'm go ahead and create
some subs
it's a they're very useful it helps you
out with programming a lot so that you
don't have to type to type the same code
over and over and over again you can
just call that sub whenever you want to
and after this we're going to be talking
about functions and passing values to
subs and functions so I'm going to
practice a bit and once you've got that
down go ahead and
move on to the next tutorial and thanks
