to your fourteenth biology tutorial and
in this tutorial I want to talk to you
guys about something called lipids now
you may be familiar with lipids because
they are actually the fat in your body
so hopefully you aren't too familiar
with them but that's what they are and
I'll tell you guys how molecules become
fat in your body in a second because
hopefully you know you can burn the
energy before it gets the state but
before I want to talk to you guys a
little bit more about lipids so lipids
are basically large molecules relative
to you know every other molecule in your
body however they have a lot of energy
inside them so that can be a good thing
and a bad thing because you know if you
ever are you know starving and you
aren't around a source of food then your
body can start to burn that fat and use
that energy however it can be a bad
thing because you know if you're just
you know sitting at home eating a bunch
of double cheeseburgers for McDonald's
then those lipids build up in your body
and you never end up using that energy
you just you know become fat basically
and that's actually why they can pack so
many calories into a double cheeseburger
so let me go ahead and draw a picture of
a delicious double cheeseburger right
here so you may be thinking and this is
what some people think sometimes that oh
my god I ate one double cheeseburger and
there are 2,000 calories in that and I'm
like dude that's not a bad thing how
many grapes would you have to eat to get
2,000 calories 2,000 calories worth of
energy in your body so you know again
like I said lipids large molecules but
they can pack a bunch of energy into a
small space that's why a double
cheeseburger can have so many calories
and it can still be you know not that
big relative to fruit or something like
that but enough about you seeing
cheeseburgers and fats and stuff let's
go ahead and learn something scientific
so lipids as well go lipids are what we
call hydrophobic
and if you take apart this you know
hydro means water and phobic if you have
a phobia of something it means you're
afraid of it so it basically means that
lipids don't like water or they don't
mix good with water and oil is actually
a liquid lipid and a solid one would be
something like butter and that's why if
you have air I have like vegetable oil
or if you see an oil spill on TV it
doesn't mix in with the water it either
sits on top of it or if you have butter
and you try to I don't know mix it with
oil or if you ever pour vegetable oil in
water like maybe you're making cookies
or something they aren't going to mix
together like if you're making I don't
know like sugar and water or something
and that's because of lipids are fats
that are hydrophobic doesn't get along
well with water now scientifically again
I am obviously hungry if I'm talking
about cheeseburgers and cookies and
stuff but let's go ahead and talk about
three types of lipids and three
different types of lipids I'm going to
go ahead and start with phospholipids
now phospholipids in when I say three
major types of lipids I mean the three
types of lipids or how they're used in
your bodies so phospholipids are
actually a type of lipid that Arielle's
are used in the cell membrane now I know
we didn't talk about the cell yet but
the membrane just think of it like the
skin of the cell the outer covering of
the cell so phospholipids are a type of
useful lipids a lot more useful than the
fat on your body and they're used on the
skin of the cell now another type of
lipids is steroids yes believe it or not
I'm not making this up steroids are a
type of lipid now steroids you may be
familiar with them may not be but
they're actually used to create hormones
and that's why if you you know if you
seen a bodybuilder or something taking
steroids it's because they want a lot of
testosterone or in a female they create
a lot of estrogen and actually
cholesterol
is actually a steroid molecule and
believe it or not steroids or excuse me
oh I have to swallow steroids are
actually found in the membrane of a cell
to just not as many as phospholipids
because pretty much the whole thing is
phospholipids but then you have a few
things scattered in but we're talking
about that more when we talk about the
parts of the cell and again the reason
that they're in your body is because
just like many things in your body it's
useful but just like anything else too
much can be a bad thing and that's why
if you have too much cholesterol in your
body then it can go ahead and get
clogged in your bloodstream and you know
all that cholesterol gets clogged up and
whenever this happens you of course have
a heart attack or a stroke or something
like that so pretty much everything in
biology every food you eat every drug
that you take can be good if used in the
right kind of ways but just like you
know anything else too much is a bad
thing cholesterol is no exception but
you know I'm done giving life advice
let's go ahead and move on to something
a little more educational the last type
of lipid that I want to talk to you guys
about and let's try try glyceride
definitely the most complicated one to
see so I guess I might as well say this
your liver tries to the store all the
glucose and remember that the thing that
cells used for energy it tries to store
it as glycogen so remember we said that
the cells in your body use as much
glucose as they can and what they don't
use they store in glycogen there's
nothing wrong with that because that way
you don't have to eat all the time
pretty cool but whatever is left over in
whenever they can't store anymore
glycogen they create something called
tri glycerides
now triglycerides are not very good
because those are pretty much the fat
that here's what happens your body tries
to use the glucose and then it stores it
as glycogen and whenever it can't mix
triglycerides and triglycerides go
through your bloodstream here's a little
blood stream that's pretty good looking
bloodstream and
then they're deposited into your adipose
tissue now you're at a post tissue is
basically the fat that you see on your
body so basically whenever your body
can't use glucose it stores it in
glycogen when your body's done making
glycogen it makes triglycerides which
are the fat that travels through your
budget bloodstream into a special tissue
on your body so that way the more tissue
you have the fatter you are and that's
kind of why you can't eat too much
because if you eat too much your body
doesn't need all the energy and that's
how it stores it in something a lipid
that becomes fat
so remember phospholipids very useful
especially when making your cell
membranes steroids pretty useful but if
you have too much cholesterol they can
cause heart attacks and strokes
triglycerides you really don't want any
of those unless you're going to you know
be surviving in the wilderness for a
long amount of time because those are
the things that make you more or less
fat so uh yeah that's pretty much it and
well that's why you lose fat whenever
you workout because first you burn all
the glucose in your body and then your
body tries to convert the glycogen to
glucose and then one that's done burning
that it converts these triglycerides to
glucose and then it uses that for energy
so again it's good to have but too much
you know you're going to be fat so there
is my very very messy tutorial on lipids
next next time I promise I'll use more
slides but hopefully you guys understand
the three types of lipids phospholipids
going to talk about those later steroids
and the almighty harmful triglycerides
so thanks for watching and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
