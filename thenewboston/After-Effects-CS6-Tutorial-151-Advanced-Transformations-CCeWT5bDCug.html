buddy Blackford here again with another
After Effects cs6 tutorial again so I'm
gonna show you how to do some advanced
transformations and using an effect we
can achieve this and it's pretty sweet
everything's on one spot so let's I
guess let's get to it so let's go to
like one of our things that we got here
and I've got this trollface Mexican
thing that I made and I have put an
effect on it called transform and as you
can see it's got all this stuff on here
we got the Anchor Point position scale
skew and all that stuff I'm gonna delete
that off so we can actually I'm just
gonna show you where it is
if you come into effect and then you
come down to distort right here there an
ABC order just so you know and then you
come down to transform and click on it
that's where you get the new Trent dia
transform menu now the transform has the
skew and skew axis in there which is
pretty neat and then it's got the
shutter angle and then you can check off
if you want a uniform scale if you would
like so and then you got this scale with
if you check off the uniform scale this
uniform scale is keyframe abble so when
you uncheck and check that's gonna be
sweet
you can keyframe it so you can't do that
and your original transform Kenya so we
got the are different things here we've
got the crosshairs here so when we move
our position it's easier to just move it
without having to drag your guy around
same thing with your anchor point you
can easily move that without having to
drag the anchor point and like click on
it drag it so now our IQ points down
here or well it's actually up here I
just moved it there but whatever scale
obviously we got our skew which kind of
like tilts it
we got our skew axis which we can move
let me ask you it a little bit more so
we've got our skew axis which we can use
to adjust how our guy is skewed and we
can do like a magic mushrooms effect
like doing this so hopefully none of you
guys are on mushrooms right now because
I'm sure you'd be tripping out all right
let's put those back to what they were
at obviously rotation which hasn't
changed in this one but it's all in one
spot so that's easy we got our opacity
nothing changed
shutter angle which deals with motion
blur and right now it's checked to use
compositions shutter angle and that can
be found under composition composition
settings and come over here to the
Advanced tab and motion blur shutter
angle now we could change the shutter
angle here unchecking this and changing
the shutter angle and that's also
keyframe Bowl so that's another advanced
method here so that's a within the
motion blur and that'll increase your
blur or decrease the amount of motion
blur that you have when your object is
moving across the screen now another
trick that you can use by using this
transform is transforming a bunch of
objects at once quickly so let me delete
this off and we're gonna add an
adjustment layer and we're gonna put our
transform effect onto that adjustment
layer now if I move things they're all
gonna move together
so let's rotate them so now that's a way
you can move everything together without
having to put everything in a
composition now you know there's a a
trade-off for this is that like if you
have a background when you go to move
the rotation or whatever your
backgrounds going to move
with it so that's a that's one thing
that's kind of crappy the way to get
around this is to complete compose the
layers with the adjustment layer and not
include the background here so maybe I
wanted to do a rotation here with all my
layers and let's rotate it a little bit
like that so we've got a little rotation
there and now if I come into here and
pre-compose this layer or these layers
so I selected my adjustment layer and I
selected all the picture layers here but
I didn't select the background
pre-compose and you only have one option
so rotated I'm gonna name it now
everything will be in the layer and will
be rotating but not the background layer
so that's how you do that so there's
some tricks on advanced transforming
it's just an effect and not a lot of
people know about it because it's in the
distort effects and you don't always
have to use the distort effects -
distort things so thanks for watching
this tutorial and hopefully you can use
that to speed up your process a little
bit and get things done quickly have a
good one everybody thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
