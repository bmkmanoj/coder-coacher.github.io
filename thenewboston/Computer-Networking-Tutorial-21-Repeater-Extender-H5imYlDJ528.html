video I want to talk to you about
repeaters now a repeater and these are
often called extenders they are a really
simple device all they do is they take a
weak signal and they boost it so it can
travel further now I'll tell you guys a
story and this is actually a true story
my mom she lives in a really long house
so there's their house as you can see
it's really long alright so there is
their beautiful looking house now
whenever they got internet what the guy
did whenever he came for some reason he
took their wireless router and he hooked
it up on one end of their house so here
is the router let me label it and they
never use any wired devices they're
always on their phones tablets whatever
so everyone living in this house is only
using this as a wireless access point
now here is the funny thing about
wireless technology
whenever you're standing really close to
the access point to this router the
signal is really strung now just like a
sound wave the further away you get the
signal gets weaker and weaker now what
that means is that anyone standing close
to the router is gonna be real happy
look at this guy's face it's like the
happiest dude on earth now anyone who
has a bedroom on this end of the house
every night when they're trying to watch
Netflix and go to bed look at this girl
she is not too happy now my artwork may
not be expert quality but you get the
idea so how do we solve this problem and
how do you make the signal appropriate
for every single person in the house
well we have a couple solutions the
first thing that we can do is we can
actually take this router and we can
reposition it to the center of the house
and that way the entire signal is
distributed evenly now this may not be
practical for a couple reasons let's say
that the center of the house I don't
know maybe
like some big garage or maybe it was
unfinished or for whatever reason you
were unable to move this router to the
center of the house so what you could do
instead is you can use a repeater now a
repeater looks like a little thing with
antennas that you plug into any outlet
in the wall and let me label this too so
this is a wireless repeater you would go
on Amazon buy it and plug it in to the
center of the house now again like I
said what this does is it takes a signal
a weak Wi-Fi signal and it boosts it in
other words it rebroadcasts it to give
some more strength and now this person
is actually happy so that's all a
repeater does and it's the same thing
with ethernet now whenever you're using
Ethernet we just draw you know some kind
of quick demonstration down here say
that you add another router that had an
Ethernet cable coming from it now
whenever you use Ethernet the max length
that you should use is 100 meters now
say that you had a computer down here
and this is just you know normal PC
there's a screen this is you know the
tower or whatever now the reason that
you can only use 100 meters I believe
that's what it is I'd have to double
check is because once your Ethernet
cable gets longer than this then the
signal gets really weak and you might
have problems let's say if your cable
was 200 meters long then you might have
problems receiving and sending data to
the router so instead what you could get
is a wired or Ethernet repeater and all
this would do is essentially the same
thing whenever your signal was weak in
that wire it would take it and boost it
so it could travel the rest of the way
now to show you guys what these look
like in a real life all right so this is
the most popular repeater and this is
actually like I said they're sometimes
called extenders what you would do is
you would take this plug it into the
center of your house or wherever your
signals weak
as you can see what it does is it boosts
it and pretty much allows everyone in
your house to have a nice strong
connection to the Internet and just to
show you guys one other one this is an
Ethernet repeater or amplifier or
booster or extender why don't they just
stick with one name I don't know kind of
annoys me but as you can see alright so
this would be for the power right there
this would be for the incoming ethernet
cord from your router and on the other
side that would be for the other cable
so just think of it like a connector
whenever your Ethernet cable is too long
and the signal is too weak it can
connect two cables to make the signal
nice and strong and also one other last
thing I want to point out switches and
routers they also act as repeaters so if
you had a switch right here and let's
say you're just using this as a normal
switch to connect a bunch of different
devices you don't have to have like a
switch and then a repeater right next to
it a switch is a natural repeater it
takes a signal and it sends it out and
it's nice and strong again whenever it
sends it back out so again don't buy you
know a repeater and a switch if you only
need one or the other so again there you
go congratulations we now know about
modems routers switches repeaters and
now what I'm going to do is I want to
start talking to you about wireless
technology it's going to be awesome see
you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
