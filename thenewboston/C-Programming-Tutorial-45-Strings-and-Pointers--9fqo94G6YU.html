basics behind pointers and how to
dereference a pointer and we also
learned a little bit more about arrays
what I want to do is talk to you guys
about some more advanced topics
specifically learning why all of this is
useful or at least one way that it's
useful so the first thing I want to do
is make a very basic character array and
I'll actually put examples of two movies
the first one will be a movie one and
just like before set this equal to like
the return of lucky man right there so
this is a very basic character right
nothing we haven't seen before and you
know how in the last tutorial I told you
guys that the name of the array in other
words movie one was essentially a
special type of variable in other words
it acted like a pointer well I explained
it in a way that was easy to understand
but now let me talk about it some more
and the truth is I kind of lied in the
last story because I called it a
variable and it's not exactly a variable
it's actually a constant now I remember
you guys way back when learning about
constants variables here Ike yeah well
they're pretty much the same thing
except with a constant you can't change
it and that's the same thing for a
pointer constant whenever you have the
name of your array you can never put it
on the left-hand side like this because
it is a constant and changing it will
mess up the rest of your array remember
this pointer movie 1 is basically going
to point to the first elements address
so if you try to change it to anything
else say we want to change the name of
this movie to hey now what it's going to
do is it's gonna as you see whenever you
run this we're going to get error B's
because it says okay if you change this
right here you're going to mess up your
entire array because I'm not going to
know where any other elements are you're
going to give this array a new address
or a new pointer and then I'm going to
be lost so that's why you can never have
the name of the array on
left-hand side because it says you're
trying to change your pointer the
pointer is actually a constant and dude
you can't change those so even if you
added those brackets afterward and try
to change your name run this again
uh-uh not happening now of course we
learn what happens when we actually want
to change the name of that movie well we
need to use a special function coach
string copy or what we can do is access
each element individually one two three
four
however it's kind of a tedious way to
work with strings because I mean it
would be awesome if we could just work
with these strings like a normal
variable
well let me guys show you let me show
you guys something right now say we have
a pointer variable right now and it's
called movie - well let's go ahead and
set this equal to something like uhm I
don't know like Bucky is awesome I love
ham like I don't know like that's the
name of a freakin movie who freaking
cares well check this out we already
know that movie one is a pointer
constant we can't have it on the
left-hand side of equal sign we can't
change it we pretty much can't do
anything cool to it we have to treat it
as a constant because that's what we
told C it was however movie two is not a
constant what we did is we made this a
pointer variable so whenever something
is a variable we can indeed change it in
other words we can print this out or put
on the left-hand side of the equal sign
so now let me do something like this
put movie two and what puts those is
basically takes this movie and prints it
out on the screen just like a regular
stream so says Bucky is awesome I love
ham now the reason that it is able to
print this out on the screen even though
that this is technically a pointer is
because remember what puts does is
essentially takes a string and starts
on the screen until it gets to that null
0 that 0 Terminator at the end so what's
going to happen is this movie - it's
actually not even storing any characters
or storing strings its storing the
address of where this string begins so
whenever we print it out on the screen
it says start here in the print letters
out until you get to that null 0 so
since this is indeed a variable as well
what we can do is this we can put movie
2 and set it equal to new movie title
and now we can print it out again and
check it out so this is the original one
Bucky is awesome I love ham and then we
changed it just like we did every other
variable such as floats in characters we
didn't need to use string copy we didn't
need to access every individual
character we just treated it like pretty
much how we want to treat it and we
printed it out perfectly so I know that
that's kind of a hard concept to
understand but now we have the knowledge
and pretty much ability to treat these
variables like we always dreamed of at
least I always drew nope this is the
stuff that's in my dreams
so the key concept takeaway from this
tutorial is whenever you just make a
very simple array of characters it's
hard to change because that name of the
array is a constant and you can't easily
change constants however whenever you
make a pointer to a string this pointer
right here is a variable so you can
easily put it on the left hand side
since all this is doing is its storing
the address of something so then we can
treat it like a string saying start at
this address
movie 2 and start printing crap out on
the screen until you get to know 0 so
again I know that this is kind of
confusing and kind of a hard concept to
understand but I mean don't blame me
because I a whoever made C go ahead and
yell
because they made it kind of a pain in
the butt but this is what it takes
