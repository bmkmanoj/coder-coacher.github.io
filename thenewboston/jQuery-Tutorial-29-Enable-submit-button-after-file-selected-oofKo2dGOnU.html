a video tutorial for the new Boston in
this video we're going to be creating a
form with an input field with the type
file I'm also going to be creating a
button next to this now what's going to
happen is when we actually go ahead and
upload the file or sorry select a file
from our computer this submit button to
actually go ahead and submit the file
through the form it will be
automatically enabled so the first thing
we're going to look at is our file
structure and what we have now the first
thing is that we have index dot PHP and
then we have ext Doug guess which I've
included on the page
I've also obviously got jQuery included
because we're making use of jQuery
selectors and also the remove attribute
functionality of jQuery as well so we're
looking at a fuse of basic things here
that we can bring together to create a
more you know useful and advanced script
so the first thing I'm going to go ahead
and do is actually create my form so
let's go ahead and create a form and
we're going to set the action in this
case to hash because we're not going to
submit the form anywhere but obviously
you might be submitting this somewhere
I'm going to set the method in here to
post and I'm going to set the ink type
to multi-part
form data now obviously this doesn't
apply to you if you're just looking at
the jQuery side of things chances are if
you are following this for the purpose
of you know implementing this into your
own script you'll already have something
similar set up however I'm just doing it
for the benefit of those who are unsure
how to pass file data correctly through
form attributes so in this case this is
how we would normally set up a form now
I'm going to go ahead and actually
create my input file
now we can either give this a class or
an ID or we could just literally go
ahead and use the next traversing option
in jQuery so I'm going to show you how
we can do it in several ways but for now
what we're going to do is we're going to
go ahead and give this an ID and I'm
going to give this an ID or file so we
can use jQuery selectors to pick up on
this file ID after this I'm going to
create a submit button which ultimately
would submit the data to the page that
we specify in the action I'm going to
give this a value of upload and I'm also
going to give this an ID as well and
that's just going to be called submit or
work let's go ahead and call it upload
now I'll call it submit keep the naming
conventions the same but I'm also going
to give this an attribute of disabled
let's just view it without that first
you can see that I've got my form here
where I can go ahead and select a file
and then I've got my upload button here
that when I click it we'll go to the
page we specified at the moment that's
just hash so what we want to do now is
disable this upload button and when we
click on choose file and then actually
choose a file from our computer we then
want the upload button to be re-enabled
so let's go ahead and set the disabled
property for this button or the submit
button as disabled and that will
basically disable the button so we can't
press it you can see that it's grayed
out now on my browser and I'm unable to
click upload and this is going to prompt
users to go ahead and choose a file and
click a click here before they choose
upload so we don't want the user to be
able to submit an empty file attribute
or a file element on our page so we're
going to go over to ext j/s and we know
that the ID of our files that we select
from his file and we know that our
submit button is submit so we can use
these to actually you know modify things
or set event handlers so I'm using now
xt dot j s for all my external
javascript so I'm going to come over to
ext or J s and the first thing I want to
do is just set up
jQuery code so I'm going to say document
dot ready
so we're appending the sorry we're
pending the ready event handler on to
our document and inside here once the
page is ready or the document is ready
we execute the code inside of here now
like I said the first thing we want to
do is go ahead up and set an event
handler to this file so we're going to
use the selector hash and then file
because we're using an ID selector so
let's go ahead and first of all select
this so hash file and then we append on
an event handler now this event handler
is change whenever this form field
changes we can go ahead and actually run
a piece of code and inside that is our
function here so if we come down we
could perhaps alert something has
changed
so once anything on this file element
changes ie a user selects a new file let
me just tell you exactly what happens
when we select a file and from our
computer so when we click on this and
then choose a file
here's the file name that's displayed
just here however we actually add it
into the attribute value so we can
actually grab the value from this so
change meaning has have any attributes
changed or have any additional
attributes being added when we select a
file the value attribute is added so
what we can do now is when we refresh
and we click on here when we click on
say tartan jpg what this will do is it
will change the value attribute of this
field to the location of tart and it we
have fake path but it will still change
and therefore when we select it you see
we have this dialog box something has
changed so we know that when file has
changed we can grab the for example
we're not going to be actually doing
this but we can grab the value attribute
of this so I could
perhaps a value equals sorry value
equals and I could say this which
obviously refers to this object here I
could say this dot attribute value and
then we could alert out value</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
