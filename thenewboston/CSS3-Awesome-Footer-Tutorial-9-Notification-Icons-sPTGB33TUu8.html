Manchester United let's go ahead and get
started with another frickin tutorial
sorry guys sometimes I like to talk in
bloody British on the tele governor
alright but let's talk about the
notification so these are the
notification buttons right here and as
you can see whenever you roll over them
they move a little bit and then this one
is similar to the one I have on my
website where whenever you hover over it
it tells you all of your notifications
like who likes your post who commented
on your picture stuff like that so the
first thing I want to talk to you guys
about is the footer entire notifications
section so well I'm about to style this
notifications ID is this entire
notification section so not each of
these individual pictures but the entire
section overall where I'm circling right
here now of course this excludes the
logout button the logout button is
something different we're gonna be
styling that later but anyways the first
thing you want to do is you want to
float this to the right and this is what
makes this appear on the right-hand side
of the toolbar rather than with all
these buttons over here so now let's go
ahead and just do some basic self
explanatory stuff the width:auto
the margin is going to be for this one 5
pixels 15 pixels and 0 pixels now
whenever you have three values in the
margin what this means is five pixels
from the top 15 pixels for the left and
right and zero pixels for the bottom and
of course that's probably going to be
different depending on the size of your
notification icons but for mine these
works now for the padding I just want to
make sure that this is zero pixels so we
can go ahead and type that in and for
overflow we'll just go ahead and set
this as hidden just in case anything is
overflowing so again this is the entire
node
vacations section all of these icons
combined so now what I want to do is I
want to set the style for each
notification icon so this Twitter image
I don't even know this is of the RSS
feed and the Facebook icon these are
actually um icons that I got from Cote
Canyon or whenever I got anyways I'm
getting off track here
alright so that's why I'm styling each
individual icon so footer of course
whoa and I know that when I press this
button on my mouse cool anyways see look
I'm like a five-year-old kid I'm like
ooh a flutterby okay ooh $1 okay I can't
pay attention to math today Samantha's
wearing orange shoes the heck am I
talking about
okay so each of these icons are actually
a list item of course with everything
else in this GD thing this entire thing
is an unordered list and these pictures
are items in that list so again these
are the individual lists or excuse me um
pictures so the first thing I want to do
is I want to set a margin right of 12
pixels not PlayStation's
pixels now what this means is you're
gonna have space between this icon and
this icon if you didn't set this value
then all of these little icons will be
butted up right against each other and
it would look like kind of a caterpillar
or something like that and we don't want
that so go ahead and tweak this value
somewhere between 12 and 15 looks pretty
good to me the next thing we want to do
is float left now you guys are probably
saying whoa we really don't want to do
that because then they would appear over
here right wrong remember we took the
entire section and our entire
notification section is float to the
right so all of these icons are going to
be stuck on the right-hand side just
within this section each individual
individual icon is going to float to the
left and this is important because if
you didn't have this then first of all
they would appear in a weird order
they might appear under each other like
regular HTML rather than side-by-side
now let's just go ahead and sit some
housekeeping stuff the width wow that
was actually pretty embarrassing 24
pixels padding zero pixels height I'll
set this at 32 pixels and of course this
um these settings are gonna be
determined oh I'll give you guys the
files to my icons but largely on how big
your icons are and you can actually
instead of using images you can actually
just make it in a CSS like have numbers
or a cool background but anyways we'll
get to that later on and the last thing
list-style:none because remember one
last time these even though they look
like pictures they're actually list
items so if we had you know a little
bullet point on these it will look
pretty frickin stupid so that's why you
need to set list style to none to ensure
that you don't have any bullet points or
anything like that and in the next video
what I'm gonna be doing actually I can
just go ahead and code this real quick
copy this paste that and set the
property of hover now what we want to do
is we want to put margin top negative
one pixel now what this does is it adds
the hover property and says okay
whenever you hover over these elements
move it negative one pixel which means
if you had one pixel it would move it
down from the top but since you have
negative one it would actually push it
up so that is why whenever we hover over
it I don't know if you guys can see on
the YouTube video but it's actually
moving up one pixel
do-do-do-do-do do-do-do-do-do
do-do-do-do-do do-do-do-do-do okay that
is all you guys get for of this video
anyway see you guys oh man I need to
find a cooler hobby or something anyways
thanks for watching now see you guys
