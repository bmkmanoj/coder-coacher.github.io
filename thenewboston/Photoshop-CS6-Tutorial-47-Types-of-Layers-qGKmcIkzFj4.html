another Photoshop cs6 tutorial for you
and today we're gonna be going over the
different types of layers that there is
now I've already created some of the
layers and then at some point in another
tutorial I'll just show you how to
pretty much make all these layers
because some of them are a little bit
different than others so um let's just
start off by going over what each layer
is called and then a little bit about it
so we'll start at the bottom down here
we're in our layer panel where it says
background so the background pretty much
is always positioned at the bottom of
the stack and can't be moved it always
starts out a lot excuse me as you can
see with this little lock signal here
and if you double click on the
background layer and just hit like OK or
something like that it becomes unlocked
and isn't called the background layer
anymore and every time you start a new
every time you start a new document it's
gonna have a background layer in it one
thing to note about the background layer
is that it does not support transparency
so then you'll have to users have to
unlock it and create it turn it like I
showed you before and turn it into a
layer will go up in the layers panel
here and come to this second one and
what this is called is an adjustment
layer and adjustment layers control
everything beneath its layer so right
now the only thing the adjustment layer
is going to control is the background
and the type of things that adjustment
layers cover are like contrast levels
color and things like that now to add an
adjustment layer you need to come down
to this button here and click on it and
then you got a bunch of different kinds
of adjustments to add there or you can
come up above and add an adjustment here
and as one of these buttons now what
you're gonna do is you're gonna click on
a layer so I'll click on the background
layer and then I'll add just add an
adjustment and this one's called
vibrance and it will put an adjustment
layer above the layer that you've
selected
so that's what I just meant later czar
will go up one one more here and this is
just called this is just a normal layer
and you can create a normal layer just
by clicking on this create new layer
button right here so that's how you
create a regular layer so when you click
on the create a new layer it's always
gonna put it above what you have
currently selected so just remember that
so what a layer is able to do is use all
of photo shops drawing and shape tools
opacity and all that stuff you're
available to are are available to use on
layers and layers can be pretty much
almost anything in here and you can do
pretty much everything you can do in
Photoshop on a layer just a normal layer
so that's the basic right there is the
regular layer the next one above here is
called a mask now mess are applied two
layers and you do that by clicking on
the add mask button which is a down here
at the bottom this little square with
the circle inside it is the add mask
button and masks
create transparent areas in the image
within your image without like how if
you turn opacity down all the way it
turns your image transparent well this
mask can make certain parts of your
image transparent so that's mainly what
masks are for let's go up to here where
it says rectangle one and this is called
a shape layer and the shape layers
control vector data by using a vector
mask and all the vector is is pretty
much a shape that you're able to scale
up and down without losing resolution so
you can create shapes by
using the shape tool here or maybe using
the pen tool to make a shape or any kind
of ways you can make shapes it'll create
a shape layer for you and above is of
course the text layer and a text layer
houses text I guess it's a actually
probably called a typo layer and you
just create one of those by clicking on
your text here and just clicking and
it'll create your new text layer so I'll
delete that and text layers are pretty
explanatory and I'm sure I don't need to
go in depth about those too much so
that's it for this tutorial we just went
over the different layers and their
names so now you know the layers and
you'll be able to communicate to other
people about what they are so thanks for
watching this one and everybody have a
nice day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
