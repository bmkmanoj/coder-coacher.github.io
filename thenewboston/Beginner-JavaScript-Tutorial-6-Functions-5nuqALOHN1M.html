sixth JavaScript tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm going to be talking to you
guys about something called functions
now a function is basically a mini
program it's a mini program that you can
use anytime you want throughout your
Java scripting for example if you're
making YouTube they probably have a
function to play the video whenever you
hit the play button they have a function
to pause the video whenever you hit the
pause button they have a function a
function to add a vote to the thumbs up
whenever you click the thumbs up button
so as you can see a function can be
called not only as soon as the webpage
loads but it can be called any time you
want
so let's go ahead and make a function
right now in order to make a function
you first type the name well let's give
us some space type the name function
this tells JavaScript all right we're
about to make a function now after this
you give a name to your function I'm
going to name mine funky because this
function is funky now after this you add
two little parentheses I'm not going to
be talking about these yet but these are
called your parameters so we'll just
ignore these for now until the next
tutorial and then after these you add
two little curly braces now inside the
curly braces is where you're going to be
putting all of your JavaScript code all
of the code you put in here all the
statements is the code that it's going
to run whenever you want to use your
function so if you're making that
YouTube page whenever they click the
play button you would play the video now
so anyways you can see that this is the
code that we want to happen whenever
they call that function
aka whenever the user wants to use that
function so let's go ahead and inner
function we'll make it do something
really simple let's go ahead and make a
pop-up appear on our screen so making
pop-ups is really easy in JavaScript all
you need to do is write the name alert
and this means make pop up on the screen
now inside the parentheses for this you
write what you want to appear in the box
so just go ahead and write like ouch or
something like that now whenever this
function is used a pop up is going to
appear on our screen and it's going to
say ouch so let's go ahead and well
let's go ahead and use the function
right now so in order to use a function
you go ahead and write the name of your
function funky and then you go ahead and
write those parentheses which we don't
know what they do yet but we'll we learn
that in the next tutorial and then since
this is a statement we go ahead and end
it with a semicolon
so anyways our javascript is going to
say all right we have a function right
here prepare to use it whenever we call
it so right here is when we call it and
by the way like I said anytime I say
call a function I mean use the function
calling a function is just the technical
term so use my function so it's going to
say all right call funky now so a pop-up
is going to appear so let's go ahead and
save this and see this baby in action as
soon as we load our page is going to
call it BAM
look at that a pop-up appear and it said
ouch so let's go ahead and maybe it will
be easier to see if I actually add a
button on the screen so you guys can see
functions don't need to happen as soon
as you load your page but whenever you
need to call them so let's go ahead
instead of just calling it right oh
right right away like right then let's
go ahead and add a form on our page
because if we add a form we can go ahead
and add buttons so actually we need to
do that outside the JavaScript since it
isn't actually part of JavaScript it's
actually part of XHTML so go ahead and
add a form and and your form right here
and inside your form you're only going
to have one element the input and by the
way if you have no idea what I'm doing
right now go ahead and watch my XHTML
tutorials I talked all about forms and
stuff like that so the input the type of
this is button it just kind of here as a
button on your screen the value is what
you want to say on the button and we'll
just write touch me
and there is another parameter that you
can add to your buttons and that's on
click and inside or the value for on
click you go ahead and you write the
name of your JavaScript function and I'm
just going to go ahead and write funky
because that's the name of the function
so anyways check this out if we go ahead
and save this and launch it in chrome we
go ahead and we have a button on the
screen that says touch me that's by
default
what's loaded on our web page what you
can see we added a attribute to this
function or excuse me this button called
on click funky that means whenever we
click this button we want you to use a
JavaScript function called funky so
whenever we click this button an alert
box is going to pop up that says ouch so
let's go ahead and click this button and
we see the alert box pops up and it says
ouch press ok and that's it so that is
the beauty of you know not only how to
make buttons but also how you can call a
section of JavaScript by using something
called functions so anyways
by default your web page loaded and it
loaded this form with a button on it by
default it did nothing but whenever we
clicked it it said all right whenever
you click me I'm going to call this
function called funky so that means I'm
going to go back up here and do whatever
you told me to do inside so by the way
the line of code inside your curly
bracket is called the declaration some
people call it the body but I just call
it whatever codes inside your curly
bracket and that is the basics of how to
create a function just go ahead and
write the name function the name
parentheses curly brackets and write
your rules inside your function and also
how to call a function whenever you want
using a button or you can just call it
automatically by writing the name of the
function
but anyways in the next tutorial I'm
going to show you guys what these
parentheses are and why they are useful
and why most functions actually use
those parentheses so anyways thank you
guys for watching this tutorial thank
you for learning the basics of a
function if you don't quite understand
just stick with me in the next tutorial
everything
we'll clear out for you so I know a
stink-ass washing don't forget subscribe
and I'll see you guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
