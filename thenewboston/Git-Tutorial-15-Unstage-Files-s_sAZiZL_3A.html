video and in this tutorial I'm going to
show you guys how to on stage files
pretty much whenever you move a file to
the staging area and then you decide
that actually I don't want to commit it
yet I'll show you guys how to bring it
back down or remove it from the staging
area bring it back down into your
working copy so before we get started I
want to mention this instead of using
that dogs website which was probably the
worst site ever invented I'm actually
going to be working with you know
something that's a little more useful a
little more realistic so this is the
mobile version of the website of my
website Bucky's room that I'm working on
so here's the home profile all that good
stuff and this is actual an actual
project that I put on github so later on
when I show you guys how to use github
if anyone wants to you know grab this
work on it and make some changes I'll
show you guys how to do all that but I
think that it's going to be a little
better if we have an actual project
rather than that dumb dogs website so
this is the example I'm going to be
using from now on so in of course for
this tutorial II does n't matter you can
do this on on any project so I just
thought I'd give you guys a heads up so
let's go ahead and get our feet wet and
start learning how to unstaged files so
I already am in this directory right
here I already initialize it and as you
can see I'm up to date just like before
so now let's say that we want to make a
change to this website so let's see what
we can do alright let's um let's say
that this background here this like semi
transparent background we say that it's
a little too transparent so what I want
to do is I want to make it slightly more
opaque a little more white so this is
the opacity right here I'll bump it up
to 25% so now I'm going to change this
in okay working on this ready to commit
it so I'm going to do is get add of
course if I type git status we know that
it added that profile or that um
modified files to the staging area now
just before I commit it let me refresh
you
make sure everything looks good oh crap
you know what I changed the opacity of
this tab but this opacity I forgot to
change so obviously I made a big mistake
I'm not ready to commit this yet all
right well now we have a problem now
this file is stuck in the staging area
when I actually just want it in my
working copy so how do I take this file
and remove it from a staging area bring
it back down to my working copy well
what I do is this if you type get reset
and then after type head and capital
letters and I know you guys don't know
what head means because I didn't talk to
you about the head pointer yet and
actually talking about that is probably
going to take it's an entire tutorial
all on its own because it's really
important and it really uh deserves its
own tutorial so for right now just
remember that git reset head and after
this if you type the name of the file
you want to remove from the staging area
what this command does of course is
takes whatever this file is and it
removes it from the staging area pretty
much brings it back down to your working
copy so now if I check the status of
course its modified so because we didn't
commit any changes yet so that of course
is how you take a file in unstaged
so for this tutorial that's all I got
pretty cool pretty simple so I think you
guys for watching don't forget subscribe
and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
