video I am going to show you how to use
shell scripts now shell scripts are just
a bunch of commands that you can type
into a file and then you can run them
just like you would whenever you were
running them in the terminal and this is
really good for things that you find
yourself doing over and over and over
again so say that you always had to I
don't know for some reason make a new
file and then rename it and then like
move it to a new directory well all you
have to do is type all those commands
into a shell script and then you can run
it whenever you want so I show you guys
the basics of it and by the way if you
notice that my system is a little bit
different I'm actually using my computer
that I was uh it's a Cali distribution
and I was working on my Wi-Fi security
videos but I was like I might as well
make some Linux video so the first thing
that you need to do and you can do this
in any text editor so just open up
whatever one you feel like it's all the
same so you use the pound sign the
number sign whatever you want to call it
X clinic what's it called exclamation
mark forward bin forward Sh
now what this command does is it just
says whenever we're running this file
run these commands in the shell so just
like you were typing in the terminal and
these little pound signs by the way you
can include them they're comments if
you're familiar with programming so
anything you type after on any of these
lines they're just going to be ignored
so they're pretty much just for other
people and you can write little notes to
yourself and be like this program is
going to be awesome whatever it does
actually let's say that this program is
a will print stuff out on the screen
so this program displays stuff of in a
directory
all right so now all we have to do is
you can run anything that we would
usually type into a terminal so let me
just echo something out first and
remember this just displays whatever
you're right in the terminal plain text
and I'll just write program is starting
dot dot dot and now let's just run a
simple command like LS minus L a why not
so we just have to save this as let me
save on my desktop and let me move this
so you guys can see all right so come on
keyboard so I'm just going to save it as
Bucky save that beast right there and we
got some nice cool coloring because
Linux is aware that okay this is a shell
script and now let me show you guys how
to run this
all right looks good and let me minimize
this might be a little bit easier to see
so let me move over to my desktop and
you can see that alright so this is the
file right here and right now
on cally you're running is route by
default but if you're not then let's say
you're on a boon theory or something
running as a regular user just change
the permissions on this so you can
actually execute it so plus rx and files
so change the permissions on this so you
can execute it if you know whatever
permissions you have you can now in
order to run this all you do is write
bash and then the name of the file and
that's it so hit enter and it's going to
do whatever we told the program to do so
the first thing we said is program to
starting just echo that out and then we
ran LS - LA which essentially just
prints everything out you know in that
directory nothing new we saw before so
you can see the use of this already
I mean if you have a common task that
you like find yourself typing the same
five things over and over and over again
then well put it in a shell script and
then you got one line and it's golden</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
