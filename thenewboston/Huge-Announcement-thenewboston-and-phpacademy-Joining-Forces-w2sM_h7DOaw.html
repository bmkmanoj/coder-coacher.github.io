want to make a video today because I got
some pretty exciting news for you guys
so as you guys know I want to redo a lot
of my tutorials so they're up-to-date
more in depth and better quality and I
also want to redo a lot of my PHP
tutorials because my PHP tutorials don't
cover a whole lot and they're not really
up-to-date so I was planning on remaking
my PHP tutorials until I had a better
idea
so as you guys know I always tried to
provide you guys with the best tutorials
but when it came to PHP there's one
person that I just couldn't compete with
that was a guy named Alex now alex has a
YouTube channel named PHP academy' and
this YouTube channel is made
specifically for making PHP tutorials
and already alex has hundreds and
hundreds of free high-quality up-to-date
in-depth PHP tutorials so I figured
instead of making PHP tutorials myself
why not get the best so I messaged Alex
and after a few emails he decided to
make a PHP series for the new Boston so
I got done work today went home checked
my mail and in my mailbox
I found this BAM Forrest Gump on Netflix
but aside from that I also received a
package from the UK and inside it was
this a little USB Drive and on it is 200
never before seen videos on everything
PHP now I'm talking variables loops
arrays data bases file handling
object-oriented programming you want it
you got it so I'm gonna be uploading
these videos on my channel in the next
few days so first of all to Alex and the
PHP academy' I want to say thank you so
much for these tutorials and it's
everyone else I want to tell you guys
don't forget to subscribe to his channel
PHP academy' like I said he already has
hundreds and hundreds of tutorials on
everything in anything
PHP related so what these tutorials are
gonna do right here is they're gonna
give you a really good PHP foundation a
good starting point and then when you're
ready to move on to some more advanced
stuff you can hop over to his channel or
his website so again his YouTube channel
is PHP academy' and his website is PA
P Academy org now you can go to his
website if you want a full list of all
his video tutorials in a nice organized
fashion and he also has a really cool
forum a bunch of members if you have any
questions or wanting to discuss any
topics related in PHP and lastly thank
you Alex and the PHP Academy for making
these tutorials I can't wait to watch
them and I know probably all of you guys
are itching to watch them too so thank
you everyone for watching this thank you
Alex and I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
