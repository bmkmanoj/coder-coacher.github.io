Photoshop cs6 tutorial buddy Blackbird
here and today I'm gonna go over
different ways for you to edit some of
your photos and like edit like the faces
and things like that and we're gonna go
over the patch tool and the healing
brush and they're both good for getting
rid or cleaning up imperfections as you
can call them in people's faces or in
pictures so if like there's a scratch in
a picture or something like that and
might as well go over that now and I'll
show you what I mean so the first thing
that I want to go over is called the
patch tool and you can find that over
here on your toolbar and if you click
and hold on this section here and the
sampling tools you get there's a Spot
Healing Brush healing brush so you'll
see one of these icons but you want to
use the patch tool which actually looks
like a patch and you can see that the
hotkey is J to switch through these
tools so what the patch tool does is you
create a selection by drawing a line for
example if I just draw a circle here
it's going to create a selection for you
made out of that and if you hold ctrl
and press D it gets rid of the selection
for you in case you mess up but what
you're gonna do is make a selection and
then you're gonna drag the selection
down to an area that actually that has
the same kind of texture and use that as
your new source here where it's gonna
blend in with the rest of the pixels and
try to remove the object so on this
picture this girl I know wears glasses
because she's one of my friends in real
life and you can see like the lines from
where the glasses has been have been
sitting on her face so we're gonna
remove those so you can't really see
them anymore so what we're gonna do is
make a selection around these eye lines
so I'm gonna come down here I'm going to
try to get some of the darkness that's
around that area and you'd be careful
when you're drawing it make sure it's
pretty
clean and crisp but it doesn't have to
be the good it doesn't have to be like
perfect so make sure you have a
duplicate when you're doing this you
don't want to work on your background as
I've mentioned in other tutorials so
make sure you have a duplicate of your
object click on it and then go ahead and
drag down to an area that seems like it
has a good texture or that matches where
you want to put your source so I'm gonna
drag and let go and I'm just going to
click off and then you can see how it
removed that now there's still some
darkness area rounder
under around her eye loops I just click
by accident that needs to be fixed up
and I'll show you how to do that with a
different tool so let's get this side
just draw and get as much as I can
without getting too much all right and
drag down and usually when you're
getting these eyes just going right
below is a pretty good idea so now you
can see like the bet the eye lines are
gone and I'll do a quick there you go so
that looks kind of weird when you do
that but now we're gonna use another
tool called the Healing Brush and what
the Healing Brush allows you to do is
correct small imperfections and make
them disappear into the surrounding
image so it takes a sample of everything
when you're doing it and it's kind of
like a brush so let's go back over here
and change our tool to the Healing Brush
now there's a Spot Healing Brush and a
healing brush you just want the Healing
Brush and you get a brush here make sure
you go ahead and select your brush and
the size and hardness and everything
like that it's the same as any other
kind of brush we've got our modes up
here we've got our blending modes you
can use those if you would like and then
we've got our source is going to be
sampled and we need to do is take a
sample out of the area that you want to
replace this with so hold down alt and
you'll get the little crosshairs here or
I think it's option on the Mac I always
have to remember those and click in the
area you want to sample so I'm gonna do
this cheek here because it has nice
pretty decent skin tones I'm gonna start
making small paint strokes to try to
remove and blend in some of the things
so they look nice
oops that one was bad too long so I mean
make it this little area here so look
that looks pretty decent let's try to
let's go over here and get this side
let's take another sample something like
that so that looks pretty good so you
got sampled here is up here in the
options menu sampled is when you use
your Alt key and then pick a sample and
then you got pattern here where you can
select a pattern if you want and this is
how it goes if you have a pattern so you
would have to select a good looking kind
of pattern not just any one of these
that Facebook has or not Facebook my bad
Photoshop jeez now another option that
you kind of need to worry about is this
sample right here it says current layer
either got curtain layer your current
layer below which would be everything
below it and all layers so depending on
what you have around your image so if
you have something on top that you need
to sample in width and everything like
that so make your selection based on
this so current layer is just the image
that we have and when you're working on
faces that's usually what you want to
use so the next step that we would use
to like fix this up a little more is
we're gonna use our blur tool which is
right here and we were just gonna make
some make sure that our strength is down
I have it down to 25% here and we're
just gonna move it along the face a
little bit not a lot you don't want to
go too blurry or else you're obviously
gonna know that it's photoshopped now if
we take a look at it before and after we
can see that we've taken out the lines
and
and it helps out makes makes them look
younger and they probably like that more
when you're doing your professional
pictures so let's head over back to the
patch tool we'll take a look at some of
those options so up here we've got our
different modes here we've got add
subtract and then intersect
now these modes pretty much deal with
your selection so you want to eat it so
if you need to check what these kind of
do back in the beginning of the tutorial
series we go over these in a different
selection tutorial so if you need to
check those out there right in the
beginning but pretty much it deals with
your selection so I'll just show you
real quick this is normal right here the
first one so I go to normal and I made
that selection now if I want to go to
add here I can add to that selection
with the add and if I had their subtract
this is just a quick thing I can
subtract out part of the selections as
you can see there so that's what that's
what these are then we got our patch
here we've got content to aware and
normal and when you're working on a face
you just want to use the normal but
content is used more for highly colorful
in different contrasting colors and
everything like that it blends in things
a lot better when they are different but
as you can see the normal patch works
pretty well we've got our different
options up here the source and
destination or opposite of each other
source means when you make a selection
any drag it's going to take the image
information from where you dragged as
what's going to replace what's within
the selection you made so I'm gonna go
ctrl D to go back control Z I mean
there we go and destination is just the
opposite so this area that we have
selected is going to replace what we
dragged over here so as you can see here
I could drag it over top of the eye and
it pretty much does that transparent and
preserves transparency so like if she
was cut out and I wanted to patch some
things on the edge the patch tool is
going to preserve the transparency
that's on the edge and not like add some
extra blending on the edge so that's one
you want to have this checked so you can
either check it or uncheck it so there
are some techniques you can use when
editing the face and when you're done
you can go ahead and just merge the
layers or flatten the image so select
both right click then hit merge layers
and there you go now you have a new
edited image so you can go ahead and you
can work on more things you can to the
image that I'll end up showing you guys
later like you can use the patch tool
over here on these left lines and maybe
you want to soften these lines over here
by the cheeks it's up to you and what
the what your client wants you to do and
what they feel comfortable with changing
so thanks for watching this tutorial
that's all I'm gonna talk about for the
patch tool and the healing brush thanks
a lot for watching have a good one
