to your third Ajax tutorial and in this
video we're finally going to create our
very first web-based or you know Ajax
program Ajax web page whatever you want
to call it and before I continue I want
to say that in these examples you're
going to need PHP so of course you
either need a xampp or WAMP or what I'm
doing is I'm doing it
the really lazy way I just bought some
shared hosting on the server and I do
this because it already has like you
know PHP admin and you know PHP already
installed so you can either you know
spend a couple bucks and have a server
buy some space that's already got
everything installed or install you know
xampp or ramp and in you know PHP
tutorials they show you how to do that
either Alex or me so anyways let's go
ahead and I'll shut up now and actually
let me go ahead and show you what
example we're making I'm going to be
teaching you guys how to create an
online restaurant and this is an online
restaurant that I created it's called
the chuff bucket I thought that was a
you know appealing name and what I allow
users to do is they can type in food
such as Apple and as they're typing it
in what's going to happen is Ajax is
basically going to communicate with the
server and say okay do we have the food
they typed in or not so Apple of course
in this is all done without the user
ever submitting the form they never hit
enter this is all happening as they're
typing so apples of course we don't have
um what about bacon oh we got bacon and
of course tuna we do have tuna - so
that's what program I'm going to be
teaching you guys how to make so the
very first thing we need to do is we
need to build a very basic web page
without any scripting without any PHP or
JavaScript just so they have an
interface and basically what this is
going to be is just a header and a
simple input you know area that they can
type into so the first thing that we
need to do is of course create
doctype and i'm just going to be using
html5 style although you probably don't
even need this but you know that's not
very good programming practice so create
HTML and in the head what we want to do
is we want to link to our javascript
file which we're going to be creating
soon so script and we'll just go ahead
and end this right now
Wow can't type today
alright script script and what type is
this was just text JavaScript and of
course you don't need to name your file
the same thing that I named it but the
source will just go ahead and set this
equal to food store dot J s so basically
um not right now but probably in like
three tutorials we're going to be
creating food store J s which is this
javascript file which is basically going
to be responsible for you know basically
what I'm going to be teaching you guys
but for now we're just creating this
basic web page so in the head of course
we link to the javascript file and in
the body is we're going to be making our
fabulous interface because you know this
is like you would pay a web designer
like five hundred dollars to design a
web page this beautiful I'm going to be
showing you guys how to do for free how
awesome is that so the first thing we
need to do before we start making those
elements is we actually want to call a
JavaScript function as soon as our web
page loads so the attribute for this is
onload process so this is the very first
function in this function is actually
going to be in this javascript file
right here and it's going to be called
basically the kick start off our program
our HX program so now let's go ahead and
get to the good web design part heading
3 go ahead and put the title of your
store mine is named the tough bucket
very appealing title I just want to you
know eat food whenever I think of
chuffing
so next go ahead and give the user
prompt enter the food you would like to
we'll say order instead of by and now of
course if we gave them a prompt we want
to give them some area just a little
input box to enter that so the type is
just text and the ID is my microphone
scratching against my shirt I'm actually
wearing a poncho that I got in Mexico
right now user input and this is
actually important because we need to
reference this whenever we're working
with Ajax so make sure that you do give
this ID and don't forget what it is and
under this what we're going to be doing
is we're going to be changing a portion
of the website so we're actually going
to be changing a div element and this
div the idea of it is we'll just call
this the div um under input because I'll
show you guys in a second so this is
basically your file and the user input
input is of course this little form
element right here in this blue text
right here this is the under input and I
named it because it's under our input so
this is the portion that we're going to
be changing dynamically based on you
know um based on what the user typed in
so either it will either say that they
don't have the food or if you have
something like tuna we do have tuna do
you have meat they don't have me what
about a loaf oh they got the loaf sweet
so basically this is the portion that's
going to be dynamically changing and you
actually want to end that tag and you
actually want to end this too so um this
is basically let me look everything over
one more time is our very simple start
to our program now in the next tutorial
what I want to do is I want to start
building the other files so we basically
are building two more files a JavaScript
file which stays on you know your client
or the user's computer and a PHP file or
pH
a script now the PHP script is what
stays on your server and the JavaScript
file from the user's computer
communicates back and forth with the PHP
script on the server and trust me guys
it's going to be awesome and if you
don't understand that all now you will
so thank you guys for watching don't
forget subscribe and I'll see you guys
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
