video I'm going to be answering all the
questions that you guys still have about
IP addressing and subnet masking because
yeah we learn the basics of it but now
we're looking at this thing and let's
say that this is the IP address of my
own computer and I'm thinking okay so
somehow I'm supposed to extract the
network IP address out of this I mean I
do I just like split right here or oh I
use this subnet mask but huh that's a
still kind of confusing and also I mean
how many computers are on my network and
whenever I make a network how do I know
what IP addresses I'm supposed to use
and you know what eff it forget about
now working I'm done I'm gonna you know
change majors whatever whoa just a
second and hopefully by the end of this
tutorial
everything is going to be clear so
remember whenever a computer in other
words a router sees this information the
first thing that they always do is they
convert them to binary so boom there it
is in binary and also the subnet mask
now I don't need to explain how to
convert these addresses to binary
because we already went over in the last
couple videos but there you go so now
okay so this is my IP address in binary
format of my own personal computer my
you know desktop laptop whatever so I
went to Facebook and I requested a
picture of my ex-girlfriend and Facebook
servers found that picture and it sent
it back to me now it sent it right here
to my personal computer but now when
that data gets to the router it's
looking at this IP address and say hey I
don't care about your personal IP
address I want the network IP address
what Network do you belong to because
that's where I'm supposed to send it
once it's there you know like I said in
the last video it does its thing so I'll
show you guys how to calculate the
network IP address and how to extract it
from your own personal computers IP
address so let me just write network
right here and I'll show you guys the
easiest way possible is in
really easy so all you have to do
whenever you want to find out what
network IP your computer belongs to
write your own IP address on top in
binary format and on bottom right the
subnet mask in binary format now
whenever both numbers equal 1 write a 1
so 1 1 ok 1 any time you see any 0
whether it's top or bottom or both of
them write a 0 so the only time you're
going to have one is when Buffalo equal
one so this one Buffum equal one this
one zero both of these equal 1 0 1 1 1 0
0 1 ok this is pretty easy 1 0 1 0 1 1
Yatta Yatta Yatta tomato tomahto
actually already wrote it out because I
didn't feel like doing it so let me just
pop it up and there you go that is your
network ID and of course once we have
the binary we can convert it into a
human readable IP address and there you
go so right here this if I can draw
properly is your networks IP address and
this is your own computer's IP address
all right so now we know how to figure
out the network IP and yeah that was a
pretty cool math trick but why the heck
does that work well let's think about
this remember that I told you guys that
your IP address is actually broken up
into two parts part of it is the
networks address and part of it is for
the host now we already know thanks for
a subnet mask that can be broken up
right here which means that this part on
the left that's all the network IP
address this part right here this is for
the host individual computers on your
network are all going to have a
different one of these numbers so now
that we remember that we can now
understand why this math trick actually
works because whenever we have a 1 right
here what is essentially doing is
copying that part of the IP address so
this part right here
and this part right here are always
going to be identical now whenever our
subnet mask has a zero in it it pretty
much says yeah we don't care about this
part your one yeah I don't really care
your zero now your one nope don't really
care you you're not part of the network
IP so forget about you and that is how
all these networking devices know
exactly what network to send that data
to so the last piece of the puzzle I
want to talk about is this alright so
some servers sent some data to our
network how does that network know which
computer to send it to how many
computers are we allowed to have on our
network and most importantly what IP
addresses are we supposed to use on our
network how the heck are we supposed to
figure this out
and it's actually really easy let me pop
this up so whenever we have this example
right here we have 16 useable hosts that
means that we can have 16 computers on
our network how do we know this well we
know that we have a 32 bit IP address
now 28 of those bits are designated for
the network so we can't use those for
our hosts that means that we have 4 bits
that can be designated for devices on
our network now remember that cool trick
I told you guys that anytime you want to
figure out how many values you can have
you just use 2 to the how many bits 4
and that equals 16 so whenever you have
4 decimal places you can have 16
different combinations of ones and zeros
so that's where we get the 16 different
values that we can have for hosts now
remember like a minute ago when I told
you guys that this means that you can
have 16 different computers on your
network I lied and that's because you
always need to reserve 2 IP addresses
for special occasions the first one is
your network IP I mean you just can't
have this IP assigned to a device on
your computers because this is actually
the network's address so that takes away
one right there and also the very last
IP address on your network it
special broadcast IP in I don't want to
get into that right now because I'm sure
I'm overloading you with information
right there but again one for the
broadcast and one for the network IP
address now the rest of those IP
addresses you can just assign to any
computers your laptop your phone your
you know desktop whatever so again this
is your starting point right here in you
own 16 IP addresses that follow that so
141 0 140 1.11 41.2 all the way to 15
because remember 0 to 15 that's how we
count we start with 0 instead of 1 so
it's not 1 to 16 so there you go so
these are your useable hosts the first
IP address that you can actually assign
to a computer is 169 dot 174 down 1:40
1.1 and you actually have the IP
addresses all the way the 15 but 15 is
that special broadcast 1 so you can use
all of these from this one to this one
right here so there you go all of that
we found out with this bit of
information pretty stinking amazing eh
now I just want to go over one other
example really quick just the pound it
in your guy's brain so whenever you want
to figure out the network IP address all
you have to do is convert your IP in
your subnet to binary and remember you
do that little one trick so one right
here one right here all the way into let
me pull it up boom there you go so
that's your networks IP address in
binary format let's go ahead and turn
that back into a readable format and
once we have this information then let
me just say ok so this is the network
portion of your IP address this is the
host and what that means is that we have
let's see how many bits 10 so 2 to the
10 is going to give us that remember to
reserve 2 for the network IP and the
broadcast and that means that we have
all of these IP addresses
that we can use for computers on our
network so pretty awesome this little
chunk of the Internet
from here to here it belongs to us
pretty stinkin awesome and you know what
I decided to give you guys a homework
assignment just to make sure that you
guys understand everything that's going
on so this is the IP address right here
and this is the subnet that I gave you
your job is to give me the network IP
and also for bonus points what you can
do is um give me the usable host the IP
addresses that you can actually assign
to computers and you can just leave your
answer in the comment section below and
a couple parting thoughts I want to
point out say that you haven't addressed
like a 100 a dot on I'll just make a
stupid - da - da like a 74 now you know
what subnet mask is always a bunch of
ones followed by a bunch of zeros
sometimes you may see the notation right
after the IP address people write slash
20 this is just a shorthand version of
writing the subnet mask so this means
that I'm going to write 20 ones and then
the rest are Jazeera's and this is
actually called site or notation C I D R
and the last thing I want to point out
is the maximum size of your network ID
can be 30 bits that's a maximum number
of ones that you can have in your subnet
mask and if you think about it
you can't have 32 because an IP address
is 32 bits and if you made the entire
network 32 bits that means that you're
trying to make a network with no hosts
on it with a network without any
computers now if you made it 31 in your
reserved 1 bit for the host that means
that you're trying to make a network
with only one computer on it and that's
not a network that's just a computer
sitting by itself the definition of a
network is you know computers connected
together so you know just some parting
words of wisdom for you guys but anyways
there you go
that's your homework assignment leave
your answer in the comment section below
the first one to get the answer right
they actually get no prize but you know
be pretty cool and also if you guys have
any questions at all about anything ask
me on my forum I don't really check the
YouTube comments section is that much so
in my forum on my website there's a
bunch of people willing and able to help
so there you go see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
