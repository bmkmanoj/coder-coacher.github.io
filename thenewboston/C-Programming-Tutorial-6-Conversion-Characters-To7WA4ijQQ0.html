basics of how to print crap out on the
screen I want to talk to you guys about
how to make this print command a little
more powerful using a special symbol
called conversion characters so remember
I said that C programs can work with a
bunch of different data types they can
work with numbers whole numbers numbers
with decimal points on text and also I
probably should have mentioned this
earlier but this data type which is
pretty much just a bunch of characters
these are called
strings strings are things like words um
you know maybe just it could be one
character string but basically um
whenever I say a string that's what I'm
talking about a bunch of characters or
words so let's go ahead and delete all
this because we don't need that anymore
and the first thing I want to do is make
another printf statement and this one is
going to use conversion characters so
what is a conversion character it's
basically like I said a placeholder that
you can use to put something in your
string let's say so it's probably just
easier if I shut up and type it so the
special symbol that we're going to use
is % s that means we're going to have a
placeholder for a string so we don't
know what string is going to go in here
yet but some string is going to so say %
s is the best person ever newline so
basically saying say some word is the
best person ever or some text is the
best person ever well now that we said
and make a placeholder we got to give us
something to put in that place so after
your first quotation mark if you press
comma and add another string then you
can type something like Bucky and
basically what it's going to say is ok
I'm going to use this string and say %
is the best person ever but then I need
another piece of information what string
do I use to put in this place well after
a comma that's where you tell it Bucky
is the best person ever so if you build
and run this it substitutes that second
string for that percent s
so basically any time you see percent
something it means it's going to get
substituted out and you can actually use
as many of these as you want so you can
say percent s is the best arm percent s
ever and the first substitution is Bucky
and the next one is a will say Bucky is
the best a programmer ever so basically
says okay for the first one use Bucky
for the second one
use programmer so when you build and run
this Bucky is the best programmer ever
so that's the very basics of a
converging character and I also want to
mention that this percent s is for
Strings only for text word stuff like
that whenever you're working with
numbers you need to use something out so
let's go ahead and build another awesome
thing so let's go ahead and say um I 8%
D corn dogs last night well what percent
D means is its kind of confusing it
means a whole number or an integer so a
number without a decimal point like one
eight twelve that would be a percent d
so you know percent D is not the easiest
you know letter to remember but anyways
after this you can go ahead and input a
number like nine now remember only
strings or only text goes in between
those double quotation marks whenever
you're using numbers they don't go in
between quotation marks so if you run
this program it's going to say I ate
nine corn dogs
last night simple enough so the last
thing I want to mention is this whenever
you use numbers with numbers with
decimal places you don't use percent
that you actually use something called
percent F now a number with decimal
place is called a float why they named
that I'm not really sure but that's what
it is and whenever use percent F you can
use
something like that now usually you have
decimal places with a lot of decimal
places after that doesn't make sense
numbers with a lot of decimal places
after it so whenever it prints this out
on the screen the default is to print
six decimal places so one four one five
nine two so I say I that many corn dogs
last night however if you want to format
it to only show let's say you only want
to show one decimal place or three
decimal places you can have something
like this actually let's change this up
a bit it doesn't really make sense who
you know who counts the percentage of
corn dogs they so we can say like pi is
percent F and then we'll go to a new
line actually if we just copy this
because we're lazy show you guys
something cool so print two more of
those and again right now it just prints
out six decimal places for everyone but
like I said if you only want to show
like two decimal places then what you
can do is between the percent sign in
the F you can press 0.2 now what this is
basically saying is show this flow but
only show it to two decimal places and
we can do another one like point O for
this we'll show it to four so again if
we run this the first one is the default
one which shows six decimal places right
here we're saying only show two that's
why it shows three point one four and of
course PI to four decimal places is 3.14
one and it actually rounds it for you as
you guys can see so pretty freakin sweet
that is how you print stuff using
conversion characters you're actually
going to be using those a lot and the
reason that we do want to use those if
you guys haven't figured out you
probably did but it's for programs like
um you would put conversion character is
the best person ever and then let the
user enter their name so I would enter
Bucky and it said Bucky is the first
best person ever someone else would
enter Sally it's a Sally's the best
person ever and it allows you to
customize
a program so I'm going to be showing you
guys how to get user input from the user
later on but for now I think you guys
for watching and I'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
