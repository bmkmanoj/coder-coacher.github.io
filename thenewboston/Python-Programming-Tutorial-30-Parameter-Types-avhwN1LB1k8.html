30th Python tutorial and the story I'm
going to show you guys how to use
parameters to convert it to a dictionary
now last time I showed you guys how to
take parameters in the function and
convert to a tuple but tuples can do a
whole lot in dictionaries can and
sometimes you just can't use a
tupperware you can use a dictionary and
vice versa so in the last tutorial I
showed you guys how to use an Asterix
and how to make that parameters a tupple
so in this story let me build a sample
shopping cart instead of one Asterix you
actually use two to convert it to a
dictionary so let's go ahead and put
some items in there since you don't know
how many yet it doesn't matter all you
have to do is put two actresses or Astra
C's I don't know I sit and let Python do
the work for you so all we wanted to do
is print out items and now we got a
function called cart and any items we
put in the cart it gets converted to a
dictionary so again let's go ahead and
put our cart and you don't have a single
um item each a dictionary remember it
has an item and a value so that's what
you need for each parameter so instead
of just putting apples you need to put
apples equals 4 because that's how many
apples you want and in your dictionary
this gets treated as the item and this
gets treated is the value so go ahead
and put peaches equal 6 and a beef
equals 60 we're hungry this time so now
once you go ahead and press Enter it
should print out a dictionary that gives
you the values I mean excuse me the
items and the values for each one in
dictionary format so that is how you can
use double actresses or Astra C's in
your function parameter to get a what's
called a dictionary instead of a tupple
so again i showed you guys that you can
find a tuple with ordinary parameter
types in last one but you can also
combine
a tupple ordinary parameter types and a
dictionary as well so say you wanted to
build let's say what can we build we can
define a profile and let's see this
isn't going to make a whole lot of sense
but let's say you wanted someone's first
name and last name watch our ordinary
parameter types you also wanted the ages
of the girls they dated and also what
they want to eat I know not the very
most useful thing but trust me it will
show you the example so the first thing
you want is a first name and last name
those are only going to take one
parameter each as you can see there are
no X's on these ones the next thing we
want it's couple of all the girls they
dated this only takes one umm argument
so that's ages and again with so
asterisks you can have as many as you
want and after this you want items that
they want to eat I don't know what this
will be useful for maybe a uh it won't
be useful for anything now I'm thinking
of a but trust me it'll show you guys
what I need to show you so let's go
ahead and print first and last name
print the ages and also print the items
that they want to eat and now when we um
call our function we need to enter an
unlimited number of information the
first thing we need to do is enter our
first name which is Bucky our last name
which is the Roberts or at least that's
mine and now this will take up the first
two parameter since there are set value
of one first and last now the numbers
you enter after this is the ages so
let's go ahead and enter thirty to forty
two whatever
just going to miss the one right here 76
so again if you're wondering alright how
does your computer I know what it tells
this because it's a single value and
then it automatically goes to this
because it's a tupple but how does it
know when the tupple ends in the
dictionary begins well this is due to
its built-in syntax of that equal sign
so let's go ahead and put bacon equals
four and once it sees you're using an
equal sign it says alright this equal
sign can't be used in the tupple so it
must be using dictionary so these are
thrown in for the first two since they
were set value can only enter 1 for each
these are going to be the couple since
they don't have an equal sign and this
does have equal sign so it must be
dictionary so bacon equals 4
sausage equals 64 and that's good enough
for now let's go ahead and press ENTER
and as you can see I want to print out
the first and last name inside the first
two parameters when I printed out the
tupple I saw all the ones that were
equal to each other or didn't have an
equal sign in it and again the syntax
the double stars for the items it saw it
as dictionary and anytime you're using a
dictionary in your parameters you need
the equal sign so that is how it knew
that this was a dictionary and how to
convert it to dictionary so a lot of the
times it's going to be useful to split
these things up and a lot of times is
actually going to be useful to throw
them together so that is how you use one
function with a bunch of different
parameter types since a regular
parameter type of tupple parameter and
also a dictionary parameter so that is
how you can combine them all in one
function seems confusing now and we
probably won't be doing anything this
complex in the future but I had to show
you guys that it was able to combine
them all so hopefully you understand
this at least a little bit if you don't
don't worry I'll clear things up for you
soon enough but thank you guys for
watching make sure to check out my next
tutorial in Python and I will see you
then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
