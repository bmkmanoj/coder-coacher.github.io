would sit on the porch and Whittle all
day long
once he whittled me a toy bow out of a
larger toy boat I had it was almost as
good as the first one except now it had
bumpy Whittle marks all over it and no
paint because he had whittled off the
paint Jack Handey deep thoughts this guy
is amazing so now that you got your
entertainment for the night out of the
way I figured I would teach you guys a
tutorial so that was kind of a weird
intro but you know sometimes it's
necessary to get your attention so what
have we learned so far we learned that
an if statement can test a condition to
see if it's true or false if it's true
it'll do something simple enough then we
learned that if else and this pretty
much Tessa's Tessa's test two conditions
if it's true do this if it's false do
this pretty much black and white now to
get in the more complex we did nested
if-else and that was all right with like
testing three conditions but once we
want to test like four and five we would
have to nest off and nest stuff and nest
off and you know we're not a bird we
can't nest all this stuff so we need an
easier way I mean we got a way to test
one condition
if two conditions if else three
conditions nested if and that's alright
four or five no way we're nesting all
that stuff so what is a way where we can
this several conditions with a simple
since X well you are in luck because in
this tutorial you're about to learn how
it's called else if oh yeah you hear me
right we already learned if we already
learned else we here learned nested
if-else but now we're going to learn
else if is that confusing enough for you
yet well it won't be in just a second so
check this out let's go ahead and we're
gonna make a program that it's gonna
have to take more than two variables not
like what's your name
male female one two it's gonna have to
take several so what we're going to be
building is a way that they can editor
the time and depending on what time it
is it's going to enter either morning
afternoon or if
or something weird you spiked what the f
time is there something so that's three
options we're working with here and
trust me by the end you'll understand
how this works so enough of just random
talking let's actually get the program
so we can actually understand what I'm
talking about
let's go ahead and make a variable
called time and we're gonna have them
enter the time so let's put in an NS log
and put like enter the FN time because
you know we really want to get their
attention here as well put an
explanation point and now since we were
so mean I might as well give them an
opportunity to enter it using scanf so
of course they're gonna enter an integer
so put percent i and then point that to
what's it time looks good so now
whatever integer they enter is gonna be
stored in the variable time so now let's
go ahead and make what we learned before
it and this is military time by the way
it goes from they can either enter zero
to like 24 it's like that's what we'll
do because that's a nice way you can use
integers for time because if not if they
enter for you back is this morning or
afternoon so we're using military time
for this program whole background so
let's go ahead and do what we learned so
far
if time is less than let's say 11 i
don't know one morning officially ends
if you do leave me a comment NS log
let's put like good morning to you like
a pirate
of course because why wouldn't we and
now since we're gonna be having like
we'll do like 16 for afternoon which is
actually like four o'clock in military
time and we'll do 24 at the end of the
day in anything after that we'll just
put else because they can't have more
than 24 because there's not more than 24
hours in a day so let's go ahead and in
order to give them several other
conditions test we need to put else if
so let's go ahead and put else if time
is less than 16 which means if time is
less than 4 o'clock what are we gonna
log we already took care of morning if
they entered at a time that was less
than 11 o'clock it's morning
if they enter at a time that was less
than 16 which is 4 o'clock you bike
after noon and now let's go ahead and
make another else--if right here and
we'll test for 24 and 24 and it'll say
good night toss and if they enter a
number that's greater than 24 let's just
go ahead and put else right there and
now you see it says statements so if
they enter a number that was more than
24 then that isn't even the time also
let's go ahead and put what the f did
you even enter they probably enter like
a letter or something so let me run this
real quick and then I'll explain you
guys why it works as long as I didn't
get any errors and our F in time wow
that is kind of harsh isn't it it's not
so much when I you're on the receiving
end of that but let's go ahead and enter
9 in the morning good morning to you
building around this baby again and our
F in time I'll let's enter like 18 good
night house building run enter at F in
time and then it will enter like 99 and
it says what the f did you even enter so
let me explain why this works well first
of all you're saying all right if I
entered something like 18 then this
would be true I mean excuse me if I
entered a time like 7 o'clock well 7 is
less than 11 but it's also less than 16
and it's also less than 24 so why does
it know to say good morning to you well
whenever you have an if else if SL is
else if and you can have as many of
these else ifs it doesn't matter as long
as you have these in the same block of
code it's gonna exit the entire block as
soon as it comes the one condition that
is true so for example as soon as it
meets one condition that's true then
it's gonna exit so if it hits true on
this one and it's less than 11 it's not
even going to check of this one or this
one or this one it's only looking for
one true thing so for example
you could write on this one else if the
time is greater than 11 and less than 16
using that you know conditional operator
but there really isn't a need for that
since we already know if it if we enter
12 and it this proves false then we
already know that it's greater than 11
so for example if you enter something
like 6 and you're say all right well
then all these good morning good
afternoon good night they should all pop
up that's not the case because as soon
as a condition proves true it executes
that statement and then it skips all the
rest of these because it already found
its option so that's the basics of what
I'm trying to teach you in this tutorial
again that's else if and that's a better
way to use a test not if not else but
when you have many options that you want
to give the user that's the best way to
do it so thank you for watching I hope
you enjoyed don't forget subscribe and I
will see you next tutorial by the way my
trip to Florida was awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
