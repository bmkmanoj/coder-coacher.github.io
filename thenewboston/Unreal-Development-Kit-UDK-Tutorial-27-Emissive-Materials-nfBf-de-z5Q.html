to your 27th udk tutorial and this is
one of the last tutorials I'm going to
be going over when it comes to materials
it's this one and then I got one more so
27 28 and then I'm going to be going to
food lion grams some oatmeal cream pies
and watching some netflix movies so we
only got two more tutorials on materials
to go and then we can move on to the
next topic so in this tutorial I'm going
to teaching you guys about emissive
materials now we can go ahead and look
at the emissive property right here and
the emissive property or attribute of a
material is pretty much the glow so we
can have like a spaceship with lights on
it and we can make those lights emissive
AKA glow pretty cool huh so I already
know what material I want to work with
so go ahead and select textures right
here and we're going to be grabbing two
textures now go ahead and search wall
light and I found this one in this one
right here and by the way I want to give
you guys this little tip whenever you're
looking through textures you can kind of
see what they're used for by the last
letter for example this last letter is d
this means it should be plugged into the
diffuse property this one is n this one
should be plugged into the normal map
this one is e m that means a missive map
so we're going to be grabbing that one
for the emissive map by anyways since
this is the that's the one we want for
diffuse so go ahead and we're going to
be making out of fuse and in a missive
texture so now let me give you guys
another shortcut in order to add
textures really quick just go ahead and
hold T on your keyboard and click so I'm
going to click with T right there and
it's going to add my texture and I'm
going to click with T right here and
it's going to add my texture now this
one is already set up since we had this
selected in the content browser so go
ahead and hook this up to diffuse
however this one is the wrong one I just
wanted to add that real quick so we will
actually want to associate this texture
with this emissive mapper here so make
sure you have this a Miss and map
selected and go ahead and hit this green
arrow which means use the selected
object in the content browser and
whenever you hit that it switches over
to your missing absence
this was a texture that was selected so
now go ahead and expand that because i'm
done with the content browser and also
expand your preview window just because
i think you look better and now look
what happens whenever i plug this a
missive map into this missive property
keep your eye on the preview window
whenever i plug it in those lights kind
of light up and that's basically what an
emissive map is an emissive map is
basically a black-and-white map and the
white parts tell the udk what parts of
your material needs to glow so wherever
this a Miss map is white that's the part
that glows wherever it's black that's
the part that stays dark pretty cool huh
so now you're saying all right that's
pretty cool but what if I want to kind
of change my lights a little bit say for
example I want to make them a new color
or I want to make them brighter or
dimmer well in order to do that the
easiest way is probably to add a
materials expression so go ahead and
we're going to go ahead and delete this
connection right here and actually I'm
going to drag this back so what we need
to do is we need to add a multiply
expression what the heck was that noise
that I just get it email you guys hear
that anyways go ahead and hold em on
your keyboard and left-click and this is
a shortcut to add a multiply so go ahead
and let me see how i want to set things
up I actually want to control this down
here and there we go so what we're going
to be doing is we're actually going to
be hooking up this multiplied to the
emissive and now this multiplied needs
two values in which to multiply just go
ahead and plug in this one for B and you
remember before when we use that
constant three vector i'll go ahead and
show you if you right-click constant
constant three vector this is a vector
with the r g and b value so go ahead and
grab all of those and plug them into a
and basically this red is going to be
multiplied by this red this green is
going to be multiplied by this screen in
this blue is going to be multiplied by
this blue but if we see right now since
all of these values are 0 this red green
and blue is going to multiply by zero
and remember anytime you have a number
and you multiply by zero the outcome is
zero so right now we're getting these
three RGB values we're multiplying them
by 000 in our outcome is 0 0 0 so this
basically has no emissive properties
right now and we can verify that by
taking away this connection you see when
we take it away and add it take it away
and add it our material doesn't change
glow so what we need to do is we need to
change the globe properties and we do
that by changing the mult or excuse me
the constant 3 vector properties so
let's go ahead and boost one of these
colors by the way by default if you want
to get your old glow back just type 1 11
and there's your old glow back so say we
want to add a little more let me think
of a cool number let me go ahead and
boost my green by like eight hundred and
then go ahead and focus away from that
and now you can see we get in a nice
powerful green glow and this green glow
needs a little bit of blue so I'm going
to go ahead and boost that by 200 and
check it out I get this nice looking
green and blue glow pretty cool huh so
here's what's happening it's taken the
red value and multiplying it by this red
value so we get the same since any
number times 1 is itself it's taking the
green and boosting it by 800 and taking
the blue and boosting that by 200 so now
since your boosted the green and blue we
get a nice green and blue effect and
we've done all that by taking pretty
much to list of color multiply them
together and getting the final list of
color which we plugged into the emissive
property so that's basically how we work
with the emissive property to control
the glow of our material so thank you
guys for watching if you have any
questions don't forget to sign up for my
forum and I'll answer them for you then
so thank you guys one last time and i'll
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
