X tutorial and in this video what I want
to do is all I think is pretty obvious
we need to add some styling we need to
work on that CSS because if you're
looking at this I mean for real this
looks like the first website ever made
it's horrendous so let's go ahead and
work on that Buckey CSS file so I'm just
going to go ahead and put new and I'll
save this as Bucky dot CSS alright so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
have two different sets of styles now
each style is going to be composed of
three classes one class is going to be
for the overall table you know like
background color pretty much the overall
style of the table another class is
going to be for the head and the other
class is going to be for each individual
item so again I'm going to have one
overall style or one theme I'll call it
for the dude and one theme for the chick
and then we'll go ahead and you know set
everything in JavaScript depending on
what button they click using some cool
Ajax but for right now we just need to
go ahead and worry about the Styles so
I'll go ahead and call the do table do
table you see how I came up with that
name all right do table and what do we
want to do for the do table let's just
go ahead and put a boarder of three pics
solid in here is a cool reddish color
that I use a lot CC zero zero zero zero
and that's just nice you know a red
color
what's another background color we can
use background color um here's one my
favorite it's zero zero nine 9 CC and
this is actually one my it's like a
shade of blue but it's an awesome shade
of blue can't wait to show you and since
we have you know kind of a dark red in a
kind of a darker blue we want to
actually change the color of the text
for the entire table to white it'll be a
little bit easier to see so now what I
want to do is this is the overall
styling that we're going to apply to the
entire table now what I want to do is I
want to apply individual Styles to the
head which says things
in my pocket and also the items which
are chapstick and cell phone because
usually the point of a head on a table
is to make it stand out you know like
list the categories or columns so you
want the head to be different than you
know just a regular data or else it's
all going to blend in together so now
what I want to do is make another class
called dude head and I'm just going to
set the font family to verdana not var
Dona ver Dana maybe that's how you say I
don't freaking know set the font weight
to bold because bold is manly and it is
the head and sent the font size to 18
pixels and whenever we put the chick
head we'll make the font size a little
bit smaller because guys are generally
bigger than women you know this is just
biology and now the last thing we need
to do is take care of the items styling
so we're going to put dude and we'll
just go ahead and put items I guess now
for font family we'll just go ahead and
copy this but we're going to change it
to Arial and we'll just go ahead and
copy this font size and we'll put this
at 16 because I would like if the head
is a little bit if the text on the head
is a little bit bigger than the items
right there I think it will look a
little bit you know more sorry I just
lost my train of thought so now what I
want to do is this is basically the
styling for one theme the theme of the
dude so let me just go ahead and copy
this and I'm just going to add a comment
so I don't get confused about where
things are and I'm going to change all
this to chick so we're I see dude chick
table chick head chick items chick dude
kind of sounds like a cool word chick
dude hey chick dude no it's it is and I
changed my mind so what I want to do for
the chick table is I'll just go ahead
and give it a bigger border on 10 pixel
solid
in a pink color that actually like a lot
I mean mmm I mean I don't like it I mean
my sister likes it that's what I meant
to say three three nine nine now for the
border color I'll give it a nice yellow
in ffff you know I'm just kidding
zero zero for the yellow and the color
is not white because um white would not
show up good on here so the default
coloring of all text is black so we
don't need to specify black because
that's just what it's going to be so now
for the chick head um let's go ahead and
give a font family Georgia it's kind of
a girlie you know it's kind of has those
little wavy things on it and font family
ah or excuse me font weight I guess I
can stay bold since it is the head but
we do want to make this a little bit
smaller sense you know chicks a little
bit smaller and let's just go ahead and
change this font family to Georgia to
for the items the font size is going to
be fourteen and one other thing I want
to do is I want to change
font-style:italic because you know kind
of gives you the thing that like cursive
girls italic I don't know just kind of
um fault you know I'm just following my
heart here guys so basically what we did
in this video is we set two main themes
now remember by default as soon as our
web page opens it's not going to have
any theme because we don't know what the
user is yet so we're going to give them
the option of choosing I'm a dude or I'm
a chick or if they're bored they can
just you know click beach back and forth
but basically what we're going to do is
we're going to sit this style if they
click on module in this style if they
click I'm a chick and we're going to be
doing that through Ajax and JavaScript
so right now even though we saved it and
link to it nothing happens so we need to
add mediator of the JavaScript file and
we're going to be doing that in the next
video so thank you guys for watching and
I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
