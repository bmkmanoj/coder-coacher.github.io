we did what's it called programmatically
or through the use of a program computer
program and on so what we did in
JavaScript that's what I'm trying to say
is you basically created an unordered
list with nothing inside it and then we
created a list item put some text inside
it and we did that three times and then
we put this list item inside the
unordered list pretty cool so we're done
right well not yet because think about
it what didn't we do yet well we didn't
tell this unordered list and even though
it's complete we didn't say where do we
want it to show up on the website well
of course we want to show up in the D so
go ahead and put this in your D and this
is how you do that of course the first
thing we need to do is we need the
reference the D through JavaScript so
the D equals document dot get element by
ID so we go ahead and put the ID of it
which is the D so now the D is equal to
this right here so now what we want to
do is we want to put some things inside
our D now the first thing we want to do
is we want to stick this title in here
remember that we created a while ago so
how do you stick things inside other
things in JavaScript well you append
child so the first thing we want to pin
is what's the name of that title title
and after this we want to append the
unordered list which is now complete
by doing this list so now let's go ahead
and run this baby save save refresh and
check it out here are some things old
dan chicken wings and tuna and let me go
ahead and answer this question right now
because you guys are probably saying
okay I see what you did here you
basically created an unordered list and
you know let's item stuck everything
aside explain that but where the heck
are the closing tags shouldn't you you
know append something like this a
closing unordered list tag well that's
the beautiful thing about JavaScript and
also working with
m/l nodes there's no need to manually
close your tags because that's all done
through JavaScript it knows that once
you're done sticking things inside this
list then we can go ahead and close it
for you so you just have to say that
you're creating a list item or unordered
list and then when you're done with it
javascript automatically takes care of
all the housekeeping closes everything
for you it works beautifully so one last
time what we did is and by the way if
you're saying you know what why wouldn't
I just do this you know first of all you
can probably type out this example using
all HTML and it'll be a lot easier but
why did I go ahead and teach you guys
this example well first of all because
whenever we're working with HTML in
generating it dynamically or using XML
and we need to use you know the use of
this in loops well this is really easy
to use in a loop because we can just go
ahead and append a child appendage out
stick a bunch of different items in an
unordered list and it'll just go ahead
and do all the housekeeping stuff for us
so if you want to generate a page
dynamically for someone maybe you have a
bunch of different users users on your
site and they have a list you know maybe
some person has three favorite things
maybe some person has 18 different
things well you can go ahead and make a
for loop and it will loop through
however many times needed and the code
can be different for everyone and it'll
work perfectly for every single person
no matter how many items they have in
their XML so guys let me go ahead and
explain this one more time if you got it
then go ahead and ah skip to the next
tutorial
but basically what we did is we created
you create your notes from the outside
and work inwards we created an unordered
list and then we created each list
element with the text inside and
eventually when we were done with the
list element you have to stick them
inside your list and then what we did is
we basically well I think it's pretty
self-explanatory from here pretty much
stuck everything in the div and
displayed on the screen so guys that is
how you programmatically I think that's
correct word work with XML and Ajax and
that's the tech or excuse me XML in
and that's a technique that we're going
to be using for our future
Ajax tutorials so now you understand it
congratulations by the way
I got a Facebook now everyone was
telling me to get Facebook I finally got
it there's a link below add me see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
