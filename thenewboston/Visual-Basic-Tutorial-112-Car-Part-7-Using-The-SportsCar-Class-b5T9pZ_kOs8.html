slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're gonna be
working more on the car program
now I haven't exactly thinked over the
titles for these yet but it is this
titled part 7 for the car program then
the inheritance and more uninhibited our
part five and six I don't want to
confuse you going from part 4 to forest
fart huh I don't want to confuse you go
on from part four to part seven when the
inheritance ones in between are actually
part five and six so let's go ahead and
overload the constructor for sports car
so the default constructor for sports
car is gonna be the same as our car
which is Setsuko to read speed to zero
and the number of doors to five now what
we want to do is override that so to do
this all you have to do is just type of
sub new you don't have to use the
override keyword you don't have to do
anything all you have to do is just
create a constructor and it will use
that instead of the one inherited from
the what's called the parent class so
car right here is the parent of sports
car so what do we want to do let's go
ahead and set the color equal to red
we'll set the let's find doors number of
doors it's gonna be equal to two because
most sports cars have two doors and or
you could count three for the trunk but
we're just going to do two to simplify
it so what else do we have in the
constructor up here we have the speed so
we'll set speed equal to zero so now
that we've used this default constructor
uh-huh it looks like we got let's just
go ahead and see
we'll just leave speed the way it is
because it's automatically set to zero
because car went in an inherence car
it's got the private in speed and that's
gonna start off at nothing or zero so
let's go ahead and minimize that and now
let's go ahead and add some more to our
sports car class now we'll just add a
function that will get the
power-to-weight ratio so how we're gonna
do this is we are going to use a
function so we'll just type get
power-to-weight ratio and we'll just go
ahead and return some will create our
function so we're gonna call it public
function get power-to-weight ratio and
then we will make it of type double so
now what we're gonna do is we are going
to return something so we will return
and we're just gonna divide the
horsepower by the weight
so we'll just convert the horsepower so
c-type and then we will just type
horsepower and we'll convert that to a
double and then we'll divide that by the
weight so we'll type weight and convert
that to a double so when we divide
doubles we can get a decimal decimal
type so let's go ahead and minimize that
so now let's come over here and we'll
just add one more button so we'll bring
this down sub
we'll make it a little bit bigger and
we'll set the text value to power slash
weight and then we'll set the name to
button get power wait so we'll go ahead
and double click on this and we will
group it with our button click events so
now what we're gonna do is we are going
to type we're gonna call the get power
to weight ratio function in our sports
car class or from our sports car object
the default sports car so we'll come
back to form on BB and we will show a
message box so message box not showed
and now we're gonna do is we're gonna
type convert dot to string and now we're
going to call default sports car dot and
now we're going to use we're gonna call
the weight to the get power to weight
ratio so dot get power to weight ratio
and we'll just put P over W ratio for
the title okay so now here we go
let's take that out of there and put
that over here okay so now let's go
ahead and run our program and see what
happens
the first we need to look at what the
horsepower is going to be so the
horsepower by default is going to be
equal to to come up here it's going to
be equal to 500 since we set it in our
form 1 dot V B so the horsepower is
equal to 500 so let's go ahead and run
this and we will click power over weight
and we get 0.5
because 500 divided by 1,000 is 0.5 so
let's just say we have a 275 horsepower
sports car go ahead and run this we can
get the power-to-weight ratio we get
point 275 so I'm go ahead and add this
code if you have it and once you're done
with that go ahead and move on to the
next tutorial where we're gonna be
talking about some other stuff having to
do with inheritance and then we're gonna
be finishing up the car application and
then we'll be moving on to other topics
so thanks for watching and stay tuned
for the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
