basically work with preferences because
our menu had the Preferences option so
we're going to work with that and
basically the beauty of preferences is
it will save the data even if you exit
the application so actually what I'm
going to do real quickly is go into our
menu and add just one more item and this
will just exit our program so we're
going to just say exit here real quickly
and preffer our ID is exit so we can
refer to that later but let's get into
it what we're going to do is we're going
to start a create a new folder called
XML and this is going to hold our print
where we were going to put our
preferences so again new folder all
lowercase XML make sure it's within your
resource folder right here hit finish
and then just right click hit new
Android XML file just like always and
we're going to call this prefs
dot XML and we have to choose which kind
of prep or which kind of resource we'd
like this to be and so we're going to
select preference right here and again
this is going the reason why we select
this is it's going to have a lot of
defined stuff for us it's going to save
our preferences and upload them anytime
we access them for the most part so
that's really good good stuff good stuff
so then we're going to go into the XML
section of our preferences and set up or
see what we can set up and then set up
some stuff so greater than sign and we
have a few choices here so let's say
edit text preference checkbox and list
preference those are basically the
standard preferences that you're going
to use so we're going to set this edit
text preference up we're going to say
Android and just like when we set up an
item it's going to refer to a title for
the most part so we're going to say
title and we're going to say edit text
or whatever you guys want to title it as
and then we're also going to say a key
again this is a way that the computer or
and
it saves it to the most part and we're
going to just say name is the key
reference and Android we can also do
like summary let's do enter your name
and there we go I mean for the most part
we are done with this preference let's
set up a new one so let's go still
within our preference overall thing and
then set up a checkbox checkbox
preference and we're going to say again
Android title checkbox and Android and
we can set this checkbox if we want to
be checked when it starts or unchecked
so we're going to say a default value
which is what it's going to start as and
we can either set this to true or false
so we're going to say true and also
we're going to add a key reference so
again it can save it we're going to call
this key reference check box
it's not really good this isn't really
going to do much but we're just setting
it up for the most part again Android
summary summary equals a check this box
for the most part nothing spectacular
and then we're just going to finish it
by ford slash less than sign and let's
do one last one last one here so we're
going to say list preference Android
title list
set up a key reference we're going to
also call that list as well we're gonna
set up summary this is a list to choose
from and then we're also going to set up
something else called Android entries
and this is what these will be the
entries within the list and we're going
to say equals new array for the most
part or a rate array of reference that
we're going to refer to here so we're
going to say array /list and Android all
so that's good that's good for now so
we're going to finish that off and then
check it out as you can see we have this
preference screen right here and we have
a detects checkbox and a ListView so
that's basically going to be the end of
this tutorial
pretty short and then we're going to set
up our list array in the next tutorial
it's not going to be as confusing as the
last time we set up a list array this
can be a little bit different a little
bit easier so stay tuned guys I'll have
a good have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
