enjoyed tutorial for the new boss in
again with me Travis we're going to do
in this tutorial we're going to set up
20 new variables and just get them going
and I'm just kidding
because we're done setting up variables
I feel we've set up quite a few and
you're probably like what is going on um
but we're done with the variables no
more now we're just going to reference
them and what we're going to do is we're
going to set up this on create method
within our you know our database helper
class and this is basically going to
create our database for us so let's just
get into it we're going to learn a
little bit about SQL programming not
much though but a little bit so the
first thing is when this oncreate method
gets called it gets passed in a SQLite
database called DB and we're actually
going to access that database and
execute some xql or SQL code so how
we're going to do that is we're just
going to reference the database that's
being passed in called DB and we're
going to use a method called execute SQL
as you can see it takes a string so
we're going to click that and basically
we're going to write some SQL code here
so we're just going to hit enter a few
times or delete that and hit enter a few
times open up our bracket and close it
off here so what we want to do is we
want to set up our database and how we
do that is we use the command called
create table because again our database
is going to be a table so we're going to
within quotations we're going to say
create table create space table like
that and then we're going to hit space
you guys have to follow log pretty
closely here make sure everything's
accurate so the SQL can be executed so
we're going to have this command called
create table and then what we're going
to do is we're going to reference our
basically our table name so our table
name was called database table right
here
so we're just going to say database
table
database underscore table and then we're
going to hit plus and then quotations
again and we're going to hit a space
because again our database table is you
know like just like that so we want to
have a space there and then we're going
to hit open parentheses sign now what
we're going to do is we're going to set
up basically the columns within our
table and we have three columns we have
one for a row ID we have one for our
name and one for our hotness so I'm just
going to hit Plus here and hit enter
down to the next row there and how we
set up our columns now is we're just
going to say key underscore row ID and
then we're going to hit plus and
basically how SQL works is we set up our
you know a column and then we tell it
what kind of column it needs to be you
know what type of variable that is what
we're working with so we're going to say
plus and then quotations space and we're
going to say integer so integer and
because you know our columns even though
it's defined as a string up above here
basically we're going to use this as an
integer because it's going to be Row 1
Row 2 Row 3 etc and what we also want to
do is every time you know we enter a new
row we want to add one to the row ID so
I'll be like Row 1 2 3 etc we do that by
saying primary key because this is
basically how we're going to access all
the rows by that whatever number it is
so it's going to be the primary key and
we're going to say Auto increment comma
space so there we go we set up our first
column and it's a row ID and it's going
to be an integer with the primary key
that we're going to look for later and
it's going to Auto increment so it's
going to be 1 2 3 4 etc and now what
we're going to do is we're going to say
we're basically going to set up our
second column so again you have the
comma space in quotations plus and then
we need to set up our second column
which we called
underscore name and then again +
quotations space and we're going to say
text because it's just you know into the
string SQL use text and we're also going
to say not no comma space and basically
that's going to say you know it's going
to be a text value of some sort so again
we're going to hit + and set up our last
column so that was called key hotness
and again plus quotations space and this
is also going to be a text and not null
we could have had this set up as integer
because again it's on value one to ten
but you know I'm just going to convert
it into a string because it's a little
bit easier and you know whatever so
we're going to reference that as a text
or a string if you guys want to think of
it that way and and we're pretty much
set up we've pretty much set up all of
our columns so we need to end quotations
or end or parentheses right here so
we're just going to add that after our
null and then we just need to hit our
execute statement right there so there
we go
that's basically going to set up our
database and there we go we're pretty
much done for this tutorial we've set up
our database because we're getting in a
database passed in and we're executing
some SQL code which is going to create a
table called our table name and then
it's going to you know within
parenthesis we're going to add all of
our columns first column is going to be
just a integer that's going to increment
automatically and we reference that with
our key row ID our name we also is going
to have a text for a second column or
third column is going to be hotness so
there we go we've set up our our our
database within our on create method and
I'll catch you guys in the next tutorial
where we'll set up some more stuff for
this database so have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
