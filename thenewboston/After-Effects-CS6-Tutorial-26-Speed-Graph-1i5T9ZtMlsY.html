the graph editor tutorial series my name
is buddy Blackford and if you watch the
earlier tutorials I hope you haven't
sent Bucky a bunch of buckyballs yet
well let's head on to this part of the
tutorial where I'll show you another
type of graph called the speed graph
right now the one that we have been
editing in it was called the value graph
when it auto selected the graph type it
auto selected the value graph for us now
I can go to the speed graph here this
type of graph shows you how fast the
points are changing rather than showing
you their values now we can see that the
speed of this graph our speed of this
rotation is 160 9.41 degrees per second
and then here at the end once done you
can see that it stops down here if
you're above the 0 right here that means
that you are rotating clockwise now if I
make a point let's make a point at the
end here
let's make it actually right here it
Auto snaps there and we will rotate
negatively counterclockwise
there we go now we are below the zero
line here and let's watch this real
quick
see that
you can you can tell in the graph editor
again above zero is clockwise below zero
is counter clockwise I'm going to get
back to where we were before now to be
able to see your value graph at the same
time as a reference you can come down
here to the graph options here and click
on show a reference graph and you can
see your value graph right here and it's
not editable so I can't select the point
on it you can just use that as a as a
reference so you can see when you're
comparing when you're moving points you
can see how it definitely switches is
Gregg way too many points at once and
you can see that the graph barely breaks
let's move this point right here and see
how it works
to a ram preview
and there you go it's kind of like in
Easy's
but done manually see that it's just
another way for you to tweak your
animations and another way to edit your
keyframe velocities if you double-click
on a point it will bring up the keyframe
velocity dialog box and watch as I edit
this it it to the left handle here this
is being edited as the incoming velocity
and the outgoing velocity can be edited
also which would be to the right on the
graph editor let's hit OK and you can
see how it changed the velocity here it
breaks here so that you can see what's
going on
I'll hit control Z to go back let's undo
sometimes you have to go up and edit
undo manually because control Z doesn't
always want to work so double click on
it you can also lock so as they are
together you can increase the influence
so what's make this 100% and you can see
how much the see the Bezier handle is
more out now and influence that side
more
undo and that is going to be it for this
part of the tutorial on the next
tutorial we're going to go over position
because it's has its own separate things
that we can go over and figure out
what's going on with it the rotation is
a little bit easier the position gets
harder because it has extra extra values
like an x and y and then when you start
getting into 3d it's going to have a Z
so we'll get into that into the next
tutorial and in the meantime you guys
stay frosty and get your work done have
a good time work hard play hard so see
you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
