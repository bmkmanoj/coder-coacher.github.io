tutorial that I'm making for the New
Boston and in this tutorial i'm maybe
showing you how to use the progress bar
control so are gonna need for this
tutorial is two buttons and the progress
bar so just go over to your toolbox and
drag a progress bar over to your form on
your size this first property that we're
going to be looking at is the maximum up
for you and the maximum property will
basically just tell you the maximum
value of your progress bar can hold and
the value is basically just how much
progress your progress bar shows so
since the maximum is 100 if we set the
value equal to 50 then we would show
half progress because half of 100 is 50
if we were to set the value equal to 100
then we would see the progress show full
and if we were to set the value equal to
zero it would start up at the beginning
here we didn't see any progress at all
then I'll bring us to our next property
which is the minimum property and that
is basically just a minimum value of
your progress bar can hold and you're
almost always going to want to keep that
at zero so now I'm going to show you how
to show progress in your progress bar
using code so just go ahead and double
click on your do stuff button and we're
going to be using there just we're going
to be using U value to set the value of
the farthest bar so it's going to do the
progress bar one dot value and then
we're going to plus equals ten so every
time we click this button it will add
ten to the progress bar so it'll move up
a tenth of the way cents a tenth of a
hundred is ten and it will take ten
clicks to get to the end of the progress
bar let's just go ahead and test this
tile to make sure it works
yep moving quite smoothly now I'm not
sure you have a program there you step
on so now let me double click on the
reset button right here we're just going
to set the progress bar ones value equal
to its minimum value so I'm just going
to do progress bar one dot value
equals zero since its minimum value so
no matter how much progress we ever hear
when you click the reset button it sure
does reset it back at the beginning
yep even if we had more progress yo now
if we're going to click this button 11
times since the maximum is 10 we're
going to get an error yep it says value
110 is not valid for value and it says
the value should be between the minimum
and the maximum well instead of using
the de setting the value we can use the
perform step method and that performs
that method will basically this little
bit a set number of values up so and you
can change the size of the stuff I use a
step property right now this step is
equal to 10 so we would just be doing
the same thing as before only this time
perform step nothing so this time when
you click it no matter how many times
you click it we won't get that area so
it's just a much cleaner way of doing
things and I suggest using this method
over use just setting the value of it
and like I said you can change the size
of the stuff just by using the step
property so if we were to changes to 1
and move up only one value tiny
performance stuff yeah you can barely
see the progress if I can forget really
rapidly yeah so that's one style for the
progress bar the next one that I'm going
to be showing you is mainly going to be
used when you don't know when the end of
the process or when you don't know when
a process will end so huge to launching
is a style down here to Marquis and in
order to have it do Marquis we're going
to using the Marquis animation speed
property and if we set if we keep this
at 100 right now it will basically just
start moving as you leave debug and we
don't want that so we're gonna have it
only start moving across when we click
this do stop button
so we're gonna set the Marquis
animations need now equal to 100 which
is a pretty good speed for it so now I
need the bug here you should to see it
cross and there won't be an end and
you'll see so yeah it just continues to
scroll across and this is mainly used
when you don't know in the end the
process will bleed and you can change
the speed of this if you want it to go
faster just lower the value so if we set
this equal to ten it will go really fast
yep if we set it equal to like I'll set
equal to 200 because of thousands really
slow so if we said to equal to the queue
under here you see it moves much slower
in order to reset it like right now when
you click reset it's not going to do
anything to set the value equal to zero
well you kept me put to set the Marquee
animation speed equal to zero but
basically that will just halt it in its
tracks so now if you click this step on
will still see the green it'll just stop
moving so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna change the style of the progress
bar to something different
we're gonna set equal to blocks so now
let me click the reset button it should
just reset it back to the beginning
yep over now and put this do stuff on
and it's not going to do anything is the
wrong style so we're just have to change
the style every time that you go to
click this button step is equal to
progress bar one our progress our style
marquee so now this what we should work
fine now I'm gonna click this it moves
like this fun your resets it and it
should move again lets you click this
button and yep everything looks good so
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
unusually progress bar control so see
you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
