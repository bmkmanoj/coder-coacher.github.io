computer networking tutorial and in this
video what I want to do is now that we
understand the basics of a protocol it's
basically the rules for successful
communication among two parties in less
toriel we looked at a guy talking to a
girl but now let's go ahead and like I
said relate this to computer networking
and we'll say that you are on your
macbook so here's a macbook with the
screen and we'll draw a little keyboard
right there wow this is a pretty
terrible looking macbook but oh well so
this is your Mac over here and we'll say
that you wanna you know view a website
or something so web server is going to
look something like this so again unlike
the last example where we had a guy
talking to a girl trying to get his
number now we have a Mac talking to a
webserver
trying to get a website it's kind of
like the dating for computer network
side or not I don't even know I said
that's pretty stupid but now let's go
ahead and look at a conversation between
two computers trying to get a website so
this is basically what happens whenever
your request a website if you're on your
Mac the first thing it does is it ask
the web server can I connect to you so
this is the first kind of exchange and
what the web server does is if it has
permission then it says yes for example
if it's a web server if it's a personal
home server it's going to of course say
no but since this is a web server we'll
say it's I don't know my web server for
the New Boston org best website ever by
the way the web server is going to go
yes you have my permission
now the Mack now knows that it now has
the authority to connect so now what
it's going to do is it's going to
request the file which is of course the
web file so it can view the website so
it's going to send a request that looks
like this get and we'll talk about why I
wrote get in a little bit file and the
file is just going to be you know the
New Boston org arm slash index or like
tutorials dot PHP or something like that
so this is basically the file that it's
asking for and in return of course the
web server sends the file to the Mac and
of course the Mac interprets it views it
as a website everyone is freaking happy
so let's go ahead and take a step back
and learn why this exchange was
successful well first of all this works
because both of the computers the Mac
and the webserver
they knew the rules they follow the same
protocol or the same set of rules now in
computer networking both the computers
this one and this one they must follow
the same protocol or else you can't have
a successful communication you can't
have computer networking at all now of
course it was a lot easier to understand
whenever we're talking about human
beings the different rules but the
protocol pretty much the protocol in
computer networking is the format and
we'll look at this later it's different
for every protocol the format in the
order of messages those are two big ones
so of course if this Mac um you know ask
for a file before it even had permission
this exchange wouldn't work or you know
if the webserver was trying to send a
file in this Mac over here it didn't
even ask for a file yet then of course
you know things would get really messy
and computer networking would not be
possible if you know every web server in
the world we're just sending random
files out probably you know the internet
wouldn't be it's successful as it is
today
so that's the basics of what protocol is
in computer networking and also you know
a human being protocol basically a set
of rules that both computers must follow
in order to have a successful
communication now let me go ahead and
show you guys something else real quick
that's pretty cool and you guys may have
seen this before this protocol right
here well I'll talk about the different
types of protocol in a second but
whenever you look at on a URL you're
going to see something like HTTP and let
me write these in different colors ww
the new probably going to run out of
room Boston org and what's it another
color I didn't use and we'll just write
like slash index dot PHP so now if you
guys you know used to type in URLs and
you guys didn't really know what you're
typing in now you have enough knowledge
of computer networking to understand
everything the first part right here
this HTTP this is the protocol hopefully
at protocol protocol Wow I cannot spell
so this is actually a hyper text
Transfer Protocol and again like I said
there are a lot of different protocols
or sets of rules in computer networking
whenever you want to request the website
you know from the World Wide Web or the
Internet this is the protocol or the
rules that your computer has to use this
right here ww asana org this is actually
the name of your server server name
because remember a server is just a
special computer so of course whenever
you want to ask for a file which is this
part right here a file from a computer
that somewhere out in the world you need
to know again the address of the
computer because you just don't want to
ask random computers for files only a
specific computer so this of course is
the file so again whenever you want say
to look at a website on my web page yeah
that's what or a web page on my website
rather what you're going to do is you're
going to say ok I want to ask this
server for this file and I'm going
to use this protocol which is basically
the set of rules now my server knows
it's already set up whenever you request
a website this is the rules that you
must follow so again hopefully you guys
understand a little bit about protocols
and if you don't in this goes for the
rest of my tutorials if you guys have
any questions then just go ahead and ask
me on Facebook or Google+ or even
Twitter or the best places probably my
forum on my website because if I don't
answer you there are thousands of other
people willing to so when these thank
you guys for watching number because
subscribe yada yada yada I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
