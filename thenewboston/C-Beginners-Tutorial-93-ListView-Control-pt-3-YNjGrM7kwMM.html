c-sharp tutorial that I'm making for the
New Boston and in this tutorial I'll be
showing you how you eat list and control
a little bit more so in the previous
tutorials I told you to make it so that
users cannot select more than one item
in the list view well we're going to be
working with multiple items selected in
ListView today so this go down to go
over to the properties menu for your
list view and scroll down if you see
multi select and make sure that's not
true now and we're also going to change
the text in the context menu because it
says get name of item we actually want
to get the name of multiple items so
we're gonna put parentheses ass inside
of it so that symbolizes that there
could be more than one item selected so
now we debug here is to make sure that
we can select multiple items let's just
test it a lot of two items here so now
when we hold down control we should be
able to select this eyes as well or if
we hold down shift if you work yep okay
so now let's just edit the what the code
what code executes when you double click
on this in context later so currently we
just get the first item in the selected
and you can tell because this is a zero
and this basically means the index of
the selected items and this works fine
for when you only have on the one item
selected because it is get the first
item in the collection well if you have
two or three items selected then this
will just go for the first item you
selected so let's go ahead right here
and see what happens since you can
select multiple item so now if we select
both of these we're only going to get
DFG yeah and not another one because we
only tell us you get the first item
selected if you wanted to get the second
item selected we just put a one there
got another one so now we should get um
yeah asdf because out of the second item
is selected if you wanted to loop
through or get all the items that we
have selected we can even for each date
so I'm going to be more eg and then I'll
create a new Westview item I'll LDI in
all the items that the user has selected
in the list view so the selected items
property so now it'll loop through every
item that the user has selected in the
list view and we're just gonna have a
message box to display the full name of
that item I'm going to do L VI dot sub
items and since we're going to get the
full name we're just gonna put 0 in here
because this one 0 this one's one in
this Vince - we're gonna put 0 and then
going to use the text property to get
the text of it so now we have multiple
or so now when we have multiple item
selected I should get a two message
boxes if you select two so you should
get one for FAS EF and one for asdf yeah
and yeah two message boxes if we had
another one we mean like Adam so now if
we have all these selected we should get
one for each yep if you wanted to get
the age we just put a 1 in here we
should get the age of the all these
selected items also an actual number
here this time
now let's just select all three of them
in here get 12 we should get 15 and 73
yep and you can do the same thing with
the email let's put a two here and you
get the email address of the persons or
other people selected so that's pretty
much it for this tutorial on dealing
with multiple selected items so see you
