interface built looking beautiful let's
go ahead and add the functionality to
actually make these buttons work in
other words whenever the user types
information in here and they click Add
we need to take this information convert
it to a product object and then stick it
in the table and of course the delete
button is whenever they select an item
such as The Notebook DVD and hit delete
it should actually delete it from this
table so let's get started and before we
do we actually need to set actions on
the add button so whenever we click the
Add button what do we want to occur well
we're just going to be building a method
called add button clicked and the same
thing for the delete button so bleep on
set on action delete button clicked and
it looks good so let's actually start
building these methods so just put
public void add a button clicked alright
so again like I said what we're going to
be doing is whenever they click the Add
button we're going to be going looking
at these inputs seeing what they typed
in taking these values using it to build
a product object and then sticking that
object on our table sounds confusing but
it's actually incredibly simple so the
first thing we need to do is create a
blank product object set this equal to
new product and remember I told you guys
whenever we create a new product we can
do so in one of two different ways we
can create a blank product at first with
these default values and then set all of
the properties manually the name price
and quantity or we can just add them all
at once like we did down here now that's
great if you're just using it with code
you can use this technique but here's
the thing whenever we're using user data
to pretty much create a new object
we want to make sure that they typed in
the right data for example we wanted to
do some validation in other words let's
say that they typed in on like L 7 2 1 4
4 price well we obviously don't want to
store that in our database so we
actually need to like validate and do
some things with the value they typed in
so we can't just do it this way so what
we're going to be doing is this product
set name and I'll just show you guys
some real quick techniques I'm going to
leave the advanced data validation up to
you guys but we're basically going to be
doing this for the name input we're just
going to get the text in other words get
whatever they typed in to that name
input field and we're going to be using
that as the name now for the product set
the price of it art so for the price of
it whenever they type something in to
this input right here by default it's a
string so if we were to just do price
input
get text like that it's not going to
work it's giving us an error right now
because it says okay the user typed in
some value even if they type in a number
it's still going to view it as a string
by default so we pretty much need to say
okay we're setting a price
we need to parse it into a double before
you can use it as a product object and
actually let me cut this so this is a
string value of the price hopefully they
typed in a number and if we call double
parse double what we can do is we can
paste in a string value for example the
number like two point four nine for
$2.49 and it's going to take that string
convert it into a double and set the
products price as that so again this is
just really a a simple thing about what
I was trying to explain earlier that we
need to actually do some stuff to the
user data before we just stick it in as
a new
product and the last thing we're just
going to do the same thing for quantity
now a quantity is actually an integer so
if you call int parse int what this is
going to do is it's going to take
whatever value they typed in to the
quantity input and it's going to convert
it to an integer now again we're still
going to have some problems if they like
type in the word bacon as a price or a
quantity but like I said I'll leave that
up to you you guys already you know
probably can figure out how to validate
that kind of data so once we have a
product develop the product now has a
name a price and the quantity it's ready
to go all we have to do is we have to
add it to the table so in order to do
that we have to get items and this gets
all the items that are already on the
table and we have to add product so this
actually sticks whatever they typed in
converts to products and sticks it on
the table but the one last thing I want
to do is I actually want to clear all
the input fields because if we just hit
the Add button it's going to add the
item to the table but all of their data
is still going to be in those input
fields and it's going to be kind of
weird so if you kit name input clear and
what was in price input clear and
quantity input clear all right so now
actually let me comment this out and run
it real quick so the Add button logic is
set up alright so they can type a name
in such as on like tuna fish what is the
price of tuna fish $8.99 and how many do
you have I have a sixty five tuna
fishies alright I'm going to click Add
it converts it to a product adds it to
the table and all of these fields are
clear now if I didn't hit clear then
that tuna fish $8.99 sixty five would
still be in there and they would have to
actually select them all and delete or
manually
we just save them some time so now the
add button works to delete bond however
we need to build that functionality so
let me uncomment that I'll show you guys
how to do that
delete button clicked so public boy
delete behind clicked all right now this
is actually even easier what we're going
to be doing whenever they hit the delete
button is we're going to be getting a
list of all the items currently in the
table and then we're going to be getting
a list of whatever item they selected
and then we compare the two and pretty
much say remove whatever they selected
from all of the items in the table and
it's actually probably easier if I just
shut up instead type in some code so the
observable list we of course need two of
them and they're both can be products
product selected so we're going to have
a list of product selected which is in
this case just going to be one product
and the second one is just going to be
all products so this is going to be
every item in the list everything you're
selling and this is going to be the item
that they currently have highlighted and
all products set this equal to table get
items so that's how you do that we
already saw that up here gets all the
items currently in the table now for
products selected it's kind of similar
but not quite table get selection model
and get selected items now again what
this is going to return any items that
the user has selected our selection
model right now I believe we can only
select one item but we can change that
so they can select multiple items at a
time but I'll just leave it like this
for now all right so now we pretty much
just have to go through and I'll show
you guys a shorthand version of it so we
can say for each product that they have
selected what
we want to do well we just want to say
all products remove so this is a
shorthand version of it again for all
products that they have selected remove
them from all products eat pretty much
remove them from the main table so now
let me run this and check it out make
sure our Add button is still work by
typing tuna for $8.99 and we have you
know 88 of them and now you're saying
you know what actually sold out of
bouncy balls a bunch of little rascals
came in and bought them all let me just
hit that and delete it and also corn you
know I'm not selling corn anymore
because who the heck buy his corn delete
that too and just like before still have
all our functionality of sorting
rearranging all that good stuff so that
is pretty much how you work with tables
ladies and gentlemen there are a couple
of other advanced features but I'm going
to wait till probably on a couple
tutorials to talk to you guys about them
we got other stuff to learn now but for
now thank you guys for watching don't
forget to subscribe see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
