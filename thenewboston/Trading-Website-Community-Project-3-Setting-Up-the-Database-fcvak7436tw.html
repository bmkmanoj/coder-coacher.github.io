third video and in this video I'm going
to show you guys how to set up your
database that you're going to need
whenever working on this website so the
very first thing we want to do is we
want to create a blank file now all the
Splane file is going to do is store the
information of our database name our
username and our password because
eventually after we create a database on
our server we need a PHP file that can
connect to that database so whenever we
create our PHP file it's going to need
some information like what database
you're going to connect to and it needs
a user and a password to make sure you
have privileges to connect to that
database so that's why do we just we on
it we wanted to create a blank file
that's just going to store the
information for now you'll see later on
so in your cPanel go under the databases
section and you're gonna see a little
link that says my SQL databases now
hopefully you already watched my MySQL
tutorial so you already know how to do
this but for those of you who don't well
this is how you do it so the first thing
that you need to do is create the
database itself and I'm just going to
name mine Bucky underscore Lisa great
dad base so now the first thing we need
to do is save this database name
right like that database is Bucky Lisa
and the next thing that we need to do if
I could click the right thing here is go
back and now that we have a database we
need a way to access the information in
that database and in order to do that
you need to create a user so I'm just
going to name mine Bucky underscore user
makes sense and for the password I'm
just gonna use this password generator
I'm not going to show you guys and just
go ahead and click I've copied this in a
safe place and use password now you
actually don't need to actually check
something
okay you actually don't need to copy the
password right now because once you go
ahead and hit create user right here
it's gonna verify your user and your
password so I'm gonna go ahead and copy
this information my user is Bucky user
paste that in your little temporary file
right here user is Bucky user
and for the password it is this long
thing right here password equals this
and I'm not going to show you guys my
password because then when he hooligans
is gonna sneak in my database and delete
everything mine anyways go back and now
what you did is you have a database
created and you have a user now the last
thing they need to do is you need to
tell your website ok I want this user
that we just created to be able to
access the database so under this last
section right here we want to select add
user to database select the user that
you want we only have one not a lot of
options there and select the database
which is Bucky Lisa and go ahead and add
that user to that database now what it's
going to ask is what privileges do you
want to give this user what do you want
to allow them to be able to do to your
dad base now what we would usually do
whenever we finalize our website we only
want to give them the privileges that
they need that way just in case someone
hacks on our website they can't do
things they aren't supposed to do so go
ahead and select all privileges this is
just for a testing purposes it's the
easiest thing to do and go ahead and hit
make changes now this user is able to do
anything we want to the website which
makes it really easy to test now go
ahead and hit go back and bam check it
out
the user is now added to the database
and they can do anything that it wants
to so now what we need to do is actually
something really simple go to home and
go to the section if I could find it PHP
myadmin this is where we can mess with
the inner workings of our database so
the first thing we want to do is select
our database
this one right here if you're like whoa
who the heck made this one information
schema or scheme'
I think it's called schema I don't know
but it's like the default database so
don't ever access that it's the one that
came setup with your server the one that
you made go ahead and click this now as
you can see it says no tables found in
database why is that well because we
didn't create any tables yet
what we need to do is import them and
that is when you guys are gonna thank me
because I already created all the tables
that we need so go ahead and click this
import button and you know that forum I
told you guys on tnb forum calm this
section that's project Lisa I'm gonna go
ahead and include these tables in that
section right there in a little zip file
or maybe just the SQL file so anyways if
you guys want this file I'm gonna go
ahead and put it for download right
there but anyways what you need to do is
you need to go ahead and import and
hopefully you guys will have the file
downloaded by now so browse your
computer and go to wherever you stored
that file I think I stored mine in Lisa
nope where the heck did I put it
Danielle Wow I don't even know where I
put my own file uh hold on I'll find it
eventually oh there it is under project
Lisa again this file is gonna be under
your download section but I saw it
somewhere stupid for some reason and I'm
just gonna name it Lisa tables SQL now
go ahead and open and all of the default
settings are good so it says once you
browse to that file just go ahead and
hit go and check it out it says imported
or import it has successfully finished
21 queries executed now if you go ahead
and click on your database named Bucky
Lisa you see all of these tables right
here feed back tables messages items on
the trading shipping info users how easy
was that instead of taking an hour and a
half to create all of these individually
one click of a bun there you go so again
like I said this file is gonna be
available at my forum under the project
the Lisa section so there you go if you
want to download it and by the way it
doesn't need a password anymore
so anyways thank you guys for watching
number you get to subscribing in the
next video I'm gonna be talking about
what all these tables are and specific
and yeah there you go so anyways I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
