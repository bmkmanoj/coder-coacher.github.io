in in this video we're going to start to
build the clients messaging system now
what you need to do is you need to make
an entirely new project and make two new
classes called client and client tests
Java this is basically going to be set
up the same as we you know did before
the client is going to be responsible
for making the GUI and all of the
connection crap and the client test is
just going to be responsible for
actually running the stuff inside the
client class so the reason that we need
two different projects one for the
client and one for the server is because
this isn't one big program with you know
two different classes in it these are
actually two separate Java programs that
are going to be on two completely
different computers and once both of the
programs are running then they can
connect with each other but guys just
remember this isn't one program it's two
separate programs that go on two
different computers one on the client
and one on the server so this one of
course goes on the client which is
typically you know just a personal PC
and the first thing we need to do just
like before is import a bunch of stuff
so import Java I Oh import Wow Java ok
java.net
AWT and then we need to import Java
event
okay you know probably if I just don't
wait for crap to pop up and I just type
it manually they're probably a little
bit easier simpler Java imports last but
not least Java x-wing alright so there
we go we imported everything we need
which is five lines and the next thing
we need to do of course just like the
server-side is we need to inherit from
Drake room extends oh excuse me I just
got done eating a sub and I actually
ordered it from a place called Rex it's
right here because at first I was going
to get one from Subway but I walked into
subway in the lady who was working at
Subway was actually clipping her
toenails so I just looked at her if she
looked at me and then I walked her right
back out and then I went to Drex to get
a sub so you know I wasn't that hungry
but anyway so you know now that I got
that story out of the way let's go ahead
and code all the variables that we need
again I'm not going to go over them
again so most of them are the exact same
J text field user text is where you're
going to be typing the crap J text area
is that chat window where everyone's
messages are going to be displayed drive
it object output screen output now I'm
probably the only thing that might
confuse you guys is remember I told you
guys that one of these computers is
going to be on a server and one of them
is going to be on the client which is
basically like your personal computer
that you have a home on your laptop or
something and I said in the last
tutorial that the output whenever we
coded the server class was from the
server to the client but since this is
the clients class now in the client is
going to be running this program then
whenever we view the output the output
is from this computer which is a laptop
or your personal computer to the server
so the output isn't always from the
server to the client it's whatever
computer you're running the program on
to the other computer flown away from
this flowing out so just remember that
so private
object input stream will name this input
which is you know from the server going
in to this computer and private string
message just the message and private
string server IP I probably don't need
to explain you guys what that is but if
you kind of guess it's the IP address of
the server aka the person you are
talking to so the less but not least
variable is private probably actually
the most important one it is socket
connection and you guys already know
what a socket is basically the
connection itself so now that we got all
of our variables set up in the next
story we're going to be doing is we're
going to be creating the constructor and
actually the constructor is built a
little bit differently um like the
server it's going to be responsible for
taking care of all the gooey stuff but
we're going to add one more thing in
there and I don't want it to throw you
so guys definitely make sure you check
out the next video where we're going to
be building the constructor in the GUI</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
