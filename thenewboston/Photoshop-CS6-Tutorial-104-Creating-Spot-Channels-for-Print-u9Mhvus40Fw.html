buddy Blackford here and we're going to
go over creating spot color channels in
Photoshop cs6 so if you work in the
world of service bureaus and printing
presses there are certain stuff that you
need to do to create an accurate printed
document such things are you need to
make the colormode CMYK and you need to
save the document as a format that's
designed for creating color plates such
as a dcs 2.0 which is a desktop color
separations if you were wondering what
that meant and then something you may
want to apply spot colors to an image
and one spot colors are is they instruct
the printer to apply a specific color to
a specific portion of the document and
I'm not just talking about telling the
printer to put down a blue color I'm
talking about color profiles like
different profiles like Pantone color
and everything like that so if I quickly
come over here and I'm just going to
load up my reset my swatches to the
original and bring up my small list here
if I come down here we've got these
different colors pastel yellow pastel
blue pastel and things like that peer so
these are certain colors and then we
come down here and these are the other
kind of colors I'm talking about Pantone
color bridge coded Pantone CMYK so if I
click on that and add it I'll just
replace it now these are certain colors
that are exacts and that can be used
with you to make a spot color to get an
exact color on a printing press because
sometimes when you just use the CMYK
it's not always the exact thing like
sometimes companies like if you're going
to make a Pepsi
logo or something like that they want
the exact colors and you can't be off at
all so just keep that in mind so what
we're going to do is make sure our load
up an image and then go to your image
and make sure it's in CMYK color hit OK
so we've got that and you know what CMYK
if you go back into image mode and it's
checked right there now let's create a
new layer and we need to make a
selection and what I'm going to do is
I'm going to make the this text I'm
going to go to this text tool here we're
going to go to the horizontal horizontal
type mask tool so I say that right it's
kind of hard to say I'm just going to up
this a little bit so I can see it and
I'm when I type it's just going to
create a mask for us so let's go ahead
and type hola amigos and then I'm going
to go ahead and then click off of it and
now I've got my selection here now we
need to go to the channels panel here
and then we're going to go to the
channels options and we're going to
click on new spot Channel and we get to
pick our color that we want and we can
check it anything here go to this one
hit OK or we can go into our color
libraries and pick out of our different
tones here that we want so this you may
not have known so this is pretty cool
there's so many colors so I'll just pick
this Pantone 295 see whatever got the
numbers completely wrong but I hit OK
it's going to put the name in it for me
solidity here it's pretty much opacity
but it doesn't really affect the press
output so just hit OK and now we had
this new spot channel here and it's
going to show up on our layers and
that's how you create one now let's
check it out I start undoing some of
these you can see that it is up there I
see if I got to move it up or something
oh it'll just be there um it's in the
it's in the back and we can't see it
because the solidity was at zero so
let's step back real quick step
backwards let's create our spot channel
again and then if I up the solidity here
to 100% and we're definitely where it's
going to show so if we do it to 50% just
like I said it was kind it's kind of
like opacity so I put this to 100% and
hit OK now it's on top and you can or
you can actually see it so that's all
there is to making spot channels and
remember this is going for work on like
things like brochures or like a book
cover like if you're creating like a
cover for a novel that's going to be
printed out you're gonna need to use
this and things like that so keep that
in mind just anything that needs to be
printed on a printing press so check out
Bucky's room org here I'll bring it up
check that out the website and then you
can check out the forum we got a
Photoshop section where we talk about
Photoshop in there and love to see guys
joining in and getting in on the
conversation and thanks for watching
this video I hope to see you guys in the
forum and on other videos have a good
one everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
