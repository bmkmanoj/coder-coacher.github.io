video what I want to do is I want to
explain you guys why pixels suck so you
guys probably already know what pixels
are if you took magnifying glass and you
held it up to any computer screen like a
TV your smartphone the computer screen
that I don't know just like a desktop
you're going to see that the image on
your screen is made up of these tiny
dots called pixels so why did they suck
they're just thoughts right well the
reason they suck is because these pixels
can be different sizes so what exactly
am I talking about well on some smart
phones those tiny screens the resolution
on those is 1280 I'll write it down
1280 by 720 that means that that little
screen has 1280 pixels 1280 pixels on
left to right and 720 pixels and top to
bottom so all right that's pretty
interesting now the problem is on some
TVs like big TVs like 32 inch TVs it
also has 1280 pixels by 720 pixels tall
so even though these screens have the
same resolution or the same amount of
pixels they're dramatically different in
size well what's that matter who really
cares well this is the problem say that
you made I don't know a website or
something that had 14 pixel font well
maybe you're looking at this on the
computer and you could read it really
easy everything was you know looking
good and then you went to look at it on
a smart phone with the same resolution
in all the text was incredibly small so
this is why whenever you make font with
pixels and pretty much everything on
whenever you're making a website and you
use pixels that is why you should never
use pixels in that it's really annoying
um whenever you try to design this way
so instead of pixels what I want to do
is I want to show you guys about
something called e/m and it's not
exactly um you know different for
measurement like an inch a pixel or
anything like that it kind of works in a
different way
you guys are going to love it so rule
number one whenever you're making
responsive web designs or responsive
websites if you ever see pixels think to
yourself I'm probably doing something
wrong and I probably want to use
something else
so let's go ahead and do that right now
so what I did already is I made two
files ones called index.html and I made
another one just for CSS and I also kind
of assume that you guys know the basics
of web development before you start
watching these tutorials if you don't
actually um watch this is probably the
best series of watch arm this html5 one
right here will teach you the basics of
web design and also um CSS but as long
as you guys know like the bare basics
you guys are going to be able to follow
along with this easy so the first thing
we need to do is make very simple html5
website so of course HTML and we have to
end it too and also if you guys don't
feel like typing any of this code and
maybe you just want to sit back and
learn I'm going to be taking all the
code from all of these tutorials and I'm
going to be posting it in my forum in
the words at the html5 web design
section so again it's all going to be
it's for you guys don't have to pay for
it or anything just go armed
paste it or copy/paste it and you guys
will be good all right so we need HTML
right there language equals the N now
let's just make a really simple head and
body so we don't have to for any other
tutorials body for some reason I kind of
smell right now and doesn't usually
distract me but it is must have I have
like weird odor I ate something weird
all right I'm just going to name this
example Bucky's room because you know
why not and what I want to do is I also
want to link to my stylesheet right here
because for some reason um I really
don't like having the Styles right here
even though might be easier to explain
in sorrow it's really bad
this so might as well build some good
habits right now so link stylesheet and
also href equals whatever you named your
stylesheet I named mine I like name of
my style sheets the same as the website
or the web page so alright so now we
have the basic shell and the empty CSS
file no styling whatsoever so first of
all let's go ahead and learn exactly
what IEM is and I want to do this by
making four different divs
so the first div is actually not going
to be anything special at all all we're
going to do in this one is just make
some normal text so this is normal text
so basically our browser is going to
decide whatever text this is is it times
new roman' is a blue is it black is it
14 pixels 12 pixels I don't know we're
going to leave it up to the browser to
follow its heart side what's best for us
now I also want to make three other ones
and I'll do this so we didn't do the CSS
we'll do that in a second but this one
is going to be class one and the other
ones are just going to be class two and
three keep things nice and simple all
right so we've made three different
classes so it would probably a good idea
right now to hop over in our CSS file
and actually make those classes or
browser doesn't get mad at us so by
default this is what I'm going to do we
already know that the font size is a
hundred percent and this is just pretty
much saying that whatever you have by
default keep it that way so the reason I
even include that is because later on
when I'm showing you guys exactly what
this is we're going to be tweaking that
and you guys are going to really
understand it'll help me explain exactly
what's going on but right now let's go
ahead and make those classes one two and
three we're going to make those
utilizing those things I'm talking about
called EMS so in class one what I'm
going to do is I'm going to set the font
size to 1 e
em now I'm going to copy this because
I'm too lazy to type it out and I'm
going to put two and three so one of
them is going to be one am one of them
is going to be 1.5 VM and the other one
is just going to be two so you can
actually make EMS with a decimal place
you can actually make one with less than
1 like 0.5 a.m. so let me first what do
we have we have 1 a.m. so this right
this is 1 M you know just write 1.5 m na
emt that would be like emergency
transport vehicle or something I know
what am I talking about and this is 2.0
a.m. so let's save this and find out
what the heck EMS are so run launch and
chrome and check it out so this is your
normal text that we got by default from
the browser we didn't do anything to
this it has no am supplying whatsoever
now this one right here is 1 a.m. so as
we can see 1 a.m. is the exact same as
the default now that's pretty much what
an e/m is whenever you use which click
on our own thing whenever you use EMS
what you're saying is this the number we
give you is relative to the default font
size so if the default is 12 1 a.m. is
also 12 now 1.5 p.m. means take the font
and it's going to be the size 1.5 from
the default so arm pretty much whatever
the font size is by default 1.5 that
size would be this and twice the size is
2 a.m. so it's not any given value like
arm 12 pixels 20 pixels what it is is a
relative value so this 2 a.m. right here
is twice the size of the default font
all right so why would you ever want
that what do you want more control over
it
to explicitly give it a pixel value
we'll check this out what you can do is
this if you ever wanted to change your
font size maybe to the base 250 well
before if this was like 10 you need to
go through and make this 15 pixels this
20 pixels and with an entire website you
could take a long time but now all I
have to do is change this base size to
150 and check this out all of the font
grew because it's all relative
based on that normal text so instead of
having to go through each one like I
said you just change the base and all
your font adjust appropriately so this
way you can do awesome things like if
you always want your header to be or
your headings to be twice as big is the
normal text well it doesn't matter how
big your text is no matter if it's I
don't know arm big for bigger devices or
small for smaller devices
whenever you use e/m everything is
relative so you just have to change one
thing and the rest of your website fits
appropriately so that's the benefit of
arm what eeehm is and why it's so useful
so pretty much that you only have to
change one thing so in the upcoming
tutorials what I'm going to do is I'm
going to show you guys how to utilize it
pretty much to adjust your font size
appropriately for every size screen in
every size device so for now thing guys
for watching and also like I said I'm
going to be taking all of this code and
posting it on my forum so if you don't
feel like typing it and you just want to
watch these tutorials find on me so umm
well I'm going to shut up now and I'll
see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
