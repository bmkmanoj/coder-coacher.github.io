tutorial that I'm making for the new
Austin and miss tutorial when can you
looking at making our own controls now
in the past six tutorials we were
basically working on button control and
that button control was basically coded
from the ground up because we didn't
inherit from any other classes we only
inherited from the user control class
which just doesn't really have much
information on it so if you wanted to
only change that a few properties about
the button or override something then
you can just inherit in the buttons
class and then override the members be
able to edit so now that we inherited
from our bought in class or here when we
were if we were to drag this user
control onto the form we just get a fun
because it's inheriting everything from
that bought the class so let's say we
wanted to edit a few things inside of
all its button class where all we can do
is inherit from the button class and
then edit them in this class by
overriding them so if we wanted to make
it so the user cannot set the buttons
text equal to like Adam or something we
can do that we can just do an override
and then override the text property and
we can make it so if you tries to set
the text property you feel like Adam or
something we can call it that it cannot
do that and then just set property for
something different so computer tries to
set this text property equal to Adam
we're going to get a message box and
then after the message box shows the
text will be set equal to one and then
we'll just return so that it never gets
to this code if they try to study with
the Adam all right so now if we go back
to the form
let's save our changes or update them
try to set the text equal to no you're
not authorized to use that name and then
you set the factor either control one
alright and it's a few different things
you can do for example if you want it to
override an event you can do that you
can do over I and then just type like on
and that's generally where all of the
events are and as you can see right here
like on like then you can just override
this and this will just basically just
call that or that event so if you wanted
to have a message box show and then call
the event we can do that clicks have a
message box shows hello and now you
click on the button we should see hello
you know even though we don't have any
code under this button little click
because we have it right here in this
override method and since we still call
it from the base class if we were to put
code under here under this button one
click on our form then it would still
execute that so if we have a message box
and then it should show because we're
still calling the method from the base
class yep and I'll add but if you were
to delete this so it never called
anything from the base class and all you
would get is hello so now I need be
bugged button you should just get hello
yep and no other message boxes because
it never called this method because we
told it or no I never called this method
because we told it not we just deleted
that all right so that's pretty much it
for this tutorial so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
