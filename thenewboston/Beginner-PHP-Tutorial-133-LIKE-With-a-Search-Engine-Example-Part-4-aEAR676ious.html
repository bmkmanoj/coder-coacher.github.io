data as an associative array and we're
putting it inside query row
therefore inside our while statement
what we call while loop we can echo out
the specific data so we can echo out
query remember we're using an eraser
we've square brackets here now this
corresponds to the row the field name
that you want to show so I will just
want to show the name so I'm just going
to type name into here we're going to
append a line break on the end just to
keep things nice and neat and tidy and
what we can do is if it is greater than
1 we can echo up here say results found
and what we can also do is we can we can
echo out the number of results found so
where let's take this well
I'll demonstrate the the way the program
is working at the moment and then we can
make that slight modification so let's
go and refresh the page okay so I'm
going to type in Alex and click search
you can see that results found Alex
Garrett and Alex Malcolm now let's
search for Garrett and click search you
can see that we've found everyone with
the surname Gera now let's just type in
Dale click search we can see we've found
one result let's type grr again everyone
with that let's type in a and you see
we've received all results because every
result has an A in it or every record
has an A in it now we can protect
against this you could you could for
example say if the query string is
smaller than a length of four which is
what most applications do do they don't
allow you to search for data that's
under say our four characters because
you'll return too many results so let's
just go ahead and and do that so we're
if m empty search name so inside here
we're going to say if str len search
name is greater than or smaller than opa
we can say is greater than
or equal to five or four we'll say grace
the negative or then execute all this
code and let's find where the one two
closing so we'll put that there and then
we're going to indent all of this so
essentially what I've just done is I've
added in another if statement saying if
the string length of search name so
we're using the string length function
of search name is greater than or equal
to four then we can run all this code
then otherwise we echo your keyword must
be five characters or more so now if we
try to say Alex this is going to work
because it is greater than or equal to
if we would say I now and click search
your keyword must be five characters or
more so we're now coming into more of a
search engine based tutorial I guess and
there's a couple of more things we need
to address or one more thing that we
need to address and that is how many
results that are found so I'm going to
go ahead and take out this here
and I'm going to put it into a new
variable called query num rows so now
what I can do is I can substitute this
in here query num rows and we can also
echo out here query num rows dot space
and results found so this is going to
say a number and this is the same number
as well so we're using this variable
that's why I took it out and popped it
into this variable here and we're
appending on a space and the results
found so let's go ahead and type in Alex
click search
two results found this displaying two
results now let's go ahead and type in
Garret and you can see that three
results are found in this display so
this is the like condition in in PHP
like I said you can use this with
underscores to represent specific
characters so we're filling in the
blanks for specific characters and also
we can use our wildcards on the left
right hand side or on either side of our
of our value that we're trying to match
to so we've created a little program
that search for names you can use this
to search for absolutely any data you
just need to take into account why I've
said and represent the field names with
the names that you want to search with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
