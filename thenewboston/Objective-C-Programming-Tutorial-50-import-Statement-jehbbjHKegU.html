objective-c tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm going to teach you that one
last thing about the defined statement
that I didn't have time doing last
tutorial and I'm also gonna be teaching
you about the import statement but trust
me it's super easy actually here's an
import statement right here so you know
you already know little tidbit but
anyways what I wanted to talk about in
the define last tutorial is that you can
also pass in arguments to your
definition so for example if you wanted
to check if a number was even what you
would do is you would pass in an
argument such as X and then when you
make your expression you would put like
something like X modulus 2 this means X
divided what's the remainder of X
divided by 2 if it's exactly equal to 0
then you know it's even so you're saying
all right so how exactly would you use
this you would do something like if even
and then as X you would pass in
something like 15 so we know that's odd
so what this would do is it would say
Ari 15 divided by 2
exactly equal to 0 and so now you just
have to make your MS log so if it's
exactly equal to 0 just go ahead and put
like it's even but this is going to be
equal to 1 since 15 / - what's the
remainder I mean you know what I'm
talking about it's 1 so let's go ahead
and make it a simple else and I can't
even remember if I taught you guys about
if else and not but NS log it's odd
so let's go ahead and run this a couple
times and make sure it works 15
we know that one's odd and let's go
ahead and try something like 24
we know that's even so let's go ahead
and build and run that and it's even so
what this does is anytime it comes
across even with a parameter after it
such as in this case it takes this
expression right here and it substitutes
it and as that parameter X it fills it
in just like that so this is the code
that your computer sees after it's done
processing everything pretty much
replacing it for you so that's the last
thing I want to talk about in the define
and now let's move in something similar
but you know a little bit different
objective-c gave you a really easy way
to put all your defines in one location
like if we put all of them in every
program we both defined this and then I
wanted to find that it get kind of
annoying I mean it's the same defines
over and over again so what we can do is
something really easy check this out
right click source or you know Apple
click whatever it's called I sent my
mouse up to right click but add new file
and then go ahead and get the default
file and just name this something like
crap it doesn't really matter what you
name it
what we're looking for is that crap
header file crap header file anyways
get rid of well pretty much get rid of
everything make sure you're in your
header file see crap dot H get rid of
everything now the only thing you type
into your header file I mean not even
any imports or anything just write all
your definitions right in here so to
find bacon as you know 23 and define
toast
as you know 44 so now we should get what
67 when we add them together so check
this out we got a header file but the
only thing in it is defined statements
so saying our a so how the heck am I
actually supposed to put this the use of
any sorts well instead of writing all
your defined statements up here I can do
is put one import and then go ahead and
import that header file and it'll pretty
much replace this with all your defined
statements when say if you had 30 to
find statements you don't want to write
that you just want to write one simple
little syntax and this brings me to
another point you see the difference
between this import and this import
aside from the fact that this one has an
awesome name is these a little less than
and greater than signs in quotation
marks now check this out anytime you're
working in the same directory which
pretty much means the same file if you
if you're like a Windows fan they might
be called files and Mac I don't know um
you're allowed to use quotation marks so
say for example our bucky tests and main
method is in the same file as our crap
header but you see you don't see
foundation in here at all so that's why
you need to use the less than and
greater than signs but you can't go
ahead and put your header files it's
like on your desktop or anything it
automatically searches systematically
it's like a special algorithm the
special places that you can put them but
anyways just for simplicity always put
it in the same directory and you won't
mess up if you're right right click
source add new file would always appear
where you wanted to so that's pretty
much the background to that quotation
marks it's in the same file or directory
so anyways now that we imported crap h
we imported bacon and toast
but we did a lot easier now we can do
something like an x equals bacon plus
toasts just to see if it works now let's
go ahead and
NS a log it out on the screen you know
gotta make sure this baby works because
this is one fine program we got here
percent I and I forgot what it was
supposed to equal and well we'll see in
a second if we don't get in Ayers
sixty seven there was right there so
what it did is import crap H took all
your defined statements and imported
them into your main program Bucky tested
em and then what it did is it replaced
bacon with let's see 23 toast with 44
added them both together got 67 and then
print it out well you know NSLog does
just print out 67 right there so in this
tutorial what exactly do we learn we
learned that we can pass arguments into
defined statements and we actually I
didn't mean actually I might say also
learn how to import a bunch of crap
instead of typing a bunch of defined
statements oh and we also learned it in
quotation marks in these little brackets
so you know pretty informative tutorial
I pat myself on the back for that so
thank you guys for watching I guess if
you want I can go ahead and copy the
source code and post it in the link
below
yeah I'll do that right now so uh yeah
like I said if you want any source code
click on the link below thank you for
watching don't forget subscribe and I
will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
