Python tutorial and in this story I'm
going to show you guys how to work with
files now by working with files I mean
just like opening up a txt file and how
to read the information from it and also
how to write information to a basic text
file so before I get started let me show
you guys something in my harddrive I
created a folder named test and in that
folder I'd created a document called a
and this is just a blank text document
so I just wanted to show that to you
guys so because this is the file I'm
going to be working with so just so you
guys don't get confused
so let me X out of this there we go and
now let's get to the good stuff so in
order to work with a file the first
thing that we need to do is create
something called a file object and this
object is going to allow us to perform
actions on that file so I'm going to
name mine fo B for file object and once
you have a file object you need to set
it equal to the path using the open
method now the open method takes a
couple parameters the first one is um
extremely important actually they're all
extremely important but this is the path
of the directory wherever your file is
that you're going to be working with and
if you remember my nose in tests and it
was called a dot txt I named it
something short because I wanted to be
able to do this and didn't take a long
time the next parameter it takes in the
last one I'll be teaching in this
tutorial is something called the mode
now this is an empty file and we want to
be able to write text to it first of all
so I'm going to put W in here if there
was text already in there and you just
wanted to read it you would press R but
since it's empty we're going to write
something to it first so now when you
press Enter our file object was created
and now we can do stuff to that file so
the first thing we want to be able is be
able to write information into the file
so go ahead and use your file object and
remember whenever you use this or
to this file right here so it says all
right what do you want to do this text
file well we want to write to it and
write as a built-in function and write
takes um one parameter what do you want
to write to it let's just write hey now
brown cow and then when you press ENTER
it's going to write to that file now
since we're done with a file you should
always close your files when you're done
with it
so put f OB close and go ahead and press
ENTER and this closes the file now we
have the text hey now brown cow in that
file so let's go ahead and uh where is
it computer hard drive test a as you can
see that empty file now has hey now
brown cow with brown misspelled just
like we did so that is how you write
text into a file using a file object to
open it now say we already have a file
that has text in it like we just made
what happens if all we want to do is
read from that file well of course we
need to go again and create a file
object but this time we want to create
something that we can read from we can't
use F will be because this only rights
to it but we want to be able to read
from it so let's um make a file object
in once you created it again it's going
to be all new totally new objects so
let's open and this is going to look
very familiar and I don't know why I
just did that don't do that open and in
the parameters the first one is the
directory just like before test a dot
text a your next parameter instead of W
is actually R since we're going to want
to only read from it this time now once
you have your file object in case you
didn't figure out you can go ahead and
use the read function to read from your
file now the read function actually
takes parameters believe it or not in
the parameters it takes is how many
bytes do
to read and bite is the same thing as a
character whether it be a number or a
letter so let's go ahead and read the
first three characters of this file
which includes hey now brown cow
press ENTER and it says hey since it's
one two three I gave the guy's first
three bytes and this takes parameter is
because sometimes you don't want to read
an entire file if it's like huge or
something but let's say you did want to
written until your file and this is even
easier than before what you do is press
read go and function and put no
parameters at all when you don't have
anything in your parameters it means all
right read the rest of the file so go
ahead and press ENTER and it says now
brown cow and this is because because
you already read the first three bytes
so from that point it just reads the
rest of it if you all wanted to read it
from the beginning you just would put
nothing and set a three in here and it
would do that so again to recap one more
time when you want to work with the file
you first thing you create a file object
and you need to set it equal to open the
directory and what you want to do to
that file and once you have that you can
either read or write if you want to
write you use the right function and
then close and if you want to read you
use the read function with the
parameters how many bytes or leave empty
if you want to read the whole file and
of course we should close this too just
for just to be safe
so that's your quick tutorial on how to
work with files open them read them and
write textual and don't forget to close
your files at the end to prevent memory
leaks and stuff like that so that's your
quick tutorial and the next story I'm
going to showing you guys more stuff on
dealing with files and stuff and
hopefully it will clear a lot of this
stuff up so thank you guys for watching
practice opening reading and writing
files and I will see you next tutorial
