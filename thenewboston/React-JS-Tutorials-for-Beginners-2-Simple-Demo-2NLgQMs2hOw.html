this video now that we have everything
set up I want to go ahead and show you
guys a really basic example and the most
basic example I can think of is just
displaying some text on the screen so
this is going to be the dumbest react
project ever but we'll get the basics
out of the way taken care of so the way
that this is going to work is whenever
you make something in a react whenever
you make a website or an application
you're going to use react to essentially
generate some HTML now usually this is
going to be generated by you know doing
something fancy like connecting to a
database or some API like getting a list
of users and then generating everyone's
profile picture or username or something
but for now what we're going to do is
we're just going to throw some you know
like a heading one or heading two in
there and essentially whenever it
generates this HTML we need somewhere to
stick it so we're going to say alright
this is the code we're generating with
react where are we going to put it on
our website so I'm going to go ahead and
make a div and by the way if you're
using the jetbrains IDE if you just
write div or any tag name and hit tab
then it's kind of a shortcut those the
rest out for you so I'm just going to go
ahead and give this an ID of example and
all this is is it's basically a target
for later on whenever we write our react
down here it's going to generate a bunch
of HTML and we're going to say just
stick it inside example so it's pretty
much a container you know just normal
HTML so now we can actually start rate
writing our react code so I'm going to
go ahead and make a script tag now by
default this is just normal JavaScript
that's what the browser is going to see
but remember I said that we aren't going
to write plain old vanilla JavaScript
what we are going to do is we're
actually going to be rewriting something
called JSX it's a special type of
JavaScript that allows us to use HTML
syntax and it makes it really easy to
program so what we actually need to do
is we need to add an attribute right
here it's a text babel and if I say
babel sometimes that's actually because
there's a kid in my class named andy
babel
and before I learn babble um I know
that's kind of what I see in here so
again if I say Babel it's actually
babble but anyways inside here what's
going to happen is we're going to type
JSX
and since we have this script this is
actually the UM babble transpiler is
basically a translator that's going to
take anything in between here and
translate it to normal JavaScript so our
browser doesn't freak out alright guys
so for this example I'm going to show
you guys one line of code and we'll just
go ahead and run this and make sure that
everything is working properly
so from rect dumb call one method called
render now eventually whenever I talk to
you guys about components which are
essentially just part of your website
then this is really how you use the
render method but for right now I'll
explain it like this basically what
render does is it takes a bit of HTML
and it throws it into a target in other
words wherever you want to display it
now since we you really only have one
place where we can target we'll just go
ahead and use this as a target so the
first parameter again like I said is
just some HTML so this can be whatever
you know single tag that you want just
going to go ahead and make a heading one
and I'm going to go ahead and close it
and in between here I'll just write a hi
my name is button just like that
actually let me just write Bucky make
sure I'm not running out of room so this
is our HTML and right now this is
basically our react component if you
don't know what a component is don't
worry about it yet so the next parameter
and the only other one it takes is where
are we going to display this well we
need to say on this div right up here so
how do we do that well you just write
document dot get element by ID it allows
us to throw in the ID of an element
which is example
and it's going to go ahead and return a
reference to this element right here so
all we're doing is we're saying all
right take this code which is a simple
heading and throw it into this div right
there so now if i refresh this page
check it out now if I look at my source
code I don't know if you guys can see
this it might be a little bit small but
we basically have our heading one throw
in right up into here and of course we
can change this to a heading two and we
can write like bacon or whatever we want
and it's going to take whatever this
code is and it's going to stick it right
in between our target as we can see
right there so that's the very basics of
rect now again if we didn't include this
line of code right here then watch what
happens whenever you try to run this
actually let me print out my console
it's going to say whoa whoa what the
heck is this you see it's freaking out
because this is actually JavaScript this
is JSX and again it's just a lot easier
whenever we can write HTML in our
JavaScript so that's why we need to
include this to translate it to regular
JavaScript so yeah there you go I think
as for watching I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
