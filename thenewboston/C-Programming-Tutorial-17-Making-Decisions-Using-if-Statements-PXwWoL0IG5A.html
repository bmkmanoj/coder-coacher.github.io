tutorial and in this video we're going
to be making our programs a lot smarter
than they have been because I'm going to
be teaching you guys how to create a
computer program that can make a very
simple decision now the decision that
it's going to be making is we're going
to give it some code we're just going to
like print something out on the screen
and our program is going to decide
whether it wants to run it or not and if
you guys are like ok it's a computer
program it does what I tell it to do so
it has to run it right well not exactly
so let me show you guys what I'm talking
about I'll type the syntax in right now
and show you guys the basic structure of
it so what you do is you type the
keyword if and right after that type
parentheses right there now in between
those parentheses we're going to be
giving it some sort of test and we'll
just make them really simple like check
if a number is equal to another number
or like check if one number is less than
another number so these tests can be
kind of confusing but I'm just going to
show you guys some real basic ones for
this tutorial
now after that put two little curly
brackets and any code that's in between
your brackets is going to run if that
test is true so again we're going to be
putting the tester right here and the
code will just write something simple
like print something out on the screen
but this is the basic structure of how
to allow your computer and make a
decision so I'm going to go ahead and
show you guys the actual example so this
makes sense
so like said just test something really
easy like is the number four less than
the number ten well of course we know
that it is so in this case it would run
whatever code is right here like print
something out on the screen and we'll
just put like a easy us so whenever you
run this we see that it does indeed
print out
so of course what your computer did is
it said okay you want me to test this
okay is for less than ten yes it is run
this so now let me show you guys an
instance where the test would be false
and I'll talk to you guys about the
different types of tests that you can do
um well
of course right now you know that you
can do less than you can also do greater
than so let's do that
so this it says is for less than ten
this one right here this does not equal
true for is not greater than ten so any
code that goes right here like printout
meatball if we try to run this we see
that it does not print out meatball so
even though we typed this line of code
right here in our program check it out
it doesn't print it out because we gave
it a test it wasn't true and it made the
decision not to run it pretty sweet so
before I show you guys at an example of
when you would actually use this in real
life instead just print out people on
the screen I'll talk to you guys about
the different types of tests that you
can use so of course you knew less than
greater than there's also greater than
or equal to and this case would be like
if you want to test some of those like
can enter a website their age would be
like greater or equal to 18 there's also
less than or equal to in some other ones
let me go ahead and type some numbers in
here too and another one that you can do
is test if two numbers are equal to each
other
now whenever you do this you actually
use two equal signs you're like okay
well in math class I just write is X
equal to 10 or something and the reason
you don't use one equal sign in computer
programming because remember whenever
you're making variables in assigning
values to variables you're right
something like X is equal to ten and one
equal sign in c programming means assign
a value to a variable two equal signs
means test if one value is equal to
another value so again just remember
that um you'll get used to it after a
while it's very simple now the only
other test I want to talk to you guys
about right now is this not equals two
it's basically the opposite of equal to
so in this test right here whenever you
want to test is something is not equal
to five it's going to be true in every
instance except
five so this of course is basically the
opposite of equals equals to five is
indeed not equal to five that's true so
we ran this bit of code so let me go
ahead and show you guys an actual
example when you would use this and what
we can we can actually just code that
one that I just talked about we can
allow the user to enter their age
and if they're above 18 or if they're 18
then we can allow them to enter some
sort of website but you know like what
website would the user need to be above
18 to enter I don't know I can't think
of anyone but will code it anyways easy
caps lock okay so int age and then we'll
just go ahead and give them some little
prompt on the screen printf enter your
age actually I want to ask them a
question how old are you in line and of
course if we're asking them a question
we probably should give them an area to
write into and this is just going to be
a simple integer so percent D and of
course ampersand age so now we have the
users age which is some number in the
variable age so now we need to make that
basic if statement the test if their age
is above 18 simple enough so if H is
greater or equal to because remember
said they can also be 18 18 so this is
going to be true in anything like 18
1984 it's going to be false and of
course for 3 you know like a bunch of 3
year-olds use computer but anyways let's
go ahead and just print something like
prim you may enter this website
so we can go ahead and run this and
hopefully if it works how old am I
27 you may enter this website
chello now another thing that we can do
is we can also output something if they
are under 18 and that simple you can
just write if and let me give myself a
little bit of space to work with right
here so if H is less than 18 what can we
write just write wholly nothing to see
here
so run this and of course if we say
something like how old are you 86 it
still says you may enter this website
and nothing else
and if you run this again how old are
you well I'm actually only six years old
nothing to see here so pretty sweet our
programs are getting a little bit more
interactive and actually right now I
guess this is a good time to talk to you
guys about nesting if statements so
actually put that in the next tutorial
so you know I don't want to overlap
overload your guys's brain in this one
so in the next sorrow I'm going to show
you guys had nest if statements make
decisions like right after another so
it's going to be awesome thing guys for
watching I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
