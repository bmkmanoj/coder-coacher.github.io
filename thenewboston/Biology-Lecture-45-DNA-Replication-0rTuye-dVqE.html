biology video and in this video I'm
gonna be talking to you guys about the
exact process of DNA replication so at
the last video was confusing at all I
promise
this one will clear things up so let me
go ahead and draw a strand of DNA
because basically whenever DNA
replicates the first thing it does is it
unzips in forms two new strands so each
strand like I said is half the original
in half brand-new so let me go ahead and
we'll draw the original strand like this
so the yellow one remember will be the
original so there we go
and we'll draw the new strains in I
don't know let's just say blue so here's
blue and we'll draw this blue like this
alright so basically like I said the
yellow is the original DNA and I might
as well draw rungs in it so the green
rungs technically called nucleotides
remember there are two nucleotides
they're wrong and that was one when I
was talking about the base pairing or
nucleotide pairing so that's what the
green things will be this diagram is
actually one of my better diagrams and
yeah that's not saying much bye anyways
several different enzymes help DNA
polymerase work basically several
different enzymes are responsible in
this process and that it isn't just one
enzyme that does it all so the first
enzyme I want to talk to you guys about
is helicase so in order for this DNA
this original strand right here to
actually unzip you use an enzyme called
let me go ahead and color code this
helicase now this is the pretty much the
enzyme that gets things started so of
course as you can see by the location of
where I drew this
this enzyme pretty much separates or
unzips the original strand now the other
well I don't want to say the next enzyme
because all these processes are going on
simultaneously but the next enzyme I
want to talk about is called prime ace
now prime ace puts down these things
called primers now primers are short
pieces of RNA complimentary to the
original DNA so let me go ahead and draw
a primer in all red I guess so an
important thing to note is that these
primers they aren't they're basically
temporary so I'll go ahead and draw
these dotted so this thing right here
would be a primer might as well label
that and remember that these are
temporary right here now the enzyme I
was talking about is I'm running out of
different colors here it's called prime
ace so basically what Prime ace would do
and this is actually one of the easier
ones to remember is that the enzyme
primates puts down these primers easy to
remember in primers remember like I said
are short pieces of RNA complimentary to
the original DNA so they get paired up
according to what the original
nucleotides work and another thing
remember one last time that these
primers are just temporary now why are
they temporary and why aren't they you
know you know like everlasting well
that's when the next enzyme called DNA
polymerase one comes in so what color am
I gonna draw this let's draw in this
blue looking one so this would be
the enzyme DNA polymerase and this is
technically called DNA polymerase 1 and
there are different ones DNA polymerase
3 is the other important one but I'm
just going to call this D and a
polymerase and that's what this one is
and what this does is it removes the
primers so right now on this strand we
have these primers these pink primers
they primarily pink in your body but
with these primers are just temporary
placeholders just think of them so with
this DNA polymerase is going to do is
it's going to remove these temporary
primers and replace them with actual DNA
and this is the DNA that's pretty much
permanent it's going to stay on your DNA
molecule forever until it replicates
again now the last molecule I want to
talk to you guys about is haven't used
purple yet DNA ligase so d and a ligase
so this enzyme would basically be I
don't know maybe right here now what
this enzyme does and this is the last
main enzyme I on I want to talk about
for this tutorial is it forms covalent
bonds on the backbone of DNA and the
reason does this is it needs to seal up
the strands or it needs to seal up the
breaks I guess you could call it by
starting and stopping new strains so
basically whenever you have a strand
that stops and it needs to be put back
together obviously that's when you call
DNA ligase to take care of that so again
as you can see different enzymes or
different molecules are responsible kind
of they work as a team in order to
replicate DNA in your major ones that
get things started
is helicase and what this does is it
basically unzips the original strand and
the place that this unzips is actually
called the replication fork and it's the
part where the original strand
splits so that's another one
replication fork that might be on you
you know biology test or whatever so
don't forget that
now prime ace is an enzyme that puts
down temporary primer easy to remember
now another one is DNA polymerase what
this enzyme is going to do is basically
gonna remove the primer and replace it
with permanent DNA and this is
technically called DNA polymerase one if
we you know want to get technical and
the last enzyme
is DNA ligase what this does is it
whenever you have a break in your DNA
and we'll talk about why you have breaks
later on but you're gonna have some
breaks and they need to be bonded
together again because you know you
don't want your DNA to unravel and just
split apart so what DNA ligase does is
it actually forms covalent bonds to fix
the breaks in the backbone of DNA so
these are your enzymes again we can
already see that cell division is a very
complex process using a bunch of
different enzymes but I promise guys it
gets easier later on so there is your
basic of DNA replication in the next
video there are just some other few
things I want to touch on real quick and
then we're going to be moving on to the
rest of the cell division so thing guys
for watching don't forget to follow me
on Facebook Twitter Google+ and uh
anyways I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
