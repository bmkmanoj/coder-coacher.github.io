43rd tutorial in the UDK and in this
tutorial we're going to be finally
jumping into kismet and piecing all
these pieces together or should I have
said putting all these pieces together
well either way that's where we're going
to be doing so actually i'm done with
the side view from view and top view so
let's go ahead and expand their
perspective view since that's the only
one I really care about right now so now
what I did in between this is oral and
the last story is rebuilding my lighting
so let me go ahead and demo this level
by hitting play from here and I'll show
you guys what effect we're going to go
for so basically we have this trigger in
the middle of our map and whenever we
bump into it we want this light to
flicker on and off but check it out I'm
bumping into it right now and this light
isn't turning on and off and that's
because we didn't set this up in kismet
yet so let's go ahead and head escape
and do that right now so again how you
get to kismet as you go ahead and click
this open unreal kismet bond right here
and now this is kismet right here but
what I want to do is throw this on the
right hand side of my screen and throw
my perspective view on the left hand
side of my screen and I think that's
going to be really easy to work with so
I guess what i can do is i can build
this quick example and teach you guys or
excuse me talk you guys through what I'm
doing however it might be easier if you
just kind of watch me do it and then
when everything's put together at the
end you're going to be able to see the
whole picture and probably give you a
better idea of what's going on so if you
guys don't exactly understand what I'm
talking about as I'm putting these
pieces together don't worry by the end
of this video you'll be a pro or I wants
a pro kids met but you'll be hmm not a
pro but you'll be a novice at kismet I
can i guaranteed novice so the first
thing that you want to do is you're
going to want to go ahead and in your
perspective view select this trigger now
when you have the trigger selected in
kismet go ahead and right-click
hit new event using trigger and we're
wanting to select touch now let me go
ahead and explain you guys what an event
is actually let me go ahead and explain
this how kids Matt works is this you add
a bunch of these things in this case we
added an event and these things are just
called objects so the three main things
that we're going to be adding in this
tutorial is the event an action and
variable an event is something that your
user or your player can do it's
something that happens in your game in
this case it's going to be the user
touching a trigger so everything starts
with an event in real life maybe event
would be jumping off a building and then
the result of that is called an action
so an action is basically a result of an
event so in the UDK the event is going
to be touching this trigger and the
action is going to be turning the light
on and off in real life an event would
be jumping off a building and the action
would be breaking your neck so basically
you need to start everything with an
event and then that causes an action to
happen so let's go ahead and now that we
have our event set up again basically
this is our event right here and this is
the trigger that we can flip on up let's
go ahead and create in action so in
order to create in action go ahead and
right-click and kismet hit new action
and then we're going to want to go ahead
and toggle a light on and off as the
result of this event so go ahead and hit
toggle and toggle so check it out check
out what's going on right now we want to
connect this touch event to a turn on
toggle so basically whenever our trigger
is touched which is this light switch
right here we're going to want to toggle
something on enough but it just doesn't
know that we want to toggle this light
on and off because check this out if we
made a huge level and we have like a
thousand lights how would it know what
light we wanted a toggle on off well in
order to associate this toggle action
with light it needs an additional
piece of information and that
information is the fact that we're going
to be working with this lady right here
so in order to tell the udk in kismet
that delight that we want to toggle is
this light go ahead and select that
light and now go ahead and back in
kismet right click somewhere in and now
with once you right click go ahead and
select new object variable point light
toggle bolt again if you don't see that
as an option make sure you have the
light selected in your perspective view
and by the way before I forget to
mention this moving around all these
objects is the exact same as in the
material editor again if you select it
and hold ctrl you can move it around if
you want to delete one of these arrows
just go ahead and hold alt and click on
it and if you want to select multiple
things just hold go ahead and hold ctrl
and alt and then you can select multiple
things and move them around so again
exact same as working in the material
editor so now what I want to do is for
the event I want to say all right
whenever you touch the trigger then
toggle something on and so this is the
event right here and this is the result
a cave action and now it says alright
I'm going to toggle something on but
what the heck am I supposed to toggle on
if you have like 50 different lights or
laser beams or you know guns that you
want to talk going on whatever the heck
that means what am I supposed to toggle
on so the target is basically where we
tell it what to toggle on and in that
case that's this variable the light
switch right there so again let me go
ahead and demo this first of all so I
can prove to you guys that this is
indeed working and I'm not just you know
talking crap here so I'm going to hit
play from here and keep your eyes on the
static mesh right here see it's them
right now keep looking at it keep
looking at it whenever i bump into this
trigger now it now switches on so again
if I go up to kismet right here this is
the event that happens the initial event
is something that our user can do in
this case the user can touch a light
switch or a trigger
as it's technically called now the
action is a result of what happens
whenever that event occurs now in this
case the action is something's getting
toggled on and off and the target is
basically what target do you want to
talk on and off and in that case we just
use that toggle light so hopefully you
guys understand the basics of kismet
again I just want to get a couple you
know definitions out of the way a couple
terminology and show you guys the basic
interface but trust me we are nowhere
near covering what everything we need to
cover in a kismet for example check it
out whenever we hit play from here whoa
hello let me go ahead and hit play from
here and check it out this light switch
turns on but step away from it and it
stays on so how the heck are we supposed
to turn that off well that's one example
of what we can cover in the upcoming
tutorials so for now that's all you guys
get hopefully you got a little better
feeling hopefully you guys are a little
more comfortable with kismet but in up
come Torrio's i'm going to show you guys
some awesome sequences some awesome
things you can do with kismet to make
your game a whole lot more fun and
interactive so thank you guys for
watching this tutorial thank you guys
for subscribing and supporting my
channel and if you have any questions
check out the new boston calm / forum
i'll answer for you then so thank you
guys for watching and I'll see you guys
