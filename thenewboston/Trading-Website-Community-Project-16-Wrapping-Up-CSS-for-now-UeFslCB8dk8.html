tutorial for now at least and in this
tutorial I want to explain you guys a
few things if you go ahead and take a
look at the default website you see that
there's a little area to the left with
all the links and then you have your big
main area go ahead and search for
something you're going to have your
links to your left and then you have
your big main area to 2780 however if
you go on the login page or the register
page you see that things are laid out a
little bit differently I laid this out
pretty pretty much I split it in half
500 pixels on the Left 500 pixels on the
right so therefore just on the register
page since the main area the main focus
is really on the form and not the side
links I wanted to go ahead and lay this
out a little bit differently and why am
I telling you this because we need to
code one last CSS file that's specific
to this register page now the good thing
is this is only going to take a few
minutes I just need to overwrite a few
features so let's go ahead and make a
new file and I want to go ahead and save
this as CSS register CSS whenever I make
a CSS file that I'm only going to use on
one page I like the name it the exact
same thing is that page that way I can
easily identify what CSS file is
specific to that page rather than forums
which is of course for all the forms
across all the pages or main which is to
my main website so again this is
registered CSS go ahead and save that
now as you can see in my PHP file I have
two main sections here one is the left
side and one is the right side so let's
go ahead and work with those sections
right now so the left side pretty much
the only thing I need to do is I need to
say okay this is going to be on the left
and it's going to be 500 pixels so what
I want to do is I want to give this a
width of 4 90 in you'll see why in just
a sec for 90 and I want to add hello no
one could type today margin top of 10
pixels and this is of course just to
give it that
little bit of padding from the top so
it's not pressed directly up against the
search bar and I want to give a margin
right of 10 pixels as well now the
reason I do this is because first you
have to code it correctly this left-hand
side is pretty much going to be where
this picture is now if I didn't give it
any margin at all say we decided to
change this picture right here so it had
a solid background we don't want it
directly but it up against this or else
it'll look kind of weird so you want to
give it a little bit of padding so of
course with the margin right of 10 in
the width of 4 90 that gives us our 500
and the last thing we need to do is
float it to the left just so it's butted
up against the left now after this
remember our entire website was a
thousand pixels wide we already use 500
pixels right here so for our form we
have 500 pixels to work with so let's go
ahead and code this baby right now right
side now for this right side a margin
top of 10 pixels of course just go ahead
and copy that shizz right there it also
is going to float left even though it's
on the right hand side we want to but it
up against the left and for the width if
you guys can guess it's 500 pixels now
the reason we can just use 500 pixels is
it's already spaced apart from this left
side because this left side has a margin
rate of 10 pixels so I can just go ahead
and take up the rest of that it doesn't
need a margin right because there's
nothing to the right of that now the
last thing that we need to do is let me
go ahead and open up forms that CSS even
though we aren't going to be coding it
again as you can see the container was
basically the amount of padding I mean
excuse me the width of the form plus the
padding so right now we had 780 to work
with so 7 40 plus 20 on both sides gave
us that 780 however this form is a
little bit smaller we only have 500 to
work with so let's go ahead and over ate
some of these features container is
going to have a width
460 pixels now I think I ought to
explain a few things before i continue
on first of all you're saying okay how
can you have two things name exactly the
same thing well not only in a HTML or
css but in computer programming in
general it reads your program from top
to bottom so the bottom most thing is
the last thing the most recent thing it
reads so basically it's going to take
all the settings from this then it's
going to take all the settings from this
and then it's going to take all the
settings from register CSS if you over
wrote anything in register CSS that was
inside forms that CSS it's going to use
the settings from registered CSS so
basically if we say okay first we want
to set our container to 740 pixels but
then later on we change your mind and
want to change it to four hundred and
sixty pixels it's going to take the
latest most instruction and go that now
remember our total width of the form is
500 pixels but we didn't overwrite the
padding of 20 pixels so when we have our
new width of 4 60 we still have our
padding of 20 on each side which is for
8500 and that's going to give us our new
and improved form perfectly fit for our
register page I know that was a lot to
take in but trust me it makes sense it's
so easy to work with forms when you have
some general guidelines then you can
just overwrite whatever the heck you
want to over right now to other things
that we need to look at real quick is
the input section and also the hints now
the input section is how wide we want
those input areas to be pretty much the
area that the user types in two by
default they were 500 that's no good
that means they're going to be the total
width of the form so let's go ahead and
change that right now the new input
width is going to be 360 pixels which is
going to look beautiful and the last
thing is this field hover hint if I
could find it right here now remember
the hint was basically the little box
that popped up and gave you a hint of
pretty much what data you're allowed to
enter my default it
shifted 650 pixels whenever we're
working with that big form however we're
working with a pretty much shrunken down
version of the form right now so we need
to change the positioning of that hint
so let me just go ahead and copy this
field hover hint we're pretty much
saying we want to overwrite the hint
right now so instead of a margin of 650
pixels which would put it way outside
the form we want to change this to 450
pixels now all that's going to do is
it's going to move the hint it's pretty
much going to make it fit in our mini
form so now let's go ahead and save that
and check it out our registered at CSS
page is perfect basically remember all
we did is we over wrote some settings we
pretty much changed our layout different
from the default and we change some
settings in our forum because the
original form was for a big form and
these are the settings that we need for
a smaller form pretty much a smaller
width and smaller input boxes and the
hint has to be closer to the input boxes
so there you go we are finally done
working with CSS at least for now at
least until we go to another page and
the good thing is whenever we do code
other pages the majority of the CSS is
taken care of so anyways I'm going to
shut up I'll give you guys a break so
thank you guys for watching and finally
in the next sauriol we get to start with
the good stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
