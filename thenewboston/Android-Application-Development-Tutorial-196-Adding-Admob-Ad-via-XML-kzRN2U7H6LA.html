tutorial for the new Bossin believe it's
hundred ninety six anyways we're gonna
do is we're gonna set up basically the
reference to the jar we just added
because again we did add a jar to our
project but we still need to make that
reference within the manifest so what
we're gonna do is we're gonna go within
our application bracket of the manifest
and we need to make that reference again
to the jar that we added so how we do
that is just pretty simple we're gonna
create an activity so nothing new there
give us some space to work with and we
need to refer to for the activity name
to be basically in add activity so we're
gonna say Android Android name equals
and then this has to be verbatim this
has to be the exact same so we're gonna
say comm google dot dot add activity so
make sure your spelling is correct and
all that good stuff otherwise nothing's
gonna you know our ads aren't gonna be
working so we need to have this as a
reference name or Android name you also
want to set up the Android config to be
Android config changes and we're just
gonna set this equal to be keyboard and
then we need to put one of those
straight oops
spell keyboard wrong and we want to put
one of those straight lines not exactly
sure what this you know this thing's
called it's not an L but it's like you
know shift and then the button right
above your return or Enter key
I just want those straight up and down
lines and uh then we're just gonna say
keyboard hidden and again we're gonna
put one of those straight lines and
we're just gonna say orientation and now
we have basically the reference set up
to our jar that we just added so I'm
just gonna say ctrl save make sure I'm
getting any airs again just for Android
name we need to have it con Google Ads
dot add activity and for config
changes again keyboard keyboard hidden
and orientation so there we go we
basically just set up the reference
within our manifest and now let's
actually get into setting up an ad
within XML so we're just going to go
into our layouts here and pick one of
our layouts let's go with let's go with
our main XML this is our first little
activity that we created and we're just
gonna add and add within this linear
layout so to do that what we need to do
is again reference make a reference or a
connection within our first bracket so
like if you guys have a linear layout or
a relative layout we basically need to
make a connection so we can use some
methods that's all this is doing I think
I've might have explained that but
that's just allowing us to use some of
these Android you know colon layout our
orientation and all that good stuff
so that's why we need to have a
reference like this but we're also gonna
have another reference for our ad so
what we're gonna do is we're gonna say
XML NS ads equals and then we have to
put in HTTP colon forward slash forward
slash s CH e ma s android.com forward
slash a PK for /li b forward slash comm
dot Google dot ads so I know it's kind
of long but you guys wanna make sure
again you're spelling is correct on this
everything's good and again this will
just allow us to add like ads within XML
and all that good stuff so get an HTTP a
forward slash forward slash or just
pause the video and make sure you know
you guys have this for Batum and then
what we're gonna do is we're just gonna
add an ad below our second button again
this is our layout here we're just gonna
put an ad like somewhere here so let's
go down into our code go below our
second button and we're just going to
add an ad just like we add everything
else just greater than sign and then
we're just gonna say we're gonna say
comm dot Google
dot ads dot ad view like that and we can
set up an NID so we're just a Android ID
equals at plus ID /add you know if you
guys want to set up an ID pretty much
the same way as you guys are familiar
with we're also gonna set up a layout
width and layout height so you can just
set that equal to beer at content and
maybe Android height that height to be
wrap content too as well getting nothing
new pretty pretty easy huh and what's
really important is the add references
because again this is coming from that
first reference or that first xmlns that
we've already had so we can use these
Android references but now we're going
to use the add references so we're gonna
say ads and then ad unit ID so make sure
that spoke correctly and we're gonna get
to this in the next tutorial so I'm just
gonna say next tutorial so we're gonna
have to change that to make the
connection you know with our specific ID
so we can you know so we can get paid
and they can keep track of the user all
that good stuff
what we're going to do is we're going to
say this is this ad is going to load
when the oncreate method gets called of
this activity
whichever activity has this layout so
we're gonna say load add on create we're
gonna set this equal to be true and we
just closed off our statement with a
forward slash a lesson sign so that's
how we kind of add and add within our
application and you can kind of see the
layout here of what it looks like and oh
yeah we forgot the ad size but we'll
probably get into that in the next
tutorial so make sure you watch the next
tutorial because it's gonna be pretty
important because obviously we're
missing something already but I'll catch
you guys then and
hope you ever get one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
