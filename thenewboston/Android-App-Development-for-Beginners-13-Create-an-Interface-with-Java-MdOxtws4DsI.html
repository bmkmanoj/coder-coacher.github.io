video tutorial never know what to say do
I call it a tutorial or video who knows
but welcome back and in this video what
I'm going to do is I'm going to show you
guys how to make a user interface
entirely in Java now if you didn't watch
my last video I gave a quick explanation
right at the end but basically whenever
you use that designer it's really good
for making static or just user
interfaces that don't change a lot well
whenever you have something like a game
or any interface where things are moving
around it's useful to create your
objects in Java so I'm going to show you
guys how to do that so close out of any
project you have hit file close and then
you can start a new one I'm just going
to name this like a slim it Allisyn
because I have a crush on this girl
named Alison let me Center this and all
this stuff looks good you can actually
name it anything you want
and of course we're making it for the
phone and choose blank activity right
here and hit next now this is alright so
pretty much just give it a name and keep
all the defaults now once everything is
done setting up what you can do is you
can actually hop right over to your Java
file and actually we aren't going to be
using this XML file at all so again like
I said let me expand this a little bit
so the first thing that your app is
essentially going to do is it's going to
look at this class right here and it's
going to say ok what layout do you want
to use and right now in this line right
here the content view pretty much tells
your app this is the layout this is the
user interface and right now it's
pointing to activity main which is this
we know all that already so what I'm
going to do is I'm just going to go
ahead and delete that and actually want
to show my line numbers so it's on line
14 so delete that so now we have this
class but it has no interface whatsoever
the user has nothing to look at
so actually I do want to hop over in
this XML file because even though we
aren't going to be using it I do want to
show you guys how we need to set up our
interface so this is our main device we
can't really do anything with the screen
now all right let me just myself cuz get
ready to explain alright so the very
first thing we need for user interface
is a layout now a layout is just your
general rules telling how everything how
all of your widgets are supposed to be
positioned and aligned and everything
now once we have a layout we can start
adding widgets to it alright so first
let's go ahead and make a layout and
then add some widgets to it now in order
to actually use these classes we need to
import something so import Android dot
widget is the first one and again the
first thing is relative layout and there
are different types of layouts for
example we're going to be using a
relative that's what we're used to
working with so far but they also have
arm table layouts grid layouts again
relative layout is kind of hard to
understand at first because whenever
you're laying out your widgets they're
all going to be positioned relative to
something else so for example the first
example we'll do will say make a button
and position it relative to the middle
of your screen so it's kind of hard to
explain it's a lot easier to visualize a
table or a grid but once you start
coding um you'll see what relative
really means pretty much position
whatever you have relative to something
else so the next thing we need to do is
import Android widget dot button so
again in this really simple example I'm
just going to have a layout and then I'm
going to put a button in middle the
screen so now that you have both of
those imported we tighten this up so you
guys can see it a bit what we want to do
is we want to stick all of the code to
create the layout inside the oncreate
method so remember that code that we
deleted
was right in here and remember whenever
your activity first gets called first
gets created this is the very first
thing it does so it's always a good idea
to make your layout inside this method
so hop right under this statement right
here and actually let me give myself
some space now the first thing I wanted
to do is just make a relative layout
object so relative layout that's what we
just imported and I'm just going to name
my layout you can name anything you want
I'm just going to name my Bucky's oh
yeah I think that's good my Bucky's
layout that'll be easy to remember and
what you do is you set this equal to new
relative layout this so now we have a
layout essentially what we did is we
created this right here but now it has a
cool name and we can do some cool stuff
to it so after this I'm going to create
a widget and I'm just going to create a
button so button I will make this a red
button so red button again you can name
yours anything you want and move new
button this so now we have a layout and
a button but that's it we created them
and they're in memory but we didn't do
anything to it we didn't even tell it to
actually display these things on the
screen yet so the first thing that we
want to do is we actually want to add a
widget or pretty much add this button to
the layout because right now like I said
these are two separate things and that's
it so in order to do that take your
layout and anytime you want to add a
widget to it the method is called add
view now it's called add view instead of
add widget because all of these things
they inherit from the view cat the view
class that's why you see sometimes like
plain text view an image view all the
widgets are also views so add view just
think of it like add widget to your
layout so what would you want to add
well we only have one so far
red button now after this again what we
did is we created a layout and we
created a button and then we took that
button and we added it to the view or
excuse me well technically we did but we
added it to the layout now all we have
to say is okay now take that layout and
actually use it for this activity's main
user interface or main display so
anytime you want to do that you actually
call a method called set content view
and all this is saying is okay what do
you want this activity's main interface
to be well obviously we only have one
thing we can stick in there layout so
it's going to make this the main screen
and of course since we added a button to
it that button is also going to display
so now I actually probably should have
started my emulator before but I'm going
to start up my emulator and run this bad
boy all right so there you have it I
know this is kind of hard to look at
right now because the background is kind
of light gray and the button is kind of
like normal gray so in the next story
what we're going to do is we're going to
actually add some properties to this to
give it some color and add some text of
the button as well and also what I did
is I added some comments in the source
code Y while my emulator was starting
and another thing that I want to mention
is if you guys want any of the source
code either from this tutorial or in the
future tutorials at the end of every
tutorial I copy all of this and post it
in my forum so if you just wanna I don't
know like sit back and watch this
tutorial some people like coding along
some people like watching the tutorials
and then just using the source code you
can do that as well but anyways all of
this is going to be in my forum for you
guys so I think guys for watching don't
forget to subscribe and in the next
video we're going to be making this look
a lot better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
