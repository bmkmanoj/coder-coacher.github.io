video and in this video hopefully we're
going to be doing is finishing up this
very simple web browser so again in the
last tutorial we just made the main
brains of the display now let's go ahead
and add it to the screen so right
outside this little semi colon go ahead
and hit add new scroll pane and just go
ahead and the stick display in there now
where we're going to put this Center
we'll just go ahead and put this in the
center of the screen so now we just need
to do two more simple things set the
size of it and the size of this what can
show up nicely in this video on YouTube
500 by 300 probably look pretty good and
set visible equal to true because we
don't want to make a program and make it
invisible because that would be a
complete waste of time
so now our GUI and actually our
constructor itself is completely taken
care of pretty cool huh
so the only other thing we have to do is
fix this error which pretty much says
okay you keep calling this load of crap
method and I don't have any built-in
method called load crap only you would
make something like that bulky so go
ahead and make that method right now so
again like I've been saying for the last
I don't know how many two tutorials
load crap is basically the method that
reads an HTML file or whatever URL
you're pointing to and it displays it on
the screen so let me add a comment load
crap to display on the screen now we'll
just go ahead and make this a private
because we're not going to be using it
in any class void load crap and you got
to say long like that crap okay so this
obviously gets pissed in a string and
the string is which is called user text
because that's the information that the
user typed in you know unless they click
on the hyperlink but anyways it gets
passed in a string called user text and
the
your text is basically the URL which
website do you want to go to so what we
need to do now is we actually need to
build a try-catch statement so let me go
ahead and make the frame for that
try-catch and for catch exception e and
I'll just put the simple
system.out.print line not very formal
here but I'll just put something like
crab now the reason that you put a
try-catch statement is is we don't want
to program the crash obviously whenever
they type in you know a malformed URL so
if they type in a proper URL like HTTP
colon backslash backslash Google com
then the program is going to run and
this code right here is going to execute
but if they type in something like I
don't know um HT ZZ backslash doggles
com that obviously is in a valid URL and
this you know our program isn't going to
crash it's just going to say crap on our
little display window on the bottom so
what do we want to try hopefully this is
the code that gets executed well the
first thing we want to do is we want the
web page that they go to to display in
the main window
so display set page and hopefully the
yep set page now as you can see if I
roll over this documentation it says you
guys can't see it but I'll read the
documentation to you guys it says sets
the current URL being displayed so
basically the cool thing about Java is
it already made this method this is
probably the most powerful method that's
built in Java for at least this tutorial
it takes whatever URL we pass it in as a
string and it displays it in the display
window so set page we just need to pass
in user text copy this paste it in so
say we um I don't know type in the New
Boston comm in the URL what this is
going to do is it's going to set it's
going to read the file from the New
Boston comm and it's going to put it in
the display window so all of that
confusing stuff that you guys thought we
were probably going to have to program
by hand line by line it's all taken care
of in the set page method pretty freakin
sweet so the only other thing I want to
do is of course whenever you go to a
webpage like the New Boston comm if you
look at the top of your I like how I'm
like you know keep throwing that in
there I don't even mean to do that
oh you know like the New Boston calm
like who would ever want to go to that
plug plug anyways whenever you go to a
website the web address or the URL stays
in the address bar at the top it doesn't
get deleted every time so in order to
keep that just go ahead and put address
bar set text equal to a string in that
string is user text as well so basically
well let me look about this okay that
looks pretty much like our program is
complete now the only other thing we
have to do is of course this doesn't
have a main method so we have to build
one more other class for that in a I
guess we'll do that well we'll do it in
this tutorial so let me go ahead and
talk you guys through this one last time
and then I will go ahead and I'll build
my main method so we inherited I mean
excuse me we imported everything and we
inherited from the jframe class so we
can just make the GUI now the GUI
consists of two main things our address
bar at the top in the editor pane which
is gonna you know is going to be the
main big display where all the contents
are going to be displayed now in the
constructor what we did is we named the
application just so it has a title at
the top and the address bar pretty much
is the place where the user types in the
URL now whenever they hit enter what
it's going to do is call this a load
crap method which we'll get to in a
second now whenever things get displayed
on the screen if there are any links
what it's going to do is it's going to
put a listener on top of all those links
now if the user clicks on one of those
links then what it's going to do is it's
going to grab the URL from that link
convert it to a string and pass it into
this load crap method as well so
basically you can pass URLs into this
load crap method in a bunch of different
ways either by clicking a link or typing
anything manually by anyways once you do
it gets passed in
and then pretty much Java takes that
string and passes in to set page which
you know takes that URL and displays it
on the screen so this is pretty much the
most important line in your browser
without this it's definitely definitely
not going to work so now what we need to
do is actually go ahead and make a class
that can run this so let me go ahead and
make a new class so new class and what
do we name this one read file so I'll
just put like read file why can't I
capitalize the freaking F file main and
I might as well go ahead and add my main
method in there okay now you're just
messing up and go ahead and hit finish
get rid of all this crap and get rid of
all this crap to time this up a little
bit that's what she said all right so
now the only import we have to make
right here is actually I'm going to go
ahead and steal it
swing jframe and this doesn't inherit
anything so what we need to do is just
make an object from read file so we can
and I'll just name it something like
read file dude because it's like dude
read my file
so read file do it equals new read file
so now we can use all the crap in the
read file class so dude not did dude set
default close operation to J okay my
freaking computer is going crazy - J
frame exit on closed all right so now
this class is setup and again if you
don't know what's going on right here
basically I just needed to access this
class right here because it didn't have
a main method in it so what this class
does is it accesses the main method now
once I press this Run button we should
be good to go
but you know what obviously I am a
douchebag and I'm going to make you guys
wait into the next video because I
actually want to put this fullscreen and
show you guys how awesome this browser
is going to be so anyways thank you guys
for watching and we're gonna subscribe
and I'll see you guys in next video
we're going to be testing out this bad
