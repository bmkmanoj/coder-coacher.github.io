juicy tutorial and in this tutorial
we're going to be editing the program we
built last time now in the last tutorial
we built a program that displayed how
young of a girl you can date using a
nice little formula but we all know the
more money you have the younger the
girls get so we're gonna incorporate
this into our method so let's go ahead
and in your interface right here what
we're gonna do is aside from our age we
also want to factor in our income so in
order to add another argument to our
method what we need to do is not only
pass in a value for age but go ahead and
put a colon and go ahead and put int and
you also want to pass it another
variable now a is going to symbolize age
and I is gonna symbolize income so right
now our header is in a and I so let's go
ahead and copy this and paste it right
in for our method header right here
paste so now it has the variable a which
is your age and it also has this income
to work with so before our formula for
figuring out how young of chicks you
could date was your age divided by two
plus seven so if I was 20 I would be 20
divided by 2 which is 10 plus 7 which is
17 but let's go ahead and add
parentheses around that and let's factor
in your income now let's go ahead and
the more income you have the younger
girls get so we're gonna factor in minus
your income divided by let's say 100,000
so for example every hundred thousand
you make you can take a year off the age
so this is what it does if I make a
hundred thousand it would be a hundred
thousand divided by a hundred thousand
which is one it would lower my age by
one if I made a million dollars it was
say a million divided by a hundred
thousand which is ten so take ten years
off the age not bad so now let's go
ahead and run this program so oh oh yeah
the tutorial so as you can see instead
of just passing it in an age you also
pass the in an income and now you can
use two variables when making your
calculation and this isn't only with two
you can do with three four five or six
so anyways in our main program say 45 um
that used to be a 45 29 year old chicks
they could date but what if they had an
income of 300,000 and again I didn't I
mean not again I didn't even teach you
guys this in order to pass multiple
arguments when you're calling your
method go ahead and separate it with a
colon and pass it in so go ahead
build and run this and see what we get
now that they make three hundred
thousand dollars they can now date
chicks 26 years old
mmm not bad so let's go ahead and say
you were 65 and usually this would be
something like 65 divided by 2 is like
32 and a half plus 7 so they might be
able to date 40 year old chicks but what
if they made three million dollars a
year let's go ahead and build and run
this and save it and now this 65
year-old who makes three million dollars
a year you can now date chicks nine
years old people I'm sorry it's just the
way it is I don't make the rules he can
date nine year old girls if you want to
I mean come on three million dollars a
year
let them do some nine year old chicks so
anyways the meat of the program anytime
you want to pass multiple arguments into
a method when in your declaration which
is in your interface you have the method
name and then you have each argument
outlined separated by colons in this
case it was in a for age in I for income
and now in your
implementation what you need to do is
use your method header which is your
declaration and just use those variables
any way you want it we put those into a
formula to calculate how old of chicks
we can date and last but not least
anytime you want to pass more than one
argument into a method you put the
methods name and then put argument one
separated by colon argument to an F add
more than two you just have to separate
them with a colon and add more and more
depending on how many hat but that's the
basics of how to make a cool chick
dating program and also how to use
multiple arguments and methods so thank
you guys for watching don't forget to
