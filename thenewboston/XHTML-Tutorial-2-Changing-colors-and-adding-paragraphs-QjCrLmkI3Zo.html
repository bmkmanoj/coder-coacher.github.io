second tutorial on XHTML today we're
gonna be learning about colors we're
gonna be learning how to add background
color to our website and also change the
text color of our website so in the last
tutorial as you can see we added a title
and some ba text to our website our
title we called it my title and we
displayed it right up here and in the
body we added some text wrote this is my
body and as you can see this website is
kind of plain right now so let's say you
wanted to add some colors and make it
look a little better so you might be
thinking alright any information for my
head goes in between my head tags any
information for my body goes in between
my body tags so we're exactly what I be
adding the colors and to do this you
need to add something called an
attribute and all attributes go in the
beginning tag of whatever you're
changing nothing ever goes in the end
tag so since we want to change the
background color for the entire body
right now we want to add it to the
opening body tag and to do this you
click between the Y and the end bracket
for the body type of space
and the attributes name for background
color is B G color and there's the
background color and that's the name BG
color but now we have to have something
to change it to and say we wanted to
make it red so we put equals in
quotation marks we put red and quotation
and now as you can see our attribute is
background color that's what we want to
change and we want to change it to red
this is the value of it and I want it to
apply to the whole body the whole entire
body so that's why we put it in the
beginning body tag so now as you can see
body tag space BG color equals red and
quotation marks
now our background color for the body
should be red so let's take a look at
that and as you can see the background
color is now red now let's say we wanted
to change the text color of the body
well that's easy the attribute for text
color is text and say we wanted to
change it to white so we put equals and
put white in quotation marks remember
all of this is going going in the
opening tag of the body and it applies
to the entire body
you never type anything in the end tag
so the format to add attributes is named
one attribute equals and name what value
what you want to change it to in
quotation marks so now if we take a look
we should have the background color red
and the text color white
so let's take a look at that and as you
can see our text color is now white so
the next thing we want to do is add a
heading to our website and a heading is
just pretty much like a title of the
paragraphs you just add it wherever you
want actually just to make things stand
out and it's easier just to show you so
the tech for heading is H and then
whatever number one to six one being the
biggest six being the smallest so let's
type heading one and then close it by
typing that backslash h1 and now we have
heading number one this is the biggest
heading so let's go save that and see
what it look like as you can see this is
bigger than their regular text because
you put headings to make things stand
out like I said like a title and they
vary from sizes one to six and let me
show you real quick what tell you what
size is three
and sighs this sick look six looks like
so this will be heading number three and
I'll put heading number six below it
and I'm gonna go ahead and save this and
launch it and as you can see one's going
to be the biggest three is gonna be
average-sized and six is gonna be the
smallest and you can add these in order
like some people add them at the
beginning and paragraph some people add
them above images you can just add them
anytime you feel like it it's up to you
so let's go ahead and get rid of those
and say you had a paragraph that you
wanted to add it to so I'm gonna explain
to you how to make your first paragraph
tag to begin a paragraph as simple it's
just P so let's go ahead and put our
bracket P close it off and type this is
a paragraph
now let me just copy that
and then paste it a few times to
symbolize paragraph text and to end it
you would type bracket backslash P so
this is our paragraph and this is where
ends and anything in between it is going
to show up as a paragraph so now we
should have a title at the beginning and
then we should have a heading called
heading number one and then we should
have a paragraph all in our body text
which should be read with white text so
let's save that and take a look at it as
you can see this is where I wrote this
is my body here's the heading number one
and here is the paragraph
now that's all the time we have for
right now but in the next tutorial I'm
gonna be teaching you how to add a line
break to your paragraph and how to align
it and also teaching you about lists and
how to format text and if you're not
already there you can go to my website
the new Boston comm and it will give you
a step-by-step tutorial of everything we
went over today so you can review it
