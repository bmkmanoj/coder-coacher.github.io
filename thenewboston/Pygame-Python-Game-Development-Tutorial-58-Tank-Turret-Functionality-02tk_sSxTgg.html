58 PI game tutorial video in this video
we're gonna be working on is adjusting
our we want to have our you know our
tank gun and we want to be able to
adjust the gun to fire at several
different levels so at the moment we've
just got this simple tank and it's got
you know this the gun of the tank or the
barrel I suppose of the tank so I'm some
tank aficionado is going to correct me
I'm sure but you've got the tank gun and
currently we've got a good angle here
but we want to be able to let the user
set the angle of the guns anti-tank you
can you know set the angle of it so
that's what we're gonna be talking about
in this video there's a couple ways of
you about this the most complex way
would be to take your tank gun and make
a sprite of the actual tank gun itself
and then you could use the rotate
functionality to slowly rotate that
image the problem is that image is gonna
rotate and not hold the same like the
gun won't be always attached like this
point and rotate around that point so
you'd have to build some functionality
around that but you can even have it
rotate as little as one degree at a time
so you could really make it complex now
as you'll probably see later on down the
road going this way when you make it
that complex you make everything after
it as complex as that is so later on
down the road you'll see why that why
that matters but for now what I'm gonna
say is that we're gonna have our tank
gun and we're gonna have like nine
positions basically so you've got you
know straight forward and then up up a
little bit each time and then a tank gun
for the most part of the actual cannon
of the tank cannot shoot like straight
up you know it can only go up you know
even this is probably higher than a real
tank you can go but anyway so that's
that's what we've got in store for this
video so the idea that I have for this
is we're just gonna draw the lines now
the other problem with drawing lines is
this line there's no parameter
like length of line right there is no
length of the line you could calculate
this on your own you could like build a
function and make sure the gun is the
same length every time you can do stuff
like that but we're not gonna be
worrying too much with that so what I
propose is basically what we'll have is
we've got this tank function and then
later on we'll pass through because the
tank function is ran in every frame per
second so what we'll do is we'll pass
through a turret position parameter in
the tank function but for now let's just
let's just go ahead and visualize where
we think the turrets might be so I'm
going to create a variable and it's
gonna be possible turrets and this is
just gonna be a list of tuples and
basically it's going to be the tank
position and then we're going to like
subtract basically the same thing we've
done here right X minus 10y minus 20
these are these are the tank positioned
and then the points of the line so X
minus and y minus 20 is totally fine but
let's go ahead and start with like the
smallest ones so for example we would
say X - probably like 25 and Y let's
just do - - let's go ahead and just run
that real quick and see where our turret
is right so that's pretty darn good we
might want to stick the gun out like a
little more so what you do like X like -
27 something like that so that's our
starting turret so that's as far down as
it can go right we're not gonna let the
gun like go inside the tank or anything
so that's good so we'll go ahead and
close that and that'll be our first
possible turret choice so we'll just go
ahead and paste that in there and then
from here we'll just keep modifying this
and the X like as the turret goes up you
can imagine that the X needs to decline
slightly but the Y needs to probably
change more but you'll see what I mean
in a minute but like as this gun aims
upward if X was the same position I mean
gun would get really long as we moved up
so so we'll do X minus y 7 y -2 then
we'll do let's just felt pre-populated
few here okay so then we'll do we'll
make this X minus 26 and then y minus 5
then we'll come down here we'll make
this X minus 25 and then Y minus 8
that's good let's go ahead and see where
we are at that point so let's copy that
paste that one in play the game
ok so we're moving up slowly but surely
so then we'll have X minus and then
we'll do a 23 since we're starting to
get some angle here Y minus 12 and then
X minus 20 Y minus 14 and we so far so
you've got 1 2 3 4 5 let's add let's
just copy this and let's paste 1 2 3 4
so then we'll have so let's just run
through key X is real quick so we'll do
20 18 15 13 and then we'll make this one
11 and then you've got 12 14 will do 15
17 19 and 21 so these are like all of
our possible turret locations you don't
have to get rid of this comma right here
but I'd like to so kind of go ahead and
do it
and then what we'll do just to visualize
all of them finally before we move on is
you've got this draw line reference well
we can't say instead is we could say
like this replace this with
possible turrets like so and then in in
possible turrets we will we can just
take this and we could put in like zero
okay so and then turret with so then
let's go ahead and save it run that play
and then you can see like at the zero
with position is all the way down so
it's like the minimum height so then we
can just copy this scroll it over a
little bit so copy this and let's just
paste pay I was hoping that would do
that hold on
so we have nine total so we've got three
so far four five six seven eight and
nine and then we can just write in zero
one two three four five six seven and
eight and just for the record obviously
we start at zero so we do have nine here
so let's go ahead and say we run that
and see where we are we'll hit play and
basically you can see the possible arc
of guns not too bad it's good as it'll
get for now I don't see any reason why
we need to have even like more angles in
there so that's good so now that we've
got that we want to actually be able to
let the user control the turret so
that's what we're gonna be doing in the
next video so stay tuned for that as
always a thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
