your 44 C++ tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm going to be teaching you
guys about a couple things specifically
about the keyword Const which stands for
a constant now whenever you use the
keyword Const it means that whatever you
use it on you typically use on variables
and stuff it means that that variable
remains constant throughout your program
aka it can't be changed or modified in
any way so let's go ahead and take a
quick look at that say you have an
integer variable X and you set equal to
3 whenever you first make it and then
later on you want to change it to
something like 5 while your program is
just going to run fine and whenever you
try to print out X or use it in any
other way it's going to run perfectly
fine as expected so what the constant
keyword does in that constant keyword Co
n St whenever you're creating something
you put the constant keyword in there
and it's pretty much telling your
compiler all right now whenever I create
this variable I'm going to set equal to
value and I don't want you to change it
for the rest of the program so now
whenever you change try to change to
something else like 5 in try to run this
program is going to get error because
it's saying hey Bucky you called this
variable constant
you promised me we're going to change it
and now you lied me right there so
that's why I'm giving you an error so
that's basically what the constant
keyword does and make sure that whatever
is constant is unable to be modified so
that being said later on in your
programming you're going to learn that
some objects you create you don't want
them to be able to be modified some
objects are just regular objects and
other objects you want constant you
don't want them to be able to change so
you use this constant keyword whenever
you create an object so therefore you
have an object that can't be modified
and you might be thinking RA so I can
just use it with normal functions and
not exactly whenever you have a constant
object
you can't call regular functions with
them you can only call functions that
they themselves are constant so constant
objects need constant functions and of
course whenever you create a constant
function you need to make sure it's
constant both in the prototype in the
header file and in
the definition aka the C++ source file
so let's go ahead and just create a
regular function first and then I'm
going to be running it aside a constant
object I'm going to be doing a couple
things so let's go ahead and make um a
sally function and we'll just name it
like print shiz and this is just a
regular function I'm not doing anything
weird yet so see out I'm just like I am
a regular function and then end that
line and then of course since we created
a function we need to prototype it so
then it is void I think I named it print
shiz just like that so now we can see
that we can just go ahead into our main
program create a Sally object and then
we can use that cell object to call our
regular functions such as print shows
just like that and whenever we run it
everything is going to go smoothly it's
going to print out I'm a regular
function so I did that and we already
know that so let's go ahead and jump
into constant objects now whenever you
create a constant object you do so doing
this throw your keyword Co n st before
you create your object and everything
else is basically exactly the same you
type class you want it to be from and
also what your name your object like
Const object looks like a pretty good
name search and IRA all I need to do is
Const
object and then I can go ahead and call
it my other methods like print shiz well
whenever we try and do this we get an
error message because it's saying
alright you created an object that it
was constant and you try to use a
function that wasn't constant see this
function isn't constant is just a
regular function so we need to build
special constant functions whenever we
create a constant object so you're
saying alright let's go ahead and do
that then so let's go ahead and create
another method on a constant excuse me
another function talking in Java another
computer program language but let's go
ahead and create another special
constant function so void Sally let's
just name this print shiz - and in order
to create a constant function you go
ahead and you type the keyword constant
right after your function definition so
Co n s T so now what happens is right
after this
we build the body for it so this is just
going to see out umm I am the constant
function just like that and of course
we'll end that line right there and now
like I said before we need to prototype
it is a constant two so we need to
basically tell every single file that
we're going to be working with constant
objects and in order to prototype it
here's what we do
go ahead and just like before type avoid
print chiz yeah that was called printers
- and you just write Const right there
and now you're telling your compiler
alright this is a constant object
prototype so a lot of people might think
you do this add the Const before make
sure you add it after the parameters and
you should be good to go
so now whenever we try and run this
constant function with the constant
object remember this is our constant
object and this is our constant function
print is - now whenever we try and
run it it should be good to go I am a
regular function
I am the constant function pretty simple
so so as you can see whenever we build
objects if we build a regular object we
can use the regular functions with them
whenever we build a constant object
we're telling our C++ compiler all right
this object we don't want anything to be
able to modify it or change it so it
told us all right I can do that but you
need to build me some constant functions
if you do that for me
I'll run your program just fine so that
was our little deal we had with the
compiler and that's why this one ran
with the right wave function and this
constant object ran with the constant
functions so now you should understand
how to prototype constant functions how
to create them and also why constant
objects need constant functions and
again later on you're going to be seeing
why in like bigger programs um you need
to be able to create some objects that
you want to be able to make constant and
why they were useful for your compiler
so for now I just want to teach you guys
the very basic so in the next story
we're probably going to be covering
constants a little bit more because
there's actually a lot to go over with
constants and classes so for now that's
all you get thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
