hard drive you're gonna click on it and
then you're gonna see a whole bunch of
hard drives you're like alright what the
heck am I supposed to do from here the
next thing that people look for is
pretty much the capacity and what the
capacity is it's pretty self-explanatory
but in case you're just on cloud nine
right now I'll tell you guys what it
means it's the amount of information you
can store such as the amount of programs
the amount of files and it's usually
measured in gigabytes and just guys give
you guys a general idea 40 gigabytes is
a pretty small and about a thousand
gigabytes is huge in you know and you'll
never use it we went with 250 game buddy
right here which is pretty good for
gigabytes is kind of used if you're just
gonna let go on the internet anything
over 200 gigabytes if you're going to be
playing games of stuff and anything over
500 is used for like video editing and
it's also the bigger hard drive had its
big bragging rights so for are you
computer nerds out there get a huge hard
drive and then just tell everyone about
it the next thing I want to talk you
guys about in a big thing that people
look for is the drive speed in your hard
drive and this is literally how fast
your hard drive is spinning and this is
measured in revolutions per minute rpms
there are two types of rpms will not too
tight but two speeds 7,200 revolutions
per minute in ten thousand ten thousand
revolutions per minute now you may think
alright the faster it spins means the
faster I can read and write data which
is true but you got to remember one
thing
the faster your hard drive spins the
hotter it's going to be just due to
friction and just a lot of physics oh
wow
a thousand ten thousand rpm may seem
like it's going to be faster you do want
to consider
it's gonna heat so unless you have a
sweet cooling system for your PC stick
with a 1770 200 I always build my
computers with 7200 just because I feel
safer and more secure and happy so now
that we know what to look for when
buying a harddrive let me tell you guys
what kind of hard drive I picked out
this is my hard drive wrapped in about 8
pounds of bubble wherever right here I
picked out a Seagate Barracuda which is
the brand name I went with 7200 rpm s
because I always do
I got a 250 gigabyte with just plenty
enough for probably anything you're ever
gonna want to put on and I went with a
SATA SATA 3.0 interface and we should be
good to go with that it's probably more
than enough for anything we're ever
gonna use it for so I hope you enjoyed
watching my sorta I hope you learned a
little something if nothing so once you
pick that hard drive you're ready you
can move on to the next tutorial I'll
see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
