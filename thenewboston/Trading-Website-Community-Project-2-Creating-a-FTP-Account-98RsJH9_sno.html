second video and in this video what
we're going to be doing is we're going
to be uploading a test video to the
website just to make sure everything's
running smooth and we don't got any bugs
or anything but before we do that I want
to mention this what I did is I bought
some shared hosting which is basically a
space on the internet that you could
upload files and I also bought a testing
domain name and that's Lisa 1986 dot-com
so of course this is not the final name
of the website but this is just a domain
name I bought so you guys can follow the
progression of the website and check out
its latest development so again like I
said Lisa in 1986 comm is going to be
the testing website for this project so
later on whenever we decide on a final
name for the website all we have to do
is pack up the database in all of our
files and move it over to the domain
name so it takes like five minutes but
for testing purposes there you go
so like I said I bought a testing
website basically and whenever you buy a
shared hosting account and log into it
especially through Hostgator it locks
you right in to your control panel
now the very first thing we need to be
able to do is upload files to our
website because that's what we're
developing of course so how do we upload
files to the website so the first thing
we need to do is we need to create an
FTP account now FTP is basically the
protocol where you transfer files from
your computer to a server so let's go
ahead and learn how to do that first if
you look in your control panel you're
going to see a little icon called FTP
accounts go ahead and click that and
whenever you do it's going to ask you
pretty much to create a user so I'm just
going to name my user Bucky 20 and I'm
gonna give them the password of actually
I'm not even going to tell you guys
because I don't trust you guys you
hooligans are going to try to hack into
my website just go I have copied this in
use password it just gave me like a
random password but make your own and
now the only other thing that we want to
change is this make sure that our
directory is pointing to public HTML the
might be an extension on the end but
public HTML is basically the main folder
that when people go to look at your
website this is the main files that are
going to see all of your web files you
want to put in this folder so that's why
we want to change the directory to that
so we got our name password we want to
put it in the main directory and we go
ahead and hit create FTP account and now
it says account created Bucky 20 we're
good to go and just verify down here
that this is your login name your path
make sure it ends in public HTML and now
what we need to do is we need to
actually log in to our account so in
order to do that probably the most
popular way is to use something called
file Zilla now this is basically a
program that you can install on your
computer and it's really easy with like
one click of a button you could transfer
files that you've been working on on
your computer to your server so in order
to log on your server this is what you
do when your account is created down
here you can click on this button
configure FTP client now this is all the
information that you need to log into
your server so I already have that
password copied that hopefully you guys
did it see and I'm going to plug that in
the password now for the host as you can
see it's this thing right here FTP
server so go ahead and copy that right
there and that's going to be your
hostname so paste that right in the host
name now for username it may be the
username you created but more likely
they added an extension on the end of it
so mine is Bucky 20 at Lisa 1986 comm
the whole entire thing is your user name
not only Bucky 20 so I'm going to go
ahead and plug that into user name and
the port you need that too and if you
look it's port 21 probably going to just
type that but I'm too lazy just going to
go ahead and paste that now go ahead and
hit quick connect and you're going to
see a whole bunch of matrix things runs
right here and it says directory listing
six
cessful so now even though you guys
don't see it on the right-hand side of
your screen it says empty directory this
is basically all of the web folders for
our server and on the left is our
computer so this is our computer this is
the web server so obviously we need to
make a test file for the web server just
to see if it works so right now if you
guys are curious whenever you go to Lisa
1986 calm it gives you this little
default page it's pretty much the
standard page when you have no files
listed so what we want to do is we want
to just upload a test file real quick so
I'm going to go ahead and open notepad
plus plus and create a real quick HTML
file so HTML and actually it's not going
to be a HTML file you guys are going to
see in a second HTML and just create a
you don't even need a header right now
body body and we might as well put it in
a cool heading heading one that's a
pretty cool one and heading one now I'm
guessing you guys are familiar with PHP
already but if you aren't what you can
do is we're going to be saving all of
our development files as dot PHP
extensions that way we can embed PHP
code right in the HTML file so what you
can do if you save it as HTML file your
PHP code isn't going to run but if you
save it as a PHP file your PHP and HTML
is going to run I bet you guys knew that
already but you know I just think I'd
stress it so I'm just going to write
bacon Sal's just like that now go ahead
and save this as what I did is I made a
folder on my desktop called Lisa and I'm
just going to name it this index dot PHP
and it's crucial that this is what you
named your file even though you guys
might just be downloading the same file
and go ahead and hit save now check this
out in FileZilla go ahead and navigate
and I already navigated to my desktop
Lisa now go ahead and refresh this and
you see your file right there now in
order to get files to your server once
you're logged in go ahead and navigate
to the directory you want
and we already are in the public HTML
and just double-click your file just
like that now when you do you see that
it appears on the right-hand side and
you get this little prompted top
directory listing successful basically
you were successful in moving this file
to your server so how can we verify that
well we just uploaded a test homepage so
if you go back to Lisa in 1986 calm and
hit refresh check it out it says bacon
salves so like I said the index dot PHP
is your default page whenever anyone
goes to Lisa 1986 calm or pretty much
your main webpage so there you go our
server is hooked up correctly in the
next story we're going to be doing is
getting our hands a little bit dirtier
now that we know everything is working
correctly and setup and yeah that's
basically it so anyways thank you guys
for watching don't forget to subscribe
and I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
