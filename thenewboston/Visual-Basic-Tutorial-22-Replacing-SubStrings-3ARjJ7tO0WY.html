youtube.com slash on live gamer for the
new Boston and in this tutorial we're
going to be taking a look at replacing
parts of a string so let's go ahead and
get started
we're going to come over here to new
project and once it opens our new
project window we're going to select a
console application and I'm just going
to call mine replacing sub strings and
let me pull this up here a bit and then
just go ahead and click OK and it should
load our project
okay so now that our project has loaded
let me go ahead and zoom in here a bit
okay so now that our project has loaded
we're going to go ahead and create a new
variable so we'll just call it my string
and we're going to create a second
variable and we're going to call it
final string
okay so now what we're going to do is
we're going to prompt the user to enter
in any string so we're just going to
type console dot write line please enter
a string now what we're going to do is
we're going to get what they typed in so
my string equals console dot read line
okay so after we get what they've typed
in we're going to go ahead and remove
part of that string or replace that part
of that string with another string so
we're going to type final string equals
my string and then we're going to use
dot to see what we can use for my string
now you can see there's a whole bunch of
stuff here we're going to type replace
so now what we're going to do is going
to go we're going to go through here and
we will just type in the first argument
a inside of quotes which is the old
value the value that we want to replace
and we're going to replace a with the
new value so let's just do N and then
finally we will write that out on the
console
and then we'll just do console dot
readline so it waits for us to input
something before it closes and now we're
going to start running this program it's
going to say please enter a string so I
type Sam dog cat cow astronomy now if I
press ENTER you can see that all of the
A's were replaced with an N so here we
have Sam and you can see down here it's
SN m the a and cat was replaced with an
N and this is in strata me instead of
astronomy so we can also do this with
something larger than just one character
so if I type hello and here we can
replace it with let's say goodbye so now
if I type in something like Hello on
live gamer it's going to replace it with
goodbye on live gamer now if you don't
type hello in your first string it's not
going to replace it at all and I'll just
show you that right here so if I just
type the new Boston here it's just going
to give me the new Boston back because
it didn't find Hello anywhere inside
that string so this is a pretty simple
tutorial thanks for watching and once
you guys have this nailed down and you
know how to do it go ahead and move on
to the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
