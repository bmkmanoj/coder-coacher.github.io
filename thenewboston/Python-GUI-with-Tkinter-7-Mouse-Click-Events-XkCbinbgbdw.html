you use cancer you're not just limited
to binding one function to one widget so
you're like okay that's kind of weird
what am I talking about well with
widgets what you can do is you can bind
multiple events to it and depending on
what you do to that widget its it
behaves in a different kind of way so
you can have a button and if you
left-click it something happens and if
you right-click it something else
happens pretty freakin sweet so let's go
ahead and learn how to do that right now
so what I want to do is I want to build
a like one widget and I want to say if
you left click it or middle click it or
right click it three different things
are going to happen so we need three
different functions that we can have
occur so I'm going to cover the first
one left click and of course we're going
to be passing in the event so we're
going to be doing this in the second um
you know I tell you guys two different
techniques by functions - widgets we're
going to be using the second one and
these are going to be real easy this
just going to print left on the screen
and all might as well type all these out
so - fine right click and it takes an
event print right and of course the last
one actually let me put it in here as
well put it nice in order okay you know
what just freaking ticking me off right
now
that middle click and takes an event as
well so this is going to happen whenever
we middle click on the mouse one aka the
scroll wheel and this is just going to
print middle go figure
so now we have three different functions
that can be called so instead of just
having a button actually let me build a
very basic frame so this is going to be
it's going to look like just an empty a
root window but it is actually going to
be an invisible frame in there
so of course if you guys forgot the key
word is frame and says where do you want
to place it in our main window and two
other parameters that you can add to
this are the width and we'll just set
that equal to like 300 pixels and we'll
set the Holly equal to I don't know like
250 now again and actually you don't
have those it's not a string that heck
is okay so your that like a street
sweeper or something going outside my
house but uh actually are no street
sweepers that go on my street so I don't
know what it is anyways is low
distraction so what this is going to
look like since we have an invisible
frame inside our window it's just going
to pretty much adjust the size of the
window itself so if you have this 600 by
400 it's just going to look like a 600
by 400 blank window but we know as
programmers that there is indeed in a
visible frame on there now we needed
this invisible frame because we need a
widget to actually bind events to so
take that frame and the first thing we
want to do is we want to bind button 1
and remember that is just left clicking
on your mouse and of course what do we
want to call when that occurs left click
and hold on I got to figure out what the
heck that noise is else I alright it was
some guy who decided to mow his lawn
it's like almost 7 o'clock at night and
it's about to rain I don't know maybe
he's like stuff going on later this week
but he decided it was a great time to
start mowing his lawn go figure in the
middle of my frickin tutorial all right
so now we said ok whenever they
left-click on their mouse then call this
function simple enough well now I want
to bind something else now whenever you
middle click that scroll wheel on your
mouse that scroll wheel is actually
called button 2 so whenever they middle
click on this
rame call middle-click if i copy this
you guys can see how this program is
going to finish out of course button 3
is the right button on your mouse so if
you don't have a middle scroll wheel or
if you aren't worried about it
then you don't need to include this but
one two three left middle right pretty
easy to remember all the buttons in
order so now the only other thing i have
left to do is actually we edit all the
functionality on the frame right here
but we didn't say we want the frame to
display on the screen yet so of course
frame I'll just pack it in there no need
to you know use the grid or anything
like that so let me run it right here
and of course remember like I said there
aren't any visible widgets that are
going to appear since a frame is just a
blank empty container however it is 300
wide by 250 tall even though you know
there's no way of telling that without
measuring it so keep an eye down here
about what's going on I know you guys
can't see my mouse but check it out I'm
going to left-click right now and it
says left when I met will click it says
middle and when I right-click it says
right so right right metal-metal right
right left
pretty sweet song and now we know how to
have one widget handle multiple events
or in other words you can do the same
thing to the same widget or accuse me
you can do different things to the same
widget and have different events or
functions be called so now we know a
bunch of different crap in the next
tutorial I think it's time to actually
start using the skills we learn and
learning how to build a proper piece of
software using classes so that's what we
had to look forward to I will see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
