Android tutorial for the new boss in
what we're going to do in this tutorial
I just thought this would be a good way
to show you guys because it might be
something that you need to do basically
I'm going to show you how to hide the
keyboard in code since for example if we
start a browser application we do HTTP
or actually if we click on our edit text
our keyboard comes up then we do HTTP
you know www Boston comm and then we hit
go our keyboard still there it's just
like chillin he's like hey guys what's
up just hanging out here and it doesn't
go away so in this tutorial we're just
going to close our keyboard after we hit
the Go button and after it loads our
website so it's gonna be a pretty simple
tutorial for the most part it's just
another one of those things that seems
kind of complex it's kind of hard to
remember but that's why that's why we're
creating this project here so again you
guys can refer to it and your own code
so what we're going to do is we're going
to go down into our switching case for
our go button and after we've loaded our
website we want to get rid of our
browser so we do that through input mint
method manager so we're going to set up
an input method manager and basically
this class kind of manages the input so
that's what that does and we're going to
call this our input manage method
manager IMM something like that we're
going to import this and what we're
going to set this equal to is we're
going to cast in the input method
manager
and then we're going to say get system
service and what service do we want to
get well we want to refer to the context
and then we're going to say dot input
method service so that's a service that
we're using and basically there we go
now we've set up our manager this input
method manager is going to be set up
from some sort of a input method service
and now what we have to do is we kind of
have to use one of the methods from this
manager that we set up so we could have
created this within our on create method
and have this variable you know be able
to be used within multiple methods
within our class if you want to do that
we don't have to set it up here but what
we're going to do now is use the method
that's going to basically hide our
keyboard so again once we're done typing
within our edit text we hit this go
button it's going to set it to a string
and then we're going to load that URL
and then we're going to want to close
the keyboard so this is how you close
the keyboard we refer to that input
manage input method manager and we say
dot hide soft input from window so
basically what that takes in within its
parameters is a binder window token and
flag of some sort so we're going to
click that in for a flag we're going to
set this equal to be zero let's see if
the Javadoc has anything yeah just set
it to zero for now and then what we're
going to do is we need that eye binder
so what we're going to do is we're going
to use the edit text that we have in our
class that basically is giving us the
problem with the keyboard after we're
done using it we're gonna done using
this edit text we're going to say dot
get window token so it basically is
going to convert it to this eye binder
so it's going to take our you our edit
text called URL and get the window token
from it and that's how you basically set
it up and this code will hide it hide
our keyboard after we're done using this
edit text for the most part so again
pretty simple kind of compliment
kind of you're like what's going on here
but I mean after you use it a few times
once you need this or you can always
refer back to this project so I'm just
going to put a little comment here
saying hiding the keyboard after using
an edit text so again if you're working
on a project you can be like oh these
are the two lines code I need copy and
paste for the most part and then change
your edit text so I mean it's pretty
simple little tutorial only two lines of
code that we learned but it's pretty
useful as well
so let's just run it make sure that we
get that error out of there and we're
pretty much done with this tutorial so
let's scroll down to our simple browser
and type in a website again HTTP
then we hit go and it should close this
keyboard after it starts loading our URL
and there it does it so that's kind of
what we want and I'll catch you guys in
the next tutorial
have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
