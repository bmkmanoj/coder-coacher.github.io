your 11th intermediate Java tutorial and
this is pretty much a continuation from
the last intermediate Java tutorial
which was ten in case you guys that I
can't count and in this story we're
going to be finishing up a couple
methods from the collections class so
you know enough with me talking let's
just get right into it so we ended up in
we call it a method copy which pretty
much took everything from L and copied
it into the list copy so from here what
we're going to do is just print out a
little display so we actually know
what's going on so system.out.print line
and let's just print out something
clever copy of list for the colon and
from here we need to call that a output
method that we didn't create yet so
output and instead of outputting the
original list let's go ahead and an
output list and I accidentally left the
comment that's embarrassing so let's get
rid of that output we'll just put like a
list copy so what this is going to do
eventually once we build the output
method is output the new copy that list
that we just made so the last thing the
last method I want to teach you from the
collections class is how you can take
pretty much any lists or collections
actually and fill it with something that
wasn't in there before so let's go ahead
and we can finally add our comment and
put fill collection with crap and let's
go ahead and put collection dot fill and
it takes two parameters this method the
first parameter is what collection do
you want to fill well let's just go
ahead and change the list you can change
the list copy if you want it doesn't
really matter and the second one is the
type of data what are you going to be
filling it with well we want to take
that list in this is pretty much the
same as replace anytime you come across
any instance or element in the list we
want to change it to X so now instead of
our list which was n WP since we
reversed it it's going to be X X X so uh
you know
could have picked a better letter but
you know too bad deal with it so go
ahead and we'll print this out one last
time system.out.print line and just go
ahead and put like after filling the
list : and that line and now let's go
ahead and output the list which was
called l1 last time and now the only
thing let's see
collections that's why I'm getting error
and the only areas we should have is
that output because we didn't create
another method called output yet so
let's go ahead and change that right now
so let's go ahead and tighten this up
and outside of your main method right
here make sure that you don't put this
method inside the main or it won't work
so you need to go outside the main but
yet inside the class whatever your main
class is Michael mines called Bucky we
want to write a new output method so
let's leave a comment right there I'll
name mine a method and let's go ahead
and put private since it's private to
the class static void and it will put
output and put list and this is the
parameter we pass it in as you can see
we pass the end a collection method
which was a list all the time so let's
go ahead and put list character and
we'll just name it like the list for
simplicity make sure you spell that
right the list and now what we can do is
we pretty much just need to output
everything so I'm going to go ahead and
put an enhance for loop in here so for
character thing and I'll put the list
and make sure that's the same parameter
you pass then and what this is going to
do is it's going to loop through
whatever lists you pass into it and it's
going to treat each element is things so
now we can you know alter that or pretty
much do whatever we want so let's go
ahead and put system.out.print F since
by the way the main thing we're trying
to accomplish in this method is just the
print stuff out so that's why we need
printf and for the format let's go ahead
and put a string variable
and of course for argument it has to be
thing and in case you can't remember
what it's going to do is it's going to
loop through each element in the list
and it's going to output it for you
simple enough
so then after outputs you probably want
to just print out a blank line just
because if you don't everything is going
to be running out on the same line it's
going to look pretty confusing so
system.out.print line and that's all
there is to so go ahead and check your
program make sure you don't have any
errors and then go ahead and run it
press ok and now here's our final output
low easy house a good thing for Windows
7 whenever I put it to the top at a
there we go so now you see our original
list is pwn bone not bad after we called
the reverse method on it it's n WP which
is a reverse of pwn case you guys can
figure that out
now here we print it out copy list so
this is an entirely different list than
here it's pretty much just a copy of it
and the last method that we called is
fill so let me see if I find it right
here collections dot fill and what it
did is take the original list L and
replaced every element in it with X so
now instead of n WP we have X X X so
that's demonstrating a couple new
methods from the collections class and
how you can use them in why they are
useful so that's that for this tutorial
thank you guys for watching don't forget
