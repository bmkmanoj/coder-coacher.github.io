the last video what did we learn how to
do we learned how to make a window and
look how boring this is a blank window
that you can close out of oh my god
that's so cool alright so that was
pretty boring so in this tutorial I am
going to show you how to add a button to
your window and also whenever the user
clicks it I'm going to show you guys how
to call a function and we'll just do
something stupid like print some text
out to the terminal now before we begin
just so we ensure that we are using the
best programming practices what I'm
going to do is I'm going to use
object-oriented programming from here on
out instead of jumbling everything
together
so before what we did is we created an
object right from this main gtk window
class and that's great and all but what
we're going to do in this example is
we're actually going to make our own
class and I'm going to name my main
window you can name it whatever you want
you can omit button window button
program whatever and the class that
we're going to make is actually going to
inherit from gtk window now whenever you
inherit from a class not only do you get
all of the stuff that was in that class
but we can also add some cool
functionality to it so instead of
whenever we run our program is just a
gtk window which is a plain window this
is going to be of type main window which
is pretty much just the same thing but
with our features as well whatever we
decide to add now the first thing I'm
going to do in our new shiny new class
is I'm going to make a constructor now
let me give myself one more line of code
right there now for our constructor I'm
actually going to call our super classes
constructor
wait a minute why are you calling that
constructor with our constructor well
from here what we can do is we can
actually set the title of the window so
the title is just going to be equal to
destroyed title of window that's a super
created by now so title of window and
the type of window of course is the
thing that appears on this top bar right
here so instead of just being blank or
whatever you know your file name was
you're going to have all these buttons
though but then you see this one is
tutorials desktop tutorials um it's just
going to say title of window right here
actually let me name it the button
clicker 2.0 even though this is the
first version of this program I like
naming everything 2.0 just because I
think it sounds cool all right give
myself a little bit more room to type so
now we have a blank window it has a
pretty cool title but you know it's
still a blank window not that impressive
well the next thing we want to do is
actually create the button and let me
comment this alright so in order to
create a button just write self button
and set this equal to GT K dot button so
a button object one of the properties
that it can have is a label and the
label of your button is just the text
that appears on your button so I was
just write like a click here clicker
here
all right so there you go looking good
now remember actually let me do this all
right so you know down here when I talk
to you guys about signals
so basically when something emits a
signal it means that it did something
and with your signals there are
different signals for different objects
of course you don't have a main clip-on
on a button because there's no X button
on a button only your window and
likewise one of the most important
things you're always going to do with
the button is you're going to connect
the clicked signals so connect clicked
and after this what you can do is you
can say okay now whenever the user
clicks this button the next parameter is
what do you want to do now we really
don't have a whole lot going on right
now so I'm gonna make a function later
on that just print some text out on the
screen and I'll name that function
button and clicked so again this is
going to probably give me a little
warning because I didn't create it yet
but we will in just a second and we have
our button created looking good the last
thing we actually need to do to display
is just to add it to the screen so we
want to add something what do you want
to add well just that button all right
cool cool cool so we have a constructor
we have our main window and the last
thing we need to do is we need to make
this button clicked function because we
say whenever the user clicks this call a
button in this class called button
clicked so we probably need one I'll say
a user clicks button
so fine button clicked and from here you
need to pass it in self widget and by
the way a widget is just an item that
you can add um right now you're looking
at a button which is one type but
they're also like sliders and trees and
menus and yadda yadda a whole bunch of
stuff and we're going to be covering um
mostly all the widgets in the up come to
tour iou's but for now um there you go
and from here we'll just print something
out that's really dumb would just say
game time and all right typo typo
looking good all right so that's pretty
much all we have to do from here and
hopefully when I run this check out what
happens we could this is the tiniest
program I have ever seen in my life look
at this window it's like the size of my
phone I don't even know if you guys can
see it on YouTube but we have a window
that is one pixel by one pixel top and
we have a tiny button in here that says
click here now whenever I click it let
me move this closer whenever we click
this button it just prints out game time
on the screen so again what we did is we
created a class in this class resembled
our entire window that one pixel by one
pixel thing and we have two functions in
our class one is a constructor so
whenever you call it what's the first
thing that you want to happen and all we
did here is we set the window the title
of it and created a button and then on
our button we said whenever the user
clicks it and it emits a click signal
then call this method right here and
then all this method did is it printed
out game time pretty easy stuff so there
you go that is how you create a button
and add it to your window and enough
materials I'm going to be showing you
guys how to add a bunch different
widgets and also layouts it's going to
be awesome so see
you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
