to my second C programming challenge now
before I want to tell you guys what my
second challenge is I want to
congratulate gigabit v on being the
first one to solve my first challenge
now here's a solution right here where
you need to add one line of code to
complete the pattern in the pattern or
the piece of code he added was right
before this statement the printf
statement with the empty space he added
the if to so that was a solution to the
first challenge so congratulations
gigabit v now the second challenge in
this challenge is a little more easy or
at least the instructions are what you
have to do in what I'm challenging
everyone out there to do is to create a
single hello world program without using
a single semicolon now sounds easy but
trust me it's rather difficult so again
go ahead and in the C language the
language that you've been learning
create hello world this output statement
right here without using a single
semicolon in your source code and here's
mine right here to show you guys that it
can be done obviously I'm not going to
show you my source code or outside give
away the answer so that's the challenge
I challenge you as soon as you get the
answer send me a message and you are the
winner so good luck everyone
have fun don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
