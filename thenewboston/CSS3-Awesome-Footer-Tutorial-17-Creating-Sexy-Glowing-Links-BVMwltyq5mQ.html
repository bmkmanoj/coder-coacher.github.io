whenever you are hovering over something
this this pretty much means drop up menu
Li hover means what appears on your
hover and of course we know that and you
know normal layman's terms means drop
menu so in your drop of menus what do
you want a style well we want to style
the links which are a now the color of
these by default are AAA AAA Oak Hall
anonymous what's that called Alcoholics
Anonymous oh I guess it is just AAA I
thought it was Triple A but I guess
that's a car company anyways hey Bucky
you're getting off track here style
links so this is gray that makes the
links gray by default now how do you
change the color whenever you hover over
links to white well what you want to do
is you want to add a hover that means
whenever you hover over links just make
them white simple enough a very easy
crap going on here so now what we need
to do and this is kind of a one of the
last things before we start styling the
good stuff is I want to show you guys
how to style these special links which
are I call them header links because as
you can see we have like we have stream
messages which is basically the main
category and then under we have each of
the regular links pictures is a header
link so basically this messages pictures
information friends in-stream link and
that's where we're gonna be styling so
move this biatch up alright so
us put header links stream messages etc
etc alright so how do we style the
header links well I'm so glad you asked
it's actually very easy actually I'm
gonna steal a little bit up here just a
little bit not too much it's okay
alright so the first thing we want to do
is remember we're styling links in the
drop menu so this is how you do that
however whenever the links have a
special class called header links we
want to do something a little bit
different so whenever we have a link and
we give it the class header class this
is what it's going to look like font
size is 14 pixels it's going to be a
little bit bigger because it is the
heading text decoration is underlined
and I like this because whenever you
have underline that separates this it's
like a little line that separates the
railway links from the header links
because you know the header link is
better and it can't be involved with
those dirty little regular links so I
can kind of track your color CC 0 0 0 0
I know I say oh sometimes but it's
actually 0 and for the margin top I'm
just gonna set it at 10 pixels now if
you didn't have this then this link
right here would butt up against this in
it would look like one big list so make
sure you give a margin top because it
separates each section like the
information section picture section
messages section tomato tomahto whatever
and so margin left is also going to be
10 pixels now the only other thing we
have to do for this is add a hover
property and actually I can just copy
this
so of course we want something to happen
we want these links to change basically
to white whenever you hover over them
so how do you do that so glad you asked
it's actually very simple add a hover
property boom you guys are going to be
pros by the end of these tutorials so
the only thing that you want to change
is color change that to white now you
also want to change your cursor to a
pointer now the reason that you want to
do this is for some reason whenever I
was hovering over these I think that I
don't I really don't know why um my
cursor wasn't changing into a finger so
look at my cursor right now you see how
it's a pointer and then when I hover
over these links it changes to UM a curt
hold on ginge off track here this is a
pointer or this is like default and then
it changes to the finger okay well
anyways it wasn't doing that whenever I
was hovering over these links so you
need a change cursor:pointer and if you
guys didn't even know that you can
manually change your cursor then this is
how you do that and by the way this is a
really dumb trick if you're working on
like someone's webpage and you hate them
you can actually um change the cursor to
a loading sign so it looks like your
mouse is like waiting for something like
a document to load or the page to finish
loading and then they would just sit
there and even though the page would be
loaded there they'll look at their
cursor and think that's something still
loading
I wouldn't recommend doing that in
serious web development but if you hate
your friend and you want to mess around
with them that's how you do it but
anyways thank you guys for watching and
in the next tutorial well I'll save it
for then but it's going to be sweet so
thanks for watching I'll see you next
