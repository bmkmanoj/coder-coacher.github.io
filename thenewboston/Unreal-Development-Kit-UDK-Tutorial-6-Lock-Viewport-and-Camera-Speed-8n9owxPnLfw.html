for workout tips I highly doubt it
so yeah I'm just gonna go ahead all
right guys welcome back to your 60 UDK
tutorial and in this story as promised
I'm gonna be finishing up these viewport
buns what they do and how we can use
them so the first thing I want to talk
to you guys about is this lock viewport
button now let me go ahead and show you
guys this using an example if I switch
over to one of these wire-free modes and
select one of the eyes and let me go
ahead and select this dome right here
whenever I select one of these objects
in any of the viewports and I hit home
watch what happens to all these other
viewports when I hit home it's gonna go
ahead and snap to that object this one
now shows the dome this one now shows
them this one now shows the dome so let
me go ahead and take one of these and
move it around say you know I'm working
in this side view which is the top left
and I wanna you know I want to
concentrate on this right here and I'm
gonna be working with another model down
here but I want to keep this side view
concentrated on this thing whatever the
heck it is I don't I want to say what it
looks like but anytime I want to lock
this view into place and letting go
ahead and lock this viewport now check
it out anytime you know we move around
we're working yada-yada this is nice
doing a little bit of this a little bit
of that say we want to work on this
object right here we're gonna go ahead
and hit home and all of those other
viewports are going to snap to this
object except this one where we locked
so basically locking a viewport does
exactly like well it's pretty
self-explanatory
it takes a view and it locks into place
and allows you to work with models and
different views while keeping that same
view self-explanatory alright so now
with that being said let me switch over
to lit mode and let me go ahead and this
is kind of a nice view from up here
actually now let me talk to you guys
about camera speed and that's this
button right here again I know I'm
skipping these but level streaming and
post-process volume previs our different
topics we're not even anywhere near that
advanced topic yet so let me talk to you
guys about camera speed camera movement
speed is this little container I guess
it's a container of water again this
real-time and the icon for camera
movement speed I don't know who's
designing the icons for these but it's
like I think this is your first job and
probably their last because they make no
sense to me
so this jug of water basically goes from
empty to all the way full and when it's
all the way full your camera is moving
fastest so for example you see where my
camera is right now say for example I
wanted to work on this dome so I needed
to move my camera over there so go ahead
hold down your left button and scroll up
okay scroll up and scroll up you know
what it's gonna take like an hour and a
half for me to get over to this dome so
what I want to do is I want to increase
the camera speed now check it out
whenever I'm slow I got over there like
half a second so that's basically what
camera speed allows you to do if we go
ahead and have our jug of water empty
whenever we scroll our mouse moves
really slow and our camera is moving
really slow whenever we have this all
the way to the top it moves really fast
I usually like to keep it somewhere
either there or there like halfway or
three-quarters full and by the way
answer this is the glass half full or
half empty
hmm I'll let you decide but right here
it's definitely all the way full so
that's what camera movement does and the
last thing I want to talk to you guys
about is probably the easiest thing and
that's terrif loading copy and basically
well just click it and you're gonna see
what happens and basically it takes this
window or view and it tears it off in a
new window again there's nothing else
even to explain than that that's all it
does and you know that's all I have to
say about that
I guess that's all I have to say about
that that's my Forrest Gump impression
pretty bad Forrest Gump impression but
well there it is so anyways there you go
that's all I have to cover for this
whatever your heck it's called a
viewport toolbar
and again these things I didn't cover
yet we're gonna be covering those just I
gotta teach you guys some techniques
before we you know jump into the level
streaming and stuff like that so now
that we have that covered you're ready
to move on to our next topic what it is
I don't know yet because I don't have a
tutorial outline but trust me whatever
it is it's gonna be awesome so thank you
guys for watching and I'll see you guys
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
