better is to create your own mass paths
and when it reveals its going to reveal
the way that you drew your mask path so
like not what I wanted to do I have the
wrong thing clicked on I'm just gonna
delete out the old one old outlines so
here we go we got this now you want to
draw in here and it doesn't have to be
exactly perfect because we can adjust
our brush size to be able to write these
on so there's one and then click off and
then click back on to get a new mask
I never drew my A's like this so I
wonder what the best way is maybe like
this
there we go for that one
so I'm gonna finish out making these
masks real quick I'll show you what they
look like and then I'll show you how to
use the right on how to use the stroke
to write on the letters so I'm going to
pause it and see you guys in a second
all right so now I'm back and I have my
masks in there and I drew them the way
that I think I draw the letters now I'm
going to apply my effect onto here
generate stroke and if you don't if you
want to get quickly to where your effect
is it'll always have the last effect up
here you can click on that and it'll do
the same thing so now I'm gonna check
all masks and I'm gonna hit a stroke
sequentially so it's going to make your
masks make your strokes in the way and
reveal your masks in the way that you
drew them now what's it change the color
to whatever we want which is just do
this blue we need to increase our brush
size so that it covers up all of the
letter and we may need to adjust some of
our masks so that they cover all the
letter up
this one might need and another might
need to add in more points it might
happen
just change it up like that there we go
this essay needs to know more points
now the mask or the brush size doesn't
have to look perfect on these
oops I know why it's doing that
don't want to do that
you just want to if you just want to
just select them to move them move them
around and you don't need to add any
more points just use your selection tool
and it looks like pretty much
everything's covered up so there we go
we got that now if we come to reveal
original image we ran it back here now
you can see how it's it's going to work
a little better so and let's keyframe it
and I'll turn off my masks and now we
can RAM preview it
and you be able to work if I click on it
so now it's rendered out I don't know
why it was giving me such a problem but
here we go
so that's how that works you can see
there might be a couple there might be
some problems with extra line showing
you just have to adjust your mass so it
looks nice but that's how you write on
letters with the stroke so I mean that's
the last thing that I want to show you
that's a offered for this tutorial
thanks for watching this one and
hopefully you can use your stroke like a
boss now and just impress the heck out
of your clients so I want to thank you
guys for watching again and see you in
the next tutorial which is going to be
awesome
- see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
