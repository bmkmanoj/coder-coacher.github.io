tutorial and robotics and electronics
and in this tutorial I'm going to be
teaching you guys how to build our first
circuit now what we need to build this
is pretty much all the components that
we learned so far battery which is going
to provide the power our resistor which
is going to resist some of the electric
current led which you guys can't see any
of these components because they're
really small but they're there and of
course to hook everything up you need
alligator clips now I choose red for
positive black for negative and we need
another one that's not any of those
colors in between the colors don't
matter butters is just easier to tow so
now that you have alligator clips
battery resistor and LED light we're
ready to start building our circuit all
right guys the first thing we need is
our power supply and that's our 9 volt
battery so go ahead and get that out and
the next thing we want to do is hook up
our alligator clips to the positive and
negative ends of the battery so go ahead
and take your red alligator clip and
I'll get up to the positive end of your
battery or positive terminal let's put
that aside for now go ahead and grab
your black alligator clip and hook it up
to the negative side of your terminal
now what we want to do next is hook up
our resistor now we want the electric
current to pass through our resistor
before it passes through the LED light
so I can protect all the current from
going to our LED light since if all the
current goes directly to the light it'll
blow it so that's why we need this
resistor to hook up first to protect our
LED light so go ahead and clip that to
one side of your alligator clip or
excuse me the red alligator clip next
grab the white alligator clip and yours
can be any color I'm just choosing white
because it's easy to see on this black
table hook it up to the other end of
your resistor just like this now that we
have our resistor hooked up we can now
plug in our LED light now remember
unlike a resistor
it does matter what end you plug in your
LED light and remember the positive end
or the anode is the longer side so that
side right there that's longer so the
longer side you want to hook up to the
positive end of your battery in the
shorter side you want to hook up to the
negative or L so it won't work so since
our positive current is coming through
the white one right now let's go ahead
and hook that up to our longer side and
now once I hook up this black we should
have a full circuit so let me hook this
up and I don't know if you guys can see
or not let me try to bring a little
closer but whenever I touch this we now
have a LED that lights up it might be
hard to see let me try to bring it a
little bit closer and that is our first
whole circuit so let me zoom out and
I'll show you guys what this looks like
overall so this ladies and gentlemen is
our very first circuit again to recap
one more time we have our power supply
we have a pipeline pretty much just
leading to our first resistor and this
is a resistor right here that protects
the LED light we have another clip
leading to the LED light that's turned
on right here although I don't know if
you can tell her or not and then we have
our last one leaving leading to the
negative end of the battery thus
completing the circuit so this is our
very first circuit of many we will be
building so thank you guys for watching
make sure to subscribe and don't forget
to check out the next tutorial and I
will see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
