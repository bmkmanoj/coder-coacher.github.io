Photoshop cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackbird today
we're gonna go over the brightness and
contrast adjustment and I wanted to go
over like a little disclaimer first
before I go over this because brightness
and contrast performs a linear
adjustment to your image and images are
not usually linear so what this means is
that when you move the slider it's going
to move the brightness every single
pixel is going to get brighter instead
of moving like the bright pixel is a
little less than the darker pixels and
things like that so this brightness and
contrast isn't really recommended a lot
on images but it's good for things like
clipart
text and other images that aren't really
photographic but I'm gonna show you how
it works on an image and then I'm gonna
show you why you might want to use it on
like non image so let's get started now
let's pull up an image let's go to image
up here adjustments and brightness and
contrast is on the top now it's a small
change or it's a small menu here got
brightness contrast and we've got used
legacy you know they use legacy checkbox
if you're wondering that changes it to
the cs2 style of brightness contrast so
let's go ahead and just address the
brightness and you can see that
everything is getting brighter and if we
go to the left everything gets a little
darker and if you go too far everything
gets all shitty looking so don't go too
far now if you do like a little a couple
smaller changes or something like that
that's not that bad I wouldn't recommend
using this as your main color correction
though it would be a better idea to use
like curves or something like that now
we've got contrast here and if you go
the left things are gonna get a less
trusty and if you go to the right things
are gonna get more contrast II and if
you've seen like some of the people who
make their images really contrast II
they start looking like this this is
probably how they did it and to be
honest this is kind of like a new way to
do it yes and OB that kind of new but so
don't do it this way and use your curves
to increase contrast and things like
that so here we go well put that back to
zero and now I'm gonna show you how the
legacy is different so if I click on use
legacy and I increase the contrast you
can see how it goes a little crazy and
this is the cs2 version and neat and you
can go left and it puts it all the way
to gray so that's what how the legacy
works on that and on the brightness you
can see that honestly I think the legacy
version is worse that's probably why
they changed it but there's still people
that are still used to this kind of
stuff so they use legacy because they
don't like change make sure you guys are
changing with the times and stuff like
that or else it gets stuck in old old
like trends and stuff like that that I'm
very popular and you get behind so
change is good when you're trying to
learn new things now a cool trick that I
like about with brightness/contrast
after you start moving your stuff here
and you don't feel like moving these
back to zero or typing them back in if
you hold alt your cancel button turns
into a reset button you can just click
that and it brings it all to zero so
that's all there is really to brightness
and contrast not really much more to go
over but just remembered oh yeah yeah I
know what I was gonna do I was going to
show you on a regular image non image I
mean so let's cancel this let's go to
our close game here and here's a color
scheme that I've got and what I would do
with this is put it on top of like my
Photoshop canvas as a layer and then
we can use my color picker here to like
pick from it if I really if I really
needed to oh and then create swatches or
something like that
but what if your client looks at these
colors and he's like yeah I don't really
like these colors make them all brighter
well the quick way to do that brightness
and contrast so image adjustments
pregnant rests so let's make these a
little brighter now you got completely
different colors here so here's what it
used to be here's what it is now so this
is more of a brighter type so that's a
way that you would want to use that on
these on like a non image kind of image
so this is just like a JPEG or something
like that yeah so no that's all I wanted
to go over so thanks for watching this
one and continue to watch we're gonna go
over hue and saturation in the next
tutorial and I really like using hue and
saturation it's pretty cool so see you
guys in that one have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
