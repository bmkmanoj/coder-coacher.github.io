we create it Xcode is automatically
going to make a bunch of files for us
and these are pretty much two default
files and if all of this looks a little
overwhelming at first I want to give you
guys like the real quick two second
tutorial by the way let me go on a
little rant right here
whenever I'm like reading about a new
piece of software or some new
programming language like five chapters
in the beginning of every book they go
through the interface naraka okay let me
talk to you about all the stuff in
detail and you know launch images source
and this is where that is and this is
where you can get embedded I'm like I
don't even know what this crap is yet so
you're like wasting my time and
overwhelming me so I decided not to do
that instead what I'm going to do is I'm
just going to talk a little bit about it
right now so you guys know where the
basics of everything are and then later
on when we need them I'm going to show
you guys in detail how to access
everything I think that'll be a lot
better so let's start at the very top
left corner of course we know that these
are just the close and minimize your
windows and stuff this is to run your
project so right now this is a really
it's a really dumb app if you just ran
on a device right now you just see a a
white screen with nothing on it so
pretty dumb but I mean that's what we
started out with the basics so you can
run it if you want go ahead this is how
you stop it and this right here what you
can do is you can actually choose a
little simulator to run on your phone
and for these tutorials on prep is going
to be sticking with iPhone 5 that's a
pretty pretty popular iPhone so I think
I'll go with that simulator but
eventually when you develop a full
working iOS app and you want to you know
you're ready to put it in the App Store
then what you want to do is you probably
want to test it on all of these
simulators to make sure that it's going
to look good on every device but for
these tutorials you can just choose one
of the iPhones 4 5 6 it doesn't really
matter
all right so now this white bar in the
model in the middle right here is called
the activity view and it's just a little
indicator a quick little status message
about what you're currently working on
and some other messages too so that's
what that is
these right here are just well actually
all of these buttons right here are just
ways that you can change your layout if
you ever see that this main section
looks kind of weird then it means you're
probably in this Venn diagram looking
one so make sure that you show this one
this is the standard editor with the
three lines and I'll show you guys with
these to do in a little bit in this is
actually a pretty cool way to
essentially like view your project and
split-screen and stuff like that but
anyways skipping over that not really
important right now
however these buttons you will find
important or useful immediately because
what they do is they toggle these panels
on and off for example this thing to the
left is just a little file navigator to
look at all the files that you have in
your project however you you don't
really need to see this all the time and
you may want to put some I don't know
just put some more focus into this main
area so what you can do is you can
actually click this to show it or hide
it in other words toggling it on and off
so that's what that is and of course the
bottom one and the right one as well and
also if I'm ever like ok go to your file
navigator and you're like um where the
heck is it it's this button right here
so that's what those do they come in
handy a lot so moving over here
the file Navigator of course is where
all of your files are for your project
and I'm going to be talking to you guys
about what all these files are and how
they tie into your bigger project for
right now the ones we're going to be
working with is this the main storyboard
and just like a real two second one the
main storyboard is pretty much the
overall design or the interface where
you're going to be like dragging all the
buttons and so
like that and the viewcontroller is kind
of like the brains behind everything
this will launch screen is whenever you
first open the app and liked a little
while launch screen that's that's a
pretty good name for it I guess so yeah
see so all these files we're going to be
talking about in detail but for right
now you just click on main storyboard
that's probably the most exciting one so
well so we got to do all of this stuff
in the main area is actually dependent
on what file you have open
so again if you click on like some
coding file then it's going to be a code
editor if you click on the main
storyboard then you're going to have
this thing called the interface builder
and you can drag around that so there is
the two-second tutorial and in the next
video what I want to do is I want to
start talking to guys about this
interface builder in a little more
detail because right now we have a blank
app and it is the most boring app that
I've ever seen in my entire life so in
the next tutorial we're going to drop
some items on here and spice it up a
little bit and I'll show you guys how to
lay everything out and well start making
our app look a little bit cooler but for
now think guys for watching and well
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
