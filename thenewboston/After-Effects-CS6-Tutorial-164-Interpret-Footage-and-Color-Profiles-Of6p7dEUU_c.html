Effects cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and I'm
going to go over a little bit more about
color management and try to explain it a
little bit more in this tutorial so the
way I'm going to explain it this time is
by talking about the images or videos
that you want to import and show you how
the color management system works with
those so right now I have gone to well
let's set it up from the beginning for
you guys let's go into file and then
we'll go to project settings and if we
come down to the color settings I have
this set right now for 32 bits per
channel and I changed my working space
to HDTV rec.709 and I hit OK now when
you come over and check out the images
and things you get this section here
that says profile and this one says
profile srgb and then this whole bunch
of letters and numbers and what this
profile means is when someone takes a
picture and gives it to you it usually
has an embedded profile within it
depending on what your camera settings
are or what you had on what the default
is on your camera so this picture I
picked off off the internet and I just
saved it to my computer now if you
remember or watch the last tutorial when
you save an image from the computer or
you're using images for web you want to
use this actual profile or this
workspace as RGB that's a default for a
web-based
projects now if I come down to something
that I took off from my phone like I
think this one you see if I can find one
here we go where was it
there it is it has a profile of c2 now
I'm not too sure with c2 means but that
is the profile and a head and some of
these have different profiles this
graffiti one that we took let me bring
it up for you so you can see so you
don't have to like look at these small
pictures but there's this graffiti
looking picture that I actually took
from a actual camera it was from a canon
camera and this was on a wall at a bar
that we went to and I just took a
picture of it goes as bright and cool
and then I saved it later after saving
it from the camera RAW into a JPEG out
of probably Photoshop I probably used
and it gave it the Adobe RGB 1998
profile now I want to show you how you
can actually change profiles if you
would like to fit different like profile
types of your actual project so we've
got our project here that's a HDTV and I
would set HDTV if I want to work in HD
for like putting this picture on to a TV
so I'm going to zoom in on this you can
come down to your image in your project
panel and my image right here is the
Kornfield dot jpg that jpg and we come
down to this button down here interpret
footage you click on it and it brings
you to this interpret footage of menu
here if we come over to the color
management tab we can check our change
our profile that's going on
now we've got the profile that's already
embedded in it which is srgb and we can
click preserve RGB which will allow you
not to change the assign of profile to
it or we can assign one of those
profiles that we had found before and
these profiles get based off of what
your project is so if I change the color
space that's what these profiles do they
change like the different color space
that's within the image for example
prophoto RGB here has the moat one of
the most color spaces out of anything
and it has colors that like any monitor
can't even use yet so if I click on that
it's going to change how the color space
is now if someone hands you a video some
video footage or an image and let you
know what they used for their profile
then this is how you can come in and
change that so I mean this is DHCD v1
for our profile so we want to come down
to HDTV here and use that and this is
the probable color space that we're
going to use that looks nicest on HDTV
now if you're using like what's change
up what's change everything up here okay
and we'll change up this to the the
project settings to the srgb here this
is for web hit ok and now I can come
back into the interpret footage and I'll
be able to change it back to the srgb
colors right here and that's how you
like match up your images to your
workspace if you're deciding to use that
so you want to check out this profile up
here to see what's going on and
has been assigned already and pretty
much assign your images and video to
what it's going to be most of the time
your images will be correct and
sometimes your video will be correct but
a lot of the time the video isn't going
to be correct so we've got some HDTV
video on here already and this is the
different color space here and then
we've got some NTSC video so it looks
like most of these videos have been are
correct
I downloaded a this lion one here I
downloaded that off the off the web from
like a website so that's came in the web
image our web profile there so I mean
that's why it's the srgb and hopefully
you guys hopefully this is making sense
to you guys this is probably one of the
harder things I've tried to teach is the
color management but because we haven't
like gone over anything before this that
kind of makes a whole lot of sense with
the color management and sometimes you
don't even need to mess with the color
management to even like have a
nice-looking video or anything like that
I think I've only messed with the color
management a handful of times and that's
when people hand me really nice footage
like DP X's or or red camera footage and
things like that so just keep that in
mind this is called interpret footage
and all we went over this time was the
footage for the color management section
now let me just open up the like
something like here's a DP X and this
says trillions of colors and I can bring
that in and I mean we've got
if we don't check to preserve our GB
we've got a bunch of different types of
film I don't know different types of
profiles that are using that are
different from the one in the cornfield
so let me just bring that up real quick
so you can see that I'll bring this down
into our composition and that's fine
where it is right now we can use that to
see what's the color differences will be
I don't need to scale down or anything
like that let's interpret the footage
and uncheck preserve RGB so we can check
this we've got our assigned profile here
and if I click on show all available
then we get all these other ones that
are going on instead of the ones that I
was just showing us so you want to
figure out what they have their camera
setting on and set it to that so what if
I change it to sd it didn't change too
much if I change it to one of these down
here it definitely will change though so
there's a different type of color there
on that that's a all these have
different like looks to them there's a
tungsten so just to make sure the person
you know what the person that was using
that shot the the video make sure you
know what they were using if you need to
if they don't say anything then don't
usually have to worry about it
so just letting you know that we've got
the cine on settings here which is just
the definitely the range going on here
if you mess with you shouldn't need to
mess with these too much and we'll go
over these at all at a later time
because this is like way advanced and
everything like that so we'll go over
those when we get into the more advanced
tutorials this right now this color
management everything is definitely Ford
it's like an advanced tutorial
but I'm not describing every single
thing of it so I'm kind of keeping it at
like an intermediate pace for the
tutorial so you get you get the basic
idea of what's going on with color
management without going into too much
detail and confusing you until we start
learning more stuff so thanks for
watching this tutorial and hopefully it
made sense and you understand it I'd
like to thank you guys for watching all
the tutorials up to this point so far
even if you only just watched a few
that's cool thanks for watching
everybody have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
