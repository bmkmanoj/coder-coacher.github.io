another PI game tutorial video from
youtube.com slash ascent decks for Bucky
in the new Boston where we left off
we've got this fire shell right now it
actually doesn't fire it just prints
fire we want to watching that Montana
fire or something so the first things
that we need to do is we have a decent
XY that's okay we also want to know the
position of the tank and the current
turret position so let's go ahead and
scroll down to the game loop and where
we have fire shell we have the parameter
of gun we're gonna add a few more
parameters to this function
so I say gun and then what are the
parameters do we need we want what we
want main tank X and main tank y in a
current position so we use those for now
and now we're going to come up to our
actual fire shell function I'm not in
the window there we go here it is and we
have basically the starting information
that we want so we've got X Y and then
we want to add in tank X and then we'll
say tank Y an interposition for now so
once we have that stuff now we're ready
to actually fire the cannon so how do we
actually fire the cannon so a tip you
know a real basic quadratic equation is
something like y equals x squared or you
got there's even more like you've got a
X plus B x squared or something and then
plus something else right we're not
gonna need to do something too crazy
like that and the reason why a X y
equals you know x squared works is
because X eventually it goes into the
negatives whereas our X will not go into
the negative so there's a few things
that we could do we can subtract half of
the display width and that would kind of
impose a pseudo negativity for X right
in the middle
but the problem with that is we'd want
to know well we have to know where the
tank X tank y is in relation to the
entire screen in relation to the power
so we'd have to like shift the center
point based on the power of the shot you
know all this stuff it would not really
it wouldn't be the best and it would
probably not work anywhere near as
intended so this sort of thing is
definitely complex and so we want to
keep it as simple as possible and when
we're writing it but we want it to also
look and kind of feel to the user like
it's you know because we do want to have
power of the gun and we do want angle to
matter and all that and we don't want it
too stark in the center and like a weird
way that wasn't expected so so we're
going to use a kind of rendition of the
quadratic equation and we'll say wow
fire and then you know we can have an
event loop just to have one just in case
the user wants to do something and stuff
and we're also going to need to display
the update and all that so we'll just go
ahead and say for event in PI game dot
event dot yet and there was just a if
event dot type equals PI game dot all
caps quit then we're going to just run
my game dot all caps quit actually it's
not playing to quit in any quit and
that's our little event loop otherwise
let's go ahead and print out just for
debugging purposes we're gonna print
starting show zero and then we'll print
out starting show one so we're putting
out the x and y coordinates of our
starting show subsequently we want to
actually draw the show so packing dot
draw diet circle where do we want to
draw that it's gonna be on the game
display what color do we want it let's
go ahead and make it red it's a hot show
and then where are we drawing it if you
call with a circle it's XY then radius
so in right XY the center point so the
center point of this is just going to be
starting shell 0 n1 so I'm just gonna
copy this make sure you copy and paste
like the full tuple right so copy that
actually we already started a tuple so
whatever anyway paste so now we've got
the center of the circle and then the
shell width I'm just going to take five
but for now so now we're drawing that
circle then what would we do to make
this shall actually move well we need to
shift the acts of the shell over so we
couldn't we could just do starting shall
0 and then we could say minus equals
because to make the show go left
we're actually subtracting from X so we
just say minus equals 5 done and then
then we can just ask if well actually
let's just go ahead and do a PI game dot
displayed update and then we'll do clock
tick and for this one we'll make this
sequence go by 100 frames a second it
should be basic enough and easy enough
to make it go that fast so let's go
ahead and save it on that and see where
we stand so welcome to tanks we're gonna
hit play we'll shoot it I've got a two
minus equals five
let's see ok alright so we made a slight
error here so when we're passing through
the X&amp;amp;Y this is it this is a tuple and
you can't modify tuples so my mistake
there so what we want to do is we're
gonna say we're just gonna quickly
convert this to a bit of a list I don't
think we can let's try to list and I
think we'll get away with that well
let's just try that really quick before
we do a separate method
yeah - but object has no and then
finally let me try one more method list
XY there we go got away with that one so
that's cool so let's go ahead and show
this so that works to convert it and now
we are actually shooting a show let's
make this five frames a second now so it
doesn't go off our screen as fast as it
did so we'll hit play and then we can
shoot and you can see our shell at least
starts at the gun point right but it's
just going in a straight line so now we
have to modify why does that'll give it
some height and then take away from the
height and all that so we're going to
talk about that that's going to be a
little bit more of a confusing topic so
we'll talk about that one always say
also the barrier just disappears we'll
talk about that too don't worry
but for now this will work we'll just
leave this here so that is though why we
have tank accent angle I just so yeah I
think what we'll do we'll cover that the
function for Y in the next video it's a
fairly long function that will stand to
need some explanation so that's what
we're doing in the next video so stay
tuned for that as always thanks for
