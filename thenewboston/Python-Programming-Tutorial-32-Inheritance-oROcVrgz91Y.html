can see by the title I want to start
talking to you guys about inheritance a
very important concept in computer
programming especially with
object-oriented programming so you're
going to be coming across that a lot so
before I even get started talking about
computer programming let's just talk
about inheritance in real life what does
it mean well I mean you can inherit like
um like specific genes from your parents
so I inherited on my dad's eyes I
inherited my mom's nose and what that
pretty much means is she passed those
traits on to me whenever they you know
made me as a baby
and also there's another type of
inheritance like when um I don't know
like if your grandpa dies and you
inherited his land it pretty much means
that he gave his land to you
so inheritance basically means getting
something from someone else that's the
most simple definition so what the heck
could have mean in computer programming
let's go ahead and make two classes
we're going to make one class that's a
parent and we're going to make another
class that's a child and I'll show you
guys how the child can inherit or get
stuff from the parent so of course they
don't have any land they don't have I
color so let's go ahead and make some
functions that they can inherit so what
would on the parent do say print last
name so of course this just looks like a
normal class right now in my parents
last name is the same of mine of course
so Roberts so right now this parent
doesn't have any cool land doesn't have
a million dollars leave me all it has
this is lonely old function so I'm going
to make another class right here and I'm
going to name it child and just like
before we can start building functions
but check this out
if you're wondering why do you have
these empty parentheses right here well
in side these parentheses what you can
pretty much type is the name of a class
that you want to inherit from
so whenever I typed parent inside here
what I'm telling Python is okay look for
a parent class get everything inside
that class then right now it's pretty
boring just one function and pretty much
pass it on to your child so right now
even though it looks like this child
class is empty it actually has in other
words it actually just inherited this
print last name function so let's go
ahead and make one normal function in
the child class
I'll go umm print first name and this
will just be um it'll just be a normal
function that belongs to the child and
it will just print out my first name
which is buggy so check this out right
now it looks like there's one function
and parent and one function and child
but that's not actually how Python sees
it well Python sees is this one function
parent and since this child inherited
everything from the parent it actually
has print last name and print first-name
don't believe me I wouldn't either
because I lie about stuff a lot but in
this case I am telling the true so I'll
make a function or excuse me an object
called Buckey and it's going to be long
to that child class now check this out
if I put Buckey come on you're stupid
freaking carpal tunnel glove I can do
print first name and we already know
that because the function is right in
that class but did you know I can also
do print last name and check this out
I'm going to run it and it's going to
print Bucky which is just a normal
function and also Roberts which is a
function that it inherited from the
parent so that's the basics the very
basics of inheritance pretty much saying
okay what class do you want to get stuff
from so pretty much doesn't literally do
this but goes that class copies
everything and paste it right in child
simple enough guys understand it good
because now I'm going to talk to you
guys about something that's a little bit
more advanced a little bit more
confusing so right now we have print
lastname basically as a child function
that it inherited now what we can also
do is we can also have the option of
overriding overriding wow that's a for
some reason hard for me to say the child
can override that function so what we
can do is this def print last name and
also I'll just like I don't know make
this print something called schnitzel
burg so I got to tell you guys a story
real quick because I don't have a
therapist and I've been meaning telling
this for a long time to get it off my
chest
but basically whenever my parents had me
they put Roberts on the birth
certificate and that was my last name
for a while growing up Roberts
Bucky Roberts in high school however arm
I found out that my mom was actually a
monkey and I was embarrassed about it so
I ran away from home I joined the circus
and I changed my last name to schnitzel
burg so even though I inherited the name
Roberts later on in life I decided to
over ride it to schnitzel burg so this
is also an option in Python so check
this out
even though I inherited this function to
begin with I have the option of
overriding it and basically in order to
do that you create a same function with
the same exact name and what this says
is okay we're practically going to
replace this with whatever you decided
to do here so that is a little story
about my life and that is also how you
can inherit something but you have the
choice overriding it or if you don't you
can just use the normal function as well
so now you guys understand in the next
tutorial I'm going to talk to you guys
about multi
full inheritance so we get even more
complex but it's actually going to be a
pretty cool maybe I'll think of another
fake story to tell you guys but for now
then guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
