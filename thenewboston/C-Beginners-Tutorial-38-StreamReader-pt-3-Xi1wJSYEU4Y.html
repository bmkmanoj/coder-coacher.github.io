tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial on the
continued showing you how to use the
streaming reader class so all you're
going to need for this tutorial is a
button and on your button one click make
sure you create a new Open File dialog
and then once it shows that dialog just
make sure that it checks to see if the
user actually does in fact select a file
and open it in the Open File dialog and
then if the user does open the file I'm
just have a new screen reader be created
off that file so that you can read the
file that the user opens alright and
make sure that you're using the system
dot IO namespace so that we have access
to the stream leader class review
alright so in this tutorial we're going
to be looking at a peek method so we're
just going to do right here SR for our
stream reader class dot P and the peek
method is very similar to the read
method so basically what it will do is
it will just read a character at the
position and the only difference really
is though it doesn't advance the
position at all so if we were to use the
read method though so I saw dot read
what it will do is it will advance the
position by one so the peek method what
it will be right here is it will just
read the character and then it won't
change the position although but then
here when it does the read method it
will advance the position by once in
sitrep one character so let's just say
the position right here with 0 so we
just say 0 and then after this one read
though it'll change it to 1 alright and
if you even hover your mouse over the
read method right here I said to read
the next character from the input stream
and advance in the character position by
one character alright and let's just go
ahead and see what this looks like here
so it's going to set this equal to a
character so you say character C equals
and then s r dot peek but since this
peek method returns an integer we're
gonna have to convert it into a
character now there's only one way to do
this and that's just use casting so
we're just have to put in parentheses
for this character right there and
basically what this will do is just
convert it into a character but don't
worry about
this right now if you don't understand
it it's just basically a way of
converting it we're going to get into
that in a later tutorial all right and
we're going to want to do the same thing
for this Reid method right here so
dismiss a character c1 equals and we're
going to have to convert it into a
character sort is going to say character
like that and again don't worry about
this basically just to Virts whatever
this reads into a character alright so
after this reads right here it says the
position is 0 but then after this reads
right here it says the position is 1 so
then if we were to go ahead and read
again read another character um it would
be a different character so since these
are both reading at the same position
they should be the same characters so C
and C 1 should be equal but if we were
to go ahead and leave another character
after this it would be a different
character than B would be the one after
on these two so I'd be the one at
position 1 so let's just go ahead right
here and see what happens so these
character C 2 equals and then s our read
and then we're just going to convert
this obviously into a character so I'm
going to say character all right so
right off the bat the position is 0 and
after this reads the position is still 0
but after this reads it changes it
changes the position to 1 so these two
are both reading at the exact same
position so they're always going to be
the same character but this one is
reading at position 1 so it's going to
be a different character than these two
and let's just go ahead and make sure
that this works right here we're just
going to say message box show and we're
just going to say it's right in a line
right here we're just going to say we
got to string and then following that
we're just going to put C 1 and so on
but in between each one I'm just going
to put colon so it's easier to read now
we're going to do C 1 about your string
followed by a colon so that we can can
read it easier and then we're just going
to do C 2 after that all right so let's
just go ahead and make sure that this
works right here is debug and click our
button to open the Open File dialog
select this file
right here and as you can see yep these
are two of the exact same characters so
right at position zero read this and
then sense this peak map that doesn't
change the position this method read at
the exact same position so these are
both reading the exact same character
and that's why they're the same but this
one read at position one so it's
obviously a different character and if
we were to look at the file on hxd we
see it just as Adam so these two both
read a position 1 or 0 actually and then
this one though
write a position 1 so a regular key
alright so that's pretty much it for
this tutorial on using a peak method so
see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
