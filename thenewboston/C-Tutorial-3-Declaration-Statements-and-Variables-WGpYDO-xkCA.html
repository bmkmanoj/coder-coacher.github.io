C++ tutorial and in this tutorial we're
going to be going over declaration
statements and variables now what
variable is if you never programmed
before is it is just a placeholder for
something else so as you can see we have
our old statements from tutorial two
here so let's go ahead and delete all
these C out ones
so now that we're just using the
namespace the system and the return so
let's go ahead and the first thing we
need to do when we use a variable is
declare that variable and this tells c++
what kind of variable we're using in
this case we want to use a number or
integer so we put int and then we need a
name for our variable and I'm going to
name my number so again we're using
integer variable and it's going to be
called my number and since this is a
statement you need to end it with a
semicolon
the next thing you want to do is give a
value to my number we told C++ that
we're going to be using a variable
called my number but now it doesn't have
a value so to do this it's really easy
just type in your variable which is my
number and set it equal to any number
you want I'll set it equal to 20 because
20 is my favorite number
and next let's tighten this up a little
bit so the next thing we want to do is
output this variable on the screen and
let me show you what this looks like
let me just output a basic output my
number is in whoops
for my semicolon and on the next line
I'll put the variable my number and let
me just show you guys one thing that you
may not have noticed anytime you're
working with a string of text which is
just a letters or a sentence they need
to be in quotation marks but anytime you
use a variable such as my number which
has the value of 20 it doesn't need to
be in quotation marks if you put
quotation marks around it like this it
would read my number is my number but we
don't want that we want to read my
number is and I'll have the value of 20
so let's save this compile and run
checking for errors
as you can see it says my number is 20
not change that and as you can see we
deal if we want to change that we don't
need to change it down here all we need
to do is change it up there say 254 and
save it
execute compile and run and as you can
see now it says my number is 54 so this
is one of the ways where you could type
a bunch of code and if you had this
variable used say a hundred times
instead of going through one by one by
one by one and changing every number you
can just make a variable change it one
time at the top and I'll change it for
every instance and this is really useful
when you build large applications and
you need to use the same variable many
times so next time in my next tutorial
I'm going to be talking a little more
about more variables so I hope you learn
something right now so study this learn
your basics and variables and make sure
