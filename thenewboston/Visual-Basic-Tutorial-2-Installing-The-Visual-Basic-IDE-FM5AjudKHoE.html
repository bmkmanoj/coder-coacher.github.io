visual basic tutorial in this tutorial
I'm going to be covering how to install
the Visual Basic 2010 Express IDE now
let's head on over to Google and we'll
just search Visual Basic 2010 and you
can see the first thing that comes up is
microsoft.com slash expressed slash
downloads we're going to go ahead and
click that now here's the downloads page
we're going to come over here to Visual
Basic 2010 Express just click on that
and select the language that you're
going to be using I'm going to be using
English so go ahead and click Save and
now open it up it'll ask you to allow to
make changes just click yes it will
extract the files it'll take a little
bit to set up the installation
components and when you're installing
this you may need to install the.net
framework 4.0 and if that is the case
it'll take a little bit longer than
it'll take me so let's just wait for
this to finish it'll take a second here
okay here's our setup window let's get
this out of the way okay we're going to
you can choose whatever you want to do
with the SES and information about my
static setup experience to Microsoft
obviously that checked is yes then click
Next yeah nobody ever reads names anyway
click Next and it says that all we need
to install is Visual Basic now you may
need to install the.net framework as I
said and total download size 54
megabytes so let's go ahead and install
this now I'm going to go ahead and pause
the video here and I'll come back once
it's done and ok ok you can see the
download is almost finished now it will
start installing the Visual Basic IDE so
we'll just go ahead and let that run and
I'm going to pause here and come back
once it's finished with that that's
finished you should see a window like
this now I'll just go ahead and click
exit and now if we wait for this come
down here to your Start menu I know you
can't see it but uh
you can open up visual basic 2010
Express and mine says this product is

just if you're just installing this for
the first time what you'll need to do is
anything to go up to help and register

just give them your email and like your
name and what you're interested in
developing and then they'll give you a
