tutorial and in this tutorial i will be
teaching you guys how to add checkboxes
to your GUI and yes it's going to be
awesome so pay attention
so I already got my imports right there
if you want to copy those go ahead but
I'm going to go ahead and minimize that
right now so if we need a copy and pause
your screen but if not see you later
they're annoying me so now I already
made this class called GUI and it
extends jframe like before but I got rid
of everything in the class so now I can
go ahead and start well pretty much
making everything again so in this
program we're going to build three
variables one's going to be a textbox
with a sentence in it and we're going to
have two check boxes underneath one that
says bold and one that says italicize
and whenever we could click bold it's
going to bold the text and whenever we
click italics it's going to italicize
the text so we need three private
variables so name private J text field
and this is going to hold the text and
we're going to name this TF for text
field and we need two more private J
check box make sure ispotter eight don't
want to spelt like the Czech Republic
check box and we'll just name this like
bold box because this one's going to be
the one in bold and private and it's
going to be another check box why did I
just not copy and paste that and this is
going to be like a talaq box or
something like that
so now we have three variables that are
going to hold the text field the bold
box in the check box once the text field
to our check boxes so now let's go ahead
and well I guess we can go ahead and
build our constructor now so public GUI
and doesn't take any parameters of
course and let's just go ahead and first
thing add the title of course super just
put like the title and the next thing we
need to layout set layout and or up just
a future heads-up Ruby actually going
over how to make custom layout
in and a couple tutorials but for now
we'll just go with the default because
you know works pretty good so new flow
layout will give us the default layout
and now we can go ahead and start adding
stuff to the screen so that text field
we want to set equal to nu J text field
and as our parameters the first one is
just right this is a sentence or
something like that
with the size of 20 and that pretty much
gives us a text field in the TF variable
and now let's just go ahead and we can
do stuff to that text field now the
first thing that we want to do is pretty
much set font to it so let's just go
ahead and set font like just make it
actually do this to put new font there
we go
and as your parameters put serif and
don't put anything else because Java
only accepts um a couple weird one so
font plain and plain means like not not
bold and not italicize or anything in
the size of 14 so that's how you set the
font you set the font with new font
method and it takes serif and make sure
it's safe because I know for a fact that
serif no matter what version of Java or
what platform you're running on it's
going to show up so make sure you do it
serif just like that and now that we got
a text box with it says this is a
sentence we pretty much have all the
text now all we have to do is add it to
the screen so add TF I mean it would be
a waste if we created all that and we
didn't even add the screen so now we got
that text field right there now we can
go ahead and make our two little check
boxes to add the screen underneath it so
let's go ahead and make bold box or
whatever you name your variable and
let's go ahead and set this equal to nu
J check box just like that and the
parameters it takes any time you make a
check box there's going to be a little
thing to the right-hand side of it or
else you're not going to know what the
heck it does so it's like a little
prompt to tell you what this tech box
does or a check box does I'm just going
to say bold because I mean you don't
need any more instructions than that
and let's go ahead and do the skin with
the italic box so copy this because
we're lazy and paste it and italic box I
think that's what I named it yep and put
italics or italicize or something like
that and now let's go ahead and add both
of these this screen add full box to the
screen and add we scroll down a little
bit there we go right there
add italic box to the screen there we go
so now we have pretty much three things
on the screen a text field and two check
boxes underneath it the thing is they're
just chillin on the screen right now not
really doing anything so what we need to
do is add some functionality to it so
just like before we're going to create a
new class called handler class and we're
going to name the object Handler and set
it equal to new handler class just like
that and even though we didn't create
that class yet
we're going to use it later on so now
let's go ahead and add an item listener
for it so bold
I'll go to in bold box dot add item whoa
whoa whoa I did not mean it like that
add item listener and what are we going
to add it takes an object as its
parameter so let's just add handler so
now let's do the same thing actually
copy and paste in it Susan time copy and
paste now and do the same thing right
here with italics so this pretty much
now that we have added an action or
excuse me an item listener we have a
listener waiting and what this does is
pretty much waits for something to
happen to bold box or italic box and the
only thing that can happen is you can
click it so now something is going to
happen and it's going to wait to be
clicked and when it gets clicked it's
going to recognize that it gets clicked
so now that we are able to recognize one
that gets clicked let's go ahead and
make something happen when it gets
clicked I mean can recognize it so
might as well so the first thing we need
to do is create a private handler class
so private whoa whoa whoa not right
there right here private I cannot type
today handler class and implements I
spell that right item listener like that
and you don't want in for our body upper
class just like this actually in the
next tutorial I'm going to show you guys
what goes in the body and it's pretty um
different than less tutorial so you guys
definitely want to pay attention to list
but another thing that I want to point
out before I forget whenever you put a
class inside another class and if you're
saying alright Bucky how come you just
don't put this class outside right here
and make twos totally different classes
how come you need an inter class to go
inside this whoa if you put a class
inside another class then this class
this inner class it can see all of the
variables and the methods in the outer
class so if you were to make two
separate classes either on the outside
of this or in a totally different file
then it's not going to be able to see
the variables and methods and since we
want to make this class use some of the
methods and variables in here that's why
we need to put this class inside the
bigger class right here so that is why I
put this handler class inside this GUI
class or GUI class but again and the
next story I'm going to show you guys
add some functionality to tell you guys
when you click this check box here's
what happens when cook the other one
here's what happens when you click them
both here's what happens to the text but
for now that's it for this tutorial I'm
running out of time so thank you guys
for watching and I will see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
