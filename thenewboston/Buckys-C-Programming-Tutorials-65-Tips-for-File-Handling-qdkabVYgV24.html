tutorial and in this lesson I'm just
going to be giving you guys a couple
tips when working with files and this is
you know something that can save you
time as well as some good programming
practice so it's going to save you a lot
of headaches in the future so let me go
ahead and get started so in the last
tutorial I told you guys that in order
to work with files you first need to do
two things you need to create a file
object and then you need to associate
that object with a file itself on the
computer so let's go ahead and instead
of doing that in two lines of code let
me show you guys how to do it in one
line of code so of course you need your
of' stream because that's what object
we're going to be making in order to
work with files and then you give your
object a name like buckey's file and
then you might be thinking all right
just go ahead put a semicolon go the
next line of code put bucky's file you
know open the file you want to work with
but there's the easier way to associate
this object with a file now whenever you
create a file object it takes an
optional parameter in the constructor
actually the entire constructor is
optional but if you want you can go
ahead and do this all in one line of
code by associating a file by passing
into the constructor and then whenever
you create your object it's going to
associate that file with this object so
for example let's go ahead and make a
file name beef jerky text and now
instead of creating your object on one
line of code and then associating the
file with this object on another line of
code we can just go ahead and pass the
file name into the constructor and now
this file is associated with this object
so it's probably better to get used to
this syntax unless you're making a
program where you don't know what file
is going to be associated with this
object whenever you're running it so
usually I like to do it this way just
because the save is a line of code and
again this constructor is optional but
trust me it's going to save you a whole
bunch of time in the future so now you
can do things like um
Bucky's file and then just go ahead and
output something stupid like I love the
beef and it says oh I love the beef but
you know good enough and then go ahead
and might as well add a new line and
then get my cursor out of the way and
then of course it's good program
practice to have Bucky's file close to
free up any of our computer's resources
so let's go ahead and actually watch
this file get made so I'm going to go
ahead and press run and oh man and close
it out but anyways you can see now that
we have a beef jerky
txt file so let's go ahead and click
that and it says ooh I love beef and i
do love beef jerky can't lie about that
so let's go ahead and before I let you
guys go I want to tell you guys one more
thing a function that you're going to be
seeing a lot if you're working with the
team of developers or you know if your
teacher gave you a assignment working on
the files is some function called is
open now is open is a function that you
can use on a file object and it's going
to return true if the object is
currently associated with a file and
this is a way that you can check
basically if a file is open and you know
it's ready to be worked with so in order
to do this go ahead and write if and
then you do this write your file object
which is in this case the buckey's file
and then write your function right after
it is underscore open now this isn't
going to take any parameters and just go
ahead and write something if the file is
open then we'll just output on the
screen like um
okay the file is open good enough and
then might as well go ahead and in that
line and we'll say else if the file is
not open then let's just go ahead and
output like Bucky you messed up and will
spell everything wrong and looks good go
so go ahead and in that line so now
what's going to happen is this all right
we coded this line correctly and it did
indeed open this beef jerky text file so
whenever we check if the file is open
this this is open really isn't a good
name it really should be like if object
is associated with a file that might be
a better name for this but you know that
would be a lot a lot of text so what
this line is going to do is it's going
to check if this object is associated
with a file if it is which it is it's
going to output ok the file is open if
it's not and we did something wrong it's
going to say Bucky you messed up so
let's go ahead and run this and indeed
we get ok the file is open so saying all
right
so when would be the case scenario when
the file wouldn't open well for example
if you go ahead and you made you know
your file object correctly but you
forgot to associate it with a file right
here then whenever we try to run it it's
going to say hold on Bucky you messed up
you forgot to associate your object with
a file so that is case scenario where we
would want to check if the file is open
or not and basically in programming well
in the real world how it works is this
you make sure it's open first and then
you write all your code right here so
it's a nice little check before you know
you just start writing code like this
this is probably would be better if we
threw inside here you know so if you
wanna you know impress your boss or your
teacher just make sure your files are
open before you start doing a bunch of
crap to them or else you know it's going
to save you a lot of headaches so with
that being said and this is where I just
want to stress you guys that there is
indeed an optional constructor where you
can associate a file with the object
instead of putting
on two lines of codes and also what you
can do is it's a better programming
practice to make sure your file is open
and by that I mean make sure your file
is associated with the object before you
start doing a whole bunch of crap to it
it's going to save you some time and
save your computer a whole lot of
headaches so with that being said that's
all I have for you guys for the story so
thank you guys for watching I don't
forget subscribing if they have any
questions so check out my forum the New
Boston calm slash forum and yeah I'll
see you there so thank you guys and I'll
see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
