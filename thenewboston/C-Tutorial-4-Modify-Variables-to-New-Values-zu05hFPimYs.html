C++ tutorial and in this tutorial I'm
gonna show you how to change the value
of the variable as you can see in our
last tutorial hopefully you're just
going through tutorials one by one and
tutorial 3 I showed you how to output a
number by calling it from our variable
so now if we were output on the screen
I'll just read my number is 54 but let's
say we wanted to type the code further
and we wanted to change this variable
let me first just make a new line so
it's easier to see again ndele for n
line now we have a new line and starting
on a new line so now let's say we were
going through a program and we wanted to
make a change to the variable my number
to do this it's very simple just type
you're variable again and you can either
set it equal to a new number 32 and what
this would do is um if you do this
let me copy you're right let me copy all
this
now let me show you guys what this means
since C++ reads code from top to bottom
here's what's going to do first we got a
variable number 54 so it's going to echo
that number 54 and then it's going to
spit all that out and on the next line
it's going to say all right now we have
a variable that's 32 so now the variable
is 32 so let's see what it does one does
that
I'll just compile it real quick as you
can see it's 54 first in 32 second even
though that we have the exact same
variable my number
since C++ it runs from top to bottom we
can edit that and it'll read it just
like it's getting a new variable even
though it's named the same thing so
watch it
watch out for this when you're writing
your code and one other cool little
thing you can do is actually make basic
math functions so say in our second one
we wanted to do my number equals 32 plus
42 so let's probably run this
and as you see 32 plus 42 equals 74 and
even more so what else we can do is add
variables together so let's say we
wanted to add my number to 42 well since
right now
C++ already knows that this is an
integer instead of trying to add letters
to numbers and get an error C++ is
automatically going to put in the number
54 for this since it knows that my
number isn't actually the word my number
it's actually the value 54 so what it's
going to do is say alright in this one
we have the value 54 so spit it out
button this one we want to take a
variable and add 54 which is this
variable to 42 and that's going to
become the new variable from here on out
so let's go ahead execute compile and
run as you can see 54 plus 32 is 96 or
42 sorry about that so now as you can
see 54 96
and just to recap one last time to make
this stick in your head about what's
going on we declared a variable by first
declaring what type of variable it is
and then we named it as you can see we
gave the variable the value 54 and out
put it on the screen now he told C++
alright now we want the variable equal
to the old variable plus 42 which was 96
now when the output on the screen says
all right the new variable is 96 so net
so duh what I'm trying to explain here
is even though you declare a variable
once the values can change and this may
seem confuse them but it's actually one
of the most useful things that you can
use or learn in programming and we'll be
working with this a lot later so study
this and I hope you learn how to modify
variables and how to give them a new
value and I hope you enjoyed this
