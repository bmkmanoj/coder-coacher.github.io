Effects cs6 tutorial my name is buddy
Blackford and today I want to show you
how to make 3d text inside After Effects
now this is a new feature in cs6 and you
won't be able to do it this way in cs5
or below so let's just get right into it
the text right here I created all within
After Effects and I didn't use any
anything except for a light text and a
camera so I'm gonna delete this out and
I'm gonna show you how to do this from
scratch and I'm gonna set my settings
back to what they were alright I'm back
and I deleted everything and we can
start from scratch first thing that I'd
like to do is I need to add in some text
so let's go to layer new text and we'll
just type in whatever we want to add in
here so adding in the new Boston and you
want to pick a text that will work well
in 3d and you'll have to pretty much
experiment with that let's go into a new
setting here and it's up here at the top
or says renderer and right here it says
classic 3d well we want to click on that
and it's going to bring us to our
composition settings so you remember you
probably remember this page so if you
click on the Advanced tab in your
composition settings you can change this
renderer here to raytrace to 3d now this
allows us to show things in 3d with an
After Effects and it renders that within
the composition preview panel so we're
gonna make this 3d and put it back into
the center so I'm gonna create I'm gonna
create a new camera because my camera is
all messed up for me moving it around so
I'm going to create a new camera
and just name it whatever so now it's
it's straight on and I'm not all over
the place we're going to go in to our
twirl down options here and we have some
new things like geometry options and
material options we're gonna toggle down
a geometry options and we have four
options here bevel style angular concave
and convex so this if I click on one of
these I'm going to put it on angular and
then we have the bevel depth whole bevel
depth and extrusion depth so the one to
make it more 3d is this extrusion depth
down here so let's increase that and
then we'll take our camera tool there
and then we'll paint around and we can
see that we've got some 3d here well we
can't really tell how good it looks
because I mean there's no lighting or
anything like that so let's add in a new
light so let's go to layer new light and
hit OK and now we've got some 3d looking
stuff going on here we can increase the
bevel depth I'll zoom in and you can see
along the edges here or it's a little
bit lighter grade that's the bevel
that's what that's called and that
brings it out to make it pop off and
look more 3d pretty much everything in
real life has at least a small bevel
unless it comes like straight to like a
point and it's a sharp point and that's
done and that won't have a bevel but
most things do so we can increase the
bevel depth a little bit that's too much
there we go and you can see how it makes
it pop off a little more makes it more
3d now I'll just go through these real
quick and you can see how they differ
from each other
that's a concave
the bevel kind of slides in and then
comes up and this is convex where the
bevel comes out and then goes in so I'll
make I'll use my pen tool real quick to
kind of show you how it's doing it the
convex will come out like this well
that's not very good
yeah it'll come out like this and then
the concave will come out pretend this
is on like the edge of your letter there
the concave will go in like that so
there's a rudimentary little drawing
there but to show you concave and convex
let's get those off angular is kind of
like straight so now we have gone over
these besides the whole bevel depth and
this works on things like these holes in
the E or the E or the O and if I move
them down just check out how that's
opening up there so that's the whole
bevel depth so we can that's all of
these options here I've gone over now
let's twirl that up and then we've got
these material options which basically
shows the different how it's going to
reflect and how much shine and all that
stuff is going to go on so the material
is actually like the texture that's on
there the color here is determined by
the color of your text so I made this
one kind of silver so you can come down
here and mess with these settings
diffuse here is whether it's lighter or
darker so I move the diffuse to 100%
it's a lot lighter and I move it to zero
and it's a lot darker
you've got your specular here which is
kind of like fake reflection
and that brings up like the brightness
and things like that and then there's a
specific values you can put into these
that will bring like certain colors like
you can get something that silver or you
can get like a gold color or gold
texture and then you can possibly make
water I'm not sure if that's possible in
this yet but in other 3d programs if you
put in the right values you can get
water and it's all kind of like based on
some like science and other things like
that I usually have to look them up
because I can't remember all these
values out the top of my head and
someone will have written them down on
the internet somewhere now there is
another section here that isn't totally
apparent but if you click on this
animate button right here it brings up a
whole different type of a whole
different bunch of texture options on
here where I could change like the color
of the front if I wanted to and I could
make that like like a dark like a white
or somewhere like a black or whatever I
want whatever color I want to make it
same thing for you can do the bevels and
then you can do the right side and the
left side to make a bunch of different
colors on there and then there's a whole
bunch of other options here that I can
go over at another time or you can
adjust certain sections of your text to
get a lot more fine-tuning so that's the
basics of creating your 3d text you have
to set up a 3d camera make your text 3d
change your renderer to a ray traced 3d
I'm gonna add in a light and adjust your
options of adjust your bevel depth
and your extrusion depth to get basic 3d
so thank you for watching this tutorial
remember this is only an After Effects
cs6 I wanted to also let you know that
the the previews here affect how much
time it's going to take to render your
image so if I have it on fast draft
right now I use that so I could go
through quickly and not have to render
everything so if I put it on final
quality and it renders it out it's going
to look much better and nicer the other
ones out here I'll go over in the next
tutorial and I'll see you guys at that
one so we can learn how to work
efficiently in After Effects using the
new 3d renders</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
