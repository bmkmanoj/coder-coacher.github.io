Python tutorial in this tutorial I'm
gonna show you guys how to build your
first actual program so finally we're
done testing stuff out I talk to you
guys all the basics I guys all you need
to know now we're going to actually be
building a useful stuff so the first
thing I want to teach you guys is
something called the if statement now
what the if statement does is in plain
terms it checks if a test is true a
tester condition as they're called and
if it's true it's going to execute a
certain block of code but if your test
is false or it's not true then it's not
going to execute the code at all and
this is how in computer language you can
get your computer to do a certain thing
if a certain condition is met but you
can get to skip something if another
condition is met or if it isn't met so
it's a lot easier to just show you guys
and I'll talk to you guys serve it if I
do so go ahead and open up your file new
window and this will bring up your new
arm I don't know what it's called
just as whatever program user write
Python then and again remember you have
to save it before you run it just a
little reminder so once you got that up
you're ready to start writing your
actual programs so let me first get a
variable so let's write something called
tuna and you can set the end it equal to
anything you want I'm going to set my an
equal to fish and notice when you press
ENTER in this it doesn't automatically
run because you're actually writing a
real Python program right now not just
goofing around so next I want to tell
you guys about the if statement now
again the syntax for the if statement is
simply if and after you write if you
want to give place on a test now let's
go ahead and give the only test we can
to see if tuna is equal to fish so let's
go ahead and write tuna and when you're
testing you use two equal signs instead
of one when you use one equal signs it
means you're having a variable and
setting it to
you and we're not getting a variable and
setting it to value we're just testing
if it's the value right now so let's
test if that variable is equal to fish
now after your test what you have to do
in every condition is rate of colon not
a semicolon just a regular colon then
once you're done with your test in your
if statement go ahead and press Enter
now under your if statement here's
what's going to happen if this test is
true which it is tuna is equal to fish
you're going to want to give a piece of
code to execute so let's go ahead and
give it a certain piece of code
let's give something real simple print a
statement make a single quotes print
this is a fish alright so a tuna equals
fish which it does we want you to print
out this is a fish alright and another
thing that I want you guys to take note
of for a run this program as you can see
this little piece of code is indented
right here whenever you press ENTER
after the Sun it automatically indents
and your indentation is your way of
telling Python all right whenever we
indent this is the piece of code we want
you to execute during our if statement
anything that's not indented is
completely different than the if
statement and something else and this is
very important to Python and you'll be
seeing this a lot later on so let me go
ahead and run this block of code and let
me and I'll talk you guys through after
I do I guess so go ahead and press 5
it's going to give you I mean F 5 and
it's going to give you that and you're
going to get this little statement this
is a fish alright so this statement was
true and it ran that block of code and
printed that out so as you can see this
is what it printed and let me tell you
guys one more time why this happened we
have a variable tuna and set it equal to
fish we wrote alright we're going to
give you a test if tuna is equal to fish
we want you to do something we want you
to print out this statement this is a
fish alright but if it is not equal to
fish we don't want you to do anything at
all and
show you guys what would happen if fish
was something else
say if tuna was equal to bass what would
you what would happen so go ahead and
press f5 save it and as you can see when
it runs this time nothing happens so
that's kind of the basics of the if
statement if your test is true it's
going to run this piece of code that's
directly indented underneath it if it's
not true it's going to say alright I'm
not running this just move on to the
next line and skip it all together so
again to summarize this your if
statement takes a piece or excuse me
your if statement takes a test and test
it if the test is true it's going to
execute the block of code under it and
if it's not true it's not going to do
anything at all so again this syntax is
very important where you say if test :
and don't forget that : and also don't
forget to indent and once you remember
those simple things you are ready to
write basic if statements so this is
your very first intro to an actual
program so in the next story I'll be
showing you guys how to do something
else that's really cool so don't forget
to watch on my next watch for in my next
tutorial um so again thank you guys for
watching and don't forget to subscribe
it and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
