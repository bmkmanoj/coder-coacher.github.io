this Photoshop cs6 tutorial today we're
going to go over the kerbs adjustment
today it is one of the best color
correction adjustments there and is a
lot of people's go to color correction
adjustment so usually they start out
with that so let's go ahead and get
right into it and open it up let's go to
image adjustments and then curves the
hotkey is ctrl M if I can cancel this
real quick and bring it up you can see
that ctrl M is the hotkey so what curves
do for you you might ask well you can
lighten up your brights you can lighten
up your darks you can darken both you
can shift colors you can add contrast
and you can create like some special
effects such as solarization so there
are a bunch of different things that you
can do with the curves curves adjustment
now let's go over what we see here the
first thing that you'll notice is that
we have our graph here and let me
explain the graph a little bit so down
here at the bottom we have our input
this is the very bottom and over here on
the Left we have our output now what we
got here is the black the black is black
so 0 for black is going to be at the
very bottom left corner here now if we
go all the way to the top right we're
gonna have our brightest white which
would be 255 ever and I'm talking in RGB
so this is the brightest white and this
is the black is black here then of
course we got anything on our grayscale
value from here to there in between now
you can click on this line here which is
the mid line and you can adjust the
values in the area that you clicked and
made the point from so if I make a point
up here just click it's going to create
a point on the line and then you can
drag it if I drag it up it's going to
brighten up the brights you
cuz it's up here in the top where the
breads are if I drag it down it's going
to darken the brights now if I make
another point down here and drag it up
it's going to lighten the darks and
darken the darks if I bring it down here
more so you can see how this is like
creating some contrast and things so
that's how that works now if you move
your point around and you're like oh man
I didn't really want that there you can
create another point and just bring it
back up to where you wanted it now you
may have to do some adjusting with your
and with your points here to get the
right thing but overall you can just
move your points around now one of the
best ways to get good points and some
good contrast and all that stuff in your
image is to create what they call an
s-curve now that is making your curve
look like an ass pretty much now you can
go the opposite way if you would like
okay I could bring this one down and
bring this one up this creates like kind
of like a more blown out effect and if I
go the other way it's gonna create a
more of a contrast the effect as you can
see there so that's the starting point
you want to use for your curves and then
adjust them as you go on now I'm gonna
take off some of these points by
clicking on the point and dragging it
off and if I do that I get my straight
line again and then I'm back to normal
or you could come down here to click on
default and it'll bring that back so let
me just create something click on
default it's gonna bring it back to
where it was now we do have a set of
presets in here that we can use and you
can see there are a few different ones
for RGB here so if I click on color
negative it's going to create like a
negative effect so like if you're
looking at a piece of film that hasn't
been yet developed so that's what that
we've got darker here increased contrast
and remember I was talking about the
s-curve so the contrast is increased and
then if we want like a strong contrast
you can see the different things going
on there so I can go to default and then
as it just like the other adjustments
you can create your own presets by
clicking on this and saving your preset
so if I wanted to make like something
like this where it's really dark save
preset and just type in whatever your
preset is supposed to be and you want it
to put me under the curves I'm not gonna
save this one because I just made it off
the top my head there's no reason to
save it and I'll just go back to default
so I can go right back to where I'm
supposed to be now you can change your
different color channels as well so you
can only take out a certain color if you
want it to so if I wanted to take out
some of the greens in this up here it
makes the image more red or I can bright
bright enough and add more greens so tip
going down starts taking them away and
going up starts adding them let me go
back to default
alright now we are gonna go move on to
another cool thing that I I like in the
curbs where you can pick from your
values using this finger thing right
here so come to this icon and click on
it no no we can go and there's a finger
dropper here and if you look at the at
the graph you can see that there's a
little circle on the tone line so that's
where the certain tones are in the image
now if I wanted to just start like
adjusting like these yellows I can click
and it creates a point for me and now I
can start adjusting these yellows if I
want it to and I can start bringing back
some of the other things that I was
messing with so now just pretty much the
yellows are getting adjusted so if I
bring these down
like this now I've got an area that is
the yellow that I can mess with with
those you can see now the yellows are
getting a lot more blown out or I can
start coming down here to take out some
of the yellow and you can see another
the yellows are going a lot more gray
but that's what's handy about this
little tool here I think it's pretty
cool now I'm gonna go back to default
and just click off that tool so that you
don't have it there or so you don't
aren't I like using the tool to pick
from your values now you can see that
there's no circle appearing on our graph
because I don't have it selected anymore
a quick way that you can get some color
correction using curves and if you're
strapped for time you can click on this
Auto button and what its gonna do is
it's gonna create an s-curve based off
of your image here and it's going to try
to make it a little more contrasting
everything for you that way you don't
have to put in a lot of time it creates
these points for you on photo shops like
best guess there so that's nice and then
you can always adjust these points with
however you want to so let's go ahead
and bring it back to the default and I
wanted to show you about these sliders
here down here at the input these will
adjust the tonal value so if I click and
start dragging nice you can see how
they're adjusting the tonal values in
the image right now we're getting like a
more of a solarization effect and this
way we'll start darkening things up you
can do the same thing by just dragging
your point on on your image here and you
can just mess around with it any way you
want now you can also go the other way
going up and down by dragging the point
and same thing on this point you can
drag it down to do basically the same
thing but most people just go from
love to write the show they get better
results doing it that way if you are
pretty good with drying or something
like that then you can use this pencil
right here this if you click on the
pencil you can draw your own s-curve or
whatever kind of curve you're looking
for so if I start moving my line here
and I know this is gonna look awful
because I'm not the greatest at drawing
it wasn't too bad but you can draw your
own curve there and if you like that you
have a lot of control over it this way
but it's not always the if you if you
don't have a steady hand or something
like that you can see where I went up
and down right here it can't come out
like disastrous so it's up to it's up to
you if you think you can handle using
the pencil here then go for it I mean
I'm not very good at it so I always use
the actual point curves now these
buttons down here underneath where it
says curve display options they can be
hidden by clicking on this double arrow
or shown by the same way now all these
things do is change the look of your
graph so if I did pigment slash ink
percentage basically just flips it over
so it just showed changes the look if I
click on this graph you get some more
squares that you can use and then you
can change out like if you want to see a
histogram the baseline or anything like
that so that's just use some options of
how to display your actual graph nothing
that really affects the actual image so
just remember that you can hide those if
you don't even care about showing them
and the last thing that we can go over
here is the eyedropper here same thing
as in levels and some of the other
adjustments you can sample an image and
set the black points and you can see
that it changes the how the image looks
if I click on show clipping here it's
going to show me the our parts of the
image where it has been clipped off and
you can see that the RGB values have
been changed in this was ever since I
use that eyedropper and go back to
default but use these to get different
types of looks depending on what you
want to look as you can see that the the
blue and the red and the green have been
cut off way over here you want to have
clicked and set my white point over here
because it's this wasn't obviously like
a pure white so it cut it off it's more
of like a grayish white so that's why it
did that so if we click on the options
here we've got a couple of auto color
correction options so when I click on
the auto button here it's going to
change based on these options that I
click on and you can click on them to
see how stuff is going to change so if
you like it this way when you click on
your auto it's gonna be that it's gonna
look like that
here's per channel so just preview it
here and then you can mess with the
different modes and target colors and
everything like that so if you want your
shadows to be something else like reds
or something like that so that's how you
mess with those they're just for
different kinds of looks so the fault is
enhanced brightness and contrast and
that's usually the best one to keep it
on and it looks the best but it's up to
you so that's all there is to talk about
curves so hopefully I threw a lot of
information at you guys and hopefully it
was useful I like to thank you guys for
watching this one and be sure to visit
the forums here and if you guys would
like to I'd like to see some of your
progress here and if you post some of
your before and after
correction using your levels adjustments
using your curves and your brightness
and contrasts or what else did we go
over us exposure it would be awesome to
see some of your before and afters and
all you got to do is come to Bucky's
rune org slash forum and then come down
here into the Photoshop section and just
post in here your before and after color
correction images and then I'll try to
