welcome to your 17th chemistry tutorial
and this tutorial I'm going to be
talking to you guys about radiation or
radioactivity or radioactive decay
whatever the heck you want to call it so
unfortunately this has nothing to do
with a radio in your car the definition
is the process by which an unstable
atomic nucleus loses energy by emitting
ionizing particles or radiation simple
enough ok let's move on to next tutorial
I'm just kidding I'll explain a little
bit better so certain isotopes are
naturally unstable and by this I mean
sometimes their nucleus spontaneously
decays or breaks apart now whenever this
happens we call it radioactivity and
you're saying okay Bucky what the heck
would cause an isotope or its nucleus to
start decaying or breaking apart well if
we remember in the nucleus of an element
you have all of these protons that are
jammed packed together really closely
now if you remember the rule that
opposite forces attract which would mean
that these similar forces all of these
positive charges are going to be
repelling each other so all of these
protons are basically pushing against
each other trying to get away from each
other
sorry saying okay that makes sense but
then wasn't the nucleus of atoms just
always break apart and explode like
instantly
well yes however you have something
called nuclear glue now nuclear glue
first of all it sounds like a term that
I just made up off the top of my head
but this is actually a legit chemistry
term it's what chemists called the force
that hold protons together keeps them
from breaking apart however sometimes
this glue just isn't strong enough to
compete with the force of the protons
repelling each other and it starts to
break apart and when that happens your
nucleus starts to break apart and this
is called radioactive decay simple
enough so that's pretty much what we
radioactive or radioactivity radioactive
decay is and some other interesting
stuff happens sometimes as well so
another thing that you may want to
remember before we start these tutorials
is the number 84 let me write that
little bit better 84 now this is
important to remember because any
element with 84 or more protons is
naturally unstable and when I say
unstable I mean it is going to split
apart eventually it may be a short time
it may be a long time but any element
with 84 or more protons in the nucleus
is eventually going to decay some time
now radioactivity is also related to the
proton Neutron ratio of natum typically
you want your ratio to be 1 to 1 or in
other words you want the same number of
protons and neutrons in your nucleus
whenever this happens your atom is happy
in its stable however sometimes the
ratio gets kind of out of control in
other words you may have a high number
of protons compared to neutrons or a
high number of neutrons compared to
protons the more uneven your ratio is
the more radioactive an isotope becomes
simple enough so just remember those two
rules
84 in the p-n ratio is I like to call it
no one else calls with that but hey
these are my tutorials I can call it
what I want so now let me talk to you
guys about alpha particles or alpha
emissions now if we look at the
definition it says a positively charged
particle of a helium nuclei now we know
that helium always has two protons in
its nucleus and also it also has two
neutrons however since this is
positively charged if we would draw this
we would see that it would have zero
electrons so the formula for alpha
particle is two protons plus two
neutrons plus zero electrons pretty
weird huh now typically or I guess I
might want to take a step back so since
you have two positive charges and no
negative charges you have an overall
plus two or two plus charge and whenever
you have a positively charged ion it's
technically called a cation now since
electrons are really easy to gain or
lose in nature
this ion typically picks up you know it
finds two electrons somewhere so
typically whenever you have a alpha
particle it quickly finds two electrons
in this alpha particle quickly becomes a
stable or neutral helium element or
helium atom whatever you want to call it
so aside from that let me go ahead and
give you an example of when this would
happen in nature let me think of a good
color I feel in dark blue so say you
have something like 238 on 92 uranium
now this could break apart in undergo
radioactivity and it would turn into 234
90 thorium and also for to helium and
this thing right here this helium this
would be the alpha particle again at the
as soon as it starts breaking apart it
would have two protons two neutrons in
zero electrons so this alpha particle
would not have any electrons at first
however it would find them somewhere and
quickly become a stable helium element
but at first it would just be an alpha
particle now alpha emission is one type
of radioactivity that it's kind of a
common type but there are bunch of
different types that I have to talk to
you guys about this is only the first
one I want to cover so again to recap
one last time sometimes you have 238 92
uranium and it breaks apart the nucleus
so it breaks into two different elements
one is 230 490 thorium and your other is
your alpha particle which is for to
helium without any electrons and then
that alpha particle is going to go
whizzed around and find up two electrons
and it's going to become a stable for to
helium atom so again that is the basics
of alpha emission however we have to
talk about beta emission and all this
other kinds of radiation and it gets
pretty interesting so that's what you
have to look forward to in upcoming
tutorials
but for now thank you guys for watching
don't forget
grab in oh yeah add me on Google+ I'll
see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
