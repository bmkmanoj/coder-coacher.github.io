I didn't catch anything still really
hungry and I have no I'm making a fire
now because my foot is gone
I think yeah I'm pretty sure I'm done
well it sucks cuz I can't really leave
now it's probably gonna be dark soon and
I don't want to be walking out in the
dark I'm definitely hungry I think I'm
gonna just pack up my stuff like sleep
on my pack next to this tree here and
I'm just gonna head out first thing in
the morning
well I found myself a little I'm real
hungry first of all and I found the
small for ever
I don't even know if you can see it let
me check yep begin what I'm going to try
to eat this so here we go
it's like dirt a little tang to it
though well it's the middle of the night
and I am NOT sleeping it's really cold
out actually I don't know how but yeah
I'm really cold I'm tired but I can't
really sleep for more than like 10
minutes at a time so it sucks without
having to fire it's just horrible I
can't wait till like the break of
daylight so I can leave I don't think
I've ever been like this drained in my
life it's ridiculous I totally
underestimated how hard this whole
experience was going to be and didn't
think of any of these complications that
would come off they have and I'm just
totally bored I'd really couldn't do
anything today I had probably two or
three somehow hours of sunlight left at
the end of the day and I couldn't really
do anything with it I mean I just tried
to fish for half a day and then really
just sat around there wasn't anything to
do so first thing tomorrow I'm gonna
head out hopefully I can find my way
back pretty easy I just can't wait to
get home and get out of here I really
want like a big bacon cheeseburger and
now actually that'd be amazing and also
it would be real nice to have like my
nice cozy bed to sleep in instead of
this nice
a steel hard tree that I'm leaning
against but who at least I'm gonna make
like tomorrow's day seven that's seven
hundred bucks and he probably thinks I'm
dead actually but we'll see I still got
one more day
oh man I'm tired but I figured since I
had quite a bit of battery power and
tapes left I might as well along a
little bit of a rant while I'm not
sleeping so but other than that I
actually saw a couple deer earlier - I
didn't get my camera out in time they
spotted me and took off but they like
came right out near the creek it was a
doe and a fawn that was really cool
actually
what I spooked him he laughs that oh
well I guess since it's according to
this camera no 2:30 in the morning which
means I actually missed my dentist
appointment so I'm probably just gonna
try and get a couple more hours of sleep
somewhere I gonna come up at like 5:30
so that's a couple ten-minute shifts of
sleep if I plant it out right and I can
try and track my ass out of here which I
don't know what I'm gonna do once I get
out either I don't have like a set ride
to pick me up or anything so I'm gonna
have to like hitchhike oh but uh should
be a fun day of walking with no energy
at all no sleep no food and probably
you've got much water I better take care
of that in the morning - for a leaf but
uh
yeah I'll uh I'll probably do as much
filming as I can tomorrow while I'm
walking around all day so I'll probably
be up in a few hours here so I can leave
and tape myself leaving which is going
to be exciting oh I'm going to bed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
