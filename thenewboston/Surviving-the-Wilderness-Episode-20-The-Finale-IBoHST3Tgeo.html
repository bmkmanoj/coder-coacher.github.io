the morning of it and I've been up for
about an hour now I was drizzling a
little bit so I didn't want to tape I'm
still ridiculously lost figured I might
as well do a little taping intro real
quick while I'm lost I got nothing else
to do sighs walk around and I'm gonna
keep on going south and west trying to
get out of here but it looks like it's
gonna rain so I don't know how much tape
and I'm gonna be able to get in during
the day all right well I just walked
from this way over here and found these
markers and I can hear a dog barking in
the background so markers are a they're
pink flags on all the trees and I heard
the dog from over this way so I'm gonna
go and hopefully there's a house and not
a pack of coyotes ready to kill me so
let's see what we got kind of a little
clearing here so excited your health
already
come on Bessie see it looks like a house
actually which would confirm my
suspicions
that would be salvation I'm just going
to go over there and ask them where the
hell I am and find the nearest gas
station and get the hell out of here
what up and I am definitely going home
what's that it dead animal or something
smells but
to do this alright well I just went in
over to that house no one was home so
I've heard this house behind me just
across the street and like they let me
use their phone
I called Bucky and said he's like he'll
be here in like three hours so I got a
little time to wait but at least I'm in
the hell out of here today
that was a long and treacherous
experience for sure one of the worst
ideas I've ever had I will never do this
again
totally stupid definitely not worth the
money at all but I did learn a lot of
stuff and I definitely underestimated
what it's like in the wilderness for
sure it's even with tools I can't see
how people survive without tools in the
wild because I had key things thats all
I needed I should have been able to
survive for ever really but um it days
close enough to forever for me so I
don't know if I'm going to tape again
maybe when he gets here but I am done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
