tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial we're going
to be doing even more on if statements
so for this tutorial you're going to
need to have a button a text box and a
check box once you have all that on your
form just go ahead and double click on
the button alright so first off here
let's just go ahead and create an if
statement checking to see if the text
and the text box is at them so we're
going to say get text box is one or our
text box right here and we'll say if the
text of that text box is Adam then we're
just going to want to have a message box
show saying hello so we're here and say
all right there we go so basically what
it's going to do right here is just
check to see if the text inside of text
box one is Adam and if it is we're just
going to a message box showing saying
hello so if we just go in here and type
Adam you click the button yep we get
hello but what if we only wanted it to
show the message box if the text inside
of this text box is Adam and if this
checkbox is checked well what we can do
is create an if statement inside of this
if statement checking the see if the
check box is checked so just go right
here and say if check box one dot check
and then we'll just have a message box
show so what it's going to do is this
going to first just check to see if the
text inside of text box one is Adam and
if it is then it's going to jump down to
this if statement and check to see if
the check box is checked and then if
it's checked then we're going to get a
message box saying hello and having an
if statement inside of an if statement
is called a nested-if statement all
right so let's just go ahead and make
sure that it's works right here so if we
just type Adam inside of this text box
and click the button nothing's going to
happen because the check box is in check
but if you were to go ahead and check
the check box then we get a message box
and if we only have the check box
checked and the text box is text is in
Adam then we're going to get nothing all
right and what if you had something else
do you wanted to check like you wanted
like if in all right so if you wanted to
say like if int I equals zero then you
have to have another if statement inside
of here saying if I equals zero then we
won't have a message box show so the
only way for a message box to show now
is if text box ones text equals atom if
the check box is checked and if I equals
zero well that's not very practical way
easier way of doing this is using
something called an so we can just go
ahead and delete all this and what we
can do right here is just put two and
symbols on right after this so right
after this we can say and check box one
is checked so now it's going to do is
its first going to check to see if text
box ones tax equal to atom and if it
does then it's going to check to see if
check box one is checked and if both of
these are true and we're going to get a
message box just hang below so we're
going to see right here hello okay so
let's just go ahead and make sure that
this works so if we just type atom in
here and we don't know the check box
checked we're not going to get a message
box but if we do check the check box in
text box ones text is atom then we will
get a message box but if only the check
box is checked then we want and you can
have as many ends after this as you want
so you could say um if check box one is
checked and text box ones text equals
Adam and I equals zero then that's fine
you can have as many hands as you want
all right so we've already looked at an
now let's take a look at alert so to do
or you're just going to want to do two
vertical lines and to do or create these
vertical lines you're just going to want
to hold shift and go above your Enter
key
minus-- hit that twice so just two
vertical lines and then if we wanted to
say if text box one text equals atom or
check box once checked then this message
box will show so basically what's going
to happen is it's going to go and check
to see if text box one's text equals
and if it does then it's going to go
down here and show the message box
because only one of these has to be true
for it to show this message box
so if text box ones text doesn't equal
Adam but check box one is checked and
we're still going to get this message
box so let's just go ahead here and make
sure that this works so if we just type
the atom in here and click the button
we're going to get that message box
because only one of these has to be true
so check box one is in check but text
box ones text is Adam and if you're
going to check both of them or both of
these are true it'll still do it and if
only the check box is checked it will
still do it oops but if we only or if we
don't have any of them at all we're not
going to get that message box since
neither text box ones text is Adam nor
the check box is checked
all right and just like the and you can
have as many ORS as you want so if you
wanted to say for I equals 0 then it's
just going to always show this message
box since I is equal to 0 so now if we
were to just debug and click this button
we get that message box because yeah
tech box ones text doesn't equal Adam
check box 1 isn't checked but I does
equal 0 so we'll get this message box
alright so that's pretty much it for
this tutorial so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
