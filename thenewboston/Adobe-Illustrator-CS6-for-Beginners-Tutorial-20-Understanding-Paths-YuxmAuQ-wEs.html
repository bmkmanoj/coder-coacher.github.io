illustration cs6 tutorial my name is
buddy Blackford today we're gonna be
understanding paths and learning what
they're all about and I'm gonna give you
some key terms and stuff like that that
you should do so you when you talk to
other people about illustrator they know
you're talking about so first off we're
gonna start about talking about paths so
when you draw an object or you create
one or more lines it's called a path so
go ahead and select the pen tool here
and click once and then click again and
then you got a line here now that line
is called the path now a path is made up
are of one or more curved or straight
lines so if I made a line here and
clicked and dragged now I've got a path
here that let me see if I can change
this out there we go now I've got a path
here that has curved lines in it so
these two are both still paths this
one's not curved and this one is alright
so these are called each part of these
paths are called segments in between
each of these dots so there's a dot if I
select my direct selection tool there is
a dot right there and there's a dot at
the top and there's a dot there now
those dots are called anchor points and
an anchor point is a bending point
that's used to modify the segments so if
I click on it I could drag and I can
modify a segment and in this case I'm
modifying two segments so there's some
terminology there for you so just so you
know a path can be both open and closed
now these two paths are open if I make a
path like this now I've got a closed
path where all the segments come and
close up the shape you don't have any
open space they're all closed and
nothing if if you were trying to get
like
or something like that inside you
wouldn't be able to because it's closed
up so that's a little bit about that
so paths also have two types of anchor
points you've got smooth points and
you've got corner points now this one
here would be called a smooth point
because it connects curving segments now
these two this one would be a corner
point where it connects two straight
lines so some more terminology there for
you now when you're working with these
paths we've got these two important
tools here we've got the selection tool
and then we've got the direct selection
tool selection tool is hotkey is V and
direct selection tool is a and you'll
want to use those all the time when
you're working because it's going to
make you work a lot faster when you use
the selection tool and click on some
paths if you click on the line and it's
going to make it so that the entire
thing is selected and that way you can
edit it and move it around the direct
selection tool when you click you can
click directly on an anchor point and
edit the anchor point or you can select
more than one anchor point and move both
of them like this so there's the two
tools up here on the left that you'll be
using a lot to modify your paths now
there's a bunch of other tools that you
can use to modify paths as well but
these are the just the two main ones
that you can use to modify your entire
thing or the anchor points so just keep
that in mind when you're working with
anchor points which are these points
here if you remember you can adjust the
way that they're shown so I click on
this one we've got these lines that come
out and these lines these are called
handles and we have the ability to hide
these or show these and we can show
edges and stuff like that so we can go
into the View menu here
and we can hide edges and when I do that
the edges of the of the lines here
they're hidden all right and then if I
go it back here I can go back to show
edges and now they're shown again
another thing that we can do is let me
see if I can find it we're looking for
show handles one sec where the heck did
it go
lost track of it oh yeah it's not even
in that menu it's over here in the
control panel where it says handles we
can click to hide handles for multiple
selected points or show handles so let
me select a couple points here and right
now it's on hide I click on it now I'll
be on show so that's another thing that
you can do then you got a bunch of other
things up here that we'll go over later
on at some point with the anchor points
but we'll save those for another
tutorial so we'll close out here now you
know about paths you know that the paths
are the lines each if there is more than
one line on or if there's more than one
anchor point on a path then it's going
to have segments so each of these are
segments so each it's a line on here is
a segment and then you got your anchor
points which are the points that you use
to modify your path so that's it and
thank you guys for watching this one and
hopefully you guys learned a little bit
about this and now you've got some
terminology under your belt that you can
use when you're talking to other people
and even if you're like talking to
someone else you can correct them when
they say something wrong and feel cool
so whatever I have a good day everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
