missing measurement over here you see
that the perimeter is given for each
shape notice that these two are
rectangular and this one is a square I
notice how on the rectangles there is
one side that is given that is because
they're going to be an infinite amount
of numbers that can equal 22 for both
sides to be different so you know that 8
on this side it has to be 8 on this side
so we can go right ahead and fill that
in if I can get a color go right ahead
and fill that in 8 and if that's 9 that
side has to be 9 so the way we're going
to go about this is that we're going to
add eight and eight together
so 8 plus 8 equals 16 and that is one
half of the perimeter so 22 minus 16
carry over the one is six and zero so
you have six left so there's two sides
left that you need to do so you divide
this by 2 to find the opposite sides so
3 plus 3 equals 6 so those are the
missing sides over here we have a
perimeter of 28 so what number times 4
in equals 28
we can try guess and check we can try 6
plus 6 plus 6 plus 6 6 + 6 is 12 6 + 6
is 12 2 + 2 equals 4 1 1 is 224 not
quite not quite 28 so let's go to 7 7 +
7 + 7 + 7 7 7 7 is 14 7 7 is 14 four and
four is eight 1 + 1 is 2 28 then
and since this is a square all sides are
the same so the missing measurement is 7
so for here we have 28 as again but
since this side has 9 and 9 it cannot be
7 so 9 plus 9 is 18 so 20 minus 18 is 10
so 10 divided by 2 that is two numbers
or one number added itself so four and
four or five and five or six and six you
could have two equal to ten so we can
try 4 + 4 equals 8 not quite 5 + 5
equals 10 bingo so know the missing side
is 5 and that's how you find the missing
measurement</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
