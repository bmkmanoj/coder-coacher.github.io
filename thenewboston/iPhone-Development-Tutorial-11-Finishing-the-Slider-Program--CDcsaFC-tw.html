iphone tutorial and in the store we're
going to be adding a slider to our
screen however before we get into that I
want to tell you guys about something
because I am in a super good mood about
something that just happened now
recently well let me tell you this first
down where I live there are two major
grocery stores once called harris
theater and once called food lion now i
normally shop at food line and at either
store you can give the special member
card and it gives you like extra
discounts like ten cents off gallons
milk and stuff like that and anyways i
usually shop at food lion and whenever
you forget your member card you can just
give him your phone number instead and
you still get the discounts well anyways
I was shopping at harris teeter recently
and I was you know getting all my stuff
ready to checkout and I was walking by
you know each of the cashiers seen
whatcha line was a shortest and I saw
this cashier that was super cute so even
though her line was a little longer I
decided to stand in anyways because you
know she's cute give me something nice
to look at so I got there put all my
things on conveyor belt she was you know
ringing me up getting my total and i
realized i forgot my member card for
that store so i go can i give you my
number because you know i still wanted
to discounts on my food even though i
forgot my card in my car and she's like
smiling and she takes out her cell phone
and she's like yeah and she gets my
phone number she thought i was trying to
pick her up she gets my phone number and
puts it in her cell phone so i was like
uh alright so i just give her my number
because I mean jeez this girl's cute
trust me so anyways like an hour and a
half go she just called me and we talked
for about an hour and evidently we're
going to see shrek on saturday so yeah I
mean I'm pretty good a pretty good
series of events that just happened to
me so anyways that is why I'm an
incredible good mood so yeah let's get
the story probably not even going to
have time to finish sorrow now but
anyways go ahead and click on your view
controller and it will open up interface
builder now of course what we want to do
now is
is remember we had that slider and that
label on the screen so go ahead and add
a slider it's this thing right here drag
that over and of course drag your label
over my mouse is falling off the mouse
pad all right view mode control label
there we go I'll get it eventually all
right so on your slider what you want to
do is go over into attributes right here
and you want to mess with some values
remember we had ours from 1 to 100 so
let's go ahead add a one right here add
a hundred right here and for initial
this one as soon as your program starts
up what do you want your slider to
appear at by default pretty much well we
wanted to appear at 50 so it's right in
the middle right here and by the way go
ahead and expand this a little bit so
it's same length disease so now you're
saying all right now what we have to do
is change this label to your default
value so you know we wrote code to
change this label but by default it's
whatever your initial value of the
slider is so they you know correspond
with each other so go ahead and set that
label to 50 and set all your attributes
for slider now after this we can go
ahead and hook up all our outlets and
actions so the first thing we want to do
is hook up our outlet to this label so
in the files owner um go ahead and by
the way any time you want to select
something but you know it's all lost in
your screen just go ahead to this little
motor right here and under your controls
you can here are all your objects on
your screen so anyways in this mode
files owner hold down control drag it
over to label let go and the outlet for
this is s label at least mine is I don't
know what you named yours and now for
your slider go ahead click on your
slider object and go ahead in your
slider connections and you say all right
all of these things right here do not
touch no no no what we want is right
here value change this means the action
that gets called anytime you change your
slider either slide it up or down so go
ahead
in let me move my mouse I need a bigger
mouse pad and move it excuse me drag it
over files owner and the action of
course is sliding so I mean everything
looks good to go we should be good so go
ahead file save and then go ahead in
your Xcode build and run it and see what
we get well I mean everything looks good
by default again 50 and this default is
50 so let's go ahead and see if this
baby works as you can see when we slide
it it decreases 1 200 wow this thing is
awesome so again don't forget each time
we move this like that that that each
time we move it it sends this method
right here sliding method so each time
we move it all of this happens it gets
the value it set to equal to value it
creates a new label and it sets that
label equal to the new value of the
slider and then of course it releases it
so that is pretty much how you add a
slider two years well screen and you
know some methods go along with it so I
hope you enjoyed it if anything is a
little fuzzy then just ask me question
in my forum link below and I'll be happy
to answer it for you so uh yeah that's
that I'm gonna go think about this girl
and uh yeah yep yeah oh sorry I do the
efforts are oh so thanks for watching
and don't forget subscribe and I'll see
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
