c-sharp tutorial that I'm making for the
new Boston and in this tutorial I'm
going to be showing you how you could
color dialogue so all you're gonna need
for this tutorial is a button and once
you have that on your form just go ahead
and double click on it so in order to
create a new color dialogue let's go
ahead and type out color dialogue now
you can name your color dialogue I'm
just going to call it C or color
dialogue then just go ahead and set it
equal to a new color dialogue just like
every other dialogue we're going to make
sure that the user actually selects
something in the color dialogue we're
gonna make CV dot show dialogue no
dialogue and if the result of that is
okay and we can continue one of our
business we're going to set the button
ones background color equal to whatever
color that user selects and the color
dialogue so we're going to do button one
dot back color equals CD color and this
color property is it says right there
gets or sets the color selected by the
users so whatever color the user selects
will now be button ones background color
so now I need to bug here we should get
a color dialogue yep now we can choose a
basic color or we can find our own
custom color over here I'm just gonna
make it I guess it's blue look at the
constant : let's select that color and
click OK and then when I click OK button
one's background color should change to
just believe yep you can also choose if
you want the user to be able to have a
custom color or create a custom color so
in order to do that you're going to want
to use the allow full open property and
you're going to want to set that equal
to false if you don't know on if you
don't want them deal create and select a
custom color so now I'm really bug here
and clicks flicking button
yeah you can't define a custom color so
you are forced to choose a basic color
another thing you can do is have that
color you know that custom color feature
open as soon as they open the dialog in
order to do that you're just going to
set a full open properties with the true
so as soon as you open the color dialog
it will show this custom colors over
here so it's automatic another thing you
can do is implement a Help button
in order for the Help button to appear
you have to do I'm CD show help and some
type equal to truth and now the Help
button will appear in the color dialog
yep the Help button is there in order to
have something happen when you when
somebody clicks the Help button you're
going to have to add a method to the
event so we're going to do CD
help request and they're just going to
be plus equals to add a new event
handler just gonna press tab twice and
it just created a method for us or
whenever someone clicks the help button
so whenever someone quickly health
button you're just going to tell them
that shoes use a color background of
your point so now we bug here and
someone clicks the Help button you
should get this message box yep choose a
color for the background of your body so
now we can shoot you background for the
color of our button and yep change that
just like before so that's pretty much
it for this tutorial on the color dialog
so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
