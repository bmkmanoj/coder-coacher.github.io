the hard drive so go ahead and slide
your hard drive into one of these ports
until the little screws line up like
just like that now go ahead and screw it
all right guys now once you have your
optical drive and your hard drive
installed next step is to hook them up
first let's hook up our up to a drive
with this the cord that came with it now
this is the IDE cable and you can see
there are two sides to it one side is
the side that well it doesn't have this
other nub close to it this is a side my
sides blue this is the part that's going
to plug into your motherboard and this
other end is the part that's going to
plug into your optical drive this other
cable right here is if you have another
optical drive or some hard drives or IDE
then this can plug into it but for now
since we only have one you're not going
to be using this one only this end and
this end so let's go ahead blue plug
into our IDE right here on our
motherboard
there you go make sure it's nice and
snug and go ahead and plug this one into
our optical drive and you see they're a
little notches cut out in it and there
are also little notches cut out in your
pin connector so just make sure that
your notches line up and you can go
ahead and plug that in and try to be
careful not to bend any bend any pins or
anything while you're hooking it up
hopefully I did it now that we've got
our optical drive hooked up tuck that
cable away and our next step is to
install or hook up our SATA hard drive
so let's go ahead and first connect it
to the motherboard now this right here
is our SATA cable SATA now what this
plugs into is our little slots right
here these black slots on our
motherboard that look like little elves
in in case you can't see these look like
little elves as well all right there you
go
one plugs into that and the other it's
obvious plugs right into your hard drive
now the other thing we need to do when
hooking up our hard drive just hook it
up so we can hook up the power to it now
the power supply we got it doesn't hook
directly up so we need a converter and
this is a serial SATA ATA converter it
converts it this part plugs into your
hard drive and this part plugs into your
power supply so once we hook this up
into our hard drive we're gonna be able
to hook it up into our power supply so
go ahead again rari buddy there you go
shaped like an owl go ahead and plug it
right in here and we are good to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
