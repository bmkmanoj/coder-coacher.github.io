xxx C++ toriel 30 tutorials that's like
a milestone or something and in this
tutorial I'm going to be talking to you
guys about function overloading what it
is why it's useful and when you would
use it so let's go ahead and say we
wanted to build a function - I don't
know maybe we wanted to have the user
and put a number and we just wanted to
print it out on the screen really stupid
function but really simple so let's go
ahead and make two variables we'll make
an end of your variable a and we'll set
this equal to you know 54 and we'll make
another flow variable and remember a
flow is basically a number with decimal
point so we'll use like 32.4 yadda yadda
something something stupid so now we
have two different types of numbers an
integer and a float
well we have a function that we are
gonna build called print number so let's
go ahead and call this function and
again we didn't build this yet so for
your looking where did print number come
from
we'll build it in a second so we're
going to go ahead and try to use this
function for both of these variables
print number a and we're going to try
and print out B 2 so then we say alright
now we're going to go ahead and build
this function to print out a number so
we go up here it's not going to return
anything so we're just going to be void
of course it's named print number and
then we get to this part right here
alright let's go ahead and think for a
second if we go ahead and put int X then
we're going to allow to pass in an
integer so this is going to work but
this isn't going to work so I know what
I'll do I'll just put flow X well then
this is going to allow me to pass in
this number but then this number isn't
going to work so how do we solve this
little puzzle right here well we do this
through the use of something called
function overloading and function
overloading is the idea that in C++ you
can build more than one function with
the same name in this case we're going
to build it be building two functions
called print number that take different
types of data depending on what you pass
in for example we're going to build a
print number right here that takes in
your value and just go ahead and see out
I am printing and integer and then go
ahead and print out the integer X and
then in that line well that goes ahead
and takes care of the integers that the
user might enter and now we can build
another function with the same name
which is print number again if you
double click it you'll see the exact
same name the only difference is it
takes a different type of parameter this
one takes a float number instead so now
whenever we call this method and it has
an integer it's going to use this one
and whenever we call this method and by
method I mean function I saw sorry I
could switch it on and off but I teach
too many programming languages to keep
it straight so whenever it calls a
function with a float it's going to use
this one it's smart enough to
automatically know what type of data
you're passing it in so this one is
going to print out C out now I am
printing a float which is X and n line
so as you can see these functions are
basically identical it just runs
whatever pretty much whatever type of
Daddy pass in it looks for whatever
function is appropriate for that type of
data and it uses that function so let's
go ahead and build and run this and
check out what we get at first
we pass then an integer 54 so that's why
I used this one that took an integer and
it said I am printing an integer and
after that we pass then in the same
function a float which was 32 point four
so that's why it chose this one now I am
printing a float 32 point 4 so as you
can see function overloading solves the
problem of having one function so check
this out instead of trying to explain
our boss that they need to use a bunch
of different functions depending on what
type of data we can make them happy and
say alright anytime you want to use a
function just go ahead and use this
print number function and put in any
number you want this is going to be
behind the scenes stuff that they don't
have to worry about they don't know that
we had to make two different functions
just because they were annoying
and they couldn't understand that they
needed to work with different types of
data so we're going to make it really
easy for the user through the use of
function overloading now whenever the
user enters a number like 54 we already
have a customized function that is smart
enough to realize that they are entering
an integer and prints out that value but
if someone another user like user B
enters a float then we of course can
handle that too because our program
knows it's smart enough to realize that
we're passing it in a float so that's
why it chooses this so basically
whenever you use a function your
computer program is going to do this
it's going to look for a function with
that name if print number if it has more
than one choice then it looks what type
of data are you passing it in well if I
pass it in a float it's going to look at
this one the zips print number take a
float nope it takes an integer
does this print number take a float yes
it does so I'm going to use this one
right here so that's why whenever you
create a function you need to write the
name and also the type of data that
you're passing in so then whenever the
user tries to use it it knows what
function to use so that is basically all
function overloading is it's basically
making programs that are really simple
for the user even though they might take
us a little bit of extra coding hey when
we want to build software and we want to
sell for million dollars we're going to
want to make sure that it's easiest for
the user to use as possible because I
mean when we become a millionaire
this extra function is not going to be a
real big problem for us so that is how
you make million dollars and also that
is the basics of function overloading
basically many functions with the same
name just different data types so thank
you guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I don't know what I'm
going to be teaching in the next
tutorial but I got a feeling you guys
definitely want to check it out so again
thank you don't forget sub in I'll see
you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
