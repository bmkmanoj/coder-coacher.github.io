this video is actually going to be real
quick because all I'm going to do is
show you guys how to add a simple image
to your screen now before we get started
I want to mention this in the last
tutorial actually the last two tutorials
I kind of talk to you guys about the
basic structure for a project how your
directories are set up and I also
explained a couple simple things like
what all these methods do and batch in
how to clear your screen well a lot of
this functionality you use in almost
every game that you make for example
you're always going to have this create
method you're always going to have a
render method you're always going to
clear the screen and draw stuff on it so
instead of writing it in every single
video what I did is I wrote the basic
shell for everything one time for
example all of these methods and also
the batch which is used for drawing
stuff and wiping the screen of course
and I took all this code and I pasted it
in my forum so if you just go in the
forum whenever you're trying to use
these demos you just take this paste it
in and this is going to be my starting
point from now on
so anyways now I can move on to the
specific good stuff it'll speed up our
learning process a little bit more so
before we add image to the screen we
actually need an image in the project
and the location that you add that is
actually in Android you add it in your
assets folder so remember I said that
like 99% time we're going to stay out of
this folder well this is the 1%
exception so I'm just going to go to
actually let me just do this all right
so wherever your project is again mine
is named Bucky Blaster if you go to
Android and then assets again we already
have one by default that was the first
demo one and I have this image of I
don't know it's just something I was
posting on a the new Boston I made pizza
last night so I post it on my stream so
everyone could see and uh yeah so now
it's added and if you hop over back
show you guys so assets so there's the
pizza it was delicious
I really want pizza now should I pause
the video make a pizza no no no I'm not
that bad but uh alright all I can think
about is pizza now so cheesy alright so
the first thing I want to do in the code
is just initialize two variables so
what's going to happen is we're going to
add the image to our project using one
variable and then we need to convert it
to a sprite now sprite is a special type
of image pretty much that your game can
use it's used for collision detection
moving around pretty much a game image
so first drive it texture so this is
just going to be the raw image now to
store that in image and whenever we
convert it to a sprite of course we need
to store that in a sprite object and I
might as well just name it spray so now
in crate this is how we do all this and
it's actually really easy for the image
we're just going to set this equal to
new texture and the only parameter that
this takes is the name of this image as
a string so that's pizza ping all right
so now our image is initialized in other
words this is just a rotten egde we
can't add it to the game we can't use it
at all this is just image data a bunch
of pixels means nothing to game
development so let's go ahead and
initialize our spray object from the
sprite class now the one parameter that
we're going to pass in here is the image
itself so this is going to do is it's
going to take this graphic of the pizza
and initialize it as a sprite object in
other words convert to spring so now we
can use this object to do cool things
like well hold on my house is like
really dry for some reason because well
I know why because it's winter and I
couldn't open my windows for like the
last six months so I got the same crappy
air and yeah so I've like
problems or some but anyways that's
what's going on so far and remember
before you worry about using it at all
you need to remember to dispose of it
when you're done with it unless we want
tons of memory leaks so now again later
on I'm going to show you guys like cool
things like animation and moving around
and collision detection and bumping um
sprites into each other but for right
now we will just take this and draw it
on the screen I remember to draw it you
pass in batch and now let me go ahead
and kick this off dunt dunt dunt it down
alright so kick that off and now with
android start recording my phone in
alright so let me take my phone machi
holding in my hands look at that a nice
beautiful piece of pizza alright so
there you have it again pretty simple
stuff pretty basic how to take an image
convert it to spray draw it on your
phone
now that we are a little bit more
comfortable with game development we're
going to start getting into the good
stuff so in the next video I'm actually
going to be showing you guys something
useful in that his animations because
you're going to want to animate in
almost every game that you make not
often are you going to want to display
pictures of the pizza that I ate um so
yeah in the next tutorial is where
things get good I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
