probably the easiest way what you want
to do is you want to put plus and then
go ahead and write all of your crap that
you need to so I'll go ahead and put
like three or four movies on my very
first favorite movie of all time is ARMA
get it on oh that's a good one that's a
freaking classic right there
what's another movie I like oh let's see
position impossible position impossible
that is a great one and let's see let me
think of one more ah let's see Jamaican
me crazy uh making me crazy that is
that's a great one too all right now
let's just go ahead and end this
unordered list and wham bam thank you
ma'am
all right so now we've got our variable
s which is pretty much equal to an
unordered list now what we need to do is
pretty much take this variable and plop
it down right where this div is in
between this div so how do we do that
well the first thing we need to do is we
need to reference this div we pretty
much say okay we want to work with this
div so how does this javascript file
reference this div well we do it by the
ID so that's why it's very important to
have unique IDs in your HTML file
because if you just name it like ID 1
and you have a huge web page it's going
to get very confusing so go ahead and
another thing I like to do is whenever
I'm working in my JavaScript file I just
name my variables equal to the same
thing is whatever my div was named so
the variable is div movies and of course
in order to reference anything in your
web page just write a document and if
you don't know what the document is the
document is pretty much the body of your
web page so all the head stuff is like
you know for search engines in the title
to this big white thing is the body of
your web page so that is pretty much
what the document means you know in
JavaScript language it's the body so in
the document in the body
you get element by ID I think that
function is pretty self-explanatory and
the ID is div movies so basically this
div movies variable is equal to this
element right here so now we can go
ahead and edit it in JavaScript well
what do we want to do well we just want
to take that element and set the inner
HTML which is basically you know what's
going in here right you know it's pretty
self-explanatory inner HTML set it equal
to that list that we just created and
that list was named s so now if we go
ahead and save this and run this baby
check it out here are my favorite movies
are magetta Don positioned impossible in
Jamaican me crazy alright pretty freakin
sweet so one last time just the key
things I want to go over you know I want
to kind of pound this in your head what
you want to do whenever you're working
with Ajax and I know you know this
wasn't a true Ajax application but this
is basically important for setting up
any web page using Ajax you want to make
all the static content that isn't going
to change and then put all of the
dynamic content in preferably divs and
will work with something else aside from
dibs
but for these upcoming tutorials we're
going to be working you know mostly with
divs they're the easiest and make sure
they're just empty and give them a
unique ID and again what you want to do
is you want to call a function on load
and the reason that you don't put it in
the head is because whenever it's
referencing divs in the head it didn't
even know they exist yet so once the
entire web page loads then it can go
ahead and call this function in these
functions now have knowledge of this
HTML file in all the divs inside and
then you can create awesome applications
like this favorite movie list but for
now thank you guys for watching and in
the next tutorial I'm going to be
teaching you guys well it's going to be
awesome so thanks for watching now see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
