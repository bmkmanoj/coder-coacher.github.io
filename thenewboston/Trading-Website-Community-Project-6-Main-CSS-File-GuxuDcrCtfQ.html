video and in this video what I'm gonna
be doing is I'm going to be starting
styling the webpage and making it look a
little bit prettier so the first thing I
want to do is I want to make an overall
main CSS file and what this is going to
be is the CSS for every single web page
not one specific web page I'm talking
about the text color maybe the I don't
know just the overall links pretty much
the main styling that we need on every
single web page so I'm gonna go ahead
and make my little embed thing right
here link relative and the first thing I
want to do is link to this stylesheet
and we didn't create this yet but we
will in just a second and this will be
located and I like to put all of my CSS
files in a separate directory CSS and it
makes it so much easier than just
scattering your PHP files and mixing
them in with your CSS files and I'm
gonna name this main CSS and I remember
this main CSS file this is gonna be the
file that's included on every single web
page like I said it's responsible for
your links your text color styles that
you need on every single webpage I can't
stress that enough so now what I want to
do is since we linked to this we might
as well go ahead and create it right now
so let me just type something in and put
file save as new folder CSS and remember
inside this directory is where all of
our CSS files are going to be and this
one was named main dot CSS so there we
go
and now the very first thing we want to
do is we want to Center the webpage now
so many people have so much difficulty
centering a web page you think it would
just be easy but it's actually pretty
hard so let me show you guys that do
that first the first thing we want to do
before we even center the body is we
want to set all the margins to zero
pixels and all of the padding to zero
pixels as well and last but not least
list style
type none now the reason I'm doing all
this in applying this to all the
elements is some elements by default
they have default margins default
padding in the lists by default like
unordered lists and ordered lists they
have little things that appear next to
it
I am totally resetting everything so
we're gonna be responsible for every
little detail of every little item
complete control over our entire website
so now what I want to do is I want to
Center the body and in order to do that
naughty body text-align:center now this
doesn't mean that all the text on our
web page is going to be centered but
this is what we need to do so far to
Center the body font-family:arial and
for font size let's go ahead and set it
12 pixels by default and for the color
of all the font I really don't like
black because I don't know it just looks
like so standard so what I'm gonna do is
by default the color is gonna be 30 30
30 now this is a really dark grey it's
almost black but it just gives us a
little bit of styling that makes it a
little bit prettier than plain old black
so let me go ahead and the next thing I
want to do is I want to apply something
special to our HTML elements so for
html5 we have that header the nav which
is navigation section aside and footer
now a lot of people ask me this question
they said whenever you're making html5 I
understand a side and section kind of
but how are they different than div well
they're pretty much a side and section
and all of these elements are pretty
much the exact same thing as a div the
only difference is whenever like search
engines and stuff look at your website
it doesn't know the contents inside a
div it's saying okay is there a picture
in here is there text as their
navigation well html5 allows you to do
is like a div +1 it's like a div but
better
not only does it give you all the
functionality of a div but it also
explains the content type inside of that
section so that's the little background
I should have explained that in my html5
tutorials but I didn't what I want to do
is I want to display all of these as a
block now block is pretty much the
opposite of inline which you know
paragraphs and spans are inline you
should already know what that is as well
so after this we need to do a little
more styling and this is kind of a cross
browser compatibility thing now on
Google Chrome let me give you a little
bit of history about a browser on Google
Chrome whenever you have an image and
you want to link the image for example I
want this logo right here to link to my
website no matter if you're on the
search page or the register page
whenever you click this logo I want it
to link to the home page just like you
see there well on Google Chrome by
default whenever you have an image as a
link it doesn't display a border around
it but on Internet Explorer and Firefox
it does display a border around it so
that's kind of annoying because you're
trying to develop a website and it looks
different on different browsers so what
we're saying right here is on all of my
images no matter what browser you are I
don't want any borders on any of them so
this is pretty much the main styling for
the website now from here on what we
need to do is I'm gonna make a bunch of
different looking headers I already
tested around the looks of these so they
look beautiful and that's we're gonna be
doing in the next tutorial but make sure
you make your main CSS file store in a
CSS directory and make sure you link to
it in your register dot PHP and in the
next tutorial it's probably going to
take two tutorials actually to finish
the rest of the CSS file so anyways I'll
quit talking now thank you guys for
watching and subscribe yeah dear Lulu
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
