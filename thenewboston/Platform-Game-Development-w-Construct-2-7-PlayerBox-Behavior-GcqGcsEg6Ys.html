constructed tutorial and in this video
I'm actually gonna be clearing a lot of
stuff up and everything all your
thoughts are gonna be starting to come
together because I'm gonna be showing
you guys how these different things
react with one another so in the last
tutorial what I did is as you can see I
took this blue box and I added a
behavior called platform behavior to it
now under in the description we saw it
pretty much said react to all things
that are solid which pretty much means
anything that's solid this player just
won't fall through it however how does
it know what is solid and not well in
order for that game to determine what
kind of things
this player should jump on or be able to
jump on and fall through we need to give
the ground a solid property so in order
to do or excuse me a solid behavior I
don't want to say property so in order
to do that just go ahead and select one
of these tiles right here and what we
want to say is make this tile behave
like a solid object so just add a
behavior since that's how we want it to
behave oh yeah I forgot just texted me
again I'll tell you guys what we're all
said um where is it
so forget if you didn't watch the last
video someone got one of my friends told
me to go to google and type in people
coughing and then he goes doesn't it
look like everyone is giving the
Invisible Man a bj so that's I didn't
even look at Google but I'm sure it does
so thank you all for pointing that out
and uh that's what I have to deal with
it with my friends no no he's actually
pretty cool dude so once we have a
behavior that we want to add to this
tile click add and of course select
solid now I'll show you guys what that
platform behavior was it says jump in a
run between platforms pretty much this
dude can stand on solid objects anything
that has a platform so of course we want
to say the ground is going to behave
like a solid object so now you can see
we now added the solid behavior to this
ground right here and the cool thing
about this is since we can actually
close out of this variant now
as since these are instances instances
of this first one if you double-click
this works in me just click on any of
these other tiles you can see that they
have the solid behavior too and I talked
about instances in the last tutorial or
nonetheless soro in my last series on
construct to the beginner series and an
instance is basically a copy of this
that shares a lot of the same properties
so it's pretty cool whenever we do that
so we don't have to add the behavior to
every individual one so now it says this
block remember can now stand on the
solid ground it isn't invisible to it so
that's good but we have one little issue
we didn't tell the game yet to associate
this image with the block if we just
played the game right now we could go
left and right with a sim visible block
but the dude would stay there because
he's not actually connected to this even
though he looks like it so how do we do
that well in order to do that we
actually need a head over to the events
sheet and we're gonna add a new event
and again watch the last tutorial series
if you don't know what an event is but
basically double-click the space right
here or I actually like clicking this
link for some reason we're gonna add a
system event that happens on every tick
so double click system and click every
tick and hit done so basically we want
to check continuously for the game in
what do we wanna update well basically
we want an action to occur again every
pretty much tick and what we want to do
is i like swallowed a freaking tomato it
sounds like what we're going to do is we
want to add an action anyone choose
player and if you go down to size and
position you have to find it sighs
sparks use me set position to another
object under sizing position and double
click this what this is going to do is
is pretty much gonna say take that
player and set his position or put him
wherever another object
this so we're pretty much gonna say take
this player and put them exactly where
that box is so of course the object is
this box sprite too and for the image
point we're just gonna leave that as 0
and click done so now I'll show you guys
what's going on with the game so
basically we can move this guy around by
pressing left right and have him jump by
pressing up down but actually we aren't
moving this guy at all even though you
can't see it didn't even though it looks
like this to the player we're actually
moving that box up and down and left and
right and we know that we're moving the
box because this box has the platform
behavior meaning that he can jump on
solid objects however what we did in the
event she is we basically said take this
player which is this guy right here and
pretty much set his position to wherever
the boxes which is this right here and
the reason that we did that is now
whenever we do something like this
we go off the screen in his shoes go off
it actually is making sure that it's
it's actually checking for this blue box
right here instead of this entire um the
coin or whatever it is the coin would
like a tree in his hand whoever invented
this character is a little weird
anyways I'll show you so now before I'll
restart that game before it would just
fall off as soon as it got to this point
right here but now as as soon as his
shoes fall off he falls off so again
that's what we did and that's why you
need that little box right here rather
than this player and actually I forgot
to do one thing I actually want to
rename this box to player box
instead of spray too and also that
should update everything in your event
sheet as well whenever you change the
name so anyways now that we got all the
logic and now that we know how to make a
proper reaction box connect the image
we're ready to move on to next tutorial
so thank you guys for watching and I'll
see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
