tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing a how to edit XML documents
so for this tutorial we're going to need
to have an open button save button a
name text box our age into your input
and email text box so once you have that
on your form just go ahead and double
click on the Open button so for this
tutorial you're also going to need to
have an XML document created up here so
that we can use this X doc or this XML
document all over and all the methods in
our class right here so that when we
save it and go to save it we can access
this XML document also have a pack up
here so that we can access this path
when we're saving as well and just like
before I have an open file dialog a
filter on that Open File dialog make
sure the user actually selects a file in
the Open File dialog and set the path or
that string path equal to the Open File
dialog finally or the path to the file
if you leave it open the file dialog so
we can use this path in other places
then set that X document or X dot equal
to a new XML document so tell the
compiler of what X doc is um too many
load that XML document and then here
we're just setting text box ones text
equal to the person's name then are
setting a numeric up/down with value
equal to the person's age and then we're
just setting the text box x equal to the
person's so we already went over this
ruling stuff for so when you debug here
it should just read all the information
yep fine now we're going to go to save
it so you double click on the Save
button so the first thing that we're
going to want to do is set these values
so this enter text little something I'll
say this copy that and then paste it
down here we're going to set that equal
to text box and
so let me go edit it or change it we're
just going to set it equal to the
textbox last time so if we make a change
to it change it to like five or
something it'll change the actual text
of the inter tax as an ode to whatever
we change it to or something do the same
for versus age equal to odd mera top
downs value and we're going forward this
right here to a string this is called or
Estrella and finally we're going to say
to person B now and we're going to set
this equal to text box please
all right so we can't just do it at this
this will not save it we have to use the
save method so we're gonna have to do X
dot dot save and this save method calls
for of the path to the file that you
want to save so that's why we had to
create a path up here so now we can use
path to the file
all over here now just type in path and
now this should say to save it fine so
now we bug here open that XML document
you read everything fine you want to
change this like table T age like maybe
email anything any website save it and
it should save for us so now if we go
back to notepad plus plus it says it's
been edited we load it get Bob 100 and
calm and now our program commuted
perfectly fine yeah exactly this
attitude so that's pretty much it for
this tutorial on editing XML documents
so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
