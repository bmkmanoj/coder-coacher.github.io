came down from that peak right there
that's rare was all those weird rocks
around the other side of there and I
found this pond and I actually was over
there on that side and I tried to cross
or I tried to get closer to the pond and
it was way too deep if you can tell by
my boots I fell in the mud was like
going up to here so there's no way I
could walk so then I came over to this
side and I want to get closer to the pot
this is just a little stream well I
thought of a new way to fish where well
I'll show you guys later
but I still can't find a way to get
close to the pump without sinking in so
right this isn't the pond I'm talking
about this is just a little stream that
leads to the pond the pond is over there
but uh I'm gonna try to get closer to
the pond
and hopefully I find some frogs or some
fish because I need to eat today that's
my number one objective
get some food in my stomach well finally
found this little Brook right here and
it leads into the pond but the thing is
I tried walking in and just like before
when I tried to walk it from the other
side over there it's just as you can see
it's not rock you like the other ones
this one gets muddy and there's no way I
can get anywhere close to that pond so I
think what I'm gonna try to do is go up
in this direction right here because I
came from over there I really don't know
what direction I'm heading in since I
broke my compass but I think the plan is
just instead of taking the stream or the
creek to the pond then I'm just gonna
take it away because they usually
connect bigger bodies of water from my
experience out here so far so
I think that's what I'm gonna do so far
so I'll walk along here for I don't know
however long long it takes and when I
find something I'll let you guys know
all right so it's late in the afternoon
day six and right now my spirits are
very high because after walking first of
all after finding out that I can't
access that pond that I wanted to access
to go fishing I walked along that little
stream and it turned into this right
here check it out first of all these
woods are incredibly easy to walk
through and now I found this river right
here definitely the coolest River
I found yet and this is actually really
deep let me go ahead and climb up on
this rock this is actually really deep
so I'm really hoping that there's some
fish in here let's check it out so aside
from that I got some nice sand which is
much better than um you know having to
walk through that muck or that muddy
stuff or you know sticks thick that a
beaver pond I went to so this is
probably one of the coolest things that
I've found yet even though I am starving
like I've never been starving for my
spirits are incredibly high right now
and what I'm gonna do now is I'm going
to show you guys this new thing I
thought of yesterday and well hopefully
it can catch me some fish so I want to
use this rope to pretty much act as a
fishing line and catch some fish I don't
know if you guys can tell but this is
way too thick right now if I put a hook
on this and I'm gonna have to make a
hook no fish is ever ever gonna fall for
that but what I did discover is this
check it out
if you cut it inside you have these
little strands of rope right there and I
think I'm hoping that these will be thin
enough where if I tie a bunch of them
together then I can make a fishing line
and I could whittle a hook and put it on
the end of that and hopefully I'll be
fishing in a fish will be dumb enough to
bite onto it and I can get finally
something to eat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
