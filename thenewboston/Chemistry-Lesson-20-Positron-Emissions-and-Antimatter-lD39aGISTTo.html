20th chemistry tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm going to be talking about
positron emission now in order to
understand positron emission we first
need to understand what the heck a
positron even is so if we take a look at
the definition it says the antimatter
counterpart of the electron okay that
sounds like something you would find in
a superhero movie so what is it so a
positron is basically in everyday terms
an electron that has a positive charge
not a negative charge so you know how I
said probably in the last video two
videos ago that sometimes some really
weird stuff happens inside the nucleus
well this is one of those cases
sometimes in the nucleus you can lose a
proton so let me just go ahead and write
this out and it could actually turn into
a neutron which has zero charge and an
electron with a positive charge kind of
freaky huh and this electron with a
positive charge is what we refer to as
the positron it's basically the opposite
of an electron and in fact whenever you
have a positron that collides with an
electron a huge bundle or burst of
energy is released in both particles get
completely destroyed so pretty weird huh
if you ever heard the term energy and
matter cannot be created or destroyed
well in this case you can take two
pieces of matter and collide them and
convert them into energy so that's true
some of the time but not in this case so
let me go ahead and show you guys an
example of when indeed you would have
this it happens a lot with the element
potassium-40
and you're right that 40:19 K is a
symbol for potassium how they got that
is beyond me but this can go ahead and
convert to
40:18 and then since we have a new
atomic number it's actually a new
element its argon and you also have this
positron in your eight positrons zero
plus 1e and again that positron right
there is basically the whole concept
design behind positron and
so what exactly is going on here well
first of all we're taking a proton in
the nucleus of the potassium and
converting it to a neutron and a
positron
so that is why since protons and
neutrons have the exact same mass that
our mass number is going to stay the
same however since we're losing a proton
basically that's why our atomic number
goes down from 19 to 18 so basically we
have a new element that's formed that
has the same mass but one less proton
and we also have a positron that gets
emitted from the nucleus and that's
basically it
so let me think the positron gets
emitted from the nucleus yeah yeah I
think I covered everything so just
remember that it loses a proton but it
gains a neutron and you get a positron
emitted and also that a positron is
antimatter which is kind of weird
because you can have two forms a matter
that collide and completely destroy each
other and turn into just plain a burst
of energy and we're going to be talking
about more on that later on but in the
next tutorial we have to go for yet
another really weird thing but but I
just can't skip these things I need to
teach you guys these things it's
actually pretty cool it's called
electron capture so that's what you have
to look forward to in the next tutorial
thank you guys for watching and I will
see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
