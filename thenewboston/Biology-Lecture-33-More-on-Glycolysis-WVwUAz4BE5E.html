biology video and in this video I want
to pick up where I left off in the last
video and that would be it step let me
draw my step forward because in the last
video we went through steps 1 2 3 and we
ended up with a molecule called C 6 H 10
I drop my tens weird my tens look like
six is 1006 P 2 and of course we called
this molecule fructose 1 6 by phosphate
and what happens now is an enzyme caller
out of lace actually splits this
molecule into two smaller molecules so
it splits and then two molecules and the
molecules are c3 h5 o 3 p1 and another
molecule it has the same formula c3 h5 o
3 p1
now the reason that I didn't just want
to write two of the same molecules is
that well let's go ahead and take note
of what we did here we started with a
six carbon molecule right here and now
we have two three carbon molecules one
right here and one right here however
these two three carbon molecules the one
on the left and one on the right they're
actually isomers what you mean they have
a different structure or if we were to
look at them on a really cool powerful
microscope they would have a different
shape so one of these is die hot die
hydroxy acetone phosphate and another
run is glyceraldehyde phosphate so again
even though they look the same whenever
I'm writing them they have a different
structure and that's why we call them
isomers now let's go ahead and move on
to step 5 since we now have our two
isomers right here that's our starting
point for step 5 so step 5
what we do in step number five is
actually one of the easiest steps what
we use is an enzyme called triose
phosphate isomerase and it turns one of
those molecules into the other one so
remember that I said with that we had
two molecules that had the same
molecular formula but different
structure we're pretty much gonna take
one of those and turn it into the other
one so we're gonna be left with two
identical molecules and the way this
works ed is it actually takes the
molecule I mean give my color dye
hydroxy make sure you spell this very
acetone phosphate I hope I spelled that
right dihydroxyacetone phosphate which
was what you say it's the one on the
left
why not and it turns it into the
molecule and I'm probably going to run
out of room here
glyceraldehyde phosphate and hopefully
sra smelling but basically what we need
to take away here is the result of step
number five is the enzyme which is
called triose phosphate isomerase we
have two identical molecules of this
glyceraldehyde phosphate right now so
right now remember the key thing to take
away we now have two identical molecules
so for the rest of these steps even
though I'm gonna be teaching you guys
about I'm gonna show you guys basically
what I done up to this point how the
molecule is changing and how we get
energy from it remember that each of
these processes actually occurs twice
one for each molecule but it would be
stupid for me to you know write the same
chemical you know reactions twice just
remember that since this molecule is now
this one we now have two of these
molecules so all the processes or
processes once who met es is there that
happened from this point forward are
actually going to happen twice
one for each molecule so now that's all
step 5 is turning one molecule into the
other one so now let's go to step number
6 step 6
now what step 6 does is it uses the
enzyme triose phosphate dehydrogenase
and what this enzyme does is let me go
ahead and draw the enzyme because this
is actually a pretty important enzyme I
think I drew my enzyme like this earlier
on what this enzyme does is it first
takes a hydrogen ion from glyceraldehyde
phosphate which is remember the molecule
that we have to up and it gives it to
another molecule called nad plus to form
in a D H and we're gonna be talking
about these nad krappa later on but for
free now I just want to show you guys
that this is where it happens and even
though you guys don't understand what
this molecule does now and why it's
important it's important later on but
for now just remember that this is the
point in glycolysis where it's made and
they're going to be useful later on
which you'll see so basically we have
glyceraldehyde phosphate which is c
you guys remember h5 sure my H a little
neater o3 p1 and what this enzyme does
right here is it takes a hydrogen ion
which is right here
these are parentheses on the left-hand
and right-hand side of that and it gives
that ion to and gives it to so see it
gives this hydrogen ion to another
molecule called n a d-plus and whenever
you give a hydrogen ion right there to
NAD+ it forms a molecule called n a d h
so basically we're plopping this enzyme
right here is responsible for plopping a
hydrogen ion off of this glyceraldehyde
phosphate and it gives it to nad plus in
the final thing we need to take away
from here is in step number six we form
n a d H now another thing that the
enzyme does is it adds a phosphate group
and the phosphate group comes from the
cytosol
which is pretty much the fluid inside
the cytoplasm and it adds a phosphate
group to glyceraldehyde phosphate to
form one three this is you know another
long word I'll go ahead and write the
structure for it's probably going to be
a little bit easier what it does is it
takes a phosphate again this is the
enzyme that is responsible for this so
once it's done doing all this crap its
job isn't done yet
it takes a phosphate from the cytosol
and it adds it to let me go ahead and
change my color see it didn't change c3
h5 o 3 P 1 which is remember this right
here and whenever you take a phosphate
and add it to this it now becomes this C
3 H and be careful look at my molecular
formula Oh
for P 2 you feel like okay wait a minute
I think you messed up
three okay that's good H four okay
hydrogen yeah Oh four wait a minute you
have another oxygen added on here what
the heck is going on here because I
thought you were just adding a phosphate
well actually what we're doing is we're
adding a phosphate group and what a
phosphate group is is a phosphate of
course but it has some other atoms
attached to it and people just name it
phosphate group because the phosphate is
the key the core backbone of it but the
reason that we have another oxygen or we
gained another oxygen here is because
that's how the phosphate group is bonded
on so just to recap one last time we
have an extra oxygen because that's how
the phosphate group was bonded on so now
our final product of step six is C 3 H 4
o 4 P 2 but remember we have two
molecules of these because this step is
occurring once for each molecule because
remember that main molecule that we were
working with split in half so one last
time step number six it can get really
confusing
this enzyme here does a lot of work this
is one of the hardest working enzymes in
glycolysis the first thing it does is it
takes a hydrogen ion from this molecule
right here c3 h5 o 3 p1 and this is
called glyceraldehyde phosphate and it
gives it to NAD+ and whenever you give a
hydrogen ion to nad plus you form n a D
H and this is very important later on
right now you're like okay this is just
stupid but this is actually extremely
important later on so once it's done
doing that job this enzyme isn't done
working yet what it does then is it gets
a phosphate from it's pretty much a
phosphate that's floating around
yourself and it gives it to c3 h5 o 3 P
1 to form C 3 H 4 o 4 P 2 so this is the
molecule that we're going to be working
with at the beginning of step 7 and
remember that the phosphate group is
bonded on by an oxygen so that's where
we get another oxygen but the important
key to take away on on this is we now
have two molecules of this crap right
here so that's where we're going to be
start
in the next tutorial but for now thank
you guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I'll see you guys next
