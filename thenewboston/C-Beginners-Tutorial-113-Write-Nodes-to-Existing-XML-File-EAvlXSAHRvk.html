tutorial that I'm making for through
Boston and in this tutorial I'm Emma
showing you how to add nodes to an
existing XML document so for example I'm
going to show you how to add another
person into this people military so for
this tutorial you're going to need to
have a button a name text box and a
generic up-down and email text box and
once you have that all in your form just
go ahead and double click on add person
and under here just create a new XML
document and just load the document that
we created in the previous tutorial so
in this XML document that you load you
should have at least one person inside
of it the first thing that we're going
to want to do is create a new XML node
or create another person node so we're
going to do right here these say XML
node always call it person and we're
going to study equal to this document
right here dot the neat element and an
element is basically just this right
here it doesn't have like the end of it
and it doesn't have with things inside
of it it's just the beginning of it
right there the word is going to give a
name to it person alright so now we have
our person node now we're going to want
to create another node for the person's
name so as we say XML know-it-alls call
it follow name and we will study equal
to another element and we're just going
to call this element name alright so now
we're going to want to set the courses
name so in order to do that we're going
to do name dot and air text and we're
going to set this equal to whatever the
user inputs in this name text box right
here so we're going to put text box box
text
and next we're going to have to add this
person node that we hear this name node
that we created into this person node
because right now c-sharp compiler
doesn't know what to do with this name
node so we're going to want to add it
into this person node so we're just
going to say person dot append child or
basically just add it into it or add
another children child node so we're
just going to add name and next we're
going to have to add this person node
into our document
so when you say document.documentelement
dot and child and we're just going to
add the person person and basically what
this will do is it will add it into the
root node so since this is like the root
node it will just add it into here and
the last thing that we're going to want
to do is save our documents so that all
the changes that we've made will
actually save so to save doc save and
we're just going to put the path the
file do and save say mona lily alright
so once again what this will do right
here is basically just create another
person then we're going to create
another name node or another node for
this person and this will just display
the person's name then we're going to
want to set the inner text of this name
node or basically just the text in
between here equal to whatever name that
the user puts in this text box then
we're going to want to add that name
node into the person mode then we're
going to add the person node into the
root node or into this people node right
here and then we're just going to save
the document so that all the changes
that we made will then save so now I'm
going to bug here enter a person named
Alice after Bob with add person we
should now have another person in our
XML document right here if we have
another person and their name is Bob and
we can very easily just add their email
age as well
so actually understand
to meet this review all right so now in
order to add their age and email all
we're gonna have to do right here is
just create two more nodes one for their
email and one for age age right here set
the text of X to age or the name of the
node to age or I want another one called
email and you know then I want to set
the intertext we now equal to whatever
the user inputs in this text box 3 right
here and same thing of the age or so
pages intertext equal to whatever value
you put some in your clock down so in
America up down value into a string
since it's represented as an integer and
then we're just going to want to add
this age into the person though so it's
all the same person
same thing with the email all right so
now everything should be good it should
add their name their age and their you
know so it's like Bob right here that is
a HD like 34 email I guess Bob at gmail
top add the person go back to our XML
document here and there we go we have
another person their name is Bob or 34
and their email in fob at gmail.com so
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
