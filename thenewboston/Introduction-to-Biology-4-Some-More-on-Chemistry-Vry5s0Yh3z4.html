which is the way compounds are written
for example water dihydrogen monoxide is
written as H to O this means that there
are two molecule two atoms of hydrogen
combining with one atom of oxygen to
form water the literal subscript right
here tells you the number of atoms that
are in said compound and if there is no
subscript then it is implied that it is
one we have sodium chloride one atom of
sodium and one atom of chlorine and
acetic acid or vinegar two atoms of
carbon four atoms of hydrogen and two
atoms of oxygen we have an empirical
formula that shows the smallest number
of atoms in a compound for example
acetic acid the empirical formula is
going to be ch2o molecular formula shows
the actual number of atoms in a molecule
acetic acid again there's actually two
atoms of carbon four atoms of hydrogen
and two atoms of oxygen and finally the
structural formula gives information
about the arrangement of atoms acetic
acid can also be written like this
ch3cooh this means you got your carbon
here with three hydrogen's on it you got
a carbon here and then it's attached to
two O's and then the o is attached to an
H we next have chemical equations these
are how chemical reactions are written
and a chemical reaction you have
reactants which are what are used to
form products water is formed by
hydrogen gas and oxygen gas water is
formed by hydrogen gas oxygen gas that's
what it's just sit sorry anyways these
chemical equations have to be
you balanced just like a math equation
you have to have the same number of
things on the left side as the right
side so in order to balance this
equation we start off you have two atoms
of hydrogen two atoms of oxygen but on
the right side you have two atoms of
hydrogen but only one atom of oxygen so
in order to balance the equation you
have to add what are called coefficients
which are just numbers before the
reactant so to balance this equation you
want two molecules of hydrogen gas one
molecule of oxygen gas and then you have
two molecules of water this is a
multiplier so you have two oxygens four
hydrogen's which equal two oxygens and
four hydrogen's now we move on to
chemical bonding there are a couple of
different types of chemical bonds that
can be formed the first example is the
first type is on ionic bond ions are
atoms with a charge like chloride ion
sodium ion this means that an atom has
either gained or lost electrons remember
if you gain or lose protons you change
the element so for example you have your
sodium atom here your chlorine atom here
this is just going to take an electron
to form a bond because like I said you
either want to have a completely full
valence shell or a completely empty
valence shell excuse me so this chloride
chlorine atom right here is going to
take this electron from sodium sodium
valence shell is empty chlorines valence
shell is pull these types of bonds don't
four molecules and it's basically just
an attraction so you could have
a sodium atom here with a bunch of
different chlorine atoms attracted to it
because both of these atoms have a
charge on them sodium is going to have a
plus one charge chlorine is going to
have a negative one charge these bonds
are pretty weak they for and whenever
you dissolve salt in water it's going to
form ions complete covalent bonds form
when atoms share electrons this means
electrons are going to spend some time
on all the atoms for example you have
nitrogen gas which is written into you
have your electron density cloud right
here which is where the electrons can be
found orbiting around the nucleus these
electrons are going to be attracted to
the other nucleus for example these
electrons are going to be attracted to
this atom's nucleus so eventually these
electrons are going to be shared
covalent bond forms the same thing
happens here with methane ch4 electrons
are all shared there's one electron from
hydrogen shares with one electron phone
carbon carbon has four electrons that
can be shared so it's going to share all
four electrons with four different
hydrogen's shared electrons are called
an electron pair you have a single bond
when one pair of electrons are shared a
double bond when two pairs of electrons
are shared and a triple bond when three
pairs of electrons are shared sing about
share two electrons double bonds share
four electrons triple bonds share six
electrons and when electrons spend more
time on one particular atom you get what
is called a polar bond polar covalent
bond this means that each atom is going
to have a partial charge oxygen is going
to pull electron density from hydrogen
so oxygen is going to have a partial
negative charge hydrogen is going to
have a parcel back
partial positive charge and the last
thing I'm going to talk about in this
video because it's already 13 minutes
long is hydrogen bonds these result from
the weak electrical attraction between a
partially positive hydrogen atom and a
partially negative Adam the ones you
need to remember our oxygen nitrogen and
sulfur those are the big ones in organic
systems living systems but basically
what's going to happen is you're going
to have this partial positive on your
hydrogen atoms I partial negative on
your oxygen atoms and these are just
going to form really weak attractions
the partial positive hydrogen atom is
going to be attracted to the partial
negative oxygen atom and these just form
a bunch of different little bonds in
water but I'm sorry this video was so
long but there's a lot of stuff to cover
I know this is very brief or not very
detailed but this is just the basics of
what you need to know for biology</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
