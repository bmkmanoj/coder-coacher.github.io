perpendicular lines soap airlines do not
intersect so if you look these two lines
have an equal distance between them and
they will never intersect and we denote
parallel lines with these little arrows
so those two lines are parallel and
these two lines are parallel so
perpendicular lines intersect to form
right angles and we denote this by a
little square just like we denote any
any kind of right angle so each one of
these angles right here is the right
angle so they all measure 90 degrees so
now that we know what parallel and
perpendicular lines are we're gonna name
a few so name two sets of parallel lines
well if we start with segments Ln we
know that Ln is parallel to mo because
they both have these little lines on
them so Ln is parallel to mo and that's
how we write parallel lines with these
two little lines right right here so the
second set if I look for to tick marks
there is LM and n oh and that makes
sense because if I were to extend these
lines on
forever and ever and ever they would
never intersect so line LMK is parallel
to n.o
name two sets of perpendicular lines so
like we said perpendicular lines
intersect to form right angles so we
know that none of the parallel lines can
also be perpendicular so if we look
we've got a right angle right here and
Ln this segment right here and n 0 meet
intersect to form a right angle so that
means Ln is parallel excuse me is
perpendicular to n 0 and if you look at
this other right angle right here it's
formed when LM and Mo intersect so that
means segment LM is parallel to line
segment em oh well that's all we're
gonna do today with parallel and
perpendicular lines but next time we're
going to talk about other kinds of
angles that can be formed when two lines
intersect to make sure you come check it
