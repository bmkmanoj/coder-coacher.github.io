looked at now what we're doing is we're
actually putting the vet the data that
we're typing into here into practice and
we keep creating this query which is
selecting from a database where it
equals something and then a wild-card so
a for example returns Alex Garrett and
Alex Malcolm because we have a and the
rest is a world card now as I start to
type Alex space we're still matching the
first 1 2 3 4 5 characters of when I
type of G Malcolm will disappear we're
not have an EM Malcolm will stay there
so we're basically updating this now
depending on what's typed in so we can
then type Dale and we can do the same
with Devon type G or M we can do with
Craig Craig the only one in the database
if we type now okay this is another
problem that we've we've got if we go
back to nothing now what's happened is
it's selected everything that doesn't
equal nothing and then a wild-card so
this all of this is classed as a
wild-card now because we've got nothing
in front of it so what we need to do is
we need to create an if statement in
here to say if in fact we can do it
above this here to be a lot better so if
not empty
search Oh God search text then run all
of this and let's indent that so if not
empty search text then run all of this
and let's bring this all in to make it
look a little bit neater okay so let's
go back to our page and refresh and see
if we fix this problem so I took can
type Alex Garrett
Alex Malcom you'll see that as we go on
then our results disappear so let's go
all the way back to the start and you
can see that everything disappears and
we don't just get a list of everything
up there so we've learnt in this
tutorial again how to create our Ajax
request here but we've added we've added
in this get parameter here so we've
added in a variable that's called search
text then what we've done is we've done
our usual we've sent this request and on
the key up so we've we've included this
onkeyup event and then every time a keys
as released from the keyboard so we
press down and then up we run this find
match function and that goes through to
our request our Ajax request brings back
the value from this from our PHP file in
which we've connected to the database
and searched for relevant names using
our wildcard character just at the end
here and then what we're doing is we're
returning this value to a results div
down here so essentially we created what
you would normally find doesn't
autosuggest
now like I said at the start of the
tutorial we're not including how to make
this look pretty or incorporate sort of
the white the most widely used or widely
typed values I mean by all means go and
try this for yourself because it's quite
easy all you need to do is modify your
statement to say something like where
where count or amount searched is oh no
you wouldn't say where you'd say order
by so you could order it by times
searched for example if you were keeping
track of how many times this value had
been searched so we also need to bear in
mind that when you want to submit this
form it will actually submit to where
you said where you want it to submit if
you were to put the action in here so
the part of the find matches on key opps
fine but you can actually add an action
to go to another page PHP for example
and you can say search for Alex
guarantee so yeah alex karras there
press ENTER and it will let's go back
and refresh that so Alex yeah okay so
it's gone to another page and you've
still got your search text variable in
there so you can you can create this as
normal but what we've done is we've
talked about how to do this with the
fire match function here which is going
to then return it to the div and of
course this div you can use CSS to
attach it to your form if you're good at
CSS even if you're not have a look look
it up and see if you can find anything
to do there you can also think about
creating these as hyperlinks so they
automatically search for you so we could
do something like let's say we were
submitting to another page eventually
you can create hyperlinks in here so you
could say a href equals another page dot
PHP search text equals and then you
could have
you could have the query row name in
here as well so what you're actually
doing is you are creating a hyperlink
out of this so hopefully that makes
sense to you let's just go Alex right so
what you're getting is you're getting a
hyperlink now and if you look at the
bottom of the page you can see that it
says another page dot PHP search text
equals Alex kara if we hover over this
one at the bottom it says search text
equals Alex Malcolm so you can actually
predefined links that will then submit
to your original search page so if you
had this as a search field you can have
it submit so there's plenty of things
you can do with it but for now this is
the basics of an autosuggest type thing
it's also to just type code in PHP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
