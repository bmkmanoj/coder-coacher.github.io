eighth java tutorial in this tutorial
I'm going to be talking about a new type
of data and that's called an int and
what it is is pretty much not like
double before where you had numbers like
three point five four or you could use
fractions or decimal points with int it
stands for integer and integers are
whole numbers like 6 or 75 or 76 and you
can only use whole numbers without a
fraction and no decimal point so another
thing at one point now is whenever you
use int like to defy divide and multiply
and add and subtract
whenever you use two intz to do these
operations your answer is also an int so
even if your number comes uneven like
11/4 that doesn't divide evenly but when
you try to do it on your computer with
an int you get an int as a result so let
me show you guys with edit let's go
ahead and make three variables girls
boys and people and let's go ahead and
set these to some values let's go ahead
and we'll start out with showing you all
of the math operators girls equals six
boys equals three and people equals
girls plus boys now I showed you guys
how to use this math operator and the
last one the plus sign to get a simple
sum so now we can go ahead and the sum
of girls plus boys is now stored in
people so I've put system dot out print
line and in our parameter go ahead and
put what is it people and now if we go
ahead and run this we get nine since six
plus nine excuse me 6 plus 3 is 9 and so
that is how you can use addition with
Java but addition isn't the only thing
you can use you can use minus or
subtraction to get the difference which
6 minus 3 is 3
you can also do some other cool ones in
the symbol for multiply is actually the
asterisk which is that little symbol
above the eight so whenever you want to
multiply make sure to use that as you
can see six times three is eighteen
divided is a special one now whenever
you do this you're going to get two but
let me show you guys something where if
you divide it uneven say you wanted to
divide eleven by three let's go ahead
and see what our result is three well we
all know that 11 divided by three
doesn't equal three what it equals is
three point something nine divided by
three actually equals three so what
exactly is going on here well Java said
all right you want to work with intz
well it's our whole number so whenever
you ask the question in intz i'm going
to give you an int so if you want to get
um this number exact you need to use
double so go ahead and press ok and
there's your answer three point six six
so that's difference between in and
double it gives you whole numbers and
double gives you um like a fraction of a
number or numbers with the decimal
points so anyways there's one more thing
that I can help you out with when using
instead of I'd and that's something
called the modulus now we all know that
3 goes into 11 3 times in that will give
me 9 but you have two things left over
whenever you do that and that's where
the modulus comes in the modulus pretty
means alright when you divide by a
number by a number you get a whole
number
aka an int but you also have some left
over so let's go ahead and run this and
see what we get it says 2 in the modulus
if you remember from math class this is
another way of finding the remainder so
again when you divide by 11 by 3 you get
9 I mean excuse me you get 3 which 3
times 3 is 9 but you have 2 left over so
that's where that 2 comes from
whatever's left over
is the modulus so that's how you can use
the modulus along with int to find the
exact value so again let me give you
guys one more example this one might be
easier if you have 7/3 you're going to
get the answer to but you're going to
have one left over so if you divided by
two such is this you're going to get the
answer to but if you have the modulus
you're going to get to answer one since
you have one left over right there and
that believe it or not is going to be
useful in a bunch of things that you
won't even expect like when we're
finding random numbers and stuff that
I'm going to be teaching you later but
for now I just wanted to show you guys
what the int variable type was and also
how to use different math operators so
uh thank you guys for watching practice
this little um I don't know what this
program is girls and boys and people
counters I guess and once you get good
at all the math operators you're ready
to move on to my next tutorial so again
thank you guys for watching make sure to
subscribe and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
