awesome chemistry video and in this
video I want to talk to you guys about
the barns bottle oops
not that one the barns bottle now you
guys have probably seen this before but
you may not know exactly what it's used
for and it's easily identified because
it has really thick glass walls in
comparison to the other glassware we
typically use in chemistry lab and it
also has a rubber bulb or a rubber
stopper on top and I'll talk to you guys
about why it has this in a little bit
now some people actually call these
dropping bottles because well for
obvious reasons drop drop drop drop drop
so basically whenever you're searching
for it or buying them online make sure
to type in barns bottles or dropping
bottles because different manufacturers
are going to list them under different
things
I call them barns bottles because it's I
feel like it's the more proper term it
was actually named after a guy named
Albert Barnes I don't know how they got
the name from that I guess he lived in a
barn or something but basically what it
is is a container that used to store
chemicals but only the chemicals that
you want to use in very precise amounts
aka drops whenever you want to deliver
like 200 milliliters at a time is better
to use a beaker but whenever you're
working with very precise measurements
and you need to deliver it and drops
then check it out
pretty frickin handy drop drop drop drop
drop now as you can see it's made up of
a couple different components it's
usually a big thick glass bottle and
also a quest pipette pipette however you
want to say it and also this rubber bulb
is not only a dropper so you can suck up
the liquid and drop it in little by
little but it's also a plug for the
container so pretty freakin cool
dual purposes there so that's basically
the basics of a Barns bottle aka a
dropping bottle now you're going to find
that whenever you're shopping for Barn's
bottles you usually just can't buy one
or two they usually come in a set of
either five or ten or sometimes a dozen
this set right here came with all the
bottles and the rack and I think it was
twelve dollars plus shipping and you
definitely want to
you know even though you may think that
you may not use it a lot these are
actually really handy so if you're
starting a home chemistry lab or you're
gonna start making meth or anything
these things are actually going to be
really handy definitely worth the
investment and another thing is I kind
of mentioned before make sure that when
you first buy them to get a rack this
rack is going to keep everything
organized and sometimes these bottles
are used as indicators with the lowest
strength going to the highest strength
so it's really easy
or should I say it getting it really
confusing whenever they're all mixed up
but when you have a rack it makes them
nice and organized so again this set
right here I got off Amazon it was
twelve dollars plus shipping and well
that's all I got to say about that so
thank you guys for watching and I'll see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
