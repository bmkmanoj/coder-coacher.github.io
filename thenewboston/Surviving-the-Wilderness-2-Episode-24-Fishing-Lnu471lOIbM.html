all my line right here I've been being
careful not to tangle it and I have my
rock right here it's going to act as a
weight so that way whenever I throw it
to cast it out it's a lot easier to
throw if you have some kind of weight on
it and the last thing is of course the
hook right here which just showed you
guys earlier so here we have it see if I
can get some fish with it
well the good news is there are fish in
there I saw him I don't know what kind
they are but they're not a bad size and
the bad news is I didn't catch any I put
a slug on here that I found under a rock
and they were going around the slug and
I think whenever I casted this and it
fell off but um anyways I think I'm
gonna spend the night here
I'll probably just wash my clothes make
a fire tonight eat some worms from under
rocks and I guess I'm going to try to
fish again tomorrow I really really
really want to catch a fish so that's
the plan</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
