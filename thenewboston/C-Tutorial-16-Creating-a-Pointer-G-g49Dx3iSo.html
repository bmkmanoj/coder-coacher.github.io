tutorial on pointers now in the last
tutorial I told you guys how to make an
address operator to show you guys where
in your memory the variables were stored
and in this tutorial I'm going to be
showing you guys how to make a pointer
and what pointer is is a variable that
holds the address in your memory so it
pretty much is a variable that points to
the address in your memory just saying
it twice but so the first thing that
we're going to want we're going to want
to do when we're building a pointer is
declare the points or tell C++ that
we're going to be working with it so the
first thing that you need to do is tell
what type of data you're going to be
working with is it and this is the same
type of data that you're going to be
using for your variable for example if
this is a char or double then you're
going to want our a chart or double and
declaring your variable but since this
is an integer you're going to want to
write integer for your pointer so we
have an integer pointer in the syntax to
declare a pointer is star and it's
actually called asterisks it's a symbol
above the a but I usually call it a star
so just deal with it and then you can
name your pointer anything you want I'm
going to name my pointer because I am
that creative and then once you're done
declaring your pointer c++ goes alright
I can see that you're going to be
working with a pointer but what do you
want to point to what address in your
memory that do you want to point to and
sense it as we have to answer it we've
got all right since we already have this
variable called pointer that we just
declared right here you don't need to
use the asterisk because that's just
declaring it we're going to say alright
our variable pointer is equal to the
address and remember from our last
tutorial we use the ampersand for the
address arm it's the location of our the
memory you use the ampersand and it
shows you where the address is and you
can use any of these finger eyes I'm
going to use finger
so so far just to recap we declared a
pointer called pointer and then we told
Co + + alright this pointer is equal to
whatever the address of memory is a
finger so to prove you guys prove to you
guys that this is worth I'm going to
output on the screen pointer and if
everything goes right
then this should output on the screen
the memory in your address that finger
is equal to again if I output it the
variable finger it would be equal to 10
but since I outputted the address of
memory where it points to it should be
some crazy hexadecimal code so come on
compile no whammy no whammy come on
hexadecimal code and there we go
it says 0 x2 to FF 44 and again this is
the address in your memory that your
pointer is pointing to so again to recap
one more time and if you're saying
alright this is really confusing it's
because well it is confusing pretty much
C++ is confusing but I'm trying to make
you guys it real easy for you guys we
have a variable we declared the variable
and we declared the pointer and what a
pointer does is pretty much point to the
space in your memory
so what spacing move your memory D 1.2
we want to point to wherever in your
memory the variable finger is so in
right here we just output it on the
screen where is it this is your place in
your memory on your computer this is
what your computer's seen right now
that's where your variable finger is
stored so this will make a lot more
sense when we actually use it to do
something useful but for right now just
study this tutorial learn how to build a
basic pointer and learn the basics of
what does in my next couple tutorial
this is all going to come together and
it's going to be a lot more useful in
your app
so thanks for watching remember to go to
my site the new boss and calm and I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
