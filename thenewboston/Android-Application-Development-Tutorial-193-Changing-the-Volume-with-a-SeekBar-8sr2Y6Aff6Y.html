tutorial for the new boss in what we're
gonna do in this tutorials basically set
up our seek bar and adjust our volume so
it's gonna be pretty much completing
this activity and just to make reference
of why we set up the max value and the
current value is what we're gonna do is
we're going to access our seek bar and
we're gonna say hey the maximum value is
going to be the same as the maximum
value of our audio manager or the
maximum value our phone will allow and
then why we set the current value is
right when our activity starts we're
going to set this bar equal to wherever
the current volume is on the person's
phone and then what we're gonna do is
we're gonna use that method called on
progress change and when we you know
change the progress of our bar it's
actually going to change the volume of
of the person's device through again the
audio manager so that's pretty much what
we're gonna do in this tutorial so let's
drop let's jump right into it and again
what we need to do is we need to set the
maximum value of our seat bar if you
guys aren't using you know the volume
you can set this to whatever like a
thousand and then you know as your
progress changes you can get that value
that nth value like if you're halfway
through that'd be like five hundred or
something but since we're working with
volume we want to have it equal to the
maximum volume that we can get through
our Audio Manager so what we're going to
say is we're gonna say SB for seek bar
and then we're gonna say set max and
this is the maximum volume again this is
the highest or seek bar is going to
allow us to go and what we want to set
this maximum volume to equal is
basically the maximum volume I'm sorry
we want this max value equal is the max
value or the max volume that we can run
so again we can't go any higher than the
maximum volume here and again that's why
we set up that end and now what we need
to do is we need to set where we want
the progress bar to start and we're
going to set that equal to again
wherever the current position is or the
current volume on the person's phone is
so we're gonna say SB dot set progress
and again it takes an nth value and
that's why we set up our current volume
so there we go and all we have left to
do pretty much is basically use this on
changed method and as you can see we get
some values and I'm gonna change this
reference here at least to brought
progress because again that's going to
return basically where our progress bar
is at and that's how we're gonna set our
volume so again just for reference let's
say we set our max volume to a thousand
and we set our current volume to you
know like 100 or something when we move
our progress bar let's say we start at
100 we move it halfway so that'd be 500
pass in this int I'd pass in 500 to this
on progress change so we can basically
work with the progress of the bar and
that's pretty much what we're gonna do
with our audio manager we're gonna refer
to our audio manager and then we're just
gonna say set stream volume and we're
gonna set that equal to the type that we
want it to affect so we're going to say
audio manager dot stream music and again
that's just the type of you know volume
that we're working with because you know
we have like the media volume and also
like the ringer volume all those kind of
things that we could potentially do so
we want to say it's the you know the
music that we're working with and then
what we want to change it by or what we
want to set it to is again our progress
of our progress bar so we're just gonna
say progress that's being passed in and
our flags we're gonna set to zero and I
believe that should be it again just to
talk through everything and then we'll
run our application make sure it works
again we set up a progress bar we set
the max value that a progress bar can go
to basically the max value of our
maximum volume again we got the maximum
volume as an int because we referred to
the audio manager class to get the
maximum value that's allowed and then we
also did that with the current volume
and we're gonna set a progress bar
wherever the current volume is and then
when we change the progress bar we have
this listener which is just gonna you
know set the stream volume again through
the audio manager and you know we're
gonna change this type of
stream which is music and according to
the progress on our seat bar so
hopefully that makes sense let's run our
application
turn it up here we're gonna go down to
our seat bar volume as you can see the
volume starts about right here it's not
at the maximum volume and I'll just mess
around with this hopefully you guys can
hear and see we again we can just you
know mess with the music so hopefully
you guys enjoyed that tutorial I know
it's kind of simple but I wanted to show
the seekbar and also how would you mess
around with the system volume because
you know that could be useful to someone
anyway so thanks again for watching guys
and we're pretty much gonna do the
finishing touches of our of our
application throughout the remainder of
this series again add ads and put it on
the marketplace and update it on the
marketplace so thanks again for watching
guys and catch you in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
