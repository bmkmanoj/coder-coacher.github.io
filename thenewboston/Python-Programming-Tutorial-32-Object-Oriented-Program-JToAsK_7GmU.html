32nd I think tutorial in Python and this
is wrong of me getting into objects now
you hear a lot about object-oriented
programming in Python is actually one of
those programming languages so it's kind
of a confusing topic so I'm going to
take it slow and try to explain you guys
exactly what it is because all the other
tutorials on the internet kind of suck
at it
so pretty much an object is a thing that
contains data and also has methods now a
method in object is pretty much just
like a function but you call it a method
when it's inside an object and it also
uses data from the exact same object
now object is a thing that has its
built-in attributes to describe it so
for example if I was an object Bucky you
would probably describe me is a sexy
like that arm
so it would be object period attribute
to describe it so Bucky is the object
period attribute to describe it Bucky
period man
Bucky period smart I know I'm fooling
myself but and besides attributes to go
along with objects objects also have
something called methods as I showed you
before and these are just like functions
except they're in the objects and they
use the objects data so what they would
do is have something like this if Bucky
was the object he would have a method
called shave on what else can this
object do Bucky works with your empty
parameters and also Bucky reads so that
is how you would use a method on an
object but before you do any of this
stuff you need to build something called
a class and what a class does is pretty
much your blueprint for your object and
you need to build a class before he can
even think about building objects and
it's kind of what your object is based
on so here's how you make a class to
make a class in this
the very first thing you do when
building objects you go ahead and type
class
this tells play something that you're
going to be building a class next make
your class name I'm going to name my
example class now after you get your
class name put a semicolon or excuse me
: and go ahead and press Enter
now in your class you're going to have a
bunch of different types of data the
first thing I'm going to have is a
variable and I'm going to have eyes and
this is going to pretty much describe
your class I'm going to Bri
be overall used for your class so my
eyes are blue so I'll put a variable in
there called
eyes blue age equals 22 and you can have
a bunch of different variables to
describe whatever class you're building
of course I'm building one that
resembles me actually my eyes are brown
but that's that's not important now
after you do this you can also have
something called methods in your class
and to make a method it's the exact same
thing is making function so let's go
ahead and do that so you put define or
to create let's just make something
called this method and the difference
between making a method inside a class
and making a function outside it is the
methods in your class the first one has
to be self as the first parameter so
let's go ahead and I'll tell you why
that is later but after you create your
method and name it make sure that first
parameter is self now let me go ahead
and press ENTER and let's make this
method do something let's return
hey this method a temporary worked so
now we have a method so inside our class
we have one variable that has a string
one variable that has a number and a
method that just returns hey this method
works now let's go ahead and press ENTER
and create our class now if you type
example class you can get a weird
message and just showed you that your
classic rated now I showed you guys how
to build a
which is pretty much like the blueprint
now I need to teach you guys how to make
an object and you need an object in
order to get the data from your class so
let's go ahead and make an example
object and I'll name my an example
object you can name it as anything you
want and you need to set it equal to the
class with empty parameters so I'm going
to put my example class and have mine mg
parameters now I just created an object
which refers to this blueprint right
here and now with your object you can
get all this data inside of it so you
can go ahead and press example object
period eyes and that's how you refer to
the variables inside your class or
object and once you press this you're
able to access all the information
inside your object or class so go ahead
and press example object let's go ahead
and get the age 22 and you can also call
your methods that you just made with
your object using what was probably the
same syntax you think so example object
again you need your object to access any
of the information period on what's it
called
this method and remember we're referring
to this one up here then go ahead and
get rid of that add empty parameters and
it says hey this method worked so again
that's how you build a class and again
you need to make an object to refer to
your class because you can build
different things to refer to the same
class so that's why or excuse me you can
build many objects to refer to the same
class so we need to build a specific
object and you'll see why later on but
you just need to do that and then once
you give your object built you can start
referring to the data elements inside
your class so again you have to put a
period and then what element or item you
want to refer to so if you want to refer
to the age variable you have to put your
object and then age
and again if you want to refer to a
method you just put your name of your
object and then your method after that
so that's how you can call all your
items out from your class so that's your
basics of object-oriented programming in
the next couple tutorials i'm going to
be going in depth and clearing all these
things up for you but for now I just
wanted to give you guys a quick
two-dollar tour overview of what object
oriented programming looks like in
Python
so hopefully you stayed with me a little
bit hopefully you understand this and in
the next couple tutorials like I said
I'll be clearing up so thank you guys
for watching make sure to subscribe to
my channel and I will see you next
