welcome to your sixth C++ tutorial and
in this tutorial I want to go over some
concepts with variables that are
definitely going to help you later on so
the first thing I want to go over is
this you remember in the last story
where I told you guys that there are
basically two different ways to create
variables the first way is to create a
variable called tuner or something and
set it equal to value like 43 all on one
line
simple enough easy to understand well
what I also told you guys you can do is
you can declare aka create it on one
line and set it equal to a value on
another line such as that they're both
perfectly acceptable ways to do things
the one thing I want to stress is that
whenever you do this way declare on one
line and set equal to value on another
line you don't need to write what type
of variable it is again once you give
C++ the information of what type of data
you're working with you don't need to
list it every time you're working with
the variable C++ will remember that
information and you know it'll keep it
so whenever you're working with tuna
later on you don't need to explicitly
write int and actually you can't or L so
to give you an error message so just
make sure that you know just remember
that
don't write int twice on same variable
so aside from that let me show you guys
this in tuna equals 99 so later on and I
didn't tell you guys this but what you
can do is if you set tuna equal to
something else like 76 whenever your
computer creates a variable it sets
aside a piece of memory to store that
value in this case 99 well whenever you
create or excuse me whenever you use
that variable again and set it equal to
a new value where your computer is going
to do is it's going to wipe out the old
value in order to make room for the new
value so now you said all right we have
a variable called tuna and that's equal
to 99 well now we have a variable called
tuna and we want to set this equal to 76
well all right so we're going to try to
print out
tuna and our computer is going to say
alright should I print out 99 or 76 well
since we created one originally that was
99 and then we overrode it to make it 76
it's going to print out 76 so let's go
ahead and build and run this and see
what we get
76 so basically whenever you have a
value it's placed in a memory location
and then whenever you give that variable
a new value it's going to overwrite the
old value and put it in the same
location so I just want to tell you guys
that this is how you can overwrite
variables so if you're expecting 99 and
you got 76 this is why so that's
actually all I have for you guys for
this story again the two things I want
to stress is whenever you're creating a
variable you only write the type once
you don't need to write it every single
time and then whenever you need to
reassign a value you just go ahead and
write the variable name and not the type
again and also whenever you're
overwriting a variable you use the
variable and it's going to be equal to
the latest value so whenever you you
know set this equal to 76 it's going to
wipe out the 99 and use the 76 so I just
wanted to stress those you know a couple
memory concepts so then whenever we're
building programs later on you might
have a better understanding of how it
works so for now that's all I have for
you guys in the next tutorial you know
how I said that we're going to be going
over arithmetic like how to add two
numbers together well there's actually a
bunch of different arithmetic operators
that we need to learn and that's where
we're going to be covering in the next
tutorial but for now thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
