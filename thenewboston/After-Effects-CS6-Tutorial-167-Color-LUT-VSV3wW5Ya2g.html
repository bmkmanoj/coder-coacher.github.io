Effects cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and today
we're gonna be going over how to create
a lookup table and a lookup table also
called
a lot which is lut is almost just like a
color correction preset that I showed
you a couple of tutorials back where it
just applies a color correction value
the lots however I'm gonna keep on
calling them Lutz for now on instead
lookup table because it's quicker the
Lutz however pretty much have a lot more
information in them and they're way more
advanced so I'm gonna show you the
effect we use to create a lookup table
and it is bundled with After Effects in
cs6 and I think it is also in cs5 and
I'll show you that program and we'll
have to get into it like a lot more
later on I'm going to show you how to
create basic color look-up tables and
let's start now so I've got some video
footage here and it's just big taking up
my whole composition pretty much and let
me hide all this other stuff so we don't
have to worry about it so it's just
video footage now the effect we're gonna
use is called color finesse 3 now that's
under effect synthetic aperture is a
color finesse 3 synthetic aperture is a
company and their brand made this color
finesse 3 which is a real advanced color
correction tool so when you click on it
it brings you to this color finesse 3
section here now we've got a simplified
interface where we can use this to
create something or we have the full
interface now if you click on full
interface it's going to ask you what
like your organization name is and if
you want to like register but I already
did that and I already have it up so
click on full interface and then you'll
get this
now it'll come up here you've got your
source and your result over here on your
right so this is going to be what you're
trying to change and what it's going to
look like and then you've got all your
different color correction like graphs
and tools and everything like this here
and it's pretty pretty sweet-looking
you've got some more color correction
tools down here and it's pretty much
just like a huge color correction
interface now you can see that this
whole thing will probably take a whole
like load of tutorials to even cover so
I'm just gonna go over a simple one with
you and we have used curves to be before
so let's click on curves and click on
the check box for it here and then we
want to make art sure RGB is checked now
up here you can have it on combo view
you can have pretty much whatever you
want since we're using RGB you would
probably want to stay within one of the
RGB ones here so we could get it do it
on this or something like that now the
effect that I want to create are the pre
color correction preset that I want to
create is gonna be like a dreamy look
and when I think of dreamy I think of
like purplish kind of stuff so what
we're gonna need to do is take out some
of the greens and add in blues and reds
to make it more of a purpley look so
let's do that within these we can grab
onto the red somewhere around here and
increase the red color a little bit and
then we can come into the blue and
increase the Blues a little bit so I'll
do it somewhere around here
so we can see we're already getting like
a little bit of a purple effect here and
let's take out some of the greens make
it even a little bit more purpley so now
we've got like a dreamy light color
going on here
now you can either save right here you
can save the where they called
properties that you've got here and use
them to load up another time or you can
turn this into a lookup table by coming
up here to file and we're gonna go to
export we're gonna go to settings to
Autodesk 3d lut so this is how you
export your settings to a lot and then
just you can pick any of these just pick
generic I guess that's what I that's
what I picked and you want to save this
in your presets folder so if you go to
let's see I think it's Adobe let me
check and see where it is real quick the
presets folders so if I go to this so
it's gonna be in your My Documents
folder Adobe and then After Effects cs6
and then user presets and that's where
you want to save it to so now that now
that we've saved it and we've exported
it out we're gonna come back into After
Effects and a real quick we're going to
we don't need this sa color finesse on
and where we can uncheck that that we
just used the interface there to create
a lookup table we're going to go into
effect and we're going to go into
utility and we're gonna go to apply
color lookup table or apply color light
and then we can select the one that we
just created and I save mine is LUT
dreamy and then an Autodesk so I knew
what kind it was and I hit open and it
applies it there and you don't have to
do have any other settings anymore so
that's that's what it looks like so
that's pretty cool that's how you create
a lookup table I've seen studios major
for major films used look-up tables all
the time and some of them are even
included in some of your compositing
programs they have like basic ones that
companies use all the time so the reason
that people like to use these look-up
tables for one you get you can change a
lot of the information and in the color
finesse and it's easier to export it as
a lot instead of going to apply the
settings back in color finesse every
time and open up the interface and all
that stuff so we'll just apply as a lot
to make it easy sometimes people
especially directors or producers and
those guys they like to create like a
specific color treatment for an entire
movie or something like that and they
like to use the luck for that usually
they for a movie you're going to be
using some real advanced color
correction to get exactly what you want
now I wanted to let you know that After
Effects can read the Oh Lots in a three
yo or cube which is C UB format and
that's the those are the file types for
Luntz that After Effects is going to be
able to read so just keep that in mind
and you'll probably run into lots at
Studios they use them all the time so
that's pretty cool there thanks for
watching this tutorial I'm gonna finish
it up now and thumbs up if you liked it
thumbs down if you did not like and at
another point we'll get into more about
color finesse when we get into advanced
color correction tutorials but thanks
for watching and I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
