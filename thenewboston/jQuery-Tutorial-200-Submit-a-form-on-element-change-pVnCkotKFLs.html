check what file we're going to receive
we're going to be sent to file dot PHP
which doesn't at the moment exist but we
can see that it will go there for
demonstration purposes so we now going
to go ahead and actually choose a file
I'm going to choose a file Totten jpg
and you'll see that the form the parent
form of this input element has
automatically been submitted to the
father we specified and it really is as
simple as that we've submitted or
changed this choose this file type and
we've gone and actually submitted it to
file dot PHP so obviously that can be
found but you get the general idea
that's how easy it is to go ahead and
submit the form the parent element for
this particular field here so now what
we're going to go ahead and do is look
at an input selector so let's just say
instead of fur inside this form we have
a file we're going to change this to a
select element so let's outline the
Select element
and we'll play some options inside now
remember I said in the first part of the
tutorial we have a default option choose
so I'm just going to set that to choose
and then going to choose a couple more
options and I'm going to change the
method of this form to get so we can see
which option that we're selecting so I'm
going to say value equals default and in
here I'm going to say option 1 and here
I'm going to say option 2 and the value
here is going to be option 1 or opt one
for sure and the value here is going to
be opt to option two for sure so now
when we refresh we've got this form
where we can click you know option one
option two
or we can revert back to choose now what
we want to do is we want to have the
form submit with the with the select
thing so I'm going to give this a name
and this is just going to be selected so
essentially what we're going to be doing
is we're going to be submitting a
variable called selected to file dot PHP
obviously through get get variables
we're either going to be able to submit
the value default opt 1 or opt too
but what we want to happen is we only
want to submit this form when this
changes so what we can go ahead and do
is we can say we can give this a
particular name I'll do it with the ID
selection rather than the type selection
I'm going to give this an ID of let's
say options so here what we can do in
our page we'll just go ahead and get rid
of this I'm going to say select hash
because we're referencing this by an ID
and that's options and I'm going to say
dot change and again obviously we create
a function inside of it I'm going to
pull this down and just create an alert
dialogue with changed and in a minute
we're going to go ahead and output the
value of this so when I choose something
that's changed we get this alert box
here even when we go to choose ok so
what I want to do is now just alert out
the value of the of the option that
we've selected and we'll see how that
works so I'm going to say value is equal
to
I'm going to say this attribute value so
now when I alert out value it will alert
out the value that's associated with the
with the choice so option one you can
see we've got up to one option two you
can see we've got opt two but when we
click choose we get this default value
so what we want to do is our aim of this
is to submit the form once we've
selected an option but we don't want to
submit it if it's selected the default
value so what we do is we create an if
statement obviously without condition
here and we're going to say if value is
equal to or is not equal to sorry
default then what we want to do is we
want to submit the form so we can either
reference the form using an ID so we
could give this an ID or we could use
the parent traversing selector again so
I'm going to just use the parent
function again it would just be a lot
easier so I'm going to go ahead and say
this dot parent dot submit so if the
value that we gain every time we make a
selection or a change equal or doesn't
equal default then we can submit
otherwise we don't want to submit the
form let's just go ahead and choose
option one you can see that that's been
submitted to folder PHP with selected
now equal to option one let's go ahead
and choose option two we do the same but
the selected is now option two and
because we've included our if statement
the condition is where that where the
value doesn't equal default the choose
value does so when we click it we don't
have the form actually submit so we need
to think about this when we have default
values you know we don't want to submit
things when we have default values
because then we're going to be
submitting something that might not be
picked up in in this case file dot PHP
so that's how we will go ahead how we
would go ahead and submit a form without
using a submit button with jQuery we've
looked at a file example which is
extremely useful and applicable where
you would select a file or an image and
have it uploaded and processed straight
away
no you know clicking of buttons to save
your users time or when you were to go
ahead and change a select option or a
select field or a select element sorry
and then you could obviously check
against the default value whilst
submitting if the option is is something
that you want to allow the user to
submit so that's a submitting forms in
jQuery without a submit button</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
