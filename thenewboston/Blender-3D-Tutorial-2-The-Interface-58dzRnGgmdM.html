second blender tutorial now I would have
made the sooner but I was actually
playing scrabble for the last 10 minutes
and I am how can I say this so that you
would understand I got pwned and I was
on beginner so that's embarrassing so I
decided to give up scrabble and start
making story goes so let's do that
alright so we got through tutorial 1
installing blender and now we have
blender open in the second tutorial and
in case you didn't remember don't close
your dosbox or else program will close
now the first thing we need to do is
learn what all this crap is what all
these buttons and words and fancy
symbols mean so let's get right into it
well the main part of your screen is
where you view your 3d object and yes
there is actually a 3d object here we're
just looking at it from the direct top
this is actually a box but when you look
at something from the direct top
especially a box it looks to d so the
first thing we want to learn how to do
is navigate around in view our objects
in different ways one of the most common
things we're going to learn how to do is
zoom we're going to be doing that a lot
zooming so what you need to do is click
somewhere in here in with your scroll
scroll wheel your middle mouse button
just roll it in and out when you roll it
towards you it seems out when you roll
it in zooms in not that complicated so
after that I guess another common thing
you're going to do is want to rotate
this so let me approve you guys that
this is 3d in your middle mouse button
then when you just scrolled click it and
hold it down and then when you turn it
like this my middle mouse button is held
down right now you can begin to see the
3d of it so rolling zooms it out in
holding it down and turning rotates it
just like that so not only know how to
zoom and also rotate what else can we do
well this is
really a common one that you guys are
going to be using a lot but if you hold
down shift and click with your wheel in
the middle same button we've been using
and drag it it pans instead of rotating
or zooming so again that shift and drag
with your wheel and that's called
panning it pretty much is like taking it
with your hand and moving it to the side
so again that's not like frying pan
that's like moving it like camera pan so
don't get confused by that so aside from
the different ways we can move this
around or look at it there are two
different views that were going to be
using commonly and that's the solid
right here and we can also view the
borders by pressing Z on our keyboard so
go ahead and press the Z on your
keyboard and look what happens you get
this which is called on the wireframe
mode and that's pretty much all the
borders of your object so if you have a
pretty complicated object we're actually
going to be working this mode on most of
the time but for now press Z again and
you get back to solid mode and there are
also different modes in that those are
just two most common if you want more
modes in that go ahead and click this
little drop-down list the one with the
box and four little boxes around it and
you have bounding box wireframe your
solid shaded and a textured but when you
press Z the solid and wire frame those
are two most common ones so just stick
with those for now now the next thing I
want to come over or go over in the most
common tool box are probably going to be
using you can't even see on here what
you need to do is put your mouse
somewhere in here on anywhere in press
space so again click right here and
press space and once you do this little
tool box it's called is going to pop up
um this has a bunch of different things
that we're going to be using to uh well
if you just look what they say you're
pretty much going to know what to do you
can add all this stuff edit this stuff
bam bam and another thing um some of
these are pretty deep in like if you're
going to do transform grab move a lot
this little letter right here is a
shortcut so instead of having to go here
press space every time
and then go to something like select
border select you just have to remember
these shortcuts but uh you can remember
them on your own time I'll feel like
going through every one so again that's
called the toolbox and how you get to
that as a spacebar now let's move down
here down here are all the context and
these little things right here this and
if you hover over you can see what it
says arm usually maybe I'm not because
my screen recorder is messed up but
these right here are called the context
right here and what a context is is
pretty much different groups with
different stuff in them so what we goin
over these later I just want to tell you
that they're here so look at this if you
click that button all of this changes if
you click this one it changed to hold
different set of links um here's a whole
different one and also another point i
wanna talk about you have your main
context the six buttons right here which
are pretty much your main panels and you
have sub context or pretty much your
sub-panels so in order to get to these
you just go to the main panel and these
are sub panels so panels and side panels
I know can get confusing but hey it's
confusing so just deal with it and aside
from that on the last main part is right
up here now this main menu bar at the
top is a little different than other
other let me say that right other main
menu bars and since that they're called
headers and you can have a bunch of
different headers and here's your
drop-down list right here right now
we're in user preferences but if you
change that any one of these your main
menu bars the top will change as well so
let's go to nla editor and said file
just change a view select markets trip
and just click another one a randomly um
outliner you get these and those I mean
they're all different you can see for
yourself but for right now just go to
user preferences because that's the
default one and that's what we're going
to be working with for now now once you
got your view I just want to tell you
this you probably notice from other
programs but if you put your cursor
between two lines you can
also resize this to see more or less but
um that's just pretty much for custom
views and I like working with the
default especially since I'm doing
tutorials everyone's on the same page so
I just want to tell you guys if you want
to customize your interface then you can
do it that way now another thing you can
do is get different views now everyone
likes working with different view with
these menus in different places in your
views your main views are down here you
got animation model material sequence in
scripting now you can either click one
of these like animation and see the
whole layout changes of your interface
so animation scripting scripting is a
different one this is especially for
writing scripts or another quicker way
to toggle between views is hold down
control on your keyboard and press the
left and right arrow like the one you
play games with go so go ahead and again
hold down control on your keyboard and
press the left or right until you get to
the view you want in this one again is
the basic one it's called the model view
and if you lost it and you want to get
back just go ahead and type model right
there and that will bring it back to the
main view so the last thing I want to
talk about before we get into the good
stuff is the last thing you need to know
and that's how to render a scene in in
3d working with 3d programs what render
means is pretty much your final output
is called rendering it it pretty much
after you're done creating everything
you render it and then you're done so in
order to render this what you need to do
is the easiest thing ever all you need
to do is hit f12 on your keyboard and
look at that we got our final product
right there and aside from that if
you're too lazy to hit f12 on your
keyboard you can just go ahead and click
this big render button and make sure
you're in this context right here so if
you're in the shading or any of these
make sure in this one I believe it's the
modify context and hit render and that
will also render your block for you so
now that you know all the basics it's a
blender we've been getting
the not boring and actually half way fun
stuff so I promised that was the most
boring tutorial I know but I had to
teach it to you guys so now that you
learn that we can begin at creating
stuff and having some fun so thank you
guys for watching don't forget subscribe
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
