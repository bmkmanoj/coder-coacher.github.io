38th chemistry tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm gonna teach you guys how to
balance an unbalanced chemical reaction
basically how we can determine the
amount of molecules we end up with or
the amount that we need for a chemical
reaction a nice a balanced one to take
place so let's go ahead and start with
the easy example say I have 10 and yes
the chemical symbol for 10 is SN how
they come up with that I have no idea
but we have some tin dioxide and we're
gonna go ahead and combine it with some
hydrogen molecules now whenever we do we
end up with 10 alone and also some water
molecules so let's go ahead and balance
this reaction and see where we went
wrong well let's go ahead and take a
look at the tin first SN on the left
side we have one and on the right side
we have one good to go now for the
oxygen let's go ahead and count these
babies up on the left hand side we have
two and on the right hand side one okay
something's are wrong so how can we go
ahead and fix and balance this chemical
reaction
I know Bucky I'm just gonna go ahead and
add a two right there BAM next one well
you cannot do that don't ever touch the
subscripts actually if you can only
remember one thing from this tutorial
it's don't ever mess with the subscripts
in a chemical reaction now the reason
for that is because first of all it's
invalid and it's against like the laws
of physics but aside from that it
changes the compound completely h2o is
water h2o 2 is not water it's a
different compound completely so that's
why you cannot ever touch the subscripts
you can't cut them in half you can't add
you can't subtract for mum just leave
them alone
so you're saying okay so I have two
oxygens over here and one over here how
am I supposed to fix that problem well
what you can do is you can fix the
coefficient you can change the amount of
a molecule or compound that you make so
what we can do is we can go ahead and
add a coefficient of two and all this
would mean is whenever we took ten died
and combined it with hydrogen we would
end up with 10 in two molecules of water
instead of one so now we have two
Oxygen's on each side so the last thing
we have to worry about is the hydrogen
so on the left-hand side we have two and
on the right-hand side we have 4 two
times two is four so you're saying okay
now what am I supposed to do cut it in
half again no all we have to do is go on
the left-hand side and say okay I have
two hydrogens so basically four hydrogen
atoms total so now I have four
hydrogen's on each side this is a nice
even balanced reaction we got one ten
two oxygen atoms on each side and also
four hydrogen atoms so again why can't
we do this because we're not changing
the chemical reaction itself we're just
changing the amount of products that
gets produced or the amount of reactants
needed to pretty much make that chemical
reaction work so let's go ahead and take
a look at one more a kind of more
complicated example so let's go ahead
and say we have a butane now butane is
c4h10 now before I continue I just want
to tell you guys this you can't reduce
that to like c2h5 because that would be
a different compound altogether don't
ever touch the subscripts you can't it's
illegal you'll go to jail don't do it so
if you take butane butane and you
combine it with oxygen in the air and by
the way butane is what you have in your
lighters if you have a butane lighter um
there you go nice little tip of
information whenever you combine it with
oxygen in the air you end up with co2
which is carbon dioxide and also some
water you also end up with Heat and
that's you know why people buy lighters
but anyways enough of that so let's go
ahead and take a look at this reaction
and we don't even have to write anything
down to notice that something's not
right here
we'll go ahead and we'll start with the
carbons okay so we have four carbons on
the left and I'm only seeing one on the
right okay I know how to fix this since
I can't do that
we know that's illegal let's just go
ahead and say we produce more carbon
dioxide than we thought okay fair enough
we don't change the chemicals or the
compounds at all
illegal so now let's go ahead and take a
look at hydrogen okay we have 10
hydrogen's on this side and only two on
this side so how can we fix that we just
need to add a coefficient of 5 right
there so basically we end up with more
crap than we thought more carbon dioxide
more hydrogens but the chemical reaction
is still valid one more to go oxygen so
we have two oxygen atoms on the left
hand side and on the right hand side
after the reaction takes place let's
count them up 4 times 2 is 8 plus 5
times 1 is 5 so we have 13 remember 8
plus 5 I'm pretty sure that equals 13 so
now what we need to do is we need to
figure out a way that we can take this
and how can we make 13 onto this what
can we multiply two by to get 13 well
the answer is 6.5 not 65 6.5 just like
that they're saying Bucky how the heck
can you have 6.50 twos that really
doesn't make sense well it doesn't and
you can't have partial numbers or you
know fractions of a number so what we
need to do is we need to round each one
of these coefficients up to the nearest
whole number so in that case what we
need to do is we need to multiply all
the coefficients by 2 and remember the
one rule that we have to follow
don't touch the sub scripts that's all
we have to remember to make this valid
so we need to multiply all the
coefficients by 2 and remember if you
don't have a coefficient that's written
explicitly we have to assume it's 1 so
this would be 2 c4h10 plus 6 point 5
times 2 is going to give you 13
oh two molecules and we need the time
the right hand side by 2 as well so 8
that was a pretty bad lookin 8 co2 and
10 molecules of h2
so that would basically be a nice even
balanced chemical reaction however in
some cases you're gonna see it like only
this blue is written because some of
these things can get pretty big and
already you're seeing that this 2 13 8
and 10 these numbers are kind of in the
way because we know what happens
whenever we combine butane with oxygen
and air we carbon dioxide and you know
water we don't really care how many
molecules of each so a lot of the times
you're just going to see them written as
blue however if you want to balance it
out what you need to do is you need to
balance all the molecules and then find
the right coefficients and then make the
coefficients the smallest whole number
possible pretty much simplified the
equation if you guys ever had math class
you know what that means so that is
basically how you balanced an unbalanced
reaction and how you determine the
amount of each molecule that you need
either to start with or the amount of
molecules that you end up with so there
you go there you have it I hope you
enjoyed hope you learned a little
something um thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
you guys in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
