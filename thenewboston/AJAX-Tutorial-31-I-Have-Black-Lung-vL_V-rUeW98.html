let me note this down on my little cheat
sheet I have here I actually started
writing down what number tutorial I am
working on because my tiny little brain
can't handle you know what number
tutorial I can't remember that much
information so I have to write it down
on a little freaking post-it note so
anyways what we want to do now is we
want above the function basically what's
going to happen or what's going to be
called whenever state changes now we
already told our program that we're
going to vote a function called handle
state change so obviously we comment
when state changes function handle state
change now it doesn't take any
additional information but what we do
want to do is we want to go ahead and
first make sure that our server is
communicating with our client properly
so in order to do that we just check a
couple states and statuses XML HTTP if
this ready state is equal to 4 and also
not only that but if just copy this
little sucker right here but if the
status is equal to 200 and that means
that you are freaking good to go things
are running smooth and my servers is set
up and hopefully it's on right now and
didn't have to reboot or anything but I
say reboot a reboot or anything so
hopefully this code in here is what's
going to happen now even though we have
we check the ready state and also the
status and if we meet these two
conditionals then it should mean
everything is working properly we also
in addition to that we want to put this
in a try-catch statement because even
though everything may be communicating
properly you still want your code to run
effectively so handle response
so this function right here is basically
going to handle the response now
remember whenever I made my XML file
that I said all right this entire XML
file and pretty much the core of this
tutorial is going to be handling the
response you guys are like all right
this program is just going to you know
show your employees on the screen so why
won't you just name it you know company
or whatever you know whatever something
more simple well it's because like I
said response that's what we're going to
be doing you finally understand now so
try to handle response and by the way
this is the last function that we're
going to be creating in this program so
you know don't think how many different
freaking functions is Bucky going to
make this is the last one handle
response so catch actually can I just
copy hate type in this freaking catch I
hope it just they need to make um a text
editor where you just type catch and it
just automatically assumes that you know
you're too lazy to make a true catch
statement so you just want to alert
everything out I'm going to make one
it's going to be called Bucky's lazy
text editor where you just type two
letters and it just codes the rest of
the program for you and then you can go
take a nap or something but you know
maybe one day actually I probably won't
because I'm too lazy to do that all
right so now the last thing I want to do
is I actually want to check the status
and if we don't get 200 then I just want
to make a little alert so we know where
we went wrong so alert XML HTTP status
text so hopefully we don't see this
because if we see this alert box right
here then that means that the status was
not 200 and it means that something was
wrong when our local PC communicated
with our server so let me just go ahead
and check this handle state change for
200 if everything is good then handle
responds and this is going to be sorry
got black long working in the mines all
day and
so that's what we're going to be coding
in actually I'll go ahead and save this
for the next video because the next
video is going to be the last function
we're going to wrap everything up in
this mini program and this is going to
be where I talk about the XML structure
so up until this point it was pretty
much a little refresher and I tell you
guys maybe a couple new things but in
the next video we're finally going to be
learning something new how to work with
xml structures beautifully and this is
how we're going to be working with them
in all the programs that we develop in
future so thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe I'm going to go
work in the mines for a little bit
hopefully get some coal and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
