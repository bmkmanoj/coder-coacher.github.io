Dreamweaver tutorial in this tutorial
I'm gonna be teaching you guys how to
insert a background image to your
website and also how to use your
rollover images which is a really cool
feature first thing I want to you guys
how to do is add a background image to
do this under your properties panel go
down to page properties and click that
make sure you're under the appearance
setting and you'll see how convenient a
little thing called a background image
just click browse and go to whatever
image that you want to use on your
website I'm gonna click this easy house
1 again and just double click it as you
can see your right now
the default value is to repeat the
images you can also have it no-repeat to
show up once or repeat up and down or
left or right I'm just gonna leave it
like it is and then click OK once you're
happy with it as you can see we now have
a background and make sure our website
whatever text we type shows up over it
so this is how you can get a background
image on your website obviously you want
to want to use one with a lot of cluster
like this one but if you have like a
basic gray or pale image then it's
sometimes can add a neat effect to your
website
so let's get rid of this and the next
thing I want to teach you guys how to do
is add a rollover image and these are
pretty useful when you're making
navigation bars which we're gonna be
doing later it allows you to take two
different images and when you roll your
mouse over it it's gonna switch those
images so to do this what you need to do
is go up to insert and then go down
image objects and go to rollover image
and for the original image it's going to
show the image that when you don't hover
over it it's just gonna display plane so
I'm going to browse and I have some from
the from a website I'm making some
routes and I have two images right here
and of course I need to do this but you
won't need to do it just cuz I'm not
saving this in my file so just browse
and on the second one
so this first original image is an image
image that's going to show on your
screen and this rollover image is the
image that's going to show up whenever
you roll your mouse over that image so
make sure that this and this are not the
same image or it's not even going to
have an effect so once you get two
different images you can go ahead and
press ok
and Dreamweaver will automatically show
you the image on the website now as you
can see right now if we hover over it
with a mouse it's not doing anything to
test this you actually need to test it
in a regular browser so let let me go
ahead up to a regular browser and I'm
going to go ahead and preview it and
Internet Explorer first we need to save
it make sure it's sick
and as you can see if you have enter and
explore you might have to pop this but
if you're working on a Firefox then
it'll be okay as you can see when I
hover over the news button it lights up
that's because this is my first image
right here it just has a basic news
image and my second image I made I made
just a little brighter and as you can
see you can use these when you're making
navigation bars and then give us a view
or something and it just lets them feel
like they're interacting a little more
and give them some confidence that know
that what they're doing is making
something happen so to make this
actually go to a link all you need to do
is click with your mouse and when the
border is around it all you have to do
is go down here and type in the link on
your website and then not only when the
viewer hovers over it it'll light up but
when they click it it'll take them to a
new website so this is a awesome way
that you can make sweet dynamic websites
and awesome navigation bars in just a
couple seconds so thank you for watching
and then the next tutorial I don't know
what we're gonna be learning it but it's
gonna be you're pretty awesome just like
