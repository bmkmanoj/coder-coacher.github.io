max tutorial hopefully this is the first
of many and now these tutorials we're
going to be going from beginner to very
advanced awesome animator and modeler so
you know go ahead and get ready prepare
for it I just want to let you know so
you probably open this in your like wTF
is all this you don't even know where to
begin or even what buttons to start
messing up or clicking or anything well
I'm not going to keep you from messing
anything up but I am the first thing I
want to do is pretty much go over
everything and tell you what it's called
and a quick overview of what it does so
let's start right on top where we begin
with the most pieces of software this
bar up here is called the menu these are
where you click in all of your menus
drop down pretty much every single thing
is contained in here it's like pretty
much the heart of your program right
under it if we click away this is our
toolbar right here this is where the
most common tools that we use to create
stuff this is where they are so anytime
I see I say toolbar you know you know
look over here
so under this this thing right here with
the graphite modeling tool freeform in
selection this is called the ribbon now
I'm not even going to tell you guys what
this does yet because it's pretty
advanced it'll just confuse you so aside
from these little things right here you
get this Big Mama right here all of this
stuff right here now this is actually
four different little boxes if you can't
tell and all of these things are called
viewports and if you couldn't guess
already this is where you view your
object from different angles so let me
go ahead and create an object real quick
I know you guys don't know how to create
one yet but um bear with me this is just
for an example see this is the top view
right here this is the front view of the
cube I just created this is the left
view and this is the perspective view
right here so it's the same object as
four different views so that's what the
viewport is now aside from the viewport
the another main section of this is the
command panel and the command panel is
this right here and I know it's probably
hard to see with this command panel is
actually six different tabs in one and
these are the tabs up here so anytime I
say go to your command panel and click
on the correct tab you'll know that it's
right there and if you see something
like um these right here and you're like
a deck to get that that's not in mine
then that means you're on the wrong tab
so aside from that I guess the only
other thing that's a parent in 3ds max
is this lower interface and this is
called if you couldn't guess it's the
lower interface oh yes I'm talking about
and this pretty much is used for
animation and these over here are - like
um view your viewport or views in
different ways but we'll be talking
about these in detail later so now that
we got that under control the only other
thing I want to talk to you guys about
pretty much with naming convention
before we go into the specifics is
pretty much where the file buttons okay
do you see edit tools group
here's your save stuff your file button
is actually this button right here and
it's called the application button they
decided to get rid of the file button I
don't know why maybe cuz they want to
brand their logo or something but all of
your file commands are under here so
anything anytime you usually use file
it's under this application button now
let's begin learning what these most
common toolbar items mean the most
common ones that we're going to be
working with is probably select object
and this say you have an object right
here and you have another object right
here which is a sphere and I know you
guys I didn't go over how to build these
yet don't worry we will do that in
probably the next tutorial but for now
I'm just building them real quick to
demonstrate with these tools mean so a
select object pretty much selects
between one object in the other so you
probably could have guessed that in the
hot key for that is Q and another object
that we're going to be using a lot is
select and move and this is the little
icon with arrows to the north south east
and west so if you select that you can
move your 3d objects around so you can
move it in the X the Z or if you click
in the middle you can move it around
like that a little easier probably so
again any time you want to move on the
axis just click hover over the axis and
no light up or if you want to move it
like freeform click this little box
right here in the middle and the entire
thing will light up and again that's
just how you move any object and again
the hotkey for that is W I know where
they got the letter for this cue for
select object W if you want to move to
your select and move tool I don't know
but whatever alright the other tool that
we're going to be working with a lot is
select and rotate what this does it's
like a select tool BAM but you also get
this rotate function right here so you
can hover over one of these axes and you
can rotate this as well or your master
axis BAM or again you can go to the
middle one and then this lets you hover
or rotate in any direction so let's get
a good angle to rotate with and BAM just
use their select and rotate tool again
the hotkey for that is e so anytime you
want to use it and you're too lazy to go
up here and click the button I need to
click Z how convenient is that
and the last object or excuse me the
less tool that we're going to be used to
work with our objects for now is called
this one and this is the scale and what
this does is pretty much change the size
of your object so if we go ahead and
click the center we can go ahead and
change the size by dragging our mouse up
or dragging it down while it's clicked
once your release it sets the size you
can also change the size of different
axes by clicking one of them and
changing it and stretching it or
clicking another one and you can get
some pretty mess
looking looking on shapes this way but
you know that's how you do it so and bam
look at that so in this tutorial we
cover pretty much what everything is
called the interface and we also covered
the common tools that we're going to be
using in the next tutorial I'm probably
going to be going over different ways
that you can view your objects because
it's kind of important it's probably the
most important tutorial the next one so
for now just play around with it click a
button but click a bunch of buttons I'm
sure you'll figure something now but uh
thank you guys for watching don't forget
to subscribe my channel and I will see
you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
