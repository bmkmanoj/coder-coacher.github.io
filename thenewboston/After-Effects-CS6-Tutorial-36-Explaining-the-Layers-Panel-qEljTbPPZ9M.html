back to another adult hour effects cs6
tutorial my name is buddy Blackford
we're going to be learning about layers
in the next few tutorials and I wanted
to take this tutorial to explain the
different buttons and different switches
and what they do and I wanted to explain
them to you they're on the same area as
my Mouse's right now and I'm gonna
explain those but first I wanted to show
you something cool that I saw today on
on the Internet we're gonna start having
four terabyte SSDs pretty soon so that's
gonna be awesome
maybe the hard disk drives will pretty
much become obsolete
so just keep it keep a lookout for that
hopefully they're not like two thousand
dollars each which I'm sure there will
be at the beginning but let's get on to
figuring out what all this stuff even
means so we'll start from the left here
this is the basically show and hide
button I was just called the I and
that's what I'll probably call it in
tutorials so it just hides or shows a
lair and if you turn it off it's not
going to render so when you actually
render out your final project things
that are don't have the ion aren't gonna
render this Larry this column right here
is to turn your audio on or off and has
the same effect as the I just for audio
I think I do have an audio on here yep
and now you can see that I get turned
this off and if I try to play anything
it will never do that this right here
this little circle is the solo layer and
if I click on it
why did it oh it turned my background
off let's solo a different layer because
the squish is the same color as the
background it's gonna not be able we're
not gonna see it so I'll just do this
one
and now the tuna layer here is soloed
the background is the default color that
you made your comp so composition
composition settings if I change this
now I can see so these are both so now
turn that up turn those off and
everything comes back on the next one is
your the Lak a layer tool or not tool
it's a locked layer checkbox basically
and usually I put these on layers that I
know I have finished and I don't want
ever to be touched again and the first
one usually is the background that I
always put it on that way you're not
you're not able to drag it or click on
like click it off or anything like that
actually apparently you can't click it
off so you just basically can't grab it
and move it around in here and you won't
be able to grab it and move it around in
the background that was the adjustment
layer that I was moving which is this
one right here I just threw that layer
in there just for so I could explain
this one later on so the next over here
is your label color and you can edit
those in your preferences if we go to
labels here you can see that all my
compositions will have the sandstone
color all my stills like images and
adjustment layers and backgrounds and
stuff like that will have the lavender
color I should change that change it to
like a seafoam
changed the audio to lavender just for
fun there we go that's a little more
manly this is just a layer order right
here we move over here this is the layer
name obviously and if we come over to
this one right here it is called a shy
and layers that are set to shy are
hidden from the timeline panel so this
is the shy layers button here and if I
hit it you can see that the background
is shied as you can tell there and I
just shied a few other ones and if I
click on this button they will hide from
the timeline layer then you'll never be
able to mess with them it's almost kind
of like locking so the next one over is
the collapse transformations or
continually rasterize so what you use
that for usually is for compositions
that are within your composition so I am
able to take this composition and put it
in here and then if I had certain
elements and it layers different layers
and then we're all showing up you can
click on this to make all the layers
show up also the if you have a vector
image like this chain saw right here if
you click on it it'll continually rest
your eyes which means and I can just
show you real quick you can it's a
pretty nice and crisp because this is a
default scale right now and if i zoom in
you can see it's all blurry now well if
I hit this now it's nice and crisp again
and that works on vector layers and also
works on PDFs and SWF and your text
layers shapes and solids also
hard to remember all those off the top
of my head I think that's all of them
that you can continually rest your eyes
the next over here is the quality put
this back down because this is knowing
me the next one over is the quality and
if I click on it it'll change to draft
if I unclick on it or if I leave it on
the solid line that's best quality so
let's see if it it works usually on like
vectors and let's see if it works on a
tuna or not yeah you it works but you
can barely see it it'll help with your
rendering within the comp times so when
you want to do like a ram preview or
something like that and you have these
lower quality it won't take as long to
create the RAM preview</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
