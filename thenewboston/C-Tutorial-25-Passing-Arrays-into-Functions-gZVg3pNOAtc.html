C++ and this tutorial I'm going to teach
you guys how to use an array and pass it
into a function so pretty much how to
use functions and arrays as one in
harmony so peaceful
well listen up here's how you do it the
first thing that we need build is a
function so I'm gonna this function is
pretty much going to loop through the
array and sum up all the numbers in it
and you guys already know how to do this
but you didn't put it in a function for
so that's what I'm going to do so I
think a good name for this would be
answer and of course it's going to take
two parameters the array of course I'm
going to name it Bucky and the number of
elements that I'm going to name numb
simple enough
now let's go ahead and build the
function body make sure I got all that
right good enough the first variable you
need in here is the sum of the numbers
and I'm going to set that equal to zero
and you probably should too
the next thing we're going to want to do
is loop through our array so let's go
ahead and we'll set the index equal to I
and start a zero send 0 is the first
element of the array and make sure that
I is less than num because remember num
is the amount of elements in your array
and then we want increment by I every
time don't do anything fancy here just
basic looping through it earng array
nothing to see here move okay I get some
nice spacing there we go now what we
want to do is when it loops through each
element we want to store it into a sum
so put some plus equal to Bucky I and
what this is going to do is it's going
to take the first element add it the sum
second element add it to some third
element add it to some until it gets to
the end of the array so of course after
all our hard work we probably want to
return something and that would be the
sum or our answer but we can't write
answer because that's the name of our
function so after we built a function we
need to prototype it and let's go ahead
and copy and pay
and prototyping in case you forgot all
you have to do is take the header and
add above main with a semicolon at the
end and that's because when we use that
function C++ knows what it does pretty
much that's a real basic and now what we
got is a function that takes an array
and adds up all of the elements in it so
in order to use this we probably are
going to need an array so let's go ahead
and make one right now I'm going to name
my numbers because I'm just that
creative and I'm going to have five
elements in it and now let me get five
random elements for this sum that forty
three and seven looks pretty random make
sure I got five one two three four five
good and now what we want to do is set a
variable for the total then we want to
set it in this main function we can't
use this sum because this variable is
only local to this function so we need
another variable we couldn't put some I
believe but that would be too confusing
so in total and this is going to store
the answer of whatever this function
returned us so let's go ahead and put
answer because that's the name of our
function and of course it takes two
parameters the name of the array and the
amount of elements in the array so the
name of the array is numbers and the
amount of elements in the array is 5
semicolon Enter a little too easy now
let's just output on the screen what we
did so put C out and let's just put
something like the total number or
actually the sum of all elements in the
array make sure you have a couple typos
in there and set it equal to total and
that line and semicolon good so now that
everything looks right until I run this
thing probably get a bunch of errors go
ahead and compile and run it and we'll
see what we get
got feeling I forgot
: summer nope
the some of the elements in the array
131 so as you can see through all my
fast typing 131 is the sum of all the
elements in the array so let me explain
you one more time what we did we
prototype the function up here for down
here that's function we now made it an
array call numbers in that array have
five elements in it and then we said
alright take this variable total and
hold the answer of your array and what
we did right here is called the function
answer and I need to take a breather
before I explain this take two I took
two arguments numbers which was the
array and five and it took numbers and
threw in Bucky and five and through and
num and then loop through and summed all
of the elements in the array and
outputted that variable as you can see
we returned it right here so then after
that the answer of that sum was stored
in the variable total so then we just
outputted the sum of all the elements in
the array is total probably should put a
space right there but we didn't so and
that is how well I guess that's it
that's how you basically use an array
and pass it into a function so I just
want to show you this tutorial so you
can know that it isn't just boring
integers or variables that you can throw
into a function but you can also use
arrays in there and that's going to come
and use later on when we when we are
building programs so that's it for this
tutorial and the next story I'm probably
going to go over some more advanced
stuffing functions so copy as I did and
after you copy all this trust me you'll
be a pro at it so again thank you guys
