tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
to show you guys how to use our time
class to convert time to a regular
string instead of military time since
you know not everyone uses military time
some people just use normal time like
1:30 p.m. so let's just go ahead and I'm
going to show you guys how to do that so
we first need to make another method and
I'm going to name mine public but I'm
going to spell it right eventually there
we go right there you got a buddy public
string and let's just name it two
strings just a normal string you can
name it like two normal or something if
you want but you know what I don't so
I'm going to name mine to string and now
we got a new method bill and what we
wanted to do here is just return a basic
formatting string so let's go ahead and
return string just like last time move
my cursor earlier format I'm I'm not
typing to right today and now once you
do that it's going to let us format the
string how we want it so the first thing
that we need to do is make sure I don't
get anything mess up string format looks
good first thing we need to do is give
the format we want to put our time in so
for the first one for the hour we just
want percent d for the minute we want
percent o to D so percent zero to D and
this is because the minute always has
two decimal places for the second it's
the same one percent o to D or zero to D
excuse me and for the AM or PM we just
want to string since they're just
letters so now for the hour we need to
do something weird we need to check if
it's zero or 12 then put 12
if not then put the whoa you'll see what
we do so in here go ahead and in your
well just do as I type if our is exactly
equal to 0 or if our is exactly equal to
12 then what do we want to do well let's
just go ahead and put 12 for that if not
else if it isn't then just go ahead and
put our modulus 12 let me go slide this
over a little bit maybe that will be
easier for you guys so what we're doing
here is saying all right if that if they
put 0 or 12 for the hour then go ahead
and put 12 if they put anything else
then divided by 12 and give our
remainder so if it's 13 put 1 if it's 8
by 8 if it's 14 put 2 simple enough that
the other ones are a lot easier I
promise for a minute we just need to go
ahead and type minute since we don't
need to do anything special with that
second just go ahead and type second
since minutes and seconds don't have a
a.m. or p.m. only hours do so now it
brings us to my last point we need to
check whether it's a.m. or p.m.
they're talking about and there we go
right there so how do we check if it's
a.m. or p.m.
well we need to test the hour first of
all and if our is less than 12 then what
do we want to do we want to go ahead and
insert a.m. else if it's not let's go
ahead and insert p.m. so that's how we
check for a.m. or p.m. right there so
now we got our basic two string and we
got a little error right there and I
forgot parentheses somewhere right here
I'll find it I promise I will I think I
did crap this darn screen recorder is in
the way
let me pause this off here we go this is
the one I forgot right here again when
you're doing your hour make sure this
one's enclosed right here and make sure
the entire thing is enclosed right there
but anyways hopefully I don't have any
more errors now that we got our basic
string to string method built we can go
ahead and call it in our main function
so let's just go ahead and right here we
called the military one and we can go
ahead and copy this and we're not going
to use it again I'm just too lazy to
type to string so the first one is going
to call the military time
the second one is going to call the
string one that we just built and by
default this is zero and by default this
is 12 and if you're saying alright why
isn't this zero and why is it 12 well
I'll show you right here and right here
where we put if our is zero or 12 and
then put 12 and it was zero so put 12
since when you're looking at regular
time there's only 12 o'clock then it
goes right to one o'clock there is no
zero o'clock I don't know if you guys
knew that or not but uh yeah drop that
in your notebooks there's actually no
zero o'clock so now let's go ahead and
quit messing around this crap and do
what we came here for we want to be able
to set the time so let's go ahead and
put tuna actually probably want to put
tuna object and let's go ahead and use
our set time function and we want to
editor enter three parameters the hour
and we'll go ahead and change that to 13
which should be one o'clock in regular
time and then for minutes we'll put like
27 and then for seconds we'll pull like
six or something then go ahead and add a
colon and now we can go ahead and output
these two again and why type them again
if you can just copy and paste them the
lazy way that's right that's what I'm
talking about and now let's just go
ahead and well let's just go ahead and
output it simple as that so here's what
we got here is our defaults that we got
from last time before he set the time
and then we set the time in military
time it was 13 o'clock on him 1,300
hours 27 6 seconds in regular time is 1
o'clock or 127 and 6 seconds p.m. so
that is how you use here let me recap
this one more time what we did is refer
much as output the defaults on screen
then we went ahead and called set time
passing the parameters 13 27 and 6 so
duck took 13 hours and converted it to
hours was the next one 27 and stored it
for minutes and 6 and stored it for
seconds outputted that in our military
format
outputted that in our regular string
format so that is your basics of your
time class right there and make sure
that you are copy all this and follow
along with me because in the next
tutorials I'm going to be teaching you a
new stuff not about time but we're going
to be using this code right here so make
sure you copy all this and make sure
your programs are working and if they
aren't then leave a comment on this
video and I'll try to answer it for you
so thank you guys for watching don't
forget to subscribe I hope you learned a
little something but not too much and I
will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
