After Effects tutorial and in this story
i'm going to show you guys how to use
something about presets now what a
preset is is pretty much a way that you
can reuse an effect or animation once
you get it just how you like it so let's
go ahead and make a new composition ah
it doesn't matter what clip you get is
just test so now let's go ahead and add
some kind of animation to it so we'll go
ahead and keyframe the position and then
let me zoom in a little bit zoom in like
five seconds or something and then in a
little bit we'll move the position over
and then let's go ahead and and may
something like a opacity that looks good
and change this to zero and start it out
at a hundred so here's our real quick
animation slides down and then fades out
and now let's go ahead and add an
exposure as well so let me go ahead and
drag exposure on here and once i get my
effects you can see that our exposure
can change as well so let me just set
this keyframe it's a 100 i just want to
get something noticeable so this is why
I'm doing this so now let me show you
guys what a preset is a preset is way
where you can save all of these things
um so you can reuse them later on so let
me go ahead and expand this right knee
and uh there we go so any time you want
to save any of these settings and apply
it to another layer all you have to do
is control click the ones you want to
use so I want to use exposure position
and opacity so I'm going to click
opacity hold down control on my keyboard
click position and then go ahead and
click exposure now once I have those
selected what I'm going to do is go up
to animation right here and click Save
animation presets now go anywhere you
want to save it and then go ahead and
save it I'm going to save mine is Bucky
and by default it will be F
FX this means after effects preset so
now go ahead and save now anything you
apply this preset to is going to have
these settings of exposure position and
opacity so let's go ahead and get rid of
this just so I can prove it to you guys
and let's go ahead and make a new
composition with here we go just make
anything a new composition so let me get
rid of this so now we have a composition
right here I might as well put a
starting point now we want to apply that
preset to this layer right here so go
ahead and highlight the layer click
effect or excuse me animation apply
animation preset and then go ahead and
double-click the end excuse me preset
you just say and as you can see that
preset is now applied to this clip as
you can see it now moves down right like
that so in order to prove it to you guys
my animation exposures right there and
also my position and opacity is right
here as well so that's a real quick
tutorial on how you can use on presets
if you have like um say you did
something with a color correcting and
you're making a whole movie and you want
to apply it to a bunch of scenes or you
got a real cool animation that you work
with a long time and you want to apply
it to a whole bunch of layers this is
how you can do that so again anytime you
want to UM get a new preset just go
ahead and click animation save animation
preset and anytime you want to use any
of your presets just use apply animation
presets and right here this will give
you a list of your recent presets so
again that's a real quick tutorial on
presets I'm sorry I couldn't make a
cooler animation by I want to stick with
basics so thank you guys for watching it

low some and i look forward to teaching
