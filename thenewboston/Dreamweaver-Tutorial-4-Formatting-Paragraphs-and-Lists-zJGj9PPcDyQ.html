tutorial in Dreamweaver last time I
talked to you guys about formatting
basic text and this time I want to talk
to you about formatting paragraphs
making lists and some basic textiles
first thing I want to talk to you guys
about is basic alignment of your
paragraph now you can do this in two
ways say you want to align this
paragraph right here you could either
select the entire paragraph or portion
you want to align or just place your
cursor right in the middle of the
paragraph you can click any of these
buttons right down here these are your
aligned buttons this is Center align and
as you see our paragraph is now aligned
in the center of the page right line and
is now online the right hand side and
this button is the justify button and
this aligns your paragraph to the left
and the right hand side by adding extra
spaces between the words in your
sentence this is especially useful when
you're trying to create a magazine or
newspaper style website with nice even
columns up and down
the next thing I want to talk to you
guys about is the indent property say
you wanted to indent this paragraph 50
pixels to the right you would highlight
the entire paragraph and you would go
down to these buttons right here this is
the Alt + button and this is the indent
button just click it and deselect your
text and as you can see our paragraph is
now indented each time you press it
indents it 50 pixels either in or if you
highlight it out go in that out so
that's how you use the indent properties
so let's get rid of all of this so we
only leave the heading and now I want to
tell you guys how to create a list say
you wanted to create a list of a certain
certain items so just go and type item1
item2 and then item 3 anytime you want
to turn these into the list just select
the entire selection and go down to
these buttons right here as you see when
you highlight over it it says ordered
list or unordered list an unordered list
will provide a list with bullet points
and an order list will provide provide a
list with numbers or letters so let's
click that
and as you can see our list has now
changed into a list with numbers now
just like any other paragraph or text
you can format this list so let's
highlight this list
and go up the task text list and click
the properties tab as you can see you
can change it to numbered lists bullet
lists and also change the style of the
list also if you have a bullet list you
can change the bullets two squares so
let's say we wanted to change this list
to Roman numerals you would highlight
numbered list and change your style to
Roman large or Roman small and then
press ok and as you can see we now
change this list to Roman numerals you
can also format this list anyway like
you format a paragraph or text making it
bigger or smaller and say you have a
item in your list that you don't want
our item you want to add all you have to
do is go to the end of your selection
press ENTER and automatically creates a
new number or Roman numeral that you can
insert your new item you don't have to
recreate a list every time so let's
click new item and say you have a item
that you want to delete as you can see
now it's one two three four
and say we want to delete this section 3
all you have to do is press backspace
and backspace again and automatically re
numbers your list for you and one thing
I didn't tell you guys about last time
when formatting text something you do
common if you want to change the style
of your head and make it stand out more
just highlight your entire heading go up
the text click style and these will give
you common attributes that you can make
to have your heading stand out so I'll
just strikethrough emphasis or strong as
you can see when I applied the
strikethrough it made a line and it
makes your heading stand out more and if
you want to make your head I can stand
out more then you can apply some of
these styles so now that we learn the
format paragraphs and make lists and
also some basic textiles next we're
going to learn about links and if you
miss anything I went over today you can
go to my website WWE New Boston com I'll
give you a step-by-step instruction
