Python tutorial and this one's gonna be
real quick so don't fall asleep or you
might miss it um in this story I'm going
to show you guys had built a check box
and you know everyone you probably knows
what check box is so I'm not gonna have
to explain to you but I am going to show
you how to do it and it's really easy
and really simple all you need to do is
put W X and check box the thing you need
to watch out for probably these make
sure that C and B are capitalized and
then you go ahead and write your parent
which is panel in this case and have a
bunch our ID and then your right we want
the value to be on that check box so say
we're building like um let's put a
grocery list where there's a bunch of
items and you can click the ones you
want an online grocery store how do you
like that apples how would you like
getting apples Center email not too good
so after you put your item name you go
ahead and put the positioning so I'm
gonna put mine in like twenty twenty or
something like that and then you go
ahead and put the size in another tupple
and my 160 by negative one for a default
height and again you just do this again
and again for however many check boxes
you want so let's go ahead and copy this
and we should only need to change the
value let's change this one to tuna and
of course we need to change the
positioning of it so they don't overlap
each other and let's go ahead and create
one more right there so we have Apple's
tuna and let's have roast beef only the
best online grocery store for my
customers so 20 40 we'll put this one at
2060 so there we'll go from top down and
let me show you guys how this works run
her and module save this bad boy
hopefully I don't get any hairs and move
this out of the way and as you can see
we now have a checklist or check box
that has apples tuna and roast beef and
as you can see this is
check box where you can click any of
these as you so desire so that's pretty
much the basics of your check box and
again three things you have to remember
here not three things I don't even know
I said that because these are three
things check box make sure you have your
capitalization right don't forget the
third one is the value and after that
don't forget the position them correctly
so they don't overlap so that's correct
tutorial on how to build a check box
don't know what I'm going to teaching in
Estoril but it's gonna be awesome so
thank you guys for watching don't forget
to subscribe and I will see you next
