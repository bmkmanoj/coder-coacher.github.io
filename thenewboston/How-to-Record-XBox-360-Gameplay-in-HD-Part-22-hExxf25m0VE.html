HD footage from your xbox is to install
the disc that they gave you and I'm not
going to walk you through how to install
it because if you're ever installed
anything in your life is pretty
self-explanatory so go ahead and install
it and once you do it gives you this
program called total media Xtreme now
once you have this program open go ahead
and click record video and make sure
that your HD PVR is on in your xbox and
TV and everything like that
make sure everything is turned on and
when it is it's automatically going to
detect your system settings I'm in by
that I mean it's automatically going to
detect the video that you want to record
if it isn't go ahead and click Xbox 360
and it automatically knows that it's
recording so the only thing yet have to
do after this is one more step by
default it's not high-def because it
automatically detects what resolution
the video is coming in and that's what
it records so it might be hi-def for you
but for mine it wasn't so if it isn't
and you're still having trouble this is
the last thing you need to know go ahead
to my xbox and go ahead to system
settings actually I'm going to capture
this alright now we're good now this is
recording right now so go ahead to my
xbox then go ahead to system settings
and then go ahead until console settings
right there display and you want to make
sure your HDTV settings are at 720p now
you can also record in 1080i or 1080p
but 720p is the best for YouTube that's
what I record all my videos that's what
machinima records and that's what anyone
who's making any high quality tutorials
on youtube records in so with that being
said that is all you need to do to
record high-definition video and like I
said one last time to record just go
ahead and press record and then it's
gonna change with stop button and press
stop and this automatically
automatically saves to this
folder right here see yours yours but
look lucky video so again anytime you
want to record just go ahead and press
capture and anytime you want to stop
it'll change your stop sign so that's
all there is to it how to record high
def video from your xbox 360 and put on
youtube so thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
