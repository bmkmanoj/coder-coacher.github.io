simplifying fractions so whenever you
simplify fractions you're going to
factor the top and the bottom you're
going to cancel any like factors and
you're going to reduce so for this one
we're going to factor the top and bottom
first so the first thing we can do is
factor out a 5 so we factor out of 5 and
then we get x squared plus 30 divided by
5 is 6x minus 35 divided by 5 is 7 over
we can factor 5 out of this one to 1
minus x squared so those fives will go
ahead and cancel and then we can factor
the top and bottom again x squared plus
6x minus seven is going to factor to two
quantities so we have to think what's
going to add to get a positive 6 but
multiply to get a negative 7 well seven
is a prime number so it's only factors
are seven in itself if we want it to be
positive that means the seven has to be
positive and the one has to be negative
and then we're going to factor hanover
and since this is a difference of
squares it's just that it's just the
first term the square root of the first
term minus the square root of the second
term plus the square root of x the
square root of the first plus the square
root of a second so now these two
factors will cancel and we're be left
with a fraction of X plus 7 over X plus
1 so now we're just going to do some
more examples so first we always factor
the top so the top is a difference of
squares so it's going to be X minus 3
times X plus 3 over and if we factor the
bottom it's going to be two factors that
look like that
negative 6 is divided by two and three
two and three will add to make a
positive one if we have a positive 3 and
then negative 2 so this positive 3 and
this positive x plus 3 factors are going
to cancel and we're just left with X
minus 3 over X minus 2 now what we're
essentially doing here is dividing by
those common factors this is the only
way for us to really divide polynomials
so now we're going to factor the top and
the top will just be able to factor a 3
out of it so it'll be 4 12 / 4 is 3
minus 4 divided by 4 is just one so a
and then the bottom will factor as well
we'll get an a here in an a here the two
factors of 12 that are going to add to
give us a one is going to be 3 and 4
since it's a negative 12 and we want a
positive one we're going to have
positive 4 negative 3 is a minus 3 is if
you look if you were to rewrite this
with this would be a minus 3 so this
cancels with this factor and we're just
left with four over a plus for we're
going to do a couple more so to factor
the top all we can do is factor of X out
of that and to factor the bottom it's a
difference of squares it's going to be X
plus 5 times X minus 5 these decks plus
wives are going to cancel we're going to
x over X minus 5 and now this last one
you can't factor the top but the bottom
should look really familiar because this
is a perfect square trinomial so then so
if you remember we're going to take the
square root of the first plus the square
root of the second and then square root
plus the square root because that's our
formula for perfect square trinomial so
this a plus B is only going to cancel
with one of these a plus beads so we're
left with the one on top and an a plus B
on the bottom so that's all for
simplifying fractions make sure you come
back and watch your next video where
we're going to talk about multiplying
fractions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
