I'm going to show you guys how to create
a table with different sections or
different groups so we'll actually put
this other couple to use so this table
will have a people section at the top
and that one will have three rows and it
will have another video section at the
bottom and that will have five rows and
I'm going to demonstrate a lot of other
things so well let's go ahead and get
started so if you hop back into your
storyboard and open up your right panel
alright so make sure you have your table
view selected which resembles pretty
much the table and open your attributes
inspector which is this little slider
looking thing and right now you're
looking for a property called style and
by default it's plain what we want to do
is grouped so plain use that whenever
you have one set of information grouped
whenever you want your table to have
sections or groups that's what we do so
now this table right here is capable of
displaying a different piece of
information and sections or categories
that's probably a pretty good word for
it so now over in the brains here's what
we're going to do the first thing we
have to say is okay well this table
doesn't just have one section anymore it
actually has two so we're going to
change this to two again it's going to
have a section for people and one for
videos so after this remember right here
is saying how many rows are in this
level section well by default whenever
we had one we can just count however
many items are in the tupple but right
now this is actually going to change
because for people it has three but for
videos it has five so how do we kind of
handle that well what we want to do is
we actually want to test what section
we're looking at or what section we're
currently creating so the first section
that we're going to create is for people
so in order to test that we can just say
if
section equals equals zero because this
section right here whenever it's
creating our table it's information that
it passes along to us saying what group
you're currently creating well of course
computers start counting at zero so
whenever we create that first group
that's what we're testing it right here
so how many rows are in my first group
well however many rows are in people so
we can just paste that in right there
now what we can do is we can just call
else
so it says okay whenever I'm creating
that people section this is how many
rows else if you're creating the other
section which is videos and you want the
number of rows well just go ahead and
count the number of items in the videos
top bold so pretty easy right there
actually let me go ahead and probably
easier to see if I add some spacing
right there so now what we need to do is
whenever we're displaying the contents
and all right so the contents right here
and I actually I can keep that whatever
so by default I mean before whenever we
displayed the contents we just said okay
just use this people topple because
that's all we were doing for that simple
demonstration but now the contents it
displays for each section is dependent
on what section we're creating so we
actually use this index path this index
path is kind of a dumb variable name
just think of this as row number so the
first three rows are going to be people
in the last five are going to be videos
now what we need to do is for each row
we need to test what section it's a part
of so under this cell because remember
we always want to create a blank table
cell and you always are on a return it
at the end but in the middle is where we
say what contents we want to use so the
test this we just say okay if index path
and there's property on this called
section so it's pretty much saying if
this row belongs to the section zero it
must mean that this Row is part of the
people group so that's a really simple
test and then we can say else else if
this row is not part of the people group
well then it must be part of the video
group so I know it's kind of weird to
look at sections and whatever like that
but simple no so now if it's part of the
people group we can just do this extract
the person's name and then return that
name for the label and actually let me
just go ahead and create a new one right
here else if we're making a table cell
for the video group then what we can do
is we can extract the video title and
what am I going to name is like video
description and of course take videos
index path dot row and actually we can
just copy this and instead of returning
person's name we can just return
something like video title and tighten
this up so again we already know what
all this does now whenever it's creating
the content for an individual cell the
first thing it does is say okay what
section am i part of am I supposed to be
for the people or the videos if I'm in
the people section then extract the
information from that tuple and just
print out their name else print out the
video title so if we run this we can see
what's going on alright pretty sweet so
it created two different sections how
big did it create them well it's based
on the size of the tupple and what are
the contents of each cell well it
and what section you're at and also the
positioning as well so pretty I say you
know what I say pretty stinkin sweet a
lot and it's kind of a not I never say
that in real life just like for my
videos which is a kind of stupid now
that I think about it but I want to show
you guys one other cool thing while I
have some time left so if the users just
looking at this they're like okay so I
see a bunch of names and then I see a
bunch of like programming categories
what the heck am I looking at it's
always useful to give them a nice little
title above each video section so I'll
show you guys the method to do that and
let me just say like give each um table
section a title all right so if you go
to table view and you return string then
what you can do I'll make sure I got the
right one a table view alright yup so
you want to look for this title for
header in section and what this does
again is it just adds a little bit of
text above that little table section and
it's just a little indicator of the
contents of the table and this is
actually really easy so I'm just going
to copy this so again we get past in the
section which pretty much means what
group are you working with well for the
first little category right there we
just want to return the title of people
that says okay for the first section the
title of this is people and if it's not
the people category then we just want to
return the title of videos and this is
what that does it's probably easier if
you just see it so what it does is it
takes as it takes whatever string you
return and it capitalizes it all and it
sets it as the title for that section so
now again I really don't know what this
app would be useful for having people
and videos on the same screen
I know maybe you're like you're saving a
list of your favorite
things people in videos who knows but
now the user can easily see which each
different category is used for so it
took a deep breath and now sound like
I'm smoking so there you go
hopefully you guys aren't you know
incredibly overwhelmed if you are then
again all of this code is going to be on
my forum I'm going to copy it and paste
it on there right now so you can go copy
it and also if you're having any bugs or
if you're wondering how to do anything
else with tables go to my forum ask me
on there I will be glad to answer it for
you so yeah thank guys for watching and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
