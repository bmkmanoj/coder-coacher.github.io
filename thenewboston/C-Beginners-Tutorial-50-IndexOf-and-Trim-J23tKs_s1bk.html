c-sharp tutorial that I'm making for
running Boston and this tutorial I'm
going to be showing you how to use the
index of method and the trim methods and
there's a few of them so all you're
going to need for this tutorial is
button and once you have done in your
form just double click on it so in the
last tutorial we looked at isolating the
first and the last names of the string
on your John Smith well say we want to
get on first and last names of a whole
like group of clients well not
everyone's name is four characters long
like in the beginning in their last name
obviously all is in five characters long
so we need to find a better method of
getting the first and last name we'll do
that with use the index of method so
just like before we're going to use the
substring method first off but first we
can do first here set equal to a
substring of this is this full name
right here well for the in start index
we're just going to set it to zero
because we're just trying to get John
and then the length well instead of
putting this four right here we can use
the index of method to find the index of
this space so we know we wanted to stop
reading as soon as that find the space
so what we're going to do is we're going
to get the math or the index of this
space and since the index of this space
is 4 it will just read 1 or 0 1 2 3 4
but and since this is a space it'll stop
at it so we're going to use the index of
method we're just going to name dot
index of and then inside of here it just
calls for a character value so we're
going to put in a character we want it
to be the space character and then it'll
get the index of the space right here
and then which is 4 so I'll read 1 2 3 4
alright so now we get this first name so
let's just display this in a message box
to make sure that it actually hits the
first name let's just test this out yup
I got John and we can use this to get on
Smith as well we can use the index of
space and put it at the beginning so
it'll start index on the space and then
we read to the end so we're just going
to go ahead and copy this over here and
paste it right into there and then we
don't need a second parameter because
it'll just read to the end of the string
so now I need to bug well this will
actually be the last name but I'm going
to change it and sure just gets Smith
yep but as you can see right there
there's a space at the beginning and
that's because the index of returns the
index before it so it would return the
index of right here and not right there
so in order to solve this because
everyone so it'll begin reading here
instead of there so now we need a bug we
should just get Smith and no space Smith
yep and there's no spaces beginning even
though kind of hard to tell and the
other methods that I'm going to be
showing you how to use is the trim
methods and these are very useful like
and basically what it will do is will
just remove all the spaces so they're
all the spaces at the beginning and end
so we have a bunch of space at the
beginning right here and we wanted to
still read John Smith and not space
space space no space
John Smith well we can use these the
trim method to do that so what we're
going to do right here is we're just
going to call it that's just raw name
because it'll just get the actual name
so just going to name dot net trim and
the trim just the regular one will
remove all the spaces from the beginning
and the end so if you've got a whole
bunch of spaces right here then it will
just remove all these spaces and we'll
all
have john smith and not a whole bunch of
spaces John Smith in the novel bunch of
spaces so now we're going to display
this draw name and message box we should
just get John Smith and not a whole
bunch of spaces in them John Smith yeah
and if I were to show you just the
original name without using that trim
method you'll see there's a whole bunch
of spaces yeah it's spaces there and
spaces after it you can also use trim
start if you only want to trim the start
up here so if you don't want to trim the
spaces off the end name so now we will
get odd John Smith and then all bunch of
spaces and you really won't be able to
tell that the spaces are there but they
are and then you can use trim and to
just trim spaces off the end so now we
get a whole bunch of spaces and then
John Smith and you should be able to
tell ya bunch of spaces right there so
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
in the next tutorial we'll continue on
looking at more methods I need in the
string class so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
