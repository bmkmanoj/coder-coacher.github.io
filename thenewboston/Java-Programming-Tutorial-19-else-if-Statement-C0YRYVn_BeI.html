tutorial in Java and in this story I'm
gonna be going over something called an
else--if statement you know what else if
statement is is pretty much a way of
giving Java many options so in our last
tutorial I showed you guys how to build
a if statement such as this one where we
had a condition which if age was greater
than 60 then we want you to do something
like system.out.print line and copy that
so I don't have to keep typing it so if
it's over 60 say you are a senior
citizen let me type it right there we go
so if statement allows you to do give it
one option we also have something called
else which gives it another option say
else if it's the less than 60 you are a
young buck and whenever you run this
make sure we don't got any errors it
says you are a young buck so again a
simple if statement what this allows you
to do is give it one option and an
alternative option but there's a way
where you can do more than just two
options and you do this by in the middle
of if and else you add something called
a else if and what this is is pretty
much a third option so let's say all
right if age is greater than 60 print
this actually just put greater equal two
else if age is greater or equal to 50
want you to print you are in your 50s
and we can have as many of these else if
statements as we want
so unlike last time where we only had
one alternative it tests to see if age
is equal or where it stands in many
different tests so if it's greater than
60 do this and if it's not greater than
60 then it must be less than 60 so else
if it's
less than greater than 50 do this and we
can do this all the way down actually
let's go ahead and just copy that save
us some time
copy and paste and it changes to 40 and
40 s so let me uh put 45 and I'll show
you guys why this does this go ahead and
put run and it says you are in your 40s
so here's what it did it can only do one
of these things so here's what it does
the first thing it does and remember our
age is 45 that says all right is age
greater or equal to 60 nope it's less so
I'm not doing this is age greater or
equal to 50 nope it's not so I'm not
doing this is age greater or equal to 40
yes it is greater than 40 so I am doing
this you are in your 40s so that's why
it output it you are in your 40s and
again whenever you use the if statement
as soon as it finds this answer it exits
the whole thing so it can only do this
this this or this and since it did this
one since age was greater than 40 there
was no need to go to the elf's because I
already found its answer so that's how
you can give a variable many tests using
it is excuse me if else if else
statement again the if is the main test
and the else if statements are
alternative test if these previous tests
are false so it's pretty much is just a
way to give it a bunch of different
options when testing the same variable
or you can even test different variables
if you want to be dumb but um that's
your basic tutorial on an elf's if
statement and how to use it in java
programming again it's called else--if
and it goes in between the if and else
to give it more options so in the next
couple of tutorials I'll probably be
clearing this up later and showing you
guys why it's actually useful in
applications but for now we just wanted
to show you guys the basics of it so
thank you guys for watching make sure to
subscribe to my channel
and don't forget to check out all my
other videos so again thank you and I'll
see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
