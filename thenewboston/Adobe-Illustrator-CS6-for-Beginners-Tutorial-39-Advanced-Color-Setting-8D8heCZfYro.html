illustration cs6 tutorial and from this
section on for a couple more tutorials
we're gonna be working with color and
the first thing I wanted to go over with
you guys are how to change your color
settings and some of this might be more
advanced and it might not even need to
ever use it if you're just working on
small projects but when you start
getting into the big leagues and even
sometimes in the smaller ones you're
gonna need to know what this stuff is so
it's good to have it in the back your
mind so we're gonna work with some color
settings so what we're gonna do is go to
edit and we're gonna go to color
settings which is down here and here we
go now illustrator does its best to
manage the its color for you but
sometimes you need to have like a
certain color requirements that say
you're the person that hired you is your
client what they they have certain ones
that they need to use that they're using
all the time and that's because they
have like a certain printer that they
got a print on or something or another
so let me go over these do you cut
settings here and these settings have a
bunch of different color settings that
are pretty much presets and I'll go over
what they are for you the first one we
got is monitor color and that's useful
for video and on-screen content and it
sets the RGB working space to your
current monitor space now all this might
not make sense but I'm just gonna go
over it I'm not gonna be able to go over
what everything is and if you have if
you're having some trouble just go on to
something like Wikipedia or just type it
in in Google if you're if you're not
sure what everything means sometimes you
actually learn a lot more when you have
to go and look up something you're on
your own but I'm gonna give you a
general overview of the color settings
I'm not going to go too far into it now
the default usually is North America
general purpose too
and that's useful for screen and print
content in North America the next one is
North American newspaper and that's
common for newspaper press conditions in
North America so the CMYK values are
preserved
now CMYK is for printing out things RGB
is good for like video and websites and
stuff like that so if you're gonna print
something now on some kind of printer or
something like that you want use CMYK
now if you're working for and you're
creating stuff in Illustrator for a
newspaper you might want to change your
color settings to North American
newspaper the next one is North America
pre-press - and that's common for
printing conditions in North America and
the default RGB colour space is set to
Adobe RGB and you'll have to look what
up what those Adobe RGB is the next one
is North America web internet and that's
useful for non print content on the web
in North America so set it to what you
want but for most part you can just use
North America general purpose and that's
pretty much useful and then you do that
and you hit OK and that will select that
for you now if your client has something
that they've already came up with with a
custom settings you'll hit up load and
then you'll go find wherever it is and
load it in to your new settings and then
these things will change down here that
is we've got working spaces now these
are to set some custom stuff the main
thing that I always use and most people
are going to use is this srgb and then
as IEC blah blah blah all these numbers
but there are other things we've got
Adobe RGB that's made in 1998
that's a outdated and not everybody you
can use it for some things but I guess
it's really not I don't know I just
usually keep my srgb let's go check out
some other things
see my K now this has got a whole bunch
of different other things and I'm not
going to go over well every one of these
mean because you'll never use most of
these but if your client tells you to
use a certain one then you can go in
here and pick it out I hope I didn't
just change it so that wasn't sure what
it was actually under oh yeah it was
that's that that's the default okay next
one color management policies so color
management policies control how
illustrator works with color when
opening files that don't have a color
for out file or one that doesn't match
the ones of your current current
settings so if I have something that has
a color profile of Adobe RGB and then
the CMYK is this coded one then this
color management policy is going to tell
me we're gonna tell illustrator what to
do with those so we're gonna preserve
embedded you can turn it to off and it
won't do anything or you can convert it
to working space and those are just up
to you the next one is CMYK same thing
you'll have to go ahead and look these
up if you're really into it but pretty
much keep those and keep those at the
defaults and illustrator or do a pretty
good job for you now I can click more
options here and that's you can just
gonna specify some conversion options
and honestly I don't know anything about
this so I'm not gonna talk like I know
anything about these so I'm just gonna
click on less option so it's not there
but if you ever get confused again you
can hover over these and it gives you a
little description down here in this
description box of what this actually
does so there you go that's a little bit
on the color settings and what you need
to know and if you want to know a lot
more about color settings I'm not going
to get into these too much because these
are just mainly for beginning and
illustrator and this stuff's a little
more advanced if you want to know more
go ahead and check out just type it in
on the internet I look up on Adobe's
website and they'll tell you a lot more
about it so thanks for watching this
tutorial and hopefully some of it made
sense pretty much if you don't know what
you're doing keep it on the defaults
keep it on North America general purpose
too but you can use those preset
settings that I showed you in the first
part to switch in between and you can
get the pretty much the best thing so
thanks a lot for watching everybody have
a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
