video my family just showed up there's
like a town-wide garage sale today so
they got all came over in my house
because I have like a um an awesome
location for garage sale it's like right
in the village so my mom and sister in
my little cousin are here today so if
you hear any noise in the background
blame then not me anyways what we're
learning about printing stuff out on the
screen so we learn how to do that
basically right now our programs saying
is print this out play a beep on our
computer and then print this out of
course since our program runs real fast
it's going to just look like it's doing
everything at once but that's what's
happening right now and another thing I
want to talk to you guys about is
comments because you probably are going
to be seeing these a lot in I want to
explain to you guys what they are so you
don't get confused whenever you come
across them so a comment is basically
just little notes that you can put in
your program and they're just notes for
you to read the computer whenever it
sees a comment it ignores it your
compiler doesn't care about it it's just
notes that you can have in there for
reminders or if you're working on
program with other programmers um you
can put little notes in there so anytime
you want to UM make a comment on
multiple lines you do this put to follow
type of first pretty much your comment
starts wherever you put forward slash
asterisks above the 8th and then you can
type up your comment in multiple lines
and then does um symbolize the end of
your comment do the same thing but
backwards so asterisks forward slash so
again the beginning is the 4th plus
first the ending is a forward slash last
so then you know that typically wouldn't
be your comment your coming would be
something like this is my program it
prints out my name it's awesome or
something like that so you'll probably
have them like above functions you'll
see them a lot and it explains what the
function does or at the top of your
program to explain what the program does
so again that's a multi-line comment now
whenever you just want to leave a
comment on
one line like a short little note what
you can do is you can add two forward
slashes in a row now everything you type
after this is going to be commented out
or it's going to be ignored by the
computer so you can say these are the
lines that print my name so basically
whenever your compiler is going to build
this program the first thing it does is
it rips out all of these comments
because you know it doesn't care about
them so that's why whenever you build a
run it it runs at the exact same way as
if the comments didn't even exist just
um you know so you can pretty much make
notes simple stuff and also whenever I
put the source code on my website I'll
probably comment some stuff so if you
guys I don't know um can't watch your
video for some reason then you guys can
just read what each of the line does now
in the next story I think since you're
kind of running out of time is I'm going
to talk to you guys about something
called conversion characters and that is
how to make this little piece printf
statement a whole lot better so I'll
show you guys then and uh thanks for
watching don't forget subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
