slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to
learn about saving files with the save
file dialog so let's go ahead and create
a new project and we will call it save
files now just like the Open File dialog
save file dialogues are built in the
Visual Basic and they're very easy to
use and they keep you focused on what
your application is doing and instead of
having to work on coding the dialogues
yourself so let's go ahead and come over
here to our toolbox we will add a text
box
we'll make it multi-line make it a
little bit bigger and let's add a button
called save so we'll just type save file
we'll set the name to button save now
what we need to do is come over here to
our toolbox and double click on save
file dialog now this will create an
object of save file dot say file dialog
that we can use in our program so let's
go ahead and double click on save file
to open up the event handler for that
now what you guys also need to know is
that you don't have to come into your
form one designer to add say file
dialogues you can also create instances
of them just like object so dim my file
- save as new save file dialogue so you
can create object create objects with
them inside of your code so that's just
another way of doing it and this is what
the designer does for you when you add
subs to the toolbox
it just makes objects of it in your code
but it's saved in a different file so
let's go ahead and delete this here so
what we want to do is let's use a simple
if statement so if text box one dot text
dot length is greater than zero then
we'll go ahead and show that
because we can't write nothing to a file
so we'll type say final dialog one dot
show dialog and now what we want to do
is we want to save the file to whatever
they named it so we'll just type system
dot IO dot file dot write all text and
for our path we're just going to use the
path that they gave us from save file
dialog one so a save file dialog one dot
file name so this gets the path and the
filename after that and the contents of
it is going to be text box one dot txt
so you can see that right here I use
system dot o system dot IO dot file dot
right I'll text now this can be used for
anything you want what we usually do is
we import it but sometimes you don't
want to import it you can just use the
long version of it and it will still
work exactly the same way so let's go
ahead and run this and see what kind of
results we get so let's go ahead and
write coding in Visual Basic is fun so
when we click save file that we would
click save file it opens up this save
file dialog the default title is save as
so let's go ahead and go to the desktop
and we will save it as corn dot txt now
you can also set filters so they can so
that they can only save it as certain
data types and we'll be going over that
in later tutorials so it's going to be
saved as corn dot Tex we'll go ahead and
click Save and you can see here well you
can't see it but I haven't filed on my
desktop I'm it's dragging in right there
so you can see it and let's go ahead and
open that and you can see that says
coding in Visual Basic is fun so what we
did is we
just created a savefile dialogue and if
they have actually typed something in
here this is going to go ahead and show
that dialogue and it's going to write
all the text of that into the file that
they specified and from use the text
from text box one so go ahead and
practice a little bit with save file
dialogues you can also change the
attributes of them just like you could
with the Open File dialogues and then
once you've got those down go ahead and
move on to the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
