slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
taking a closer look at arrays and what
you can do with arrays so just go ahead
or not erase array lists my Ben we go
ahead and go to new project will shrink
this down a little bit we'll select
windows forms application and we will
title it array lists go ahead and hit OK
and wait for that to load so we're just
going to go ahead and add two things to
our form we will add a button and a list
box now the list box we're just going to
use that to print out the items in our
array so in this tutorial we're going to
be focusing more on the code and not the
form so string that down and we'll set
some names for this and then we'll be
done with the form so we'll go ahead and
set the name of list box 1 to list array
list and we'll set the name for button 1
to button list items and we will set the
text to display array list okay so now
I'll go ahead and view the code for
display array list and so we created an
event that will run whenever button list
items is clicked so let's come up here
and we will create an array list so
let's go ahead and type private and now
we're going to have to set a name for
our array list so we'll just call it my
array list as and then we'll use the new
keyword to create an object of a rain
list so now that we have an array list
let's go ahead and add something to it
so we can do this by using the add sub
so we'll just type my array list dot add
then we'll go ahead add an integer
10
now let's go ahead and cut that and
we'll double click on form 1 so with the
form 1 loads it will add this to my
array list let's go ahead and get rid of
some of this white space right here so
we can also add strings to my ArrayList
so my ArrayList add hello and let's
close that in for them and then we can
add decimals to it too so my latest add
10 point or 1 point 3 4 so if we come up
here and click button list items let's
go ahead and add some code that will
display all the stuff in my rayleigh my
ArrayList so we'll just use a for each
loop here so for each item as string in
my ArrayList go ahead and do this now
you don't always have to use the name
item that's just what I'm using you can
name it whatever you want and we use
type string in here because we're going
to be converting each one of these to a
string before we print it out inside of
our list box and then in my ArrayList so
we'll type list array list dot items and
we're going to put item dot to string so
it will convert 10 to a string it'll
convert hello to a string which is
already a string and it will convert
1.34 to a string so let's go ahead and
run this and do over there if we click
display array list we get 10 hello and
1.34 so this is just how you add stuff
to ArrayList of any data type you want
you can even do it of objects of classes
structures enumerations whatever you
want you can add to your ArrayList and
it has no bounds now you can set bounds
and we're going to be learning about
that in the next tutorial so I'm
practice a little bit with ArrayList and
once you've got those down go ahead and
move on to the next tutorial and we're
going to be learning more about what you
can do with ArrayList so thanks for
watching guys and stay tuned for the
next tutorial
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
