Roberts and welcome to your very first
tutorial in react now for those of you
who have never heard of react before or
maybe you have heard of it but you're
trying to look at the website and you're
like ok I'm trying to read these
definitions and still have no idea what
the heck this thing is a library for
building user interfaces okay I can just
do that with like HTML so why would I
ever want to use your e act well react
allows you to build websites or web
pages where if any part of your web page
changes or is dynamic then you can use
react for so let me give you guys an
example of when react would be awesome
so say that you're making some kind of
social network and you had notifications
at the top of your screen like Facebook
well instead of having to refresh your
page every time to see when you got a
new notification you can just use react
and then whenever you got new
notification it would update in
real-time so another thing that people
use react a lot for is say that you're
building like some kind of chat
application
so um you're chatting with your friends
of course same thing you don't want to
have to refresh your page every single
time to check if you got a new chat
message you just want to look at the
webpage and it automatically updates
whenever you get these messages so react
is awesome for that stuff like I know
maybe you're making um some like stock
program and you just want the prices to
update in real time boom react now
before I start showing you guys you know
all the code and stuff I want to mention
this react this library that I'm going
to be showing you guys this is only for
the view so you know the look of your
web page it updates in real time it's
nothing to do with the server or backend
stuff so you know like all your data
coming into your server in your database
getting more data in real time that's
entirely separate this is just for
making awesome views or you know the
design that updates in real time or
changes in some kind of way so that's
you know the kind of simplified version
of react and there's also um you know a
bunch of other benefits and
stuff we'll get into later on but I just
want to give you guys you know a real
quick introduction to get you guys's
feet wet so sounds pretty cool how do we
get started well the first thing you
need is of course a web page so right
here I just have a blank web page right
here and let me show you guys how blank
it is pretty exciting let me move these
around a little bit so that's my
starting point so just make a regular
old HTML page index.html now we have a
couple options of how we can include the
react library the source code that we
need to get started so one way that we
can get all the code is we can go to the
react home page which is this Facebook
github bio slash react and we can click
download react download it extract it
pull it out and stick all the source
code in our project or a much easier way
is just to include the files that are
already on the CDN now a CDN is just a
server that has this library already on
it and what I did is to make things
incredibly easy for you guys is if you
go to my github page and that's
github.com slash bucky roberts and click
on source code from tutorials click on
react and i already made you guys a
really simple template and this is
pretty much a bare-bones template just
to get started your bear starting point
so this is the code that I'm going to be
going over in either this tutorial or
the next tutorial but take all of these
these three scripts right here and copy
them and then we can just include these
in our HTML so instead of having to
download it anything and extract it and
move it into the proper project
this'n just include these and you're
good to go
alright so that was easy we're ready to
start typing react now but before we do
let me explain exactly what you just
paste it in so this right here is just
the react library so that's what we're
going to be learning in this tutorial
and this is if you were download it this
is what you would get now this right
here
is something called the JSX transformer
now JSX is a special type of syntax that
you can type instead of just typing pure
JavaScript
oh crap so now not only am I going to
have to learn react I'm going to have to
learn this stupid syntax too well
believe it or not this syntax right here
is a lot easier to understand than just
typing pure JavaScript so instead of you
know referencing every element you know
just typing confusing JavaScript this
allows you to and you're going to see
what I'm talking about later on it's
kind of confusing now but you're pretty
much going to be able to type plain old
HTML and your brain just thinks of it
like okay this is just a regular HTML
but what this transformer does is it
behind-the-scenes it translates it all
into JavaScript so your webpage can read
it so we just type it like we think of
it and how it's easy to understand and
this takes care of all the hard part and
this right here this is just Jake Oh
what the heck jQuery as soon as I said
that like a bug flew in my throat
so anyways how easy was that to set up
we now know what react is it sounds
pretty awesome that's all we need to do
we can now start typing in so in the
next video I'm going to show you guys
how to create a basic react component
what they are and how you can include
them in your webpage it's going to be
awesome see then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
