change or a ready state change from from
our XML HTTP object so we say XML HTTP
dot on ready state to change and then we
equal this to a function so it so
basically based on this event we create
a new function and then inside here we
can start checking our ready State and
our status of our of our request so we
say if and we say XML HTTP dot ready
state remember our capital S here so
case sensitive is equal to 4 and our XML
HTTP status is also a status is equal to
200 this just means if the page is not
blank or the request isn't blank coming
then we complete the rest this block so
if this is but if these are both true
then we create what's in here so now
under our insert field if you like here
where we're typing our the value that we
want to insert into our database
we're going to create a div and what
this div is going to do is it's going to
feed back in information from our
updating PHP file when we create it and
the reason for this is when we've
inserted the data we're going to tell
the user that the data is being inserted
but because we're doing this without
refreshing the page we want to give a
confirmation message inside a div so I'm
going to call this div I've created a
structure of the div here we don't need
to put anything in here at the moment
well at all I'm going to call the div
message so this is just going to feed
back information from our from our
request our Ajax request and the the
output in updating PHP is going to be
put into this div so hopefully that
makes sense otherwise continue to follow
along and see what you think so we've
got document dot get
element by ID what I struggled with
earlier and then we specify the name of
the dip so in this case it's message and
then what we do is we say inner dot
sorry dot inner HTML and what this is
going to do is it's going to set the
HTML within out this specific div that
we've specified so what we're going to
do is I'm going to equal this to XML
HTTP response text and all this
basically is is it's the the output sent
back from update Inc PHP because we're
going to be opening this file later and
sending post data to where I'm going to
be taking back the response text from
this file so that's important that we
put that into message in order to let's
say if we would say echo failed at any
point in our program the in anytime in
our script the message div would be
updated so now that we've done that we
can come down here and we can start to
send our post data now if you watch the
other tutorials you'll see that we used
XML HTTP open and then we've supplied
three parameters don't forget the
semicolon at the end and we've supplied
the first primary parameter was get the
next was the file so this was update in
PHP and then it was true because we're
sending the data synchronously so we
need to set this to true it's actually
true by default but I tend to put it in
anyway just to ensure that it's there
etc etc etc just for my own peace of
mind
so now we set XML HTTP send now there's
a few changes that we need to make when
we're using post data you'll see that in
some of the other tutorials I've put a
question mark here to specify that we're
going to be sending get data and I've
sent some specific data so I've said for
example
text equals hello okay so what I've done
there is
I've sent get data because it's as part
of the URL so let's go ahead and test
this so we we can see that everything's
working with regards to the the Ajax so
at the moment what what this what this
set Ajax will do is it will open this
update dot PHP file or will it and it
will pass through a variable called text
which is a get variable with the value
hello so what we can do inside here is
just echo out dollar underscore get text
and what that should do is it should
react oh what we've entered into the
text box because remember what we enter
into the text box is being picked up
sorry let's go back here
what we enter into the text box will be
picked up eventually by this so this
will equal hello just for now and it
will put that into our message div down
here as I explained earlier so let's go
ahead and check that this works let's
click Submit and you can see that the
value hello has been returned
now obviously the problem with this at
the moment is we've completely avoided
the point of the tutorial we need to
post data using post so the first thing
we'll do is change this to post and I'm
going to get rid of these variables and
the end hits we don't post data through
the URL</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
