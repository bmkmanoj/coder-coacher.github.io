tutorial in Adobe Premiere Pro and in
this tutorial we're actually going to be
getting into the fun stuff and we're
actually going to be adding our very
first title so let's go ahead and find
out how to do this and before you do
this make sure you have um some clip-in
video one and if you do you probably
have some audio audio also and move your
current time indicator all the way to
start like that and once you do all that
we can go ahead and get started now to
add a title let's go up here to file and
go ahead and click new title because we
want a new title you can name it
whatever you want I'm just going to go
ahead and pick the defaults and click OK
now the first thing you're going to want
to do is go ahead to this text tool
which is the capital T and just click it
and now click anywhere on your screen
I'm going to go ahead and click there
and you're going to see a big cursor i'm
going to type mine a myrtle beach and
i'm going to go ahead and highlight all
of that and right up here is where you
change the font i'm going to change my
mind to something a little smaller
actually if you want to move it just go
go right over here to your selection
tool and move it and not like that right
there so and again if you want to change
the font just go over your text tool
highlight at all and pick a font let's
pick arial and if you want to change the
size of that click your selection tool
and one you have a selection selected
these um let's see eight little squares
pop up anytime you're
what's it called selection tool has two
arrows on it you can change the size of
it like this and any time it has a
little curve with two arrows you can
rotate it like that you can also change
the size by this as you can see is 207
point font let's change this the 150 as
you can see when we click it goes a
little smaller in there are also some
other things you can do but we're
learning about those later and you can
also rotate it using this but we'll also
learn about that later so once we have a
title I'm going to move minor right to
the center using a selection tool let's
go ahead and click x now you don't need
to save this or anything and as you see
as soon as you click x adobe makes a
little thing with your title and as you
can se see it's just a little frame with
all your words in it so just like this
is any other clip go ahead and move it
to video 2 at the very beginning now as
you can see in our program or movie
adobe put in a nice title for us now by
default this is a completely transparent
so you can see the background but if you
want a title with a black background or
something then i'll show you how to do
that later so right now our title is
about five seconds long and again if you
want to change the length of that like
make it a eight seconds long we can go
ahead and do that so let me play it and
show you guys what looks like it just
pretty much says Myrtle Beach right in
the middle with a nothing else but most
of the time people don't want the total
right at the beginning of their movie so
they might want it you know starting
within four seconds and they might only
want it
like six seconds long so let me show you
guys how that looks remove this to the
beginning as you can see it doesn't
quite start out so and then it pops up
for six seconds and then it disappears
so that's how you can get the title not
directly at the beginning of your movie
and another neat thing let me just make
this a little longer that people always
ask me to teach them how to do is how
you make the title fade in and out whoa
that's easy go to your selection tool
and make sure you have total 06 or
actually whatever the name of your title
is selected then make sure your effects
controls panel is open and again if it's
not just go to window effects controls
and down here where it says opacity
expand that and expand the word opacity
now this little line right here shows
the opacity of your clip and in this
case the title so let's go ahead and
move our current time indicator to the
beginning of the title and make it 0
opacity now let's go ahead and move
let's say a quarter of the way and make
it a hundred opacity and what happens is
this line goes from 0 to 100 opacity so
its first it's going to show nothing
then it's going to start fading in and
in and in until it's completely solid so
about a 75-percent of the way let's
click 100 again and all you have to do
is click it and it will make a key frame
and then let's go to the end the very
end and make it 0 and as you can see the
effects control is going to fade in is
going to be completely solid then it's
going to fade out until nothing so again
you don't need to save this or anything
just go ahead and click right here let's
move to the beginning of the movie
and let's play this bad boy now we see
Corey and now the title is going to fade
in how beautiful is that and now it's
going to fade out how beautiful are we
making this movie right now so I hope
you guys enjoyed that I showed you guys
how to add a title and fade it just like
the pros do so I hope you learned
something and remember it's in the
effects control make sure you have your
title selected and I you can play around
with some of these other effects but uh
for now make sure you learn how to add a
title and make sure you learn how to
play it and I hope you enjoyed watching
