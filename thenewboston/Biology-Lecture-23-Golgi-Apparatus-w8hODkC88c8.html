to your 23rd biology tutorial and in
this tutorial I want to talk to you guys
about the Golgi apparatus now Golgi is
actually the dudes name who discovered
this thing but in order to understand
this organelle what we need to do is we
need to understand the process of how
materials get to this organelle so let
me go ahead and draw the diagram of
course here's my nucleus as always looks
like a loaf of bread and let me draw
some ER outside here so this is going to
be the rough ER just draw it real quick
and this will be the smooth ER okay
there we go
and on the rough ER of course we have
the ribosomes can't forget those draw a
few dots real quick and remember that I
said in the last video whenever
materials such as proteins and lipids
need to go from the ER to Golgi
apparatus they go in something called
vesicles so I'll just draw those as
circles right now so these things are
vesicles now vesicles just think of them
like buses that carry materials like
proteins and lipids so proteins and
lipids are the vesicles passengers and
what they do is they go from the ER
which is right here to the Golgi
apparatus now just draw the Golgi
apparatus is green and it looks
something like this kind of like flat
pancakes and they're kind of stacked on
top of each other like a delicious
delicious stack of golgi pancakes so
this is the Golgi apparatus right here
interesting okay why would these
proteins and lipids want to take the bus
to the Golgi apparatus well with the
Golgi apparatus does is it packages and
tags these proteins of lipids further
the proper destination and what do I
mean by that well first of all whenever
I say packages and tag something it
isn't a dude wrapping it up and you know
a cardboard package I mean chemically
packaged and tag them and whenever I see
tags them for the proper destination
well these proteins and lipids right
here
they aren't just going to chill in the
Golgi apparatus and just stay there
forever they're going to a bunch of
different parts of the body maybe
different parts of the cell wherever
they're needed so with the Golgi
apparatus does is it basically acts as a
post-office and whenever it receives
stuff it packages up into another
vesicle and then it ships them out to
the proper destination and how this does
this is if a molecule is getting shipped
out what happens is the vesicle it
pretty much well let me go ahead and say
it like this once the proteins and
lipids are done being tagged what they
do is they get packaged up into other
vesicles so let me go ahead and draw
those so here are more vesicles and now
these vesicles right here on the right
hand side these ones right here are
tagged for the proper destination now if
a molecule is getting shipped out of the
cell and let me just draw the cell
membrane in white right here so here's a
cell membrane there's your nice bilayer
so there's your cell membrane right here
if these vesicles are going out what
they do is they head up to the membrane
and they're going to wait for a protein
to make a channel remember I said that
proteins do a couple of different things
on the the plasma membrane one thing
they do is they make a channel so that
larger molecules can pass through
because smaller molecules can pass
through easy but these vesicles right
here are really large so they're going
to do is they're going to have to rate
wait for a protein right here to open up
a channel for them to get out now once
they are outside the cell what they can
do is they can go ahead and enter the
blood stream or pretty much get
delivered to the other parts of the body
where they are needed so one last time
the golgi apparatus in order to
understand that you need to understand
the entire process of what happens first
of all what the smooth ER does and the
rough ER is it makes proteins and lipids
and when it's done making those it gets
packaged up into vesicles and moved
along to the Golgi apparatus which is
right here now with the Golgi apparatus
this kind of acts like a post-office it
packages up those proteins and lipids
and it tags them pretty much puts a
stamp on them says okay you need to go
here you need to go here you need to go
to another part of the body that's what
the post-office does it tags it for its
proper destination and once it's done
packaging it up into a new vesicle
properly tagged this time it heads over
to wherever it's needed if it is you
know going outside into another cell it
needs to wait by the cell membrane for a
protein to open up a channel because
these vesicles are rather large and they
need a way to get out of the cell that's
how it does it so again Golgi apparatus
weird name but it's part of a bigger
process and now that you guys understand
this entire process we're ready to move
away from the ER away from the vesicles
away from the golgi apparatus into
something a little bit more interesting
so thank you guys for watching don't
forget subscribe and I'll see you guys
