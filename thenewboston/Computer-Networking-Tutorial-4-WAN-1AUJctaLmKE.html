you guys about is a way in
waa N and this remember stands for wide
area network so let me see if I can draw
a really terrible drawing of the United
States
see there's California you got Texas
okay I'm going to have to start again
got California then you got Texas down
here then you know you got Florida and
then I think you know something sticks
out in New York there's Maine up there
and then you know can't forget about
Michigan Wow this is probably the worst
drunk I have overdone it looks like a
dog with a tumor on its back but but
anyways we'll just say that this is you
know the United States USA and I want to
draw this because this of course helps
me demonstrate a win so what is a win
well a LAN is made up of multiple bands
so here's a city here's a city you know
here's a city they all look the same for
some reason I don't know good enough and
what is the basically what's the
definition of a win what's the
definition of a wide area network well
one of the criteria is it needs to span
larger than 30 miles so anything less
than 30 miles whenever computers are
connected you can call it of course a
man anything larger would indeed be a
way in a wide area network and another
thing is a you know a cool way of
remembering this is you have your
telephone company in the telephone
company usually has a bunch of telephone
poles connected all across America well
these telephones whenever they're
connected like this this would be an
example of a way in it's pretty much a
network that spans greater than 30 miles
so that's probably the most easy or
simple explanation of a win and the
biggest and most famous win is of course
the Internet
so a win you can remember the Internet
and you remember that nothing is bigger
than a weigh-in
it's the biggest computer network you
can get and of course the Internet in
case you haven't heard of it before it's
the most famous computer network and the
different types of technologies that
these bands use to transfer data to each
other to form a win is of course
satellite they use satellite in the air
and they also use fiber-optic cable so
I'll draw you know nice high-speed
fiber-optic cable between these and also
they use you know old school copper
cable even telephone wires in some of
the you know the slower areas but that's
basically the very basics of a Wayne
it's a wide area network and telephone
companies in the internet make up some
of the most famous wins and also they
use pretty much every technology that
you can think of oh sorry I got kennel
cough every technology that you can
think of to transfer data and again like
I said in the beginning there are many
different ways to classify you know hold
on let me get a new slider here add new
layer there are many different ways to
classify computer networks but probably
the easiest is just by size remember
land one building man think of it like a
city and a LAN you can think of a cross
in the entire nation or across the
entire world like the Internet so
anyways thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribing I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
