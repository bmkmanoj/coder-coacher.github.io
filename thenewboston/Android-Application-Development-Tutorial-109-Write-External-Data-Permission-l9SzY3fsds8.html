Android tutorial for the new Boston and
what we're going to do in this tutorial
is basically the polishing up of our
little application it might be one more
for this external data then we'll be
done but whatever realize is we haven't
set up our edit text that reference so
let's do that real quick otherwise err
our program is going to crash so we're
going to say save file standard stuff
here so hopefully we won't getting any
errors
and what was that called et
you t save as and there we go we have
that set up now the other thing we need
to do is we have to add a permission to
our manifest so we can write to the
external data or write externally so
we're just going to say add uses
permission over here in the name we're
just going to click down scroll the
bottom and there's the choice write
external storage hit save and now we can
write to the external storage another
thing we can do is that we want to do is
make sure that our actual path exists
because we're going to be basically
saving this to the you know the SD card
and then we're going to get our path
which is it they're going to be kind of
a directory for downloads pictures music
if that path doesn't exist we want to
create it so we can actually save some
stuff within that folder so how we do
that is we just say path dot m'kay dirs
now basically create a directory path
for us if it doesn't exist if it already
does exist it's not going to do anything
so it's a pretty simple way to create a
folder wherever we want our path to to
lead and let's let's also add a toast
within our within our try here so what
we're going to do we've we've done toast
before but just to make our application
a little bit you know better we're going
to say toast toast dot make text context
or class name which is called external
data dot this text file has been saved
and duration toast dot long length or
leg length long I don't know
dyslexia or something I'm listed exit
and and then we're just going to T dot
show so now will display a toast after
we open and close their input and output
streams
now let's uh check it for the most part
and then I'm going to show you guys our
application but apologize if the camera
apologizes if the quality is poor you
guys might not be able to see the actual
phone or what I'm doing but I'll try and
talk through everything that I'm doing
so you'll understand it I'll catch you
guys then peace
alright so just friend the judge to
judge the application on my phone here
and first thing I want to show you guys
is when we go to external data right
here both of our our triggers are set to
false we can't read or write
that's because we have the SD or this
cable plugged in USB so we're just going
to unplug that bad boy and hit back let
it kind of readjust be like yeah they
implode that thing we're good we're good
hit external data we got true and true
now let's try and save to our music
folder we're going to say Travis music
test something like that I did a
previous video so a few of these
directories already exist you just want
to make sure your spinner item is you
want to select even the music because I
don't think we set up our path at the
beginning so it's only going to be
setting up the path once we hit one of
our spinner items now we're going to hit
confirm and save we got the toast down
there that says file has been saved and
let's also you know try and save to our
pictures save yeah that's working as
well and or down
so we're going to hit save for downloads
as well all with the file name Travis
music test you can change as well but
just to save some time here so now what
we're going to do is we're going to go
into our files to many applications here
to many games play and when our files
here we're in the SD card if you guys
saw that got a hit SD card because
that's where we're saving to again okay
so we're going to scroll and I just clip
the video because I just realized
something we're going to scroll down and
it is right there you can see it but
it's not going to open it because we
didn't add an extension so it doesn't
really know what type it is so in order
for this activity to work you guys want
to actually add the extension such as
P&amp;amp;G test2 and I'll open up our or actual
thing but if we just leave it as is LLL
say unable to open this type so that's a
good thing to note we could probably add
to our file that we created just plus
P&amp;amp;G after that if you guys want and then
let's check our other folders real quick
our music folder got Travis music test
right there again we need to add the
extension and it's probably it's in our
pictures directory as well so just open
up test it yeah trap
Travis music test as well so there we go
guys thanks for watching I'll see you in
the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
