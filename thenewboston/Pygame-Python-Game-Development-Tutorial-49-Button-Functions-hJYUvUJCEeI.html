another PI game tutorial video in this
video we're building our button function
so right now to generate a button we're
basically throwing in this block of code
I mean obviously we're drawing a few
more buttons here but this is getting
really messy and we're using you know
the hard-coded numbers there and we
don't really want to do that so and
basically the reason why I don't want to
do that is because we're writing these
numbers out like a bunch of times so
anytime we want to change something this
would be kind of a problem so now what
we want to do is we're going to write a
button function but we also know that we
need two versions of every color that we
want to use for about it we need an
active version and the inactive version
so light green and regular right or
light red regular red and so on so we're
gonna go to the top of our script here
and we're gonna make some light and dark
colors so we have green and light green
now we have yellow and we need like a
yellow and a light yellow so light
underscore yellow equals what and then
we also have a red and we need a light
underscore red so what we can do though
is we can take away some color from the
regular red for example so we can do two
hundred zero zero and then light red can
be 255 0 0 yellow this one's kind of a
challenge but yellow is the mixture of
red and green so in theory we should be
able to say 200 200 zero for regular
yellow and then 255 255 0 for a light
yellow the green can stay the same
there's really no no problem there we'll
just use the same old code there so now
we've got our colors and now what we
want to do is like we did before
we'll come down here and basically now
what we want to do is we know this was
we're gonna leave text a button for sure
or hmmm try to think here Willie
yeah I think what we'll do we'll just
delete all this maybe leave the cursor
well yeah we'll just delete all this and
basically when we generate a button
first of all we're gonna replace this
with button so we'll say button copy
button button so we know we want a
button here here and here we want this
one to be a play button controls and
quit black will be the color of you know
the text but part of me thinks that we
can just get rid of the text color it's
just gonna be black so we've got the
button the location of the button and
the sizes and all of that so since the
button makes a rectangle usually that
makes a whole lot of sense 150 500 150
so like the location basically and width
and height and then finally the colors
of that button is what we'll throw in so
we'll just say green or light green and
then this one will be yellow and light
yellow and then this one will be red or
light red and that's basically how we
want our button function to operate so
now we're gonna go and define the button
function and we'll just put that right
under here it really don't matter but
we'll do that or underneath message to
screen and we'll say define button and
our parameters for button were the text
that we wanted the button to say the X
location the Y location to the top left
and then the width the height and then
we had interactive or actually let's see
it was in active color and then active
color I believe so regular then yeah
okay so that's those are the parameters
of a button and then like we had before
how how do we make this button but for
everyone so we first say cur equals Pi
game
diet mouse dot get underscore position
oops then we're gonna say what so this
might make a little bit more sense since
we're not gonna be hard coding this so
basically the question is if X so that X
location of the top left right corner of
the box if X plus wit is greater than
the Kiersey row so the x value of
wherever our mouse is Wow
her zero is simultaneously greater than
just X and y plus height is greater than
her one which is simultaneously greater
than just straight Y if all those are
the case then what we do is we do pygame
draw dot Rex where do we draw that
rectangle game display we draw it if
this is the case then it's then we've
got the mouse over the buttons so we
want that to be the active color and
then where's the location of this button
well it's going to be an X Y width
height done then otherwise else what do
we want to do well we're just going to
do basically the exact same thing except
this will be inactive underscore color
so pug and draw a track game display
inactive color same exact location once
that is done we're ready to overlay the
buttons text so we would say text
underscore to underscore button and the
text of button will be text what color
we're going to say black and then we
just specify if you recall the button
parameters so X Y width and height
protects a button and later on down the
road for button you could also add in
another parameter like text color so for
example we could just add another
parameter right now we could say text
underscore color equals black like that
you could do that although if black is
not predefined you would run into some
trouble so I'm just not going to do that
for now but yeah if you wanted to do
that so you could change the text color
as well you could otherwise this should
work so let's go ahead and save and run
that and see how it worked out for us so
we see our buttons we've got in there
and you see how that one is responsive
quit as responsive and play as
responsive so now all of our buttons
appear to be pretty responsive for us so
now the only thing that we have left
that we want to do is add like
functionality to them like if they're
clicked we want to do something so then
the question becomes not only do we ask
if the mouse is within these parameters
we also want to ask like is there a
click and if there's a click well I
can't find my Pi game anymore but if
there's a click then we want to do
something so in the event of quit you
know we want to quit it controls take
them to a control screen play play the
game so that's what we're going to be
doing in the next video as always thanks
for watching and stay tuned to that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
