this tutorial we're gonna learn about
aligning paragraphs and working with
paragraphs and stuff like that in
Illustrator cs6 and we're gonna use the
paragraph panel here and then you can
also do it do some things with the
control panel up here so all I did was I
took a line of text um I mean not a line
of text actually I went and picked out
some lyrics and maybe you can figure out
what they were are by just reading them
but whatever anyways I'm gonna go over
here we're gonna go to window and make
sure that you have your panel open so
you're gonna want to go to paragraph and
it's going to bring up your paragraph
panel if you already had it open
obviously you can click the tabs but the
first thing we're gonna learn about is
aligning you know we're gonna start with
a line Center and when it's aligned in
the center everything's pretty much
centered for each line that you have
it's gonna be equally in the center if
we go to the left it's going to be
aligned to the left of the text box and
right to the right of the text box and
then we've got a couple justifies here
and I'll just do the regular justify or
says justify all lines and that's gonna
space everything out evenly
all the words evenly on each line and if
I justify a line to the left it was
justified to the middle and here's
justified to the right but that's a
that's a good idea on how to align
paragraphs it's not the coolest thing in
the world but you gotta know how to do
it when you're working with stuff like
this so let's go down a little bit
farther and check out the indenting and
the spacing of the paragraphs so pretty
much the you can quickly indent lines of
text
in precise locations using this actually
from from the left or even the right
margin with the ruler here so what I'm
gonna do here is I'm gonna put left
alignment so we can it kind of looks
like what we're used to working with and
we're going to intent some of this stuff
going on here so here is the left indent
button if I start bringing that up
it left indents the whole entire thing
know here is first a line left indent if
I do that look at the very first line of
each well it's not good the first line
indent is not gonna work on this
actually if you move something bad I
need to go back because each line except
for this last one are their own lines
because they have a enter pressed after
so let's just look at this line down
here so pretend this is the start of a
sentence or start of a paragraph right
here and you need to indent the first
line so we'll go ahead I'll put my
cursor down here what's go ahead and
indent this want our first line and now
you can see what I was talking about
when you can be precise you can take
your mouse cursor that was on the type
tool so you just switch to the type tool
and bring it to wherever you need to and
then the last thing we've got here is
the right indent and we can increase the
indent if we want or decrease it all
it's going to do is push things over and
make things become easier it's going to
allow them to be closer to the edge of
the box or not as close just
two more little boxes here left we've
got space before a paragraph and if you
want to add spacing between paragraphs
you can using this so there's tons of
paragraphs on this each sentence right
here is paragraph because they have
entered pressed after them except for
the last one so let's go ahead and I'm
just gonna select all of them use my
selection tool and a now you can see
it's trying to space out in between
these paragraphs and I'll try this one
out it's gonna do pretty much the same
thing because they're all one line well
we can also make them closer together it
looks like I've got a cursor down there
no I can there we go
look who we're smashing it together not
start an overlap well you can get a
closer together or not or whatever and
then you've got hyphenate if you've got
a big word and it goes off the edge it's
gonna hyphenate it if you have this
selected and or it's not it'll just go
to the next line most of the time you
want to take that off because nowadays
nobody really likes hyphenated words
they kind of look unprofessional so
that's about it for this tutorial and
you guys learned about using paragraphs
how to align them how to indent them and
how to basically just maneuver your way
around using paragraphs in Illustrator
you'll probably have to use them at one
time or another and you just got to know
how to do it so you can just get through
it quickly and not get stuck on it so
thanks a lot for watching hope to see
you guys in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
