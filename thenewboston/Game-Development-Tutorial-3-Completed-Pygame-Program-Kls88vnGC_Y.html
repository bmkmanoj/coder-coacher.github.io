pygame tutorial and in this tutorial
it's pretty much a continuation of our
last story going to be picking up where
we left off and we're going to be
building the mouse so make sure your
watch tutorial - before you watch this
one so in order to build the mouse or
our cursor we need to get X in Y
coordinates so we're going to make two
variables x and y and we're going to set
both of those equal to PI game dot mouse
which is this is all built in an
anything time you see PI game it's built
in get underscore POS and no that
doesn't stand for what you think it does
and this gives us an x and y variable
that we can position the mouse so what
we want to do is make it so whatever our
cursor is that's where we want the X and
wherever it is same thing for y so take
your X variable and we will what we want
to do this is set it - equal to Mouse
underscore C or whatever you named it up
here for whatever your image was we want
to set pretty much our image dot get
with underscore get width and divided by
two and I'll tell you why this is if
you're wondering all right this makes
sense to me except when you did this / -
well by default it's it a coordinate
which is like one of the corners of it
and when you divide x and y by 2 it puts
your cursor right in the middle of your
image so if you don't want to in the
middle of your image don't put the / -
but like 99% of time you want your
cursor to be right in the middle of the
image and this this is going to be
really clear whenever you see what I'm
doing so um just pay attention for now
and copy as I do I'll comment and mount
later and I'll show you what happens
when you don't put the / - but for now
y- equals mouse underscore see get there
we go get height this time
get height empty parameters / to make
sure that I'll have my typos or anything
and now what we want to do is just like
we've lit the background to the screen
we want to blit the mouse to the screen
- so screen dot Blitz Mouse underscore C
or whatever you name your image and x
and y for a coordinates X Y there we go
and the last thing that we need to do is
PI game
display update with empty parameters and
what this does is pretty much just make
sure it doesn't flicker this is pretty
much just housekeeping stuff but you
need it in order to have a smoother
running program so let me run this and
it's a lot easier if you see the program
and then I'll go through everything and
tell you what it does pretty much you
don't even know what's going on right
here so let me fix that for you save
this hopefully I don't have any errors
and here's my program right here as you
can see I have a red ball that's in the
screen as you can see this black and
white gradient is my background
this ball is that ball ping I was
talking about and as you can see it's
transparent on the edges so again take
note of my cursor being in the middle of
the ball and now I'll go through that
tutorial one last time and show you what
everything does so here's the program we
just built all right the first thing we
did is set well you should know what
this does just take the image files and
set it equal to variable all of this is
housekeeping stuff we're going to be
going over this later but for now just
copy all that and now let's get to what
we actually program the first thing we
did is build a window or screen so we
can put our like background image in our
regular image in it and you pretty much
need to build a display every time or
else you don't have a window the next
thing we did is converted this
new image and set it equal to variable
name background we also converted this
ball image in set equal to variable name
Mouse see so we have two variables that
we're going to use background in mousey
for our two images in our game next we
built a loop that never ends and we did
this by putting either while one or
while true the first thing that we
needed to do is this and this pretty
much means is invent so when you click X
on your program it shuts down again
we're going to be going over events in
the next tutorial but for now we need
this or else your program is not going
to be able to shut down so sorry if I
made you do it before explain what meant
but just do it before I explain wouldn't
meant the next thing we did is copied
our background onto our screen and we
did this using the blit bullet means
copy I don't know why they said bullet
if someone wants to find that out for me
and leave me a comment I would greatly
appreciate it but just take note that
blip means copy background to the screen
the next thing we did is build our x and
y mouse coordinates again the x value
was that mousey image in again divided
by 2 puts it in the middle and then we
copied that mouse to the screen and
again I'm going to be going over all of
this in detail later I just want to
build you guys a simple program and then
go over the details later
fear it's the best way of teaching
interesting by the end of these
tutorials you'll be a pro at developing
games and lastly I just did a little
housekeeping thing make sure you have
this PI game display update and now let
me show you guys what happens if you
don't have this divided by two and this
will probably clear up while it's useful
go ahead and take out those divided by
two and now run your module and as you
can see instead of my cursor being
inside the ball it's to one of the edges
of the ball and this is why I've divided
by 2 and divided by 2 and x and y what
this does is find the middle of each X&amp;amp;Y
coordinates so puts your cursor in the
middle of the ball now my cursor is only
on
corner of the ball so again I told you
guys I'd show you I and that's why so
that is your third tutorial and I know
things are going to seem kind of
confusing right now Bob promise you I'm
going to be going over each of these
things in details and by the end of
these tutorials you're going to be able
to build awesome 2d and 3d games so
again thank you for sticking with me
don't forget to subscribe and I will see
you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
