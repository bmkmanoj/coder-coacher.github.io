physics lesson and in this lesson I want
to talk to you guys about something
called refraction now before I start
talking to you guys about refraction I
want to tell you guys a story of when I
was a little kid because I just have to
get this story off my chest now you guys
probably think that I was born in New
York or something but you guys are
totally wrong because I was actually
raised on a desert island when I was a
little girl and this desert island had
one tree with a couple of leaves and you
know this picture actually is looking
pretty good right now
pretty sweet-looking tree so here's me
Bucky just a little lonely girl on a
desert island surrounded with nothing
but water so here's the water right here
w eh t e r I think that's how you spell
it
I'm not sure so one day when I was about
I want to say twelve years old a boat
was sailing past now this boat was a
pretty cool looking boat look like that
and inside it was this beautiful girl
named Henry H en r right why I know
weird names but hey it happened so I
wanted to get off the island and meter
so I started yelling at the top of my
lungs now whenever you yell to someone
else your sound waves would look
something like this let me pick some
colors that are going to contrast okay
yellow might look good so the sound wave
might look like this hey yay yeah yeah
hopefully you guys can see that yellow
because it's you know I know it's kind
of light but hopefully it shows up now
this is what typically would happen
whenever you were yelling to someone
whether they were outside your house or
in a parking lot or in a grocery store
something like that but I knew since I
was you know secretly studying physics
on this desert island in my own time
that sound travels faster through warm
air because it's easier for the air
molecules to collide with one another
this is also why sound travels faster
different speeds or excuse me sound
travels at different speeds faster
through water because it's easier for
those water molecules to
pretty much smashed into each other
transferring the sound energy same thing
transfers excuse me travels really fast
through metal because those particles
are so jam-packed together they can
collide with each other really easy same
thing is true with air and water
whenever you get really warm air I'll
label it so you guys know what I'm
talking about
air this warm air basically let's sound
to travel really easy through it now
cool air or I should write cold there
what this cool air right above the water
let's sound travel through it but much
more slowly so what exactly was
happening with these sound waves well
these yellow sound waves was basically
what should have happened but since
sound travels faster through warm air
rather than cool air this is what
actually was happening by the time the
sound wave was supposed to get here the
top of the sound wave actually was a
little bit ahead and the bottom of the
sound wave was a little bit behind where
it should have been why is this again
because it is traveling faster through
the warm air and slower at the bottom
where it's closer to the cool air so the
sound wave actually looked like that now
by the time it was supposed to get to
the second one the same thing happened
but even more so the air was warmer so
the sound wave got to about here now
remember like I said sound travels
slower through cool air so the wave kind
of looked like this and they kept going
on and on and as you can see instead of
a default sound wave like we had in
yellow where would be the case if you're
yelling in a field or in a parking lot
or something
whenever you yell to someone over water
your sound actually bends now that's the
definition of refraction basically the
bending of a sound wave so if anyone
asks you how can a sound wave Bend that
doesn't make sense to me well to recap
one last time send sound waves travel
faster in warm air sound near the water
or trip or excuse me
I keep saying transfer when I mean
travel will travel slower than the sound
above it so
this part of the sound wave is traveling
faster than this part of the sound wave
creating sort of a bend so since my
sound was bending towards the boat that
means that this beautiful girl Henry
could actually hear me more clearly than
if we were both on dry land so that's
another cool fact that you guys you know
maybe you want to impress your friends
or um you know maybe you have a
girlfriend named Henry if you're like
you know what I bet that you can hear me
better if you go out in a boat 300 yards
and then I scream to you so they're like
you know what Bucky I don't believe you
so then you you know you send them out
on the boat and you yell to them and
you're like hey can hear me in there
like yeah I can actually hear you a lot
better in there like okay see ya and
then you know you leave in there stuck
out in the middle of the ocean on a boat
it's an enjoyment for everyone but
anyways that is what refraction is the
bending of sound waves hopefully you
guys enjoy that little story thank guys
for watching and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
