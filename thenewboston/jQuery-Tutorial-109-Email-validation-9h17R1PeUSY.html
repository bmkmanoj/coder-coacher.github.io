data that we've just discussed inside
our email feedback div span let's
refresh and test this out so I'm going
to go ahead and type alt X in fact we
can't really test this functionality
until we've done something in email dot
PHP and that's to pick up this variable
and return it so I'm going to create an
if statement I'm gonna first of all
check if the email variable that we've
sent is set so I've used if is set post
email then I'm gonna go ahead and echo
dollar underscore post in fact let's
just make this into a variable so email
equals dollar underscore post email now
just a quick note it's up to you whether
you want to sanitize this data or not if
it's going into a database then it's
strongly or highly recommended
you sanitize this data and by that I
mean either use HTML entities if you
know you're displaying it onto a page at
further times this will help prevent at
cross-site scripting attack so XSS
attacks or the MySQL real escape string
function which will replace specific
special characters in order to help
prevent SQL injection however for the
purposes of this tutorial I'm neither
putting my data into a database table
nor am i displaying it back to the user
so I'm not going to sanitize the
sanitize the data in this case anyway
we're going to go ahead and echo out
email so now our Ajax is sending the
data we're then retrieving the data here
and when then echoing it back out now
the echo will then be placed into this
data variable and then inside the email
feed back span so let's go ahead and
test so I'm going to type Alex and you
can see that it's returning everything I
type so Alex of PHP academy' dorg it's
constantly returning this value now the
one thing to note is that I'm moving
away and
back and it's still carrying out this
validate email function it's not when we
focus in just showing go on enter a
valid email address so that's an
important stage of it that we're calling
the function at these two key points
where we need the validation to take
place okay so now let's go on to
actually validating and then returning
this value so let's just get rid of that
for now all I'm gonna do inside of this
function is return data okay so this
function will then equal the data that
we get back from email dot PHP and
inside here we need to start actually
validating the email address so I'm
gonna create an if statement here and
I'm gonna say if not empty email we're
gonna go ahead and do something here so
the email address must contain some
value I'm then going to create another
if statement and the condition for this
we're going to use the filter of our
function and the filter of our function
takes typically two parameters we're
only going to be giving it to you can
specify additional parameters but we're
not going to be using them filter bar
we're validating this email address and
we need to say filter validate email now
this function will either return true or
false so if it's equal to false we know
that the email address is not valid so
we're gonna echo that doesn't appear to
be a valid email address
otherwise we should have a valid email
or we will have a valid email let's just
tidy them up and then we can echo valid
email address okay so now we are passing
this variable email we are checking it
using the filter of our function against
folks first of all then we're just
returning the appropriate error
otherwise we assume a valid email
address now at the moment I've just
returned this data so this data will now
either either contain this value here or
this value here now we need to actually
display it so we've returned the data
and you'll notice that nothing will
actually display you'll see that we you
know we're aren't we aren't actually
displaying anything inside of that
inside of the span here the reason for
this is because we've only returned the
data and we haven't actually echoed out
or sorry not echoed out applied it to
this email feedback div so what I'm
going to do is I'm just going to create
a variable called result and that's
going to equal validate email I'm gonna
do the same here as well far result
equals of valid a email now this is a
bit inefficient because we're we're
creating the same variable twice for
each depending on each event we choose
we could define this as a as a variable
elsewhere however just for now we're
going to be keeping them as two separate
variable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
