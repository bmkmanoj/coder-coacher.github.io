a registered Apple developer how does it
feel you are part of a pretty exclusive
club so for now since we are part of
this awesome Club let's go to the first
Development Center the iOS link click
that right there and as a special member
it gives you this little section where
you can download all the cool tools that
you need all the software including this
really fancy text editor which is great
for developing iOS apps now for most of
you guys before you get started I wanted
to I want to mention this what's going
to happen is we're eventually going to
download Xcode I'm going to talk you
guys through that show you exactly how
to do it we're going to install it and
we're going to start building these apps
these really awesome apps now whenever
we want to test it we're going to go
ahead and click umm it's like build and
then it pops up on a little simulator
and we can you know play around with the
interface and whole bunch of stuff now
before I get into all that the reason
that I talked to you guys through that
little process real quick is because we
also have another optional step that we
can take you can also choose right now
to join the iOS developer program wait a
minute Bucky I just registered as iOS
developer and now you're telling me I
can enroll in this other developer
program what the heck is this thing well
if you ever want to actually sell apps
in the App Store
um then you need to join this program
and it also has one other benefit as
well again like I said whenever we're
just learning how to develop apps I'm
going to show you guys how to launch
something called the simulator and it's
just this kind of virtual phone that
pops up on your computer and you can
kind of see what your app is going to
look like in real life by looking at
this little virtual device kind of like
this looks like right now however if you
ever want to test your app on actual
device that you can hold in your hand
then you also need to be part of the
developer program so again if you want
to watch these tutorials and follow
along with it just learning everything
then it's fine you don't need to do this
but the two benefits of this program are
one you can test your apps on a
oh device and to eventually whenever you
decide that you want to sell something
in the App Store then you need to be
part of this program so if you don't
want to be part of it then just go to
the next video but for those who do I'm
going to show you guys how to do that
right now so click on this link join the
iOS developer program and this is $99 a
year so I'm just going to go ahead and
enroll now since eventually I want to be
selling apps and also I'm going to show
you guys in a couple tutorials how to
test on a physical device
well it says okay get everything you
need a lot of love is going to continue
and alright we already have an existing
Apple ID so I'm going to go ahead and
continue right there are you enrolling
is an individual or a business is
essentially what it's saying so I'm just
going to go ahead and click individual
and now all of your contact information
and I'm going to type this but I'm not
going to show you because well I don't
trust you guys so um just to explain
real quick it's just pretty much your
mailing address your credit card
information and again it's $99 a year so
you have to pay for it and it's a you
know just all that guy stuff like you're
buying anything online alright so after
you filled out your address it says okay
what program are you trying to buy well
I'm just trying to buy this one the iOS
developer program of course it says
whenever you want to distribute your
apps on the App Store and also the stuff
there collects certificates to test on a
physical device you can get that so
alright that looks good that's the one
I'm looking for
continue and now here is my billing
information which I'm not going to show
you guys nice try sucka
I'm just going to hit continue looks
good you can verify that and alright do
you agree to all this stuff hold on let
me just read a little oh yeah oh oh okay
that was interesting okay but okay yep I
definitely read all that and I'm just
going to agree oMG can I just get this
thing already complete your purchase by
now and you know what why don't you make
a sign in one more time
jeez Louise alright so we now can choose
our payment option and that's pretty
nice they put that PayPal option right
there but they don't even let you click
it why would they even put it on there
and then like oh you can also pay with
PayPal JK sucker you can't so you know
whoever is making this whip so I just
hide that thing because it's annoying me
but you can choose to either make
monthly payments or just pay with a
debit card I'm just going to pay with my
credit card and then I'll I'm going to
pause the video and then after I fill
this out I'll show you guys what to do
so once you submit your order what
they're going to do is they're going to
send you an email just to verify
everything and it usually comes within a
day or two so it says okay thank you you
are now in the iOS developer program so
from this point until one year from now
you have all the benefits like being
able to sell apps in the App Store and
being able to test on physical devices
pretty cool but now what we need to do
is we need to go in and actually learn
how to make apps before we can sell any
on the App Store so well let's go ahead
and do that right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
