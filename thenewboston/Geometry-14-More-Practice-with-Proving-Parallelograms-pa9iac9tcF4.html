practice with proving that a
parallelogram is a parallelogram so for
this example you're given that a B is
parallel to DC okay and you know that OB
is congruent to that should say OD sorry
OD prove that ABCD is a parallelogram so
first we'll write our given a B parallel
the DC o be congruent to OD and we're
given that okay so what we're gonna do
is we need to get well there's two
things we could do we could prove that
these two triangles are congruent and
then say that this side is congruent to
this side and therefore the it is a
parallelogram or we could get them
congruent and say this side equals this
side and then therefore o bisects these
two so it really doesn't matter which
way you do it one way might have a
little less steps to it okay
so we need we need to we need to prove
that these two triangles are congruent
first okay so if you look these two
angles right here are a special kind of
angle their vertical angles and if you
remember vertical angles are congruent
so in this step we can say angle and
this time we have to write it with three
letters because they share this same
vertex so angle a OB is congruent to
angle D OC vertical so if vertical
angles then congruent okay
the next thing we can do since we know
that this line is parallel to this line
and there cut by this transversal we can
get angle be congruent to angle D so
angle a be au is congruent to angle D
excuse me not angle D angle C D oh and
that if lines are parallel then
alternate interior angles are congruent
so now we have an angle a side and an
angle and if you remember that's one of
our properties for proving triangles
congruent so triangle a B oh is
congruent to triangle C D oh by eight
goals side angle
and then we can get a be congruent to DC
if triangles are congruent their
corresponding parts responding parts are
also congruent and finally I can say a/b
c/d
is a parallelogram because if opposite
sides are congruent and parallel then it
is a parallelogram so
it's congruent to triangle
E Dez by side-angle-side so now I have
one opposite pair of opposite sides
congruent and that's to prove it's a
parallelogram we need this pair of
opposite sides congruent so since we
just proved that the triangles are
congruent we can say a B is congruent to
DC if triangles congruent corresponding
parts are congruent and finally because
I have two pairs of opposite sides that
are congruent I can say ABCD is a
parallelogram because two pairs opposite
sides congruent then it is a
parallelogram so that's all we have to
do with parallelograms today but make
sure you come back when we move on to
circles and a sector of a circle and an
arc of a circle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
