slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're gonna be
changing some things about the log like
adding the ability to show or hide the
log and also adding the ability to hook
the log to our form so let's say this
window is our form whenever this has
moved around the log is gonna be moved
around and connected to it so before we
get started I just want to apologize for
some of the logic errors in my last
tutorials such as in the first two game
tutorials in this tutorial 159 for the
most part I was making up this game as I
was going along and I wanted to do that
because if I went ahead and pre wrote
the code before I did it first of all it
would take a really long time and second
of all it would make it seem to you guys
that like whenever you're making a
program you're gonna come up with the
best most efficient code with no errors
at first and that's not realistic to
what programming is like you when you're
programming you come up with ideas as
you go along you come up with better
ways and you will run into logic errors
and that don't actually show up in your
error list because it's something that
you did wrong or in this case I did
wrong and it's nothing has nothing to do
with a compiler or the program so I
wanted to just apologize for that I did
fix those in tutorial 160 you can see
that I added some annotations to the
tutorials where the errors were created
so that I won't get trolled in the
comments so now that we got that out of
the way I must go ahead and we will hook
our log to the forum one so what we're
gonna do is we're gonna set the position
of new log so new log dot location is
going to be equal to a new point now a
point is a point that has has X&amp;amp;Y
coordinates because the location
property for any form
is going to be of type point so we have
to create a new point and the location
is going to be me dot location dot X so
while this is going to do is going to
get the X location of the current form
which is form one so the X location of
new log is going to be the same X
location as form one so the X location
would be across so we want it to be the
same across as it is form one so it'll
be a straight line down each of the
sides so we got me dot location dot X
and then for the y coordinate will do me
dot location dot Y but we need to
subtract some from so let's open up the
designer for form 1 DB and you can see
that the size 457 across 328 down so
let's go ahead and try a 328 so the Y
location and we want to add 328 because
all coordinates start from the top left
corner of the screen and they go forward
you cannot have negative coordinates so
it's not like a normal grid where it is
across with a point in the middle and
then it has negative coordinates the
point in the middle would be the top
left corner of your screen so let's go
ahead and try plus 328 so it's going to
set the coordinates of our new log to
just below our form 1 and it's going to
be touching the form 1 but what if they
move form 1 well we want to move that
log with it so we'll go ahead and put
the lightening bolt on this and we need
to find the move event so you can see
here we got move so whenever form 1 has
moved we will tie it will set new log
dot location equals and then we'll do a
new point and they'll do me dot location
dot X
and then me dot location dot y and then
we're gonna add 328 so every time it's
moved it's going to update the location
so hopefully everything will work here
well here we won't get any logic errors
so you can see that here is our game and
here is our log extender the log is
touching right to the bottom of the game
then when we move the game around you
can see the log is attached to the game
and it moves with it so this is
something very useful very cool that I
figured out if you've ever used team
view or you've probably wondered how
they did that well this is a similar
method and it works the same way but
then you can also move this log away
from the game it looks like I just took
it there and so but they want you to
move the game again it resets it back to
the original position which is connected
to it and it'll function just like
normal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
