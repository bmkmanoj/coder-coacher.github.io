to make a video real quick with some
pretty important updates first of all
I've always been getting a ton of
messages in my inbox and people have
been asking me for my mailing address
and I finally got one so any of you guys
who wanted to mail me stuff what you're
gonna mail me I don't know but you want
my mail and dress and I finally gone I
don't remember it because I just have it
but i will post it on my youtube main
channel the new boston and i will also
post it in the description box under
this video so if you want my mailing
address for any reason send me mail or
you know rotten bananas or a box of
cereal maybe um it's under this so there
you go second important announcement due
to this is the most requested thing that
I get they always want me to make a
forum everyone who pretty much sends me
a message so I finally made a form i
actually made a couple days ago but me
and couple members have been working on
a few things make sure it was good to go
before I told all you guys about it so i
will put a link to the forum in the
description box as well it's the new
boston.com / forum if I you just want to
type it in or something a bookmark it
but anyways I made a forum for all my
computer program and stuff and here's
what I think would be a good idea a lot
of people want the source code for my
tutorials but I'm not going to go ahead
and get it all because I have like 900
tutorial so if you want to share the
source code with each other I'm you can
go there and do that and also if you
have any if you're like writing a
program and you get some errors and you
don't know why go to my forum and post
the code there if I see it I'll help you
out and tell you how to fix it if you
see someone else's code and you know
what's wrong with it tell them how to
fix it and then everyone can work
together and we all have best programs
ever and also I have sections for like
3d modeling and photoshop and everything
like that so if you like don't know what
to do on After Effects you're like why
does it sound play on After Effects post
in the forum and I'll try to answer it
for you or someone will
and if you have any questions at all
basically I know people always message
me with computer related questions
instead of messaging me post them on the
forum because not only I can help you
but everyone all the members can help
you and we can collaborate together and
find the best solution so I'm super
excited about that super excited by my
mailing address and um that's why I
haven't been making a lot of videos but
because I've been working on this forum
so go check it out make sure to join it
subscribe and that some guys what you
think if there's something wrong with it
then I you know I just made it I'm
there's probably going to be a couple
things that I can fix on it but if
there's anything you want me to improve
there's little section at the bottom for
our suggestions and stuff so let me know
and soon enough we'll have one of the
greatest forums on the Internet so thank
you guys for watching make sure to check
out my form and send me something in the
mail and I'll open it and i'll make a
video about it or something so uh yeah
i'll be looking forward to hearing from
you guys so i'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
