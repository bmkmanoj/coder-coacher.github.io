boring crap out of the way in the last
video so let's start learning something
cool the first thing I want to show you
guys is basically how to create a new
image from cutting out an area of your
original image so this of course is my
original image next let me show you in
Photoshop so say that we want to take
this and I don't know maybe we need to
crop it because we're using it as a
profile picture on a website or
something or maybe we just only wanted
part of this because my ex-girlfriend
was on the side so we wanted to crop her
out so what we can do using pillow is
essentially this we can crop out for
example a piece of this image right here
and pretty much cut it and save this
portion as a new image so let's go ahead
and learn how to do that and let me
close out of this alright so I deleted
the other two lines so I kept the first
one and the last one pretty much created
an object from this image and displayed
it in Photoshop so the first thing that
we need to do is we need to give it the
area that we want to crop so I'm going
to set it equal to area and it's
actually a 4 item couple the first two
parameters are the X&amp;amp;Y coordinates of
the top left corner so 100 100 so
actually let me probably shouldn't have
deleted that alright so we'll say that
we want to start at 100 over and 100
down so this is going to be our starting
point and we'll say that we'll crop to
like I don't know like 300 and 375 so in
order to do that the other parameters
are 300 and 375 now another thing I want
to point out is whenever you're making
your tupple right here make sure that
you don't go outside the main image area
so for example you can't start at 100
100 and end up at like I don't know 600
700 because that's off your original
image so
just watch out for that so this is the
area that we want to crop so now what we
have to basically say is create a new
image from this cropped image well the
first thing we need is to be able to
store this new image in its own object
so I'm going to name my new image
cropped image and now in order to crop
it take your original image and call the
function crop now this crop function the
only parameter that it takes is a four
digit tupple with the parameters or the
coordinates of where to crop oh that's
convenient we have one right there so
I'm going to take this and pass it in
and you can actually throw this entire
thing right in here without the need for
the area variable but then you have
these double parenthesis and it gets
kind of messy so this is actually the
best way to do it so what we're
basically saying is take this original
image of Bucky and crop out an area with
these coordinates and store that new
image in this cropped image so now if we
actually just show this what it's going
to do whenever you run this is check
this out now the reason that we have two
of these is because this is the one I
was demonstrating this is the one that
opened with this line right here and
whenever I ran this line look at what it
did pretty stinking cool so this is our
original image and this is our new
cropped image and later on I'm going to
be showing you guys how to you know
whatever you want to do with it whether
you want to upload it to the internet or
just save it as a JPEG or ping whatever
but that is how you do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
