wx-- tutorial and in this tutorial I'm
going to show you guys how to take a
simple image such as this Creek right
here and turn it into a button and I'm
going to show you guys how to do this
because whenever we're working with
buttons
um the defaults kind of don't suck but
they're kind of plain and anytime we
want to build a cool-looking button then
we need to use our own bitmap and
normally you wouldn't use like an image
you just make a cool-looking button but
same concept you'll get it so the first
thing that we need to do is go ahead and
make our button object and now I'm just
going to name it pic since I can
remember picture that's what I usually
go on next you need to do W X dot image
and that's less you use image but it
takes a few parameters the first
parameter is um pretty much the name of
the file and mine is named creek dot BMP
it's bitmap and this needs to be in the
same directory as your program if it's
in something else then again you need to
do your slashes and all that with your
different folder names but just a for
this tutorial put in the same directory
after that you need to write this w X
dot in all capital capital letters
bitmap not mipmap bitmap underscore type
underscore BMP and the last thing you
need to do is convert to bitmap and this
again just fill in all of this and what
this is going to do is store this bitmap
picture in a variable or object called
pic so now we can do things to this pic
so just remember what this does is allow
you to use pick anytime you want to use
that picture instead of having to type
this whole thing out so the next thing
we want to do after this is go ahead and
create that button so go ahead and input
self dot just name it a button or
something and what you need to set it
equal to is W
X dot and this is how you make bitmap
buttons bitmap button and in your
parentheses you write what you want it's
parent V I'm going to write my panel
negative one for ID negative one and
then after this you got a name what you
want your button be and so we want ours
to be picked again that's what we just
made and the last parameter you probably
want is the position of it so right POS
stands for a piece of no I'm just
getting a stands for position let's go
ahead put 10 10 10 or something doesn't
matter um and now what we have here is
pretty much a button but the thing is
this is pretty much just a picture of a
button right now we didn't give any
functionality so what we want to do is
bind an event to one so we have a button
and it's pretty much the same all right
what do you want to do with it what we
want to do is self bind and what we're
going to create here is the function of
when you click on the button it closes
so what do we want to bind to the button
um well we don't need that equal sign
first of all um put WX event underscore
button and this means um well you see
what it means you should know all this
from the left tutorials we need to be
create a function later that says do me
and this do me function is going to
close the button and you want to bind to
self dot button so what this fine did is
say ah right on the button function we
want to execute this function do me to
the button and if you run in alright
where's this dooming function well we
got build that later so let's go ahead
and press enter and now we just have to
set uh well you'll see a self button and
put set default and what this is pretty
much your housekeeping for creating your
button so now it looks like we're good
to go
but the only thing we have left
do is create that do me function and
what that do me function does is pretty
much say just close this button so let's
go ahead and put create a function theft
due yep there we go right there and the
parameters take self event and real
simple just put self destroy I spell
that right close enough so let me run
this and I'll show you guys what it does
when you run it I go ahead and then we
have this picture right here of this
Creek and then we can either close it
out using this or if we click this Creek
which is also the button it go ahead and
closes the program like that so let me
show you guys why this works the first
thing we did is take this entire image
right here this is how you do it you
can't change this and we store it in a
variable called pic this is just make it
easier the next thing we did is go ahead
and create a button using WX bitmap
button this is how you create bitmaps
boo-boo-boo-boo bitmap buttons in WX the
parent was panel ID negative one the
button it says alright what do you want
to use for button we want to use that
pic image and this is just positioning
the next thing we do is says all right
if we just created a button if we don't
make it have any function then it's
pretty much just a picture we don't want
that so what we need to do is combined
when we click the button to have it
shutdown and again we put that shutdown
function in do me and then we built that
later on so whenever it says all right
we want to execute a program called do
me and that program just destroys the
button and this is just housekeeping to
create the button so again that is your
ninth tutorial on how to create bitmap
buttons hopefully you know now how to
create them so thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
now see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
