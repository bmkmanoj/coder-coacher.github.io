Photoshop cs6 tutorial i'm your host
buddy Blackford today we're going to be
talking about applying a stroke to your
path and we're going to use our path
here that we created and right now i
just have a circular path around this
moon and we're just going to apply a
stroke around it so go ahead and make
your paths and then go to your paths tab
here and we'll go to our path options
and go to stroke path now we've only got
two options here we've got our tool and
we can use all of these tools here and
then we've got simulate pressure so when
we select our tool here the main thing
to know and it's important to know is
that the properties that your tool had
last is what they're going to use when
they're trying to make the stroke here
in Photoshop also your foreground color
is going to be the color that gets the
stroke applied so right now I have read
and it's going to use my last known
brush settings which is have six as the
size and all my mode and opacity and
everything like that so stroke path and
I'm just going to hit OK and now I get
the circular stroke there so let me go
back and I'm just going to adjust some
of these settings a little bit we'll
make it like 35 and we'll make it really
soft and then i'll go ahead and make my
stroke path ok and now you can see that
as a softer brush and a thicker stroke
we can use all the different things oh
that's the wrong one we can use all the
different tools that it has so let's
look at them real quick pencil brush
racer background eraser so if I wanted
to race around the outside edge now it's
erased the eraser must have been small
because it just did this little line in
between so let's check out the racer yep
it was at three let's bring this up to
like 40 something
and you can see I erased around the
outside of it now that looks that's
pretty helpful too if I wanted to just
select the moon and now it's easy really
really easy to just select that and I
have a perfect circle around it so I
just wanted to show you that the other
thing I didn't go over yet was the
simulate pressure button and it's going
to mimic the pressure that you use when
you're using a drawing tablet and
photoshop is going to try to simulate
that for you so that's all there is to
know about the using the stroke on your
path it's simple it's easy and it's an
efficient tool to you so go ahead and
use that when you need to in your
different ways and experiment with all
these different kinds of brushes like if
you use the healing brush it would mix
it in if you use the burn tool it burn
all the way around the edges you could
sharpen the edges if you needed to and
so on so use the tool to your advantage
because it is really helpful and you can
do multiple strokes on top of strokes so
you can first you can sharpen it and
then you can add another color around it
or something like that so that's pretty
helpful so that's a nice tool to learn
and I hope you guys use it well in your
next project so see you guys later and
have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
