have 89 cents you have to figure out
what kind of corns you have to make up
89 cents so so you have three quarters
that'd be 75 cents so you subtract the
75 cents so 9 minus 5 is 4 and the 8
minus 7 is 1 so you have 14 cents left
so you can either use two nickels or one
dime so say you just either/or two
nickels or one dime so let's count it
down three quarters let's say two
nickels two nickels is 10 cents bring
down the poor so you have four cents
left so you can have nothing left but
four pennies so you can make 89 cents by
having three quarters two nickels four
pennies or let's say you can either
convert this to one dime or you can
revert this to seven dimes and one
nickel so altogether you can have eight
dimes one nickel and four pennies
another option if you didn't have any
quarters let's go to a different example
93 cents so you have the 93 cents and
say how to use all nickels all you had
was nickels and pennies so how many
nickels make up 90 cents so you know
five and five is ten so thinking
critically if you had if you want to
have 90 that would be nine tens so that
would be nine dimes and you'd times that
by to 18
so 18 nickels would make up 90 cents
bring down three and all you have left
is three pennies so 18 nickels and three
pennies or you can do nine dimes in
three pennies or say you had some
quarters 75 cents get to carry over make
that in a 13 that's 8 and 8 minus 7 is
18 so you have 18 cents left so you can
use one dime that's three quarters so
one dime is ten cents and then you let's
bring this up here so yeah one dime and
you subtract five cents is three one
nickel and then three pennies remaining
there is another option
26 cents so you're 26 cents and you can
have one quarter and one penny you can
have two dimes so just 20 cents one
nickel and one penny that's two dimes
one nickel and one penny or five times
five is twenty five so five nickels and
one penny so many possibilities sure
another one sixty eight cents say you
want to use this little coins you
possibly can so you'd use your quarters
first or if you have a half dollar you
can use a half dollar so let's say you
have one half dollar one H team that's
50 Cent's 8 - zeroes 8 + 6 minus 5 is 1
and you have 18 cents left so you can do
one dime just 10 cents one nickel oops
that's not a plus sign one nickel
and one penny
so you have 32 cents you can't use a
half-dollar so you have to use a quarter
borrow one from the 3 negative to make
that 12 and that's seven two minus two
is zero so that's one quarter and you
have one nickel and then two pennies
and that's all I have with subtraction
