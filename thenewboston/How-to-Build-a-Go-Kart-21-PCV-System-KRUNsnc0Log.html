and in this video I want to talk about
the PC v-system now in the next video
what we're going to be doing is we're
going to be hooking up the gas tank and
whenever we hook up the gas tank we hook
up two hoses to it - of course well you
obviously need a hose between the engine
and the gas tank so the gas has a way of
getting to the engine but if you go
ahead and take a look around what I just
taught though you're going to notice
that there are a lot of other hoses
these ones that come from all over
places this thing that helps up to PCV 3
hoses hooked up to that something is
hooked up to something near your air
filter what the heck is this crap well
for your complete fuel system you need
more hoses than just a hose connecting
the gas tank to the engine because what
happens is your engine isn't 100%
perfect often gasoline fumes in harmful
vapor pretty much leaks in various
places from your engine for example
hurtful gas vapor may be leaking from
the fuel tank or maybe your carburetor
or maybe some fuel vapors may get past
the piston in your engine so in order to
pretty much prevent these vapors from
just escaping into the atmosphere
because of course that would be bad for
the atmosphere in - it would be a waste
of fuel what they did is they decided
they designed a PC V system so that is
why if you ever look on the engine and
you see a little plastic thing called
PCB that's what it is so what the heck
does PCB stand for first of all it
stands for a positive crankcase
ventilation now what it does is it takes
all of the places where harmful gas
vapors can escape for example or is it
one I just had for example this one
takes all the harmful filters from the
gas tank I could zoom in on it properly
and let's see there are some hooked up
to the carburetor and the reason that
you may have some harmful vapors in your
carburetor is because your carburetor is
of course responsible for mixing the
gasoline in the air together to give it
the perfect mixture to burn however when
that mixture is off a little bit then it
may result in some excess gas vapors so
like I said there's a bunch of different
places on your engine where harmful
vapors are created or are supposed to be
so what this does is it reroute all of
the gas vapors pretty much takes them
from where they're not supposed to be
and reroute them back into the area
where it can burn again so of course you
know like I just said that the
carburetor is responsible for making
that perfect mixture what this does is
it takes all the vapors and puts it back
into the engine so they can reburn
therefore what it does is like I said
prevents all the vapors from going into
the atmosphere in preventing you from
wasting more money on gas so I know that
what I usually do is I talk to you guys
about what I'm extoling onto my engine
and then I show you guys where
everything goes but there are a lot of
different connections for this and if I
made a video it would be like 20 min not
20 minutes long probably like 10 minutes
long so on your engine whenever you're
looking at it you're going to notice
several places where it's pretty much
different for every engine so it's going
to be no use to showing you where mine
goes because like I said it's going to
be different for your engine so now that
you know what the system does in pretty
much one sentence takes the bad vapors
from all over your engine and reroutes
them to the engine so they can burn it
in and that's pretty much it so now that
you know the basics of a pcv7 system
which stands for positive crankcase
ventilation we're ready to take that
knowledge and use it to hook up the gas
tank so that's what we have to look
forward to in the next tutorial so I
will see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
