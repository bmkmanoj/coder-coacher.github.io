to your very first blender tutorial now
if you're wondering Ari I don't even
know what blender is why am i watching
this tutorial then well that's a good
question but if you actually want to
answer to that blender is a 3d editing
program so you can make like 3d
animations and cool graphics and maybe
you can make a fake 3d UFO and put it on
YouTube and get millions views and get
tons of money and you know just quick
idea but before you start doing that the
first thing you're probably going to
need to do is download blender and like
I said it's free so don't be complaining
about money and this is one of the best
free programs you can get so the first
thing you need to do is go to the
Internet
now what the Internet is it's a way of
you know I think I I think you all know
what the internet is and if you don't
then you should just stop watching right
now but next after that go to Google or
anywhere and type in blender that's it
nothing else and now we got to look for
a blender by looking for it oh no I'm
just kidding what we need to do is go to
this first link
it's blender org and this is the home
page of blender which is again the name
of the program that you're about to
download now what one of these at the
top can allows download featuring
gallery maybe download definitely not
education help looks promising community
now go to download so click download and
now you get all these versions that you
really don't know what one pick well
well you I mean it's pretty obvious what
to pick but uh in case you don't know
99% of you are probably going to click
this windows 32-bit if you know you have
64-bit then you can download a zip file
for that but the windows is a very top
one and most you guys have 32-bit so
there's Linux and Mac's down there but
uh like I said most you guys want to go
this windows 32-bit and you want to
download the blender 2.49 installer you
don't want the zip file right here that
extra work that you don't need you want
to go right to the Installer because
that's some like a common installer like
a wizard and what you want to do is
click on this USA link and when you
click that I'm not gonna click it
because I already installed it it's
gonna download an executable file what
you need to do is if you're on Firefox
just double-click that executable file
let me see if I have it where my
downloads tools downloads right here
let's see what I downloaded anything
embarrassing a movie picture of a fat
guy to send my sister right here here's
where you're gonna download this is
blender 2.49 executable file and when
you download that double-click it and
it's gonna run and as you just have to
like type next agree agree to some stuff
next next and once you do that you're
gonna get this little thing called
blender on your computer so now you just
downloaded blender simple enough so now
when you have this icon on your computer
you can go ahead and double click it to
open the application so double click it
just like that and actually probably the
first thing you notice is not only one
box of blender opens but also the second
box right here if you're working with
Windows you have this box that opens in
this is called the DOS box now I know
it's annoying but don't just press X and
close it because if you do both of these
programs are going to close you need to
leave this running and what this does is
just check that you have hopefully if
python on your computer already if you
don't then go to my other tutorial i'll
put a link and you can install python
there it's even easier than solving this
one i should i had downloaded and
another tutorial but this just set
checks for python so you can go ahead
and minimize that again don't close it
or your programs you need to leave it
open the whole time you're running your
program so and then once you do that you
got blender open and if you see this
then you are good to go so that's all
we're gonna be covering in this tutorial
I just want to show you
what blender is how to install it I just
want to tell you guys it's free you
should all install it because you're
going to be learning how to animate in
3d it's an awesome program oh did I
mention like 80 times already it's free
so you got no excuse not to download it
go do it and my car alarms going off so
I will see you next tutorial oh by the
way don't forget to subscribe I'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
