with another tutorial video for PI game
for Bucky and New Boston so what we left
off we just downloaded PI game and made
sure that we could import it and now
we're ready to talk about the basically
the skeleton of Huygens so what are the
required things that must be here for PI
game to work so first we have import PI
game from the last video
easy enough we have to import the module
to actually use the things from the
module now what's the next thing that is
absolutely imperative that we have that
is PI game dot in it and in it is short
for initialize and what this is going to
do is is going to initialize all of the
pugging modules so to speak that we're
going to use and actually most of the
time you'll just see people say PI game
in it but in it this Piegan dot and it
actually does return to you something so
if the initialization of a module
doesn't work you're not going to get any
return on why or what happened or that
something didn't work but if you do want
one just for future reference you can
this function in it does return a tuple
which is a successful initializations
and unsuccessful so you could say x
equals PI game dot in it and that will
return something and then so we could
print X we'll run that in a moment so
you can see what I mean actually let's
go ahead and run that now then I get rid
of that that's not really necessary to
see
so anyway 6:06 successes zero failures
we're all set so that's just a quick
aside about hogging that in it so you
have to have PI ganda in it the next
thing that you have to have is your
surface so you have to get your surface
and what a surface is is kind of like
the background or the canvas of what
you're going to draw your objects to and
then you update that surface to this to
like the users screen basically so first
we need that surface so we're going to
call this game display and this is going
to equal PI game dot display dot set
under school
or mode and in here we're only going to
put one parameter for now and this
parameter is a tuple it must be a tuple
and you're probably going to forget I
know I've forgotten a few times to make
it a tuple you're just going to throw it
in here and you're going to have a
problem but for example if we wanted our
window to be 800 pixels wide 600 pixels
tall that is what we would type now it's
obviously very easy though to do this
and now you've got two function
parameters instead of what you meant to
be just one as a tuple and 800 comma 600
is actually a valid tuple but when you
pass that through a function it's going
to treat 800 and 600 as different
function parameters so we can't do that
you can also make this a list most
people make it a tuple so I'm going to
go ahead and keep that as a tuple since
that's how you're usually going to see
it so um that's game display that's
going to return a PI game dot surface
object so game display will be our
surface so whenever we do stuff we're
going to be doing it to game display and
then we're going to update it
so speaking of update let's talk about
that now so you're going to see PI game
dot display dot update and you're going
to see this most often but there is
actually another function that's
completely interchangeable with this
alias in this form and that would be PI
game dot display dot flip so right now
these two functions do the exact same
thing so what's the difference uh it's
necessary to know the difference for
sure because you're gonna see some
people use flip and then you're gonna
see a lot of people use update and you
might not know what the difference is
and you might actually not like even
know flip even exists because almost
everyone uses update so PI game dot
display dot lip is it's called flip and
you can think of it like a flipbook
and that's the way most games work our
game is going to work a law like a
flipbook and what is motion in the game
is only perceived motion it's actually
just you know a frame and then you make
an update and you show another frame
with a slight change and you keep
slightly changing things you give the
appearance of motion but it's not really
motion so it's like a flipbook if you've
ever made a flipbook and you'd like draw
things you just barely
change everything every page and then
when you go to flip all through the
pages it looks almost like you made a
movie and that's how and why this is
called flip so flip is going to update
the entire surface all at once pygame
display dot update is only going to
update the specific area that you
mentioned or tell it to update but if
you put no parameters in this function
it's going to update the entire surface
so for that reason you rarely see people
use pygame displayed off flip it just
doesn't get used that much but in case
you see it that's what it is the same
thing now that's basically required for
your game to run the next thing you need
um although just just as a note nothing
is going to run so you have PI game
display to update there but then you'd
have you know some code down here some
more updates and that kind of stuff so
we'll get to that but finally to
actually exit PI again you need two
things first you have to have a PI game
quit and what Kagamine up quit is going
to do obviously is going to quit PI game
but what's actually doing is
uninitialized PI game so we initialized
all those things here now we run
initializing them here finally you must
have a quit you have to call that and
then that's what's going to exit out of
Python so let's go ahead and run this
real quick and what you're going to see
is a window just pops up and goes away
really quick so that's this window as
soon as it's initialized it's updated
and then we quit and just as a side note
the reason why we see this question here
like are you sure you want to quit it is
because we're on IDE if we close this
and we were to actually just run it from
the script itself you'll see a window
just pops up and it goes away and
there's no asking like questions so we
actually run this game no problem so
with that those are the bare basics in
the skeleton if you will of Pi game so
now we're going to be talking about in
the next video or I guess the muscles if
we're going to continue this analogy are
the muscles to buy a game and then we'll
kind of go into logic of Pi game and all
of that so it'd be good fun so that's it
for this video thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
