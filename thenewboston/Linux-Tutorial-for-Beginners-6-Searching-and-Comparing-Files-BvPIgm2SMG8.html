video I'm going to show you some other
really cool useful things that you can
do with the terminal and before this
video started what I did is I made two
sample files and I just found some text
online and I pasted them in there and I
don't know I just want some sample files
to work with so if you want to follow on
go ahead and make some you know like
temporary files and paste whatever you
want in there
but the first command I want to teach
you guys is how you can search a file
for a specific keyword or you know any
bit of text so in this corn file I'll
just show you guys
none of this code is important arm this
is just source code but it could be any
code a story a Word document say that
you wanted to go through here and look
for the word button so you want to
search this file for the word button
well what you do is you type gr EP and
then type whatever word you're looking
for so I'm just looking for the word
button so it's going to say and actually
I'm not even in the right directory so
move to my desktop and okay so grip
button and after this is saying you want
to search for the word button in what
file
well search for the word button in corn
so hit enter and now it's going to go
through that file and any time it sees
the word button it's going to display
that line so let's see if we can find
what it found so the first line was this
so that's why I print out bottom button
and then where's the next one right here
so that's why it printed that and that's
essentially all it's doing so grep the
word you're looking for in the file
simple enough
now another cool thing that you can do
with the terminal is you can compare two
files so what if you wanted to compare
this file corn with this file and you
wanted to see the differences between
the two I know maybe this is an updated
version and you wanted to see what
changed what we can do is you can use
the command DIF and it will show you the
difference between two files
file ones name which is corn and file
Tuesday which is corn to hit enter and
it will show you the difference between
the two files so any line that's
different it's going to print out so for
example in corn it says public class
main and in corn - it says public class
beef and also in corn it says button
equals new button and in corn - button
equals new thingy so let's check that
out here's corn one let me open chord
two as well so here is corn one a button
equals new button and in corn two button
equals new thingy so it does work so let
me just clear this NR a so now we know
how to search a file for a specific word
and also how to compare two different
files one other command that you may
find useful is if you ever want to
change your password type pas swd so
whenever you hit enter it's going to say
what is your current password so just
enter it and make sure that you know you
have permission to change it and enter
your new password and verify your new
password and password unchanged and that
says that because I didn't actually want
to change it so I just like to say one
over again but that is how you would do
it now another useful command that you
can use is if you ever want to have a
bit of information and store it inside a
variable and if you guys never
programmed before then a variable is
just a placeholder for something else so
let's make a variable called name and
we're going to set it equal to the value
of Bucky and just hit enter so now I can
use this keyword name and for this
example just to keep things real simple
I'm just going to use echo and the echo
command just take something and displays
it on the screen so it's like really
easy so if you echo hey now it's going
to display hey now so it's pretty much
like the most basic command ever so what
we can do is if we want to echo out the
variable type of echo and then you use
the dollar sign
and the dollar sign is the way of
telling Linux that hey this is a
variable so echo the variable name is in
say okay name is a placeholder for what
it's a placeholder for Bucky now if you
do something like echo um my name is
name it says my name is and then it
echoes out your variable now usually you
just want to make variables like this
you would set those equal to like files
or you know something important but
there you go that's the basics of how
you can use variables in your terminal
now one other thing I want to point out
is if you ever see a command and maybe I
forgot to go over in detail or maybe you
just want to know some more information
about it then write the word info and
then you type the word of your command
so echo like okay that echo thing was
pretty cool if you type this it's going
to give you a whole bunch of info about
the echo command so here you can see
okay
echo it prints a line of text then it
writes each given string to standard
output which pretty much means your
computer screen and a space between
newline last one okay I don't really
feel like reading all that and here are
the different options you can have so
you know whenever we just listed the
contents of a directory we had the
option of using minus a and minus l for
having more details or showing hidden
files well a lot of these commands have
other options and there you go read all
about that I'm sure it's thrilling but
whatever so I want to get out of here so
just hold ctrl Z and that will pop you
back up to home and just hit clear to
clear the screen so there you go that is
your basics of you know how to search a
file for a specific keyword how to
compare files change your passwords use
variables and the last thing I want to
show you guys real quick is if you ever
have a command and you are too lazy to
type it again then what you can do is
you can cycle through your previous
commands using the up arrow on your
keyboard so I'm
is going to tap up and all the previous
commands that I typed in this little
example are right there so I can cycle
through pressing up and down so maybe
I'm like okay actually I want to echo
hey now again for some reason just press
up until you got it again hit enter and
it runs that command again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
