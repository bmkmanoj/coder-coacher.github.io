slash on live gamer for the new Boxton
and in this tutorial we're going to be
talking about graphics now we're going
to be working with graphics a lot
throughout the next couple tutorials so
let's go ahead and create a new project
we will select a windows forms
application and we will just call it
graphics demo now in this program we're
going to be making some of the simplest
graphic drawings that you can do so
we'll just wait for that to load and
once it's done we'll just resize the
form some and let's come over here to
our tool box and we'll add a button make
it a little bit bigger we'll set the
text to draw rectangle and we will set
the name to button draw so let's go
ahead and center it some and we'll
double click on draw rectangle to open
up the event handler so whenever button
draw is clicked is going to run this so
all we need to do first is create a
graphics object or it would be more like
a variable because we're not creating a
new instance of the object so we'll just
do private and we'll call it G as system
dot drawing dot graphics now I believe
system drawing is already imported so
let's just go ahead and see if graphic
shows up so system dot drawing is
already important but if you ever need
to access graphics and it's not
important you can just go ahead and use
the longhand version of that so now that
we have our G what we want to do is set
it equal to something so we'll do that
whenever the form loads so we'll set G
equals and then we'll type in me now me
refers to the form 1 class which is the
form 1 right here so what we need to do
is create graphics for that so we'll
just call me dot create graph
fix it says public function create
graphics as system not drawing graphics
creates the graphics for the control so
basically lets us draw stuff on our form
so G is going to be equal to me create
graphics so whenever we draw anything
with G it's going to be drawn directly
to the form now you can set G equal to
say button draw dot create graphics I
think but you can set it don't quote me
on that
but you can set it equal to other things
to draw on certain parts of your program
so whenever they click draw what we want
to do is draw a rectangle so G draw and
you can see that there's a whole bunch
of stuff here that we can use what we
want to do is select draw rectangle now
draw rectangle is going to take some
arguments the first version of draw
rectangle takes a pin and a rectangle
now you can make objects of rectangles
and you need four points to that and we
go into that later but for now we're
just going to use this version of draw
rectangle which takes a pin object and
then our exposition on our Y position
which is the top left corner of our
rectangle the width and the height so to
specify a pin what we want to do is just
type pins dot and this I believe is an
enumeration and we can just select any
color we want so we'll just do pins dot
black our exposition I'll show I'll
start it off at let's say it 1 1 so you
can so you guys can see where that is
that's going to be somewhere right up in
here close to the corner form 1 and then
bigger these numbers are the farther
away it gets so this is the starting
point for your exposition and Y position
this will be 0 0 and it goes all the way
down to right here and this would be the
biggest so we'll do 1 1 and for our
width we'll just make it 20 pixels long
and or let's make that a little bit
bigger 30 pixels long and 20 pixels wide
so go ahead and run this you can see
when we click draw rectangle it draws a
rectangle right here in my form so let's
just move that away from the top-left
corner so you can see a little bit
better so we'll do it 30 pixels down and
30 pixels across or 30 pixels across and
30 pixels down go ahead and run this and
when we click draw a rectangle you can
see that it draws the rectangle for us
so let's go ahead and close out of that
we can also use fill rectangle just go
ahead and run this and for fill
rectangle what we're going to need is a
brush so we'll just type brushes dot
black so whenever you're feeling
something use a brush to fill it and
whenever you're drawing the outline or
just draw you're going to use a pin so
go ahead and run this we'll click draw
rectangle and you can see that it fills
a rectangle on our form 1 so go ahead
practice a little bit with graphics look
at some of the methods that you can use
um by typing draw and see what kind of
stuff you can draw and once you've
played around with that a little bit
maybe there's something you don't know
just move on to the next tutorial and
your questions will probably be answered
and we'll look more at graphics so
thanks for watching and stay tuned for
the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
