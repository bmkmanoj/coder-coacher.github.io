your fourth chemistry lab tutorial in
this video I want to talk to you guys
about the Erlenmeyer flask now this is
probably the most famous or popular
pieces of chemistry glassware and that's
because I think of its unique shape you
don't see anything that looks like this
other than in chemistry lab and well I
don't know I just think it looks really
cool but the uses of these things are
actually really similar to beakers for
example you can use these for measuring
you can also use them for boiling
solutions etc etc basically anything
that you can do with a beaker you can do
with an Erlenmeyer flask now the reason
that you may prefer to use an Erlenmeyer
flask rather than a beaker in certain
experiments is because first of all it
makes it really easy to swirl solutions
if you try to swirl solution with a
beaker it's probably going to get all
over the place but in an Erlenmeyer
flask it's really easy another thing is
that whenever you have product and you
need to seal it up sealing things up in
a beaker is actually kind of difficult
because the mouth is so wide but with
these flasks you can just go ahead and
put a cork in it or a rubber stopper you
can seal them up really easy now another
reason is that they don't tip as easy as
beakers due to the shape whenever you
set it down they're really hard to knock
over so they don't tip easy and the last
reason is just well it looks really cool
now if you want some advice on buying
these first of all the most important
thing I can say is make sure that it's
legal to own in your state you guys are
probably going to think I'm kidding
whenever I tell you this but in Texas
these are illegal and I don't know if
any other states banned them or not but
thanks to all the meth labs even though
these are just you know stupid pieces of
glass their shape funny these are
illegal to own in Texas unless you have
a special permit I know who would have
thought that owning an Erlenmeyer flask
would be illegal many ways first thing
make sure it's legal in your state now
if it is then what I recommend doing is
getting a set of two as you notice all
of my flats I have two of the same size
from one thousand milliliters all the
way down to
the milliliters and you can actually
often buy them in a five piece set just
like that and if you can only get you
know one or two you probably want to
stick with 250 milliliters that's what
this one is right here it's I want to
say the most common size probably 250
and 500 milliliters that's what we're
going to be using in our experiments
another thing is just like the beakers
you want to make sure that it has see
that volume indicator on the side
because if you have them without the
volume indicator of course you never
know how much solution or you know
product you have in your flask and the
last thing I want to say is well two
more things first of all make sure you
get high quality glass because like you
know beakers and boiling class anything
else that we can boil in including these
flasks
you want to make sure that you have high
quality glass so it doesn't overheat and
crack or chip and the last thing is if
you can go ahead and buy Stoppers too
because whenever we experiment and we
you know have our final product you want
we want to keep it for you know however
long or if we're just you know producing
some gases and we want to capture them
it's really helpful to have Stoppers
both solid stoppers corks or these ones
with holes in them I know if you guys
can see it so anyways this is a helpful
whenever you want to capture the gases
anyways that's my little video on
Erlenmeyer flasks well that's kind of a
tongue twister to say anyways thank you
for watching and I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
