let's see fifty first Java tutorial I
believe and in this tutorial we're going
to be talking about GUI some more and
unlike last time where we built a GUI
that looks the same on every single
operating system like if you ran on a
Windows operating system and a Mac it
will look the exact same what we want to
do is we want to build an interface that
when you run it on a Windows machine
that it inherits all the look in the
feel of a Windows program and when you
run on Mac machine that uses all the
buttons in two bars and title bars and
windows as a Mac so the last one we
built in the last tutorial was simple
for like you know a really easy one but
we're going to be going in some complex
and it's just a better GUI system of
building interfaces so that's what I'm
going to be teaching you today so the
first thing that we're going to want to
do again we're going to be working with
two classes the apples main class with
our main method in it and a subclass or
another class called tuna right here so
in your tuna class or not the one
without your main argument the first
thing we're going to do is import a
bunch of stuff to use so the first thing
we're going to import is go ahead and
type import java.awt dot flow layout and
make sure you're capitalized like I am
and what this is going to do is it's
going to import pretty much how things
are placed here that's how I can say it
what this is going to do is pretty much
give me the default layout managing it's
going to say alright I'm going to put
this here when I build my next item put
it to the right of it when I build my
next item put it to the right of it and
once you run out of space just move to
the next line so this is pretty much the
layout of our thing and we don't want to
have to program an entire layout so
that's why we're importing that the next
thing we're going to want to import is
go into import Java X don't forget that
X and we're going to import swing dot
j-frame in there we go what jframe is is
it pretty much gives you all the basic
windows features like the title bar the
minimize the maximize the X to close and
it pretty much just gives you the basic
window so we don't want to we want to
use what we have already so that's why
we're importing that and the last thing
we're going to import in this tutorial
is the J label and this is where we're
going to be building in this pretty much
a label is pretty much just a line of
text the N it also lets you do simple
images but let's go ahead and import
Java X again swing the J label make sure
it's capitalized just like that so again
this is gonna there sorry about that I
had to take a little break someone
knocked on my door
but what J label does is it allows you
to output text and images on the screen
so that's why we need to import that so
now we can go ahead and start
programming this stuff right here the
first thing we want to do is use
inheritance like we did before
public class tuna extends ext NDS J
frame so we need this tuna class right
here to inherit all the stuff from J
frame and again like I said J frame
gives you all the basic windows features
so now we have all of the title bars the
minimize the maximize the X button
that's what that does now that it's in
here it inherited all those qualities
let's go ahead and the first thing we're
going to want to do is build a variable
which is pretty much going to be our
item so let's make it private and let's
just go ahead J label that's what type
it is
and just name it like item 1 or
something like that and this is pretty
much it's going to be the item that
we're adding I mean you need to name it
something so why not item 1 and now
we're going to build a constructor so go
ahead and type public tuna or whatever
your class name is and give it empty
it's not going to take any parameters
and the first line in our constructor
and I spell
- nor on the first line in our
constructor is the title of the window
so let's go ahead and how you do that is
you put super and the only argument it
takes is the title so this was going to
be your in title bar though the title
bar let's just go ahead and put that so
that is how you add a title to your
window the next thing we're going to
want to do is set the layout which is
pretty much the default layout so go
ahead and put set layout and all of
these methods unlike super and set
layout these are imported whenever we
imported everything so set layout and as
a parameter for this let's just go ahead
and put new flow layout right there and
what this does is pretty much give us
our default layout so this adds a title
and this gives us default layout so now
let's go ahead and start building the
actual item that we wanted to build so
again we already named item one
so that's item one equal to new jlabel
and remember remember labels are pretty
much just text so this is how we put
text on the screen and the argument for
it is what you want to help put on
screen this is a sentence make sure you
spell it wrong and now we pretty much
just have an item that says this is a
sentence all we have is text on the
screen now now we can add some
functionality to our item one thing we
can do is make a little scroll box pop
up when you hover over it in that scroll
box is actually called a tool tip text
so we can take that item one that we
just built and set tool tip text like
that and now our argument is what's
going to appear when we hover over it so
what do we want to appear this is going
to show up on hover or something like
that so now we built a line of text on
the screen and now when you hover over
it this thing is going to pop up and we
use that
during the set tooltip text method
little tongue twister and now lastly the
last thing we want to do is add the item
to the window we made an item we have a
window but we didn't add the item in the
window so that's easy all you have to do
is add item one so again don't forget it
just doesn't automatically add it for
you have to actually add it why they did
that I don't know but that's what they
did so now we have an item in pretty
much our tuna class is done now go over
to your main apples class right here and
we can go ahead and start building on
the object for that or calling our toon
class so the first thing we're going to
need to do is import one thing right
here import Java X dot swing make sure
it's pillar right dot J frame and again
like I said before this pretty much
gives you all the basic windows features
so now let's go ahead and start building
an object for tuna tuna I'm just going
to name my object bucky equals new tuna
or whatever your class's not going to
take any arguments and now you need to
do a couple things
does this object which is pretty much
the window with a line of text in it
what we want to do is set and this is
really important set default close
operation right there and what we need
to put in here is how we want our
program to close
so put j-frame dot exit underscore on
underscore close all in capitals and
what this does is whenever we hit the X
button the program terminates if you
don't have this then your program is
going to be messed up whenever you hit
the X button is my screen recorder so we
run all right just check it now what we
need to do is set eyes for that object
or a window so again put Bucky
set sighs let me see how much time I got
left two minutes so this is going to go
real quick
Bucky set sighs and let's just put it
like 275 by 180 or something like that
and now the last thing we need to do is
Bucky set set visible and I'm going to
do this real fast set true and this
pretty much means so you can see it now
let's go ahead and run this and what we
got right here is this is a sentence and
when you hover over it it says this is
going to show up on hover so again
that's what we built right here this is
a sentence put the title bar at the top
and when you hover over it this is going
to show up on hover now I only have 30
seconds left so I can't talk you through
how we did this all again but make sure
you watch the next tutorial we're going
to be putting more stuff in here and I'm
going to be explaining how we did
everything but again like I said I don't
have time to do this tutorial because
YouTube only lets you upload 10 minute
videos so um thank you guys for watching
and I'll see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
