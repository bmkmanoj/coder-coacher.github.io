exciting After Effects cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and we're
on the new boston youtube channel for
this tutorial I want to go over using
the different camera tools to use to
navigate your camera views and a little
bit more about the different camera
views so right now we're on the main
camera here and I have a 3d setup here
with a camera and some objects that have
been made 3d by clicking on the cube
here so I wanted to go over that if
you're in a view one of these views
right here that are in this section
you're looking down an axis right now
we're in the right view so we're going
to be looking down the x-axis and when
you're doing anything in these views you
can't really orbit around your scene you
can only move you can only move left and
right or you can let me move this camera
tool here or you can move forward and
backwards I'll demonstrate that in the
front view real quick so we can see
what's going on so you can zoom in going
forward and backwards this is on the z
axis now and this is called a track this
is on the X&amp;amp;Y but if I try to use D it's
something like this orbit camera tool
which would normally let us move around
the scene it's not gonna work and I
click and it makes that annoying noise
that's like when you're on something
like Wheel fortune and you gets the
wrong letter and it's like but I don't
even know if that was the right sound
for that because I haven't watched wheel
fortunate in forever actually but I'm
gonna show you how you can use this tool
to navigate around your 3d scene a
little better so let's go down here into
our view and
come down to custom view now you can see
that this little pink box right here
that's the camera and then our three
seen three things in the scene here now
I'm gonna click on this tool here click
and hold and I'm gonna go to this orbit
camera tool now the hotkeys for your
camera tools is C and if you just push C
you can cycle around and then you can
see how the icon changes so this one is
the orbit camera tool and if you click
and hold you can look around your scene
quickly and this is in your custom view
here and you can only do this in the
custom view it's pretty nice you can see
how far away they are relative to each
other from different angles so that's
just clicking and holding with the left
mouse button now if you press control Z
it'll go back to where you last let go
of your mouse and you can see I let go
of my mouse a few times but now we're
back in the front here there's another
tool called the unified camera tool and
that pretty much is all three of the
orbit camera track XY and track Z camera
tools so if I hold my left mouse button
while I'm using this it's gonna let me
orbit if I hold my right mouse button
it's gonna let me zoom in and and track
in and drag out if I hold my middle
mouse button it's gonna let me pan left
and right and up and down
so that's an easy way if you're using
your your custom view how you can use
all three without having to switch
through it's a pretty neat tool now you
can have up to three custom view setup
so if I set this and move it to a
position like this and I can come down
to my second custom view and yet we can
set it to a position like this and then
my third and we can do something like
this you can quickly switch between your
views and they'll stay how you just had
them so if you want to set up like it's
kind of like setting up another camera
without having to add another camera in
there so if you if you want to set up a
couple more views you can do it that way
so that's pretty much all I have to say
about using your camera tool and using
your custom view thanks for watching
this tutorial I look forward to seeing
you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
