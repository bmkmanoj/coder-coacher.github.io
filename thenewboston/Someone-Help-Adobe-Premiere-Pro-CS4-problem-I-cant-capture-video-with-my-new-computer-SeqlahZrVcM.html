actually making this video because I
need someone to help me with a problem
and I cannot for the life of me figure
out what's wrong I just got a new
computer and it has windows seven on it
and I have adobe premiere pro set up and
I go ahead the problem is pretty much I
can't capture video from my camcorder to
adobe premiere pro I always have to
import it so I go ahead click new
project make sure it's an hdv which it
is and I'll just name it up set new or
something press ok and all these
settings are correct or at least they're
the same i think is my other arm I mean
I have another computer sitting right
next to me and I do these exact same
settings and it works but whenever I go
ahead and put file capture um you know I
can go ahead and press record and my
other computer whenever it plays I mean
you can hear the camcorder right here
playing and it should be capturing right
now but look right here says capture
adoration it's not capturing at all so I
can go ahead and press you know stop my
camcorder and the screen pops up right
here like you know it recognizes it so I
mean it recognizes my camcorder and
knows that it's hooked up but for some
reason whenever I press record to
capture it won't capture it will play
but it won't capture so that's the
problem I have I searched the forums i
searched google if anyone can find a
solution to my problem of why this is
not capturing please let me know i will
thank you beyond belief so you know i
gave you guys like 600 soils on computer
in all is is for you to help me with
this one thing and by the way my head is
healing for those of you who've been
keeping up on my channel so i thank you
guys for all your support but anyways I
think you guys for watching and please I
am begging for your help so I hope to
hear some comments soon so thanks for
watching and hope to hear from you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
