video I'm gonna show you how to create a
notebook now I want to mention this
before everyone freaks out on me you
know like three tutorials ago or
something when I showed you guys how to
make a stack switcher I called all those
things tabs but then I was like I kind
of feel bad calling them tabs because
there's something else that more closely
resembles tabs and this is you know
technically called a stack and a stack
switcher yada yada I want I went on
forever about it it was really annoying
well anyways whenever I ran the program
you guys are like you know what these
things they don't really look like tabs
they just look like a bunch of length
buttons at the top
well this notebook this is actually what
you picture in your head whenever you
think about tabs so if you want to make
a program with actual tabs this is what
you're gonna create so just remember
that there's a difference between the
stack switcher and a notebook so self
notebook first thing we're gonna do is
actually create the notebook it's set
equal to GT k dot notebook class and by
the way I'm gonna mention this too this
type of layout is one of my favorite
types of layouts I use it in almost
every piece of software that I make
using GT K and I don't know I just love
it it's so convenient it's so easy for
the user to understand tabs every
program in the world should have tabs in
my opinion alright so now we got a blank
notebook all we're gonna do now is we're
gonna add it so self add self notebook
and boom we've got a blank notebook on
the screen so this is what we're gonna
do if she let me open up another tab
right here so essentially your notebook
is your entire like your entire section
with the tabs and the content now the
area where the content is displayed like
this area right here these are called
your pages so you're gonna create a
bunch of pages then after you have a
page created you're gonna add it to the
notebook now once you add that page you
also give a title and that title is the
name that appears on the tab so again
what you're going to be doing is you're
gonna create a notebook which
and now we just have to create a bunch
of pages and add them one by one to the
notebook and I'll say first page all
right so self I'll just name this page
one or not and set this equal to GT k
box and I'll actually make one tab with
the text and then I'll make another tab
with the icon because you can actually
have all your tabs not even have words
on them just have you know symbols or
whatever but I'll show you guys um you
know the different ones so self so for
the first page what we're gonna do is
we're gonna set a border width of 10 and
you should always set some kind of
border with it unless you want it to
look really weird and now also on page
one what we're gonna do is we're gonna
add gtk a label now this right here what
I'm writing this is just the stuff that
appears in the main section in the main
area so this isn't the actual title that
appears on the tab else right here is
the stuff that is in the main area
alright looking good mate so we have a
page we have some text in it now what we
have to do is we actually need to add
this page to the notebook and in that
process we add the title to the tab as
well so self notebook a pen page and the
first thing is what page you want to add
well how about that one we just created
so page one and the second parameter is
our rights
whenever I display the tab what do you
want me to put on it a label and icon
and we'll just stick a label on this one
keep things real simple so I'll just
write first tab so you guys know clearly
what's going on so actually let me copy
these first two lines
for the second page in our right page 2
and page 2 so peh-chu is gonna be pretty
similar but um what can we change about
it actually let me just add some text in
here too i don't wanna get too fancy
alright so on page 203 a there Derr Derr
I am h2 this program is looking
excellent already and I spelled page
wrong embarrassing heart so in addition
to just having some kind of word on the
tab you can also have an icon in order
to do that the easiest way is just to
make gtk image new from icon name and
you know how I said that essentially
what you need to do and I set this in
the last video is you make a icon and
you convert it to an image and then you
can stick it on whatever you want to
stick on on gtk related but if you just
want to do it in one big shebang then
this is how you can do that and we'll
just use that CD player for that icon of
the CD from the last one and that is no
dev audio and what size you want it to
be okay icon size dot menu alright so
now when we add this page self notebook
at page what we need to do first of
course is say what page you want to add
page to and what do you want to display
on the tab and we just want to display
that icon so alright that is it ladies
and gentlemen hopefully so let me go
ahead and run this and check it out
so this is the first tab and remember on
the first one on this page what we did
is we just said for the tab the title of
the tab we just want some text so that's
why we just made
a blank label right here so again the
second parameter is just what do you
want to appear as the tabs title and for
the second one we added an icon of a CD
or you can have an icon of whatever you
want so again you make a notebook a
plain notebook and then you create pages
one by one and then you add the pages to
the notebook and in the process of
adding them as you add them you also
give it a title for the tab really easy
stuff I thought this software
development was supposed to be hard but
this is a piece of cake so ladies and
gentlemen congratulations you have just
learned my favorite layout which is the
tabbed notebook layout I will see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
