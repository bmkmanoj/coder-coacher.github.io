tutorial and in this story I'm going to
be going over constructors what they are
and why they are useful so first of all
I want to tell you guys what a
constructor is a constructor is a
function that gets called automatically
as soon as you create an object so
before what we could do is we could
create an object and use that object to
call functions from our class well now
as soon as we create this object it's
going to call a funk funk ssin code
constructor we don't need to explicitly
use that object to call a function it's
going to do automatically so you're
saying alright Bucky you talk to talk
time to walk the walk show me an example
well creating a constructor is
incredibly simple to do so it's
basically the same as creating a
function with a couple weird rules first
of all I need to tell you guys this
constructors never have a return type so
you don't need to type int or void or
string or anything like that the only
thing you need to do is type the
constructor name and the constructor
name is always the same as the class
name the exact same so let's go ahead
and copy this and paste it right here
and that's how your C++ program knows
that it's a constructor because once it
comes across a function with the same
name it knows that that is the
constructor so let's go ahead and we'll
add no parameters and in the body what
do we want to happen as soon as we
create this object we didn't have just
you know maybe it will print something
out on the screen like this will get
printed automatically
pretty cool huh so now we have
constructor that's going to get called
automatically as soon as you create an
object interesting all right you keep
saying that but what exactly does that
mean
well say we have an object from Bucky
class named Bo well before we would have
to write Bo yadda yadda yadda whatever
we want to use from it but now as soon
as we create this object this
constructor is going to get called so
let's go ahead build and run this and
see this will get printed on Mac app
will blah blah blah automatically so you
could see that
before we needed to use that object to
call functions but this is a special
function called a constructor that gets
called automatically as soon as you
create that object so you're saying all
right that's pretty cool and interesting
but why what didn't I just you know
print this out on the screen or
something else what's the use of a
constructor why would you even want
things to happen automatically well
typically people don't print things out
in their constructors actually if you
see anyone printing something out in
their constructor then they're idiots
and you should slap them inside ahead
because constructors the main reason
that people make constructors are to
give variables an initial value so for
example this class has a variable called
name but it might have another variable
called age height weight favorite color
favorite sports theme have all these
variables so as soon as you create an
object from that class you might want to
assign a bunch of values to these
variables right now so in order to do
that here is what you do whenever you
want to take a value and assign it to a
variable you need to add a parameter in
your constructor so let's go ahead and
assign a value to this name right here
and in order to do that we need to pass
in string and just name it Z or
something so now what we can do is we're
going to be passing it in a string to be
setting it equal to name well we already
have a function that does that called
set name so in order to do that just go
ahead and call set name with the
parameter of Z so now later on whenever
we want to use our constructor our
constructor can take a parameter as well
and for our parameter let's just go
ahead and write something like lucky
bucky roberts and now what's going to
happen is this as soon as we create this
object it's going to call a constructor
with a parameter lucky bucky roberts so
it's going to go up see if it has a
constructor oh I do
and as my parameter I need a string and
for a string we give it lucky bucky
roberts so anytime has saw z it plugged
in lucky bucky Reppert so it says all
right
your constructor you told me to set the
name equal to lucky lucky Roberts
so it basically set the name equal to
lucky bug you're Robert so pretty much
lucky Bucky Roberts got passed into Z
which got passed in X which got passed
in the name so that's why our name was
lucky Bucky Robert so now that our name
is lucky bug you're Everts that gets
kind of repetitive saying that but
anyways we can just go ahead and you
know print it out on the screen or
something so of course to access
anything in our class use the object and
of course the get name just like that
function so let's go ahead and build and
around this and we have int main we got
a problem here hold on one second
we find it oh I see what the heck how in
the world did I do that for some reason
I must actually hit paste or something
but I copy the word name outside my
class I just wrote the word name
randomly in the middle of my program so
remembering not to put words randomly in
am over your program or else it won't
run so now let's go ahead and build and
run this and check it out lucky lucky
Roberts so that is the basics of a
constructor how they work and also how
you can add a parameter to your
constructor and basically the only times
you wouldn't want to add parameters to
your instructors is whenever you're
taking those variables that are inside
your class and you want to set them
equal to values initially so that is
basically why a constructor is useful
whenever you have a bunch of variables
in your class and you wanted to set them
equal to values initially on that is how
you can do that so here's that example
and you just printed it our name so
simple enough
so aside from this I guess I have time
to show you this one thing you might be
thinking all right so I have an object
from this Bucky class named Bo and its
name is equal to lucky Bucky Robert so
does that mean later on if I were to
create another object from the Bucky
class name like Bo too
and I set this name equal to armed
what's even dumber than lucky Bucky
Roberts um Sally Mick salad that's
that's what's on my mind right now
so does that mean that I'm going to
overwrite this one well let's go ahead
and print out armed bo2 dot get name
just like this so let's go ahead and
print it out and see what we get lucky
Bucky Robertson Sally Mix Aled so why
wanna stress is this whenever you create
an object from a class each object has
its own set of variables so this object
Bo name is lucky Bucky Roberts this
object is named Sally Mix Aled even
though they're from the same class it's
not like changing the same variable so
even though we set this BL to equal to
Sally mixed salad it didn't overwrite
this they're just from the same template
pretty much so anyways what I wanted to
stress is that you can create multiple
objects from the same class and they
don't overwrite each other they're just
a sign they're they're assigned they're
each set variables am I saying that
right
they're each assigned a set of variables
so yeah I just wanted to stress that
before you get in to objects in classes
more and you get confused so anyways
that's just a little side note stick
with constructors and then once you're
good with constructors you're ready to
move on to my next tutorial but for now
thank you guys for watching and remember
don't stick words into randomly middle
of your program and yeah I guess I'll
see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
