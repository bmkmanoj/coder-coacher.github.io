first Photoshop project and these
projects I'm gonna be doing are not
teaching you how to use Photoshop but
teaching me how to do something specific
and often awesome in Photoshop so in
this first project I got a picture of
myself here and I'm gonna be giving
myself a black eye so let me just zoom
out so you can see what this picture
looks like I tried to look like a thug
since a bunch of thugs usually have
black eyes so go ahead and zoom in on
the eye portion of the project right
here let me just Center mine and once
you have the eye what we're gonna be
doing is going over to the lasso tool
right here and what we want to do is
make an outline of where we want to the
bruise or black eye to be so let's just
go along right about here and right
there there you go it's gonna be a
pretty big black eye now if you're going
around the eye which we're not going to
be doing this time but you want to cut
out the center of the hi hold down the
alt tab to cut it out now that we have
this lasso tool right here we don't want
these edges to be directly cut since the
bruise kind of fades out as your face
goes on so go ahead and press alt
control D hold it all down and you'll
get this a little box that says feather
radius go ahead and select 20 you can do
more actually go ahead actually 20 is
fine for now anywhere from 10 to 25 is
really is really alright go ahead and
click OK and what this does is instead
of giving us a fine line it'll begin to
fade out on the edges what is exactly
what we want next
when you're done with that go ahead up
the image adjustments and go down the
variations well this is gonna allow you
to do is allow variations to that
selection where
you just made so right here we have our
original and you can see our current is
right here keep it at mid-tones in about
right in the middle first thing we want
to do is add a touch of green a touch of
yellow and the touch of magenta now you
can see our current pick is beginning to
turn into kind of a Buckeye but again it
needs a little more magenta and make
sure your current pick is right here
let's give it a little bit more and that
might be good for them in jente now
let's start adding some red and maybe
that's probably good for the red maybe
it's a bit more there we go now once you
got your current pick exactly how you
want it go ahead actually I'm gonna I'm
gonna hit my one more time area this is
gonna be a pretty nasty black guy go
ahead and click okay and as you see your
selection will automatically change and
make sure you note the fading on the
side that's what we did with the feather
so once you got your fading just how you
want to move your lasso out of the way
by holding the control key on your
keyboard and pressing D this D selects
the lasso now as you can see if we zoom
out we have a pretty sweet black guy
going on but it ain't sweet enough so
let's go ahead and zoom back in and what
I like to do just for a little extra
touch is go back to the broom or the
brush and go down to darken and color
burn first I'm going to darken it I like
to put mine in about whoa your screen
will probably different depending on
your picture put yours about a hundred
and use this little fading tool right
here and then once you got that begin to
darken that oops don't want to do that
begin to put the opacity at a hundred
and put the flow down to about three two
or three
now you can begin darkening the edges as
you can see you can darken and all the
spots that are usually the dark sends a
broom
since the bruise isn't always perfect so
let me just darken up some edges here
and now for the final touch once you've
done the darken go down color burn keep
all the same settings I have my brush on
a hundred with fading opacity 100 flow
about to then start giving it some final
touches maybe bring my brush down a bit
ever bring that down to about 65 and as
you can see now it looks like we got cut
up just a little bit more so now if you
see if we zoom out we have a nice
realistic looking bruise and you could
play around of this little more maybe I
should have put a little more fading
right there but those are the basics of
how to add a Bruce to your face and you
can go ahead and show all your friends
and make them believe it so I hope you
