biology video and in this video I want
to talk to you guys about something
called peroxisomes now a lot of people
when they're first studying biology they
get peroxisomes and lysosomes mixed up
and the reason for this is because they
do have a lot of similarities but in
this video what I want to do is I want
to concentrate on the differences
between peroxisomes and lysosomes and
hopefully you guys will have a good
understanding of which does well so let
me go ahead and draw the cell looks like
a baked potato and my nucleus always
looks like a loaf of bread and I'll draw
my peroxisomes is purple that should
help you guys remember them so here are
all my peroxisomes and I'll draw my
lysosomes is blue light blue so all of
them are floating around and obviously
from this diagram right here they look
similar and actually they are similar in
a lot of ways both peroxisomes and
lysosomes are sacks filled with enzymes
they say enzymes enzymes and they also
break down molecules and help protect
the cell from harmful toxins so here we
go here's a big old bad harmful toxin
all of these perhaps homes and lysosomes
are going to help break these down
however
peroxisomes differ in that peroxisome
specialize in breaking down lipids which
we know are just fats and of course
whenever a cell breaks down a lipid or a
fat it could use those molecules for
energy and to do other stuff later on
now they are similar to lysosomes in
both they look the same in their sacks
filled with enzymes but perhaps some
actually has a different type of enzyme
than the lysosome so just remember that
peroxisomes have different types of
enzymes than the digestive enzyme in
lysosomes now let me go ahead and show
you guys an example of what a peroxisome
would do whenever you have hydrogen
peroxide in your cell and that's h2o 2
that's the chemical formula for hydrogen
peroxide
hydrogen peroxide is dangerous to your
cells
so what a peroxisome would do is it
would actually take this and convert it
to water which is h2o plus oxygen so
it'd break this up this hydrogen
peroxide up into a water molecule an
oxygen molecule and an oxygen molecule
is o2 so it would need to get an oxygen
from somewhere else in the cells
environment somewhere around the
cytoplasm but that's what it does
perhaps some turns h2o - which is
hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen
both of which are needed by the cell so
just remember that perhaps somes break
down larger harmful molecules and the
smaller useful molecules like a water
and oxygen and in this case this is an
example where it breaks down hydrogen
peroxide which is a molecule that would
be harmful to the cell</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
