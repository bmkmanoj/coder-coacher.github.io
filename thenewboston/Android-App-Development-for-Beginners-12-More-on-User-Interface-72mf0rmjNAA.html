way all right pretty sweet now if we hop
over to the source code view then let's
go ahead and change the text on the
button through here so of course right
now it just says new button that's the
default let's go ahead and change this
to for some reason I don't like when the
button text is the same as the title
text so I'm going to change this to
login all right so the title says sign
in and this says login now another thing
that's kind of annoying me is I hate
when there's not enough space for the
user to actually type in their
information and these little edit text
areas or inputs if you call them if
you're a web designer
they're kind of um you know kind of look
Bunch not enough room there so what I'm
going to do is in this first one I'm
going to add a new attribute and the
attribute - actually you just make this
a little bit wider is Android in dro ID
and it's width now I'll talk to you guys
about um you see that whenever you're
alright I probably should mention this
so when if you're a web designer you
probably use um either pixels or
percentage or e/m if you work with text
a lot however whenever you're making
apps you're going to use these special
things called DP and those are device
pixels and I'll talk to you guys about
the different units of measurement right
now but just so you guys have real basic
understanding if you had a phone that
was high def for example so it was 1920
by 1080 or even 1280 by 720 that just
means how many pixels are on there you
could have on a computer screen or a TV
that's 1280 by 720 or you could have a
little fun that's 1280 by 720 so if you
try to work with pixels you really don't
know how big a pixel is because the size
of a pixel changes from device device so
if you use these DP they give you a
little bit more control and again that's
just why we use DP for right now I'll
talk about more about that later late
it's going to make a lot more sense but
for right now I want to change this to
something like 320 dpi wide because I
know that that is a good width right
there and I actually want to do the same
for this right here so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to copy that
scroll down and paste that into so now
both of these things are 320 wide look
in pretty sweet
so let's hop back over in designer and
alright I mean this interface is looking
beautiful right now however there's one
other little thing that I want to point
out so select the top text view widget
the sign-in title and whenever you
select it you're going to notice that
there is a light bulb on the left hand
side so let's go ahead and click this
and find out what's this about okay
hard-coded string okay so it's giving us
a little warning message and what this
warning message is saying is what you
should do is instead of just writing a
string in there like we just did you
should treat this as a resource so let
me first show you guys how to treat this
as a resource and then I'm going to tell
you exactly why so make sure again you
select your widget click the light bulb
now click the little right arrow next to
here and choose extract string resource
it's kind of hard to say so right here
what we're pretty much doing is I don't
want to say that this is a variable
because it's technically a resource but
if you never arm worked with like XML
before resources or you never develop or
Android before you're probably not
really familiar with this what we pretty
much need to do is give a nickname to
this string so I'm just going to name it
something like sign-in title and then
that's it click OK now as you can see
what's going to happen is instead of
sign-in title like we had it changes to
this weird @ string sign-in title thing
so let's hop over in the source code
and look what's going on so of course it
change back to sign-in as it should but
if we look at the text now we still have
a reference to the resource instead of
the string itself so what exactly is
happening well to understand what we
need to do is we actually need to open a
new file and this file is under App just
like before our es this actually stands
for a resource now under values you're
going to have a file called strings.xml
now all right let me adjust my seat
because uh I can explain this so the
reason that we needed to make this a
resource is because we're pretty much
saying pull all of the strings in one
place in one file and then I'm just
going to reference them through XML so
again whenever we reference a string
it's going to look in this file it's
going to look for that resource name and
this one was sign-in title and then it's
going to say ok that was actually equal
to sign in so that's the value of this
now if we did something like sign in
with exclamation mark we can just switch
over and that would change no problem so
again what we're doing is we're pretty
much putting a placeholder right here
and it references something else now you
were wondering okay well what was the
problem with just writing sign-in in my
source code right here why did it give
me a hard time
well the reason that it wants all of
your strings in one place it's because
if you ever do something like you want
to translate your app to Spanish well
what you can do is you can actually just
say ok you don't have to look around
your entire app and say ok ok this is a
string now this is a string now I have
to go to 100 other arm activities and
find all of those no you just look at
one file it has all the strings for your
entire app and just translate it right
there and there's a bunch of other
useful things too but pretty
much it makes your apps life a whole lot
easier when all the strings are
organized in one file so that's why we
did that and also since this is a string
as well it's probably a good idea to do
it to this so again select your button
click the light bulb right arrow extract
string resource and for this I'll just
call it something like I don't know like
sign-in button text and choose ok and of
course if we can see on our button
instead of that text we have a reference
to it but of course whenever running our
app they don't see this weird reference
symbol and again anytime you see at sign
that means that this isn't a hard-coded
string this is actually a reference to
something else so again that's what's
going on right there now one other thing
I want to point out is this so we're
going to be referencing a bunch of stuff
and we know why that's useful right now
and actually going near your strings
that XML file and close this out because
typically we're not going to have that
open however what if you wanted to
change the text of this well you can go
back in the folder oh go all the way
find that file again that takes a lot of
time so instead what you can do is in
the source code that XML select or
excuse me
press down ctrl on your keyboard and you
see whenever you do this then you can
actually hover over these references now
click and whenever you click it it opens
up that file again so pretty sweet again
you I don't know maybe you want to
change that sign in to I don't know
maybe you want to get rid of that symbol
at the end again hold down ctrl and this
actually works for any reference but
what we want to do is click that the
file opens again and that line of code
is actually highlighted so now I can
close that and boom check it out so
those are some really cool tips in now
you guys know how to
newly add activities you guys also know
how to add strings as a reference so um
yeah that's pretty much it for this
tutorial
now one other thing I want to mention
before I let you guys go is this so
right now we're making something called
a static layout it's a layout that's not
going to change well I'm you know we
don't want to make like a sign-in form
where the buttons like floating around
in the user has to click at the sign-in
I mean if you're making a game
that'd be great but for right now we
always want everything to be in the same
place however there are going to be some
layouts um maybe like the stream if
you're reading like a bunch of posts
that actually change so of course that
feed goes up and down as you scroll with
your thumb and also with games you know
maybe there's like a bird flying around
that you have to click or maybe you have
to like make tanks that are moving
around well whenever you need a layout
that's interactive like games then we're
going to need to do something special
and what we actually do is instead of
using this the designer in the XML we're
going to be making our layout in Java
it's going to be pretty sweet but also
pretty easy to understand so uh yeah I'm
pumped up that's what I'm going to be
teaching you guys in the next tutorial
how to make interactive layouts so for
now thank you guys for watching don't
forget to subscribe and I will smell you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
