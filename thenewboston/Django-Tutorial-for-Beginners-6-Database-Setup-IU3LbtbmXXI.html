before we create any more pages before
we can create any albums or add any
songs what we need to do is we need to
set up our database so how the heck do
we do that
well we need to kind of learn a few
things first a couple core concepts of
Django now whenever you set up your
project to use Django it came with a few
things that may not be kind of apparent
at first but they're kind of going on
behind the scenes the first thing I want
to mention is it came with a default
database and that database is SQL Lite
or SQLite whatever you want to call it
and we can verify that by looking at
this file and if you guys don't see this
file then trust me it's there or it's
set up to use it and if you actually go
to website settings and scroll down to
around line 77 or maybe different
depending on if they changed it around
you're going to see that by default the
databases is set equal to a SQLite 3
engine so Django can use basically any
database it can use poast or MySQL in
those kinds of databases are probably
something that you want to use in
production but just for testing it's
really awesome that it came ready to use
this right there because you know we
don't got to worry about all the hard
stuff of setting it up and tweaking the
settings or anything like that
so we know that this is good go however
the way it's set up right now we
basically have all of our code all of
our apps and then separately we have
this database so they're not connected
at all we still need to configure it the
work with our code so before I go on I
want to show you guys something else all
right so you know up to this point what
we did is we made one really really
simple boring app the music app and I
said our website is going to have a
bunch of apps it's going to have like a
videos app it might have a profile app I
might even put like a photo viewer app
in there I don't know maybe we're going
to get crazy and make a whole bunch now
even though we can make however many
apps we want for whoops
I what happened is whenever we set up
jingo it already came with a bunch of
default apps so admin authentication
session messages and we'll get into
exactly what these are later but
basically behind the scenes
jingo is already ready to work with a
bunch of apps so these apps right here
some of them actually need to access a
database they need a set up tables in
order to work so if you ever run your
server and by the way I'm going to
switch over to this instead of my
command line just because I think it's
easier to teach that way but go ahead
and start your server and check out what
you see alright so the server runs fine
and we can look at the website just as
always but if we take a minute and read
this little word right here it says you
have unapplied migrations your app may
not be working or not work properly
until they are applied whenever you see
this message right here what it means is
your source code your app and all your
code it's not in sync with your database
all right well that's not good
so let's go ahead and get it in sync so
go ahead and open up your command prompt
or a terminal in in order to do that go
ahead and type Python move my cursor out
of the way manage py migrate now go
ahead and hit enter and what this is
going to do is it's going to sync up
your code with your database now I say
sync it up but it's kind of more
technical than that exactly what's
happening is whenever you write migrate
it's going to go in your website
settings and it's going to scroll down
and it's going to look for installed
apps right here now for each one what
it's going to do is it's going to go in
that apps directory and it's going to
look for what tables are needed to
pretty much work with this app so each
app has its own tables that it requires
and for example whenever we're working
on our music app later we're going to
need a table for albums
and we're going to need another table
for songs so on and so forth
and I know all of that sounds really
confusing right now like all right so
you have these apps in they have like
databases and they need to like migrate
somewhere what the heck I promise as
soon as we define one model and we'll
just make a really simple one and do
everything manually and it's going to
take like five minutes then you guys are
going to like oh yeah that makes a lot
of sense
I promise so check this out for right
now let me go ahead and stop my server
clear out of there and look what it said
this time we don't have any issues no
warnings and that is because after we
ran this command where are you right
here python migrate it sent up all of
our code with our database so we are now
good to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
