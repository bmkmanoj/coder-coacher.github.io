exciting Photoshop cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackbird and I want
to talk to you about copying and pasting
your selections now you might think that
this is everybody knows how to copy and
paste and everything like that but
Photoshop added a little variation to
your pasting and everything so it it
basically needed a tutorial so I'm going
to go over that with you so easy enough
I have a selection here and it's just of
this part of this lifeguard house here
on the beach so I have that selected and
then I'm going to have my background
layer selected so I can copy and paste
so what you can do is come up here to
edit and we've got the cut copy and copy
merged paste and paste special
so cut is what you would think it is it
cuts the actual thing out of the footage
and then you can paste it again at
another time so make sure you have your
layer selected and go to edit cut and it
cuts it right out and then you can go
ahead and then edit paste paste again
now the different let me let me go back
confusing me
now the hotkeys are universal with any
like Windows keyboard or whatever so cut
is control x copies control C and paces
control V those have been those hotkeys
have been around for a long time all
right now we have a copy merged which is
going to copy all the layers that you
have down here it's just going to copy
everything into one and then that way
you can go ahead and paste that later
and then we've got our paste special
going on here we've got pasted in place
so if you remember when I tried to paste
the last time let me just paste regular
well pasted it on a layer let me paste
it on here paste it pastes to the left
and pretty much in the center
I'm going to go back if I hit paste in
place and you select my layer just
delete this one select that layer edit
paste in place and not paste right over
top so if I go to move this it was right
over top where it used to be now I want
to show you these other ones that are
called paste in and paste out of
selection you get my selection back up
here there we go so we have my thing
selected here and what I'm going to do
is I'm going to go to another another
document here and I've got this bike at
sunset here I'm going to go to edit copy
and then when I go to paste it's going
to I'm going to show you the different
types of pace that you can do so we're
going to go to paste special I've got to
make sure I'm on the right layer I'm
always not on it maybe you just turn
this on it'll just keep going to the
right thing paste special and we're
going to go to paste into and yeah I
didn't need that so what it does is it
pastes into the selection that you made
and deletes out what you had there
before well it doesn't actually delete
it out it just creates a mask and puts
it on top so it's still there but a
matte a layer mask was created and
opened up an area for the other image to
be pasted into now pasted outside is
just the absolute of what this is so go
to edit a special and then paste outside
and it keeps whatever was in the inside
the selection and then pays everything
outside of the selection so everything
on the outside has been masked out so
that's how that works for the pasted in
place there's a hockey shift ctrl V so
edit paste and paste in place is shift
ctrl V and then
taste into it alt shift control V and
those are obviously for the PC so those
are how the copying and pasting works in
Photoshop you use copy and pasting alon
so it warranted a tutorial so thanks for
watching this one and I look forward to
seeing you guys in the next tutorial
have a good one everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
