tutorial and in this lesson I want to
talk to you guys about something called
classes and objects but before I get
into that I want to talk to you guys a
little bit about the world and life so
Ruby loves the treat things as objects
now that's nice but what the heck is an
object well forget about computer
programming for a second just think
about the life and think about the world
everything in the world is an object
your desk your mouse your computer
yourself the food you eat the car you
drive everything is an object now
objects have attributes for example my
car I Drive is blue that's an attribute
it's old it's smelly
ok that's nice the dog next door is an
object some attributes about the dog
loud annoying and it's named Floyd so
basically everything is an object and
everything also has attributes now let's
go ahead and jump back into computer
programming you can take these real life
objects and turn them into computer
objects in Ruby kind of weird huh well I
know that this is kind of where it
separates computer programming from real
life but just remember that objects in
real life can be objects on computers
however in order to make an object on
the computer it must belong to a class
now a class is pretty much like a
blueprint for creating objects so let me
go ahead and show you guys how to create
a class real quick let's say that we
wanted to create that dog object
remember I talked about that dog about
30 seconds ago lives next to me it's
really loud and annoying his name is
Floyd well let's go ahead and create the
object in in order to create an object
we first need to create a class so the
first thing we do in order to create a
class is write the name class now after
this we give it a name so I'm just going
to go ahead and name this class animal
now whenever you create classes in Ruby
make sure to name
with a capital letter start them with a
capital letter that's what I was trying
to say now go ahead and hit enter now we
are making the class now what we need to
do is we need to set some attributes or
qualities that all of these animals are
going to have now in order to set your
attributes type this attr underscore acc
es SOR now this means pretty much your
attributes now each attribute is going
to be a colon with the attribute name so
all animals have a name and in order to
separate the attributes just add a comma
so all animals are going to have a name
an age and just pick something else like
a trait like smelly big hairy some
random trade so basically we have a
class in the classes called animals and
each animal is going to have three
traits a name and age and a trait or
excuse me three attributes so that's all
where this is going to be a very simple
class that's it so now we're done making
our class in order to tell Ruby we're
done making your class just go ahead and
type the word end and hit enter and it
returns nil and just remember nil pretty
much means okay you created your class
without any errors everything is good to
go so just remember this I got a pound
this in your brain a class is pretty
much a blueprint for creating objects
now that we made an animal class we can
now create animal objects such as that
Floyd the dog that lives next to me
another thing to know this notice is
that you know how the 1 2 3 is the line
number the zero is no longer 0 in this
lesson it's 1 1 the 1 is the depth now I
guess I might as well explain this right
now this is pretty much because we're
working inside a class this one is part
of something bigger
basically depth means you're working
inside something instead of just typing
one line of code at a time this one is
part of something else pretty much depth
means working inside something
and last but not least Nell what we get
back pretty much means our class was
created without any airs we didn't mess
up at all all our code was good we
didn't accidentally hit any weird
buttons or anything like that so now we
have a class in the next story what I'm
going to be doing is I'm going to be
creating the first object the Floyd
object the dumb dog that lives next to
me that's what I'm going to be creating
so for now thank you guys for watching
make sure to make your own class with
your own attributes and once you do
you're ready to move on to the next
lesson
so like I said thank you guys for
watching and subscribe and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
