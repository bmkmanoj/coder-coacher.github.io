slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
looking at a couple of ways to format
strings so let's go ahead and get
started here is our program we have our
main sub and we're going to go ahead and
type in there so we're going to create a
variable called my string now what we're
going to do is we're going to prompt the
user to enter in a string so console dot
write line please
enter a string now we're just going to
get whatever they entered and store it
as my string now what we're going to do
is we're going to ask them for a double
value so console dot write line please
enter a decimal value now we're just
going to get whatever they typed in and
store it as a double so dim my double as
double it's going to be equal to
whatever they type in okay so now what
we're going to do is we're going to
format those strings so we're just going
to go ahead and do console dot write
line to give us some space and now we're
going to format our string inside of the
arguments of console dot write line so
console dot write line we're going to
start by typing the string keyword and
then we're going to use a dot separator
to see what kind of methods there are
and what kind of subs that are available
for us to use for string so here's the
format one that we want to use and it
says replaces one or more format atoms
in a specified string with a string
representation that was specified
objects now that might be a little
confusing to you you don't really have
to pay attention to that description
right now let's go ahead and type format
and we're going to have to have some
arguments for this now
first argument is going to be enclosed
in quotes and this is what we're going
to use to tell Visual Basic how to
format our string so we'll just start
with a zero colon in two and go ahead
and close your braces there and then
we're going to add a comma and after the
comma we're going to especially specify
which string to format it and we're
going to use my double so basically what
this does is it takes my double format
it and converts it to a string and you
may be wondering what this means well
this means take any take all of the
numbers on the left side of the of the
period and show them but only show two
spaces to the left side of the period so
they type a really long decimal number
it will only show the first two decimal
places so now what we're going to do is
we're going to show you a couple of ways
to format a string so we'll just do
console dot write line and we're just
going to take their string which is my
string and we're going to do dot to
upper and this is going to take their
string and convert everything to
uppercase now we can also do console dot
write line my string dot to lower and
now if we just add console dot readline
to pause the program let's go ahead and
run this and see what happens so it's
going to ask us first string so we'll
just type on live gamer and we'll ask it
asked us for a decimal value so we'll
just type a really long decimal value
and you can see that it formats the
decimal value to forty three point two
three it takes our string and converts
it all up to uppercase and then it takes
it and converts it to lowercase
now I'll run this one more time to show
you what happens when we convert
something to a lowercase so we'll enter
an all caps string and we'll enter a
decimal value
and here you can see that it formats our
decimal value and it adds a comma right
here just to make it look better so 2340
2.23
and you can see here that it took our
string and converted it all to uppercase
and since it already was uppercase you
didn't you don't see a change here and
you can see that it takes it and
converts it all to lowercase now this
was just a few simple ways to format
strings and decimal numbers and once you
got that nailed down go ahead and move
on to the next tutorial and thanks for
