another app review and this app is for
an app called I trade and what it is is
pretty much a stock market simulator and
I got this because I wanted the
application to a because of online I'm
in investopedia.com and I wanted
something for my ipod to uh you know
simulate trading stocks pretty much
pretend I have on money when I actually
don't so I got this and I got this
because this is one of the top rated
ones and most reviewed in pretty much
the App Store so what it is pretty much
you start with your interface so this is
your main portfolio right here you can
see any stocks you have and how they're
performing and you see the most thing
the one thing that annoys me the most is
this little ad right smack dab in the
middle of it
and this is incredibly annoying first of
all and they also have it on the news
section I think on the club's you go
there to ad right there and I mean
they're just as all over this app and
it's really annoying but how you do this
is it pretty much go to symbols and you
scroll until the stock you on buy and
then say you won by Advanced Micro
Devices AMD so go ahead and click that
and now you have a little meter if you
click buy how much you want to buy I
mean the interface is pretty cool but I
can't buy right now because it's
Saturday and the markets closed but this
is pretty much the interface of how you
would buy in so stocks so all in all
what I like and don't like about this at
map I don't like it because a lot of the
stocks that one buy whenever I research
them on the Internet
um they aren't available there they only
have a slipped list of symbols like this
is only probably I was gonna guess like
40% of the stocks so all the stocks that
you want to buy may not be available in
here that's what I don't like and a lot
of things on that you can buy in the
real stock market you can
I in your simulator but this is not the
case so that's the first thing I don't
like about it and the second thing is
all these annoying ads they pop up I
mean already this screen is only like
three inches big and I don't need ads
taking up my entire interface so that's
another thing I don't like about but
aside from that if you just want to get
started and a stock market simulator
then this is alright but for me I'm
gonna go ahead and I'm going to write
this app of five out of ten just because
there's too many annoying things wrong
with it
and it can be so much better if they
just fix a few simple problems so I'm
going to go ahead and buy some stocks
and lose some money and you can check
out my other videos so thank you guys
for watching don't forget subscribe and
I'll see you next time another hit if
you have any more apps you want me to
review then just shoot me a message or
leave me a comment and arguing for it so
thank you guys for watching and see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
