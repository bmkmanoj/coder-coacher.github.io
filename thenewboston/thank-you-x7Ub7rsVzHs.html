not planning on making a video tonight
but something happened to me today that
was pretty incredible so I felt the need
to kind of make a video and tell you
guys about it now before I actually tell
you guys what's going on I wanted to let
you know a little bit about the history
behind it for the last probably two or
three years I've been trying to save up
for this special camcorder and this is a
professional camcorder and it's the one
thing I always wanted I always put on my
birthday listen Christmas list even
though I knew I was never gonna get it
because it's about a $4,000 camcorder
and you know it's unrealistic but it was
like my dream so I've been trying to
save up for it for like the last two
years at least but I mean it's four
thousand dollars it's like almost
expensive is my car and anytime I'll get
a little money in the bank I would
either have a giveaway for you guys or
my car would break down or you know
someone one of my family members would
ask to borrow money so I never really
got the chance to save up enough money
and get this camcorder that I always
wanted so I was just content with a you
know what am using now and so anyways I
came home from work today and it was
about 7 o'clock I was just reading book
on my bed about to fall asleep actually
and I heard a knock on my door so I went
the door and there's a UPS guy standing
right there and I wasn't expecting any
packages so I signed for a package I
brought it in my room and I open it up
in inside was a brand new never been
opened the four thousand dollar
camcorder I have been dreaming of for
the last over two years and inside the
box along with it was a note from one of
my subscribers that I have not
met in my entire life I don't even know
if I talked to him through YouTube
messaging but um it was one of the
nicest it was the nicest no I have ever
read in my entire life
thanking me for all that I done and he
told me how I helped them through
college and it was just that no alone
would have been enough to make my day
but this is just so much over the top I
mean and I mean this literally never in
my entire life through all my
Christmases in all my birthday's in
everything have I ever received a gift
anything close to this and you have no
idea how much this meant to me so I know
that I'm probably never gonna meet you
in my entire life but I just wanted to
say that I'm so happy that there are
people like you out there and I just
wanted to say thank you
so uh from bottom I heart I thank you
and I wish you the best of luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
