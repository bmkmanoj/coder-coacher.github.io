Photoshop cs6 tutorial my name is buddy
Blackford and today we're going to learn
how to create a channel mask from
scratch now say you're working with an
image like this one here and you need to
create a channel mask out of just the
people in the canoe and the canoe as
well well when you go to try to make a
selection oops that's not the selection
tool when you go to try to make a
selection you get something that is kind
of like this and doesn't really work all
that well maybe you want to go in and
just end up painting this out yourself
so you would do something like going to
the channels and then create a new
channel but then you're like crap I
can't see what I'm doing anymore so that
you're like ah min well this is you're
on the right track if you've gotten this
far all you need to do is enable the RGB
and you can see now that there is a red
overlay going on over this over the
image now you may think what the hell is
going on i have read Oliver but that is
good it's the red part of the image is
what's black in your alpha right here in
your channel mask so if you go ahead and
zoom in you can start painting let me
zoom in a little farther you can start
painting in your image here as long as
you have the alpha channel selected and
whatever starts getting revealed is your
arm is going to appear in your channel
mask here and I can start painting and
when you paint in white that's when
stuffs gonna start getting revealed so I
can start painting out his arms and
everything here and you can see now on
the mask they're starting to some color
is starting to come through on it you
can probably see it better if I start
painting in like bigger areas besides
just like a paddle and
stuff like that and let's turn on the
panel option so we can see it better sit
okay there we go and now you can see
that some of the panelists are some of
the stuff is coming through now if you
mess up like I did and you go way too
far over you can just switch to black
and paint back and and it'll paint out
the parts that you don't want to include
so you can create a channel mass from
scratch using this method and it's good
to know how to do things from scratch if
you can't figure out how to do something
using the quick methods and quick
techniques it's good to know how to do
it from the base up so eventually will
you'll end up doing is painting white on
to everything that you want to have
revealed and painting blank on to
everything you don't want to have
revealed I'm not going to waste my time
or waste your guys's time I mean by
going through and painting this entire
thing perfectly because that would take
probably of like an hour or something
maybe even more but you guys get the
idea now so use this technique to your
advantage when pretty much all odds
fails and you can't get a good selection
go through with your paintbrush and go
in and start painting out parts of the
parts of your image that you want to
save so that's how you create a channel
nice but scratch and use it in your
channel section so thanks a lot for
watching this tutorial and I have a good
one everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
