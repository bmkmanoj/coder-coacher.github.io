Effects cs6 tutorial my name is buddy
Blackford and in this tutorial I'm going
to teach you a bit about the rendering
previews within the comp here and those
can be found right about here in this
lightning looking button and we're gonna
go over what all these options here mean
and right before I started making this
tutorial I had to go pick up some gas
for the lawnmower so a person who comes
in my was our lawn and I was backing up
with the car and our neighbor decided to
put a wheelbarrow behind like where I
pull out of the garage and it's a
downward hill and I couldn't even see
the wheelbarrow and I backed up and it
put a scratch basically along my entire
side of my car and that made me really
mad so I'm gonna just take it out on
everybody in this tutorial I'm just
kidding I'll just do it the tutorial as
I do normally but I wanted to share my
sucky day with you but everything else
around the day has been good so I guess
I got that going for me so let's get
into figuring out what these different
preview modes mean so up here in the top
right under my renderer will notice I
have a ray trace 3d on and I've got a
camera some 3d text and a light going on
here if you need to learn how to create
3d text just check back a few tutorials
and I went over that in a previous
tutorial obviously currently I am on
fast draft up as you can tell up here in
the top right you can see what mode I'm
in our preview mode and fast draft is a
quick way to see your 3d and to like be
able to move around in the scene so I've
got this little animation going on here
with this 3d text and I'm able to
preview it pretty much in almost real
time when by moving the slider
and it's not taking any time to render
or anything like that so if I come down
here into what your frame this is gonna
be the basic of the basics it's just a
box and that's pretty much all you're
gonna see you're not gonna see any
colors or anything you're just gonna see
everything in a wireframe mode now if I
had some actual geometry in here that I
pulled in from like a 3d program or
anything like that I'd see the actual
geometry like for example if I had a
chain link I would see each different
like chain but it would be in a warframe
mode and I wouldn't be able to see what
it looked like in actual 3d this is the
fastest way but it's also the least
quality and you don't always can tell
you can't always tell what's going on
now let's go to Draft here and draft it
takes a second to render so I'm gonna
pause it real quick and once we get to
the render I'll let you know
now that the draft has rendered it's
going to have to render every time you
move your current time indicator with
the draft however you can see different
things like shadows and other things
like and reflections and things like
that but I mean you're not gonna have
the most crisp most crisp edges and
sharpness I'll switch between draft and
fast drafts real quick as you can see
I'm on a fast draft now and we lost the
shadows but would have the same
crispness on the edges so let's uh try
to move in draft and I'll show you what
happens you go to move and it updates
after it has to render and you can tell
it's rendering by this yellow bar that
goes across the screen
now we're gonna head over here to
adaptive resolution now in adaptive
resolution when you let go of the time
slider here it'll render but it also a
render in the final quality when you go
to move your current time slider current
time indicator I mean it moves it in a
downgraded resolution so you can see
what's going on but it's very downgraded
and then when you release it's gonna
take time to render but then you're
going to be able to see what's going on
so I think that the adaptive resolution
is way better than draft so I don't
really see any too much reason to even
use draft so let's go to the next one
which is final quality and this is going
to be rendered in full quality every
time you move so when I try to move here
it's not gonna be able to show me the
motion path it's kind of like draft then
when I let go it's gonna take time to
render and then it's gonna be in full
quality so okay I kinda feel like
adaptive resolution is the best one for
you to just stick on so I'm gonna head
over to a dented resolution especially
when you're working with this 3d now you
can change the settings of the adaptive
resolution down here in your fast
previews preferences so if we click on
that it's gonna bring this to our
preferences panel just the same as if
you want to edit preferences and click
on the preview section now you can
change your adaptive resolution to
either half resolution quarter eighth or
sixteenth when you're moving around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
