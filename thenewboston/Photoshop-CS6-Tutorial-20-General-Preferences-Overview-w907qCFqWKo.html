Photoshop cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and today
I want to go over setting your
preferences in Photoshop and I'm going
to go over these and a lot of depth so
there may be a few tutorials on this may
be one for each section depending how
large their and how many options they
have so let's get started immediately
and set our performance and everything
like that to optimize Photoshop to what
we want so let's go under edit and we're
going to come all the way down to the
bottom to preferences and then just
click on general that will bring us to
the actual general preferences and then
we can use the other ones coming through
here so so something like gentlemen
preferences this might take a whole
entire tutorial but something like
cursors will only take like two seconds
so that's how this is going to start
going out so we're going to start out
here we've got our color picker here we
can switch between the Adobe color
picker and or the windows color picker
now if I come out here this is our color
picker here so this is the Adobe one and
the windows is different I'll let you
guys mess with those and then you could
check out what the windows color picker
looks like so I don't have to keep on
going back and forth between stuff we've
got our color picker here the it's a HUD
it says HUD and that means heads-up
display color picker so we got a huge
strip small we got a heal hue wheel so
right now it's sent on huge trip which
is the default I guess you can increase
the size if you would like or change it
to a wheel so I guess I'm going to come
back over here so you can click on this
again
see this this is the huge stripper right
here so you can make it larger or
smaller or whatever you need to go back
into the preferences now image
interpolation now I made a tutorial
about these when I in a few tutorials
back I'm not exactly sure which one it
was in but I'm going to go back and see
if you can figure out because there's
the different types of image
interpolation here most of the time you
just want to keep it on bicubic
automatic and if you don't know what
you're doing yet with these just keep it
on bicubic automatic now the little
checkboxes here we have different
options for everything auto update
document opened up documents it creates
a link between the open image so the one
they have open and the image file on the
hard disk so it'll update that stuff for
you if you've been working on it in
another program beep when done makes
it's done when an operation is complete
and most of the time you want to have
that up because it's pretty effing
annoying especially if you're working in
a studio that's like a trick that we
play on people sometimes is turn on
their beep when done and people that are
new don't sometimes they don't know
about these preferences and stuff so
they don't know what's going on and
everybody gives in 30 Lux it's awesome
anyways dynamic color sliders previews
the color effects within the slider bars
so you can know just previews so keep
that on export clipboard means that it
transfers a copied image to the
operating systems clipboard so like if
we copied text in Photoshop we could
take that text and paste it into
something like Google Chrome if we
wanted
or into like notepad or anything like
that so you shift key for tool switch
and it allows you to use the keyboard
shortcut when two tools share the same
slot in the toolbox so when I come over
to one of our tools here and hold click
and hold down now it has the all these
tools share the letter I so if I hit
shift and press I it's going to switch
between the tools so that's what that
does you want to keep that on should
just use the hotkey for this but too
lazy resize the image during place which
when you go to place an image like back
in an earlier tutorial where you told
you how to insert images it'll allow you
to resize it while you're doing that
which is really good because sometimes
they come in way bigger than your canvas
and you have to resize them down and
they come in as a smart object too so
keep that on we got animated zoom that's
nice next yep so when you're zooming it
like there's like a smooth zoom in and
out and and enables your scrubby zoom so
keep that one on zoom with the scroll
wheel and this is something that some
people like and some people don't don't
like so it's it this is up to you
whether whether it have that on I skip
this one zoom resizes windows so it
forces the image window to resize when
the zoom is selected so just get that
one off
the zoom with scroll real that's your
preference and the next one is a zoomed
clicked zoom clicked point to Center and
basically what that means is is centers
where you're zooming on the clicked
location and sometimes that's helpful
also
so uncheck or check that if you would
enable flick panning now that enables
like you can use like quick flicks or
quick mouse movements I guess um over an
image instead of holding down the mouse
so that's something I have to go over
with you guys later on now if some of
this stuff doesn't make sense to you
then we'll go over it at a later time
and then you can come back at your
preferences and check it off or check it
on if you like it or not the next one
very round brush hardness based on the
heads-up display
vertical movement so this is a new
option that we have here and it pretty
much enables the brush brush hardness or
softness when you're booted vertically
moving up and down in the brush heads up
display so that might not make sense to
you now but you'll figure it out later
on so just keep that on for now place
our drag raster images as smart objects
so it converts your rest raster image
into a smart object when you place them
or drag them which is very helpful
because then it doesn't lose image
quality so keep that on and then we got
snap vector tools and transforms the
pixel grid and that's that basically
just enables snapping and that's new to
cs6 too and that's really helpful that
was like when I shown you like about the
ruler and stuff like that so that's what
snapping is now we got the history log
here you can check this and like save
your different you can stay made a data
text files or anything like that I
usually have that off I don't really
need that I never use it and I've never
looked at a history log before but if
you are into that stuff then go ahead
and turn it on so it looks like that
took about eight and a half minute
it's let's stop there and then we'll
come into another set of let's see what
the next one yeah this one has a bunch
in it too so I'll end here and go on to
the next set of preferences in the next
tutorial so keep watching for more
Preferences options and how to keep your
Photoshop at like some really high
performance levels so see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
