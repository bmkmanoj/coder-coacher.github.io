tutorial that I'm making for the New
Boston and in this tutorial I'll be
showing you how to access every control
in the forum so if 20 change that
property our control such as like it's
enabled or the text or something like
that I'm going to show you how to access
all the controls on using one simple
method and you don't have to like type
out like button one that x equals you
could just use a method so for this
tutorial you're going to need to have a
few buttons right here have just three
or four of them outside of this group
box right here and just have a group box
with at least one button inside fit so
once you have all that in your form just
go ahead and double click on this click
new button and the first thing that
we're going to be doing is setting the
text of every control to Adam so we're
just going to write a simple for each
David here to loop through every control
on the form we're going to say orange
control I was called see in this dot
controls and this dot controls basically
just refers to every control on the form
so for every control and mystic controls
of rubber control on the form we just
want to set the text of that control
equal to M so now I need you bug here it
should just loop through every control
and set the text as I control equal to
Adam me well again for all of them
except this button and that's because
his button is inside of this group box
never told it to access this fun just
fold it to access all the controls on
the form and this bottner here is called
a nested control that's because it's
inside another control and this thing
that holds the controls or the group box
is called a container meaning it holds
control inside of it or a can hold
control inside of it so in order to
access all the controls including this
party we're going to have to write a
recursive method and we worked a little
bit with recursive methods when dealing
with the tree view and in case you
missed that one it's basically just
calling on this method from inside
itself so if we had a method called like
hello we were just
call that hello method from inside it so
first we're going to do right here is
create a new method I'll just call it
access all we're going to have it
basically pass through a control
collection and we're just going to have
it first set the text of the control
equal to Adam and then we're going to
have it check to see if it control has
children refers controlled inside of it
and if there are then we'll just we call
this method so we can set all of those
controls equal or the text of all those
control illegal to Adam so let's just
copy this for each statement because we
need it so for each control in the
controller collection we're just gonna
set the text equal to Adam now we're
also going to check this PDF of control
has children or it's a control eyes
controls inside of it so we're going to
say if see as children and this returns
a pool indicating whether the control
has children on or basically whether the
control has controls inside of it so if
there's controls inside of this control
right here then we're just going to
recall this access all method and pass
through all the controls inside of that
control okay accessing all and then see
our controls so if this were a group box
right here then it would set the text of
the group box you put the Adam and then
it would check to see if it has children
and yes it does have children there's a
button inside of it so it will call this
method access all and we'll pass through
all the controls inside of this group
box so it'll just pass through this
button it says there's only one control
outside of this group box and then it
will set the text of that equal to Adam
so now we're just going to call this
access all method I'm going to click the
button and we're going to pass through
this dot controls so now maybe bug here
and click this button on the text of all
these controls including this button
right here changed
cue Adam yep perfect so that's pretty
much it for this tutorial
in the next tutorial I'm going to show
you a few more things you can do on
using a
nothing like this so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
