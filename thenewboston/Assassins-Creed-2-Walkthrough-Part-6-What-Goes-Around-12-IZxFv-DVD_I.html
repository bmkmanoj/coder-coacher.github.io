welcome to memory for and it's just
called what goes around and this is in I
think the third sequence and this is the
mission where you have to assassinate I
think his name is very deep at sea so
it's a pretty big mission and actually
this is probably going to be a two-part
video so just letting you know
so in this mission you go ahead with
your cousin Mario it's any stockings
only with right now give me a game plan
to strike the guards once we have
engaged them get yourself over the wall
and find a way to open the gates
take these throwing knives use them to
dispatch the archers ready when you are
so here you see you get introduction to
throwing knives and the thing you want
to take note of and another thing you
probably want to buy medicine you see
I'm filled up five out of five you
probably want to make sure you're
filling on medicine before you start
this mission because you're probably
going to need at least one maybe two
probably two so go ahead and a walk onto
the target and then press X to throw
your throwing knives and you want to
take care of at least that guard and
this one up here and once you kill these
two guards then you should be good
because those are two main guards that
alert the other guards so I mean even
though there is a huge battle going on
outside with Mario and has been you want
to take the care of those two guards
first so you want to go ahead and open
this and this opens the door to let
Mario's men in now sometimes Mario's men
will kill all these people before you
can get to them but they didn't kill me
yet so you got to help them so switch to
your blade or your sword I just decided
going my sword because I could counter
attack easy and go ahead and you
yeah get that guy and it looks like
there's one guy left and then we can
continue on with the mission
so now that you kill all those guys they
run and set the wall and start looking
for merit apology so now he's gonna give
you the next part of your mission right
here so go ahead and follow him and
those gods and keep them from praising
the alarm hopefully will buy me enough
time to find in silence ba ba ba wait
kneeboarding take a few of my men with
you just to be safe
come join me once they've dealt with so
now you pretty much split up into groups
and you take these guys with you in you
can control them with a Y button anytime
you have a group of Cartesians or any
group you hire you can press Y to make
them start and stuff now if you don't
press anything they're gonna follow you
just on their own so go ahead and when
I'm quite in other groups what's kind of
cool to take note of is anytime someone
else is fine you can pretty much go and
stab them in the back easy for easy kill
so let me kill this guy real quick and
I'll show you how to little stab in the
back so you just walked up to him and
bam stab you in the back you don't even
have to worry about him because he's
already instructed you let me see if I
get this guy just stab him in the back
and you know I don't even know what I'm
swinging there right there but you know
and look this it's the only honorable
thing to do is stab people in the back
so you know don't forget it
uppercut mofo and now once we kill all
those people just go ahead and run to
your little crosshairs and that's where
it gonna gonna be where Mario is but
take note not to run in any guards like
right here
ya see ya again you probably kill them
but I don't like confrontation if I
don't need to so I decided to go on the
rooftop and another thing going on the
rooftop is just cool so do that so you
can go ahead and follow the same path as
I do or you can make your own path you
know doesn't really matter as long as
you get to those crosshairs so oh I
forgot you got to go to another guy
first but
anyways hop down here but make sure not
to die which I'm probably gonna and oh
no only half my health and go ahead and
he's like I don't know I think they
threw this part in but I mean just go to
Mario anyways and now you can see that
Mario's having a huge war with all of
these people so what do you want to do
is you don't want to stop and tell me
play you just want to get Mario's
message right here and he's pretty much
dude Ezio I got these people right you
don't worry about me you go do my Fieri
the Pazzi you take care him so we're
like alright see ya chicken balls
chopped in the head and I'm out of here
and so you're pretty much gonna run to
kill veerudu Potsie and yeah there's guy
following me I know it
so this is gonna make things yeah that's
annoying I'm trying to climb this wall
and he's knocking me in the head yeah
that's why I thought oh my god are you
kidding me alright
see now I had to use one of my medicine
just because that guy is extremely
annoying but anyways now that I got out
of there just go ahead and climb this
and this is pretty much gonna take you
to the second part of your mission which
is well the first thing you have to do
is reach this checkpoint and that is
when you listen in on Vieira de Potsie
in this conversation and once you hear
all the dirty dark secrets of what they
did and what they're planning to do then
the second part is gonna have you
assassinate them if you can so let's go
ahead and hop down here hop through some
roof whoo my snatch and I didn't even
take any health so go ahead and I
noticed my notoriety is full blast but I
don't got time to do anything about that
so oh in the checkpoint is on a roof in
case you were wondering so let's go
ahead and climb up here
and you can see the the checkpoint is
right there so just go to it and there
is its second very you will remain here
to coordinate imaginary but I just hope
we'll organize our forces in the city
and send word when it's time to strike
now Coco your job is to count the
citizens once the deed is done
what of that degree Akane Mario
continues to harass my forces and I feel
you discovered what we intend is always
been trouble just like that bastard oh
brother
then let me reunite them father there
will be plenty of time to clean up the
refuge when we're finished now is there
anything else
muy bien may the father of understanding
night guy FYI
so that's pretty much it for this video
in the next video we're gonna be going
after them so thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
