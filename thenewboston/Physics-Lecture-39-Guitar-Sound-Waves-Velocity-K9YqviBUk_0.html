video in in this video
you know since these are physics lessons
I thought it would be more appropriate
to show you guys an example of the last
formula that we learn but apply it to a
topic that's a little more physics
related because you know surfing in
Hawaii is fun and all but this formula
velocity equals wavelength times
frequency it actually works for a bunch
of different types of waves like radio
waves light waves sound waves not just
surfing in Hawaii waves so let's go
ahead and take a look at a basic sound
wave because I think that this will be
the easiest way to demonstrate on so
sound waves before we just jump into the
you know formula let me go ahead and
give you a little background first of
all the frequency of a sound wave is
often measured in Hertz and the Hertz is
basically one cycle per one second so
instead of you know figuring out hey
scientists do you want to measure in
minutes hours what about you over there
they just said you know what we better
standardize this anytime we write Hertz
it just means it's basically a very
common unit for frequency and it means
one cycle per second so another thing is
well let me just go ahead and what make
sound we'll say that a guitar so let me
draw this guitar right here
not a bad guitar here's a little
blowhole or whatever you call it on an
acoustic guitar here's the neck and
might as well go ahead and finish this
thing off here's the head and something
tells me that this guitar is going to
look like a dead alien I just got shot
and let's see what else does guitar have
some frets some strings good enough so
basically whenever you pluck a guitar
string guitar strings vibrate at around
500 Hertz so they make 500 vibrations
every single second which is incredibly
fast now here are the sound waves coming
off the guitar pretty realistic sound
waves now the sound waves the distance
between these different waves is often
around point seven meters whenever we're
talking about sound so I know that a lot
of times that
examples are way far off you know what
they normally are but this is you know
somewhere in the range for a typical
guitar plucking the frequency is often
in somewhere in the area of 500 Hertz
and the sound waves are usually
somewhere around 0.7 meters apart so
just remember that 500 Hertz and point
seven meters because I'm about to hop to
a new slide so remember the formula I'll
write that again velocity of any wave
including the sound wave is the wave
length multiplied by the frequency of
the wave now we know that the wave
length of this guitar the sound waves is
0.7 meters and the frequency equals I
think we said 500 Hertz so now if we
wanted to calculate the velocity what
would we do well velocity is equal to
the wavelength which is 0.7 meters
multiplied by 500 Hertz and remember you
don't have to write meters or seconds
because that's what Hertz means so now
when we multiply those two figures
together we get 350 meters per second so
if anyone ever asks you around what
speed does a sound wave coming from a
guitar how fast is that you can say with
confidence probably around 350 meters
per second which is actually really fast
it's almost actually I want to say like
a commercial airplane is probably 320
330 meters per second so sound waves
sound waves are slightly faster than a
commercial airplane and a fun fact I
know that a lot of you guys probably
know that really fast Jets like the kind
the army uses can break the sound
barrier which basically means they can
go faster than sound waves but some
super fast jets can break the sound
barrier many times over and they can do
it with ease and maybe we'll talk about
sonic booms in the sound barrier later
on but for now just remember this
formula applies to other things except
surfing and Hawaii</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
