Effects tutorial this is After Effects
cs6 and my name is buddy Blackford I'll
be teaching you today about the
different access modes in your custom
view so when you're working with an
object it's going to default on an axis
which is these red or a red green and
blue this is your axis right here and
it's going to default on having an axis
around your object here that you're
clicking on well maybe sometimes you
don't want to have the axis based on
this object maybe you want to have it
based on like your view or your or the
entire like world as they would call it
and the world is the entire scene here
so you there's different ways to switch
that and they're up here in this panel
right to the right of the tools panel
you've got your local access mode your
world access mode and your view access
mode so right now it's on local which
means it's on this local object is what
it means if I click on world
you can see how it changes so this is
this is local and now this is world now
based on this world the z-axis shoots
out this way the excess is shoots out
that way and the Y shoots up and if I
move my camera you can see how the axis
is move around depending on how the
world is so I'm moving my camera around
but not the actual object now if I move
the camera around on this guy it's gonna
stay with him so it's always the axis is
always on
that image then there is the next one
called view now this is going to be
straight on to us straight up and
straight to the right and if I move it
it's always going to be like that so
it's based on your viewer so you want to
use the viewer pretty much if you want
to keep a consistent axis throughout
your whole scene that's probably the
least one that I use the one I use the
most is is is the local and then the one
I use the next most is the world and you
if you have a lot of things in your
scene and you want to keep things
consistent looking use the world axis
and then that way that will be
consistent to your scene so I'll keep
this one this one short that's pretty
much the axises it's something that you
need to know and make sure you use
correctly if you come into a scene and
someone has different accesses already
like chosen in their After Effects
project you want to make sure you look
at these first and make sure they're on
the one that you want to use or the one
that your boss wants you to use so
that's the end of that tutorial it was a
really quick one but it was a necessary
one and I thank you for watching it and
look forward to seeing you in the next
one see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
