tutorial in the UDK and in this story
I'm probably going to be goofing around
some more with static meshes I'm
actually probably going to be finishing
my castle say that three times fast
finishing Castle finishing Castle to
Castle got it and yeah that's basically
it so the first thing I want to tell you
guys is I added this little column right
here so now I think it's time to add
some flavor as I would say to the front
walls here so let's go ahead and open up
our content browser and let's go ahead
and search for those arches I saw some
arches earlier that I kind of liked and
there are these ones right here these
arch walls my fate these ones oh I like
them both so much 1 0 I get 0 on do I
get we'll just stick with this one for
now so go ahead grab that drag it out
and the very first thing we're going to
notice is that if we scroll out of here
we probably want to push it back a
little bit and we still can't see and
that's because we need to rotate it
let's go ahead and rotate this 180 and
check it out my Lions face is now facing
the front but as you can see now I could
leave it like that and make it kind of
like a window looking thing but I really
don't want to do that I want to grow it
by a little bit so let me grow it by
like two let's see how that looks to
play and let's go ahead and push that
back for some perspective hey where my
other views go out there you're all
rascal alright so let's go ahead and
grab this and we'll go ahead and I don't
know if I want to set it right on the
ground yet yeah I think I do let's go
ahead and pop that right on the ground
and actually can do that in this view
right here
and now in my front view which is
actually my side view go ahead and put
that like right there looks pretty good
guys think that looks good actually want
to pull that out just a tid bit just
like that so that looks pretty good and
actually I changed my mind actually want
to drag that up again I probably should
have planned on these tutorials probably
should have done a lot of things
probably went to college probably showed
up you know what nevermind so anyways
let's go ahead and just all this and I
think this is looking pretty good to be
honest and make sure we're not looking
at any of our orthographic views because
we want those to be nice and uneven this
is looking pretty epic to be honest
pretty darn good so now with that being
done let's say that uh I'm just going to
make a game called find the statue and
this is level 1 so the goal of this game
is our players going to start right here
and his goal is to find a statue so in
this a level we're going to go ahead and
put the statue right here so let's go
ahead and I'm actually going to put this
statue on a pillar so if we go up in our
content browser and just drag out grab
like a pillar or stand or something and
let me look this one looks pretty cool
or do I want to use this one Oh any
meenie miney moe this one it is and go
ahead and drag that out and it is
incredibly tiny right now actually this
one looks a little more epic yeah there
we go so go ahead and I'm gonna grow
this to like let's say let's give it a
nice two point oh
and all right looks looking pretty good
Bucky so go ahead put it right there
make sure that's lined up in our side
view which a good enough and now in our
top view we can make sure it's lined up
right where we wanted to which right
there it looks pretty darn good so now
what I'm going to need to do is now that
I verify that is indeed on the ground go
ahead and put a statue on it because
again the name of this game find the
statue so we of course need to go open
up our content browser and find a stitch
you for this one looks pretty good eeny
meeny miny mo ok I'll choose that one
hello statue you're a little too close
to my camera so what we're going to do
is drag you over there and make sure
you're sitting right on top of this
little fellow right here and now once i
got that complete drag you over right
there and you should be placed perfectly
what i could do is rotate you and that's
actually what i'm going to do in my top
view i'm gonna rotate you just a little
bit so you're like oh oh look at him
dance
Oh dropped beat up on fifth base boom
boom boom club it belong ok ok enough me
I goofing around so actually this is
looking pretty cool right there so yeah
so our game is almost complete but check
it out if we were to play this game
right now then everything would be
incredibly dark I mean look at art
Castle this look like 15 minutes to
create aside for me talking about just
like stupid random stuff so imagine what
you can create in like an hour or two
you might be able to add like podiums
with flayer and more windows up here
make a castle look better but for now
the only thing I have left to do in this
castle is I'm going to add some lights
right along here I'm going to be adding
two lights the first kind I'm going to
be adding just game 3d model lights now
whenever we add those 3d model lights
they of course aren't going to act like
real lights in our game so then we're
going to need to do is add real lights
on top of them so our player can
actually see and if you don't know what
I'm talking about then you guys have to
wait for the next tutorial we're going
to be finishing up our castle adding
some lights and actually playing the
game find the statute so that's what you
have to look forward to but for now this
is all you guys get just a plain old
castle so in the next sort of like I
said we're going to be finishing
everything up so make sure to check that
one out so thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
