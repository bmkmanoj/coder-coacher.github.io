development tutorial and I know I
haven't been making a lot of tutorials
recently but I promise you guys that's
gonna change um
now in this tutorial one of the main
topics that I want to cover next
actually one of the last main topics I
need to teach you guys before we
actually jump in building some pretty
sweet specialized programs it has to
deal with tapping the screen and
specialization of touching the screen
like for example when you take two
fingers and pinch them together or you
know you swipe across the screen or
touch a special object I know we've been
dealing with you know touching buttons
and stuff like that but there's gonna
come across times you want to do
something else just besides touch
buttons and labels on the screen so
that's what I'm going to be teaching you
in this what's called Project this
tutorial I guess so go ahead and create
a new Xcode project and just go ahead
and make it view-based
right there and name it something
perverted like don't touch me there and
save that and there we go
so rearrange that all nice and neat and
let me get everything nice and neat for
you guys there we go so in your classes
oh good game you see it go ahead to the
don't touch me view controller right
here pretty much the main view
controller your bill and get rid of this
because it's annoying and let's go ahead
and start building a program that can
demonstrate what the heck I'm talking
about so like I said we're gonna be
dealing with a simple program that
recognizes specialized touches now
they're gonna be no buttons um there's
gonna be a label on a screen just so we
can see what we're doing but this has to
do with taking your finger and touching
the screen now when this happens
something called a touch event is
generated now check this out
every time you touch the iPhone screen
your iPhone looks for a built-in method
called touches began and they're
actually a bunch of different methods
that your iPhone looks forward to hand
the pledges whenever you first touch a
screen it looks for a method called
touches began and this is how it handles
the touch event now whenever you lift
your finger off the screen it looks for
something called touches ended and
whatever is in that method it runs and
whenever you're moving your finger
across the screen and you know your
fingers obviously touching the screen it
looks for a method called touches move
and whatever is in here this is the bit
of code that runs now there's also one
more method in this is um it's like
called touches canceled I think and this
is as you're using a touch event like as
you're sliding your finger across the
screen and your phone rings or something
then this would cancel the touch but you
know I'm not even gonna bother cutting
that because it's a simulator my phone's
obviously not gonna run ring in the
iPhone simulator or else that would be
really effed up alright so anyways let's
go ahead and build just basic label on
screen so UI label and just go ahead and
head and name it first label and then
under this go ahead property non-atomic
retain and iboutlet and UI label well we
really effed that up label and first
label alright looks good enough so go
ahead and build this or just hold
command B and no build save it and now
in your resources I'm not even going to
show you this don't touch I mean I'm not
going to show you me clicking I'm gonna
show you me doing it go ahead and take
your view and go ahead and drag a label
over to it and just go ahead expand this
baby on the screen
you might as well just leave that text
right in there since we're gonna change
it programmatically all right now go
ahead and I should be interesting our
control files owner first label so now
go ahead file save enter bit interface
builder quit interface builder all right
that's all stuff we learned before now
what we needed to do now that we got our
label all set up and that's a lot of
work just get a label set up is go over
in your main implementation file and
there we go get that situated now what
we want to do first of all housekeeping
stuff is go ahead and synthesize what
are you name it first label just like
that now I probably should you know do
stuff like release outlets and you know
take care of objects but you know I'm
not gonna do that
so first label to be fine we did that
all right
so under D Alec because I guess that's
just where everyone puts these methods
what you want to do is let's go ahead
and start building these methods I'm
talking about so right now if we go
ahead and build and run this program
let's see what happens well I got my
iPhone stimulator right here just
chilling and I click on the screen and
nothing happens and that's because it
looks for the method called touches
became not bacon touches began to say
how do I want to handle my touch and a
click is a touch in out on your iPhone
simulator so go ahead and close this and
since it has no method yet it doesn't
know how to handle it so let's go ahead
and add those methods that I was talking
about its avoid touches began right
there as you can see it automatically
pops up this is not a method that you
know you create yourself from scratches
is built-in method that you overwrite so
as you can see it takes an NS set called
touches in the case you don't know an NS
set is pretty much a sub objects so
anytime you touch the screen this
touches object happy
and you don't really use this event
parameter so don't even worry about it
so what do we want to do whenever a
touch first began so again one last time
whenever you first touch your iPhone
screen or click in your iPhone simulator
this method is going to be called so
what we want to do is just take that
first label and change the text to
something you know you what I got you
touch the screen and make sure you spell
mostly everything wrong so you know that
looks pretty good right there and the
other method I want to show you is void
touches ended right there and this
method gets called whenever you lift
your finger off the screen so let's go
ahead and copy this because you know I'm
Way too lazy to type it out again and
firstly put a text you lifted your
finger off the screen
that's obviously that's not gonna fit on
my label at all whoa what the heck just
happened I totally thought that in our
own place Wow all right maybe this work
a little you lifted your finger off the
screen there we go that's a bit better
eh all right in the last one I want to
talk to you guys about is this one
called void touches move and this
happens as you're sliding your finger
across the screen so if you ever play
like fruit ninja or anything like that
this is pretty much when you swipe your
finger this is what's happening so go
ahead and copy this again maybe I won't
f it up this time
copy/paste
and let's go with why did I just yeah
you move let's go you are moving your
finger and get rid of this actually just
move down now I probably missed
something I put copy and paste in all
those but no looks pretty good so now
check this out now when we click it says
let me try to get it you touch the
screen so I'm pressing down I'm
simulating clicking right now just
touching my finger to the screen so when
I first do that this method touches
began is gonna call it you touch the ghe
screen
alright so that's what I'm doing right
there now check it whenever I lift up
you lifted your finger off the screen
and that's me letting go of the mouse
alright so that's the middle one and now
check this out whenever we move our
mouse while clicking down you are moving
your finger aka Mouse on the iPhone
simulator so that is your basics of a
touching program in the next program
we'll build it a little bit smarter but
yeah that's your basics for now and I'm
running out of time so I think you guys
for watching don't forget subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
