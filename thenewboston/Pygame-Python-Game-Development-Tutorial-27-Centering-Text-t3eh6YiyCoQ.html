27th pygame tutorial video in the last
video we're talking about getting you
know objects to register some sort of
crossover on all this and we've done
that and now we kind of want to improve
the aesthetics of our game so our game
is pretty much fully functional now so
we've got a snake we've got an apple
we've got a bunch of rules we pretty
much done everything functionality wise
that we need to for snake but now we
want to actually cover some of the
aesthetics and then eventually we'll
package up the game and show how we
could distribute the game so uh without
squid get started the first major
aesthetics issue you know maybe it's
kind of lame that these the cube they're
cubes and stuff but that's okay but the
thing I want to first start with is
right here so where we have this message
that starts in the center great but it
just kind of it's it's obviously off
over a little bit we're not really happy
with that so we're going to go and fix
that in this video and get that to be
centered and the way that we would like
so that all starts basically this
message to screen function so in our
message to screen function we basically
want to continue doing the same thing
but we want to Center the text in a
little slightly different way than we've
been centering texts so the way that
we're going to Center text so here we
were bleeding based on the location of
that text but actually what we want to
do is we want to display the text and
like I was telling you when we wrote
this the first time like text object is
actually mm it's like an object and
there's a rectangle around it and then
we can take that rectangle take the
center of that rectangle and then Center
the center of the rectangle so we can
Center all text on that we want so to do
that we're going to need to make some
changes here so let's go ahead and get
started making those changes so first of
all we have message to screen and
that I think well basically we're just
going to rewrite all of this for the
most part so I'm going to just comment
this stuff out for now and just leave it
just in case same reasons as before and
now we want to do is we're going to say
a few things so first of all we have
what's called a text surface and text
surface is just like our PI game surface
right remember we have various surface
objects and keep in mind you've got
surface objects and you can update those
surface objects very specifically if you
want so just keep that in mind but for
now we've got a text surface which is
where we're going to put the text so a
text surface and then text rect so
that's going to be a tuple and those
objects um are those you know variables
basically are going to equal font dot or
not I'm sorry are gonna equal text
underscore objects and then whatever
that message is so um so what we want is
a we want to be able to make a function
of text objects and that we want that
function to return the surface data and
then also the rectangle of that data
once that's done we're gonna we would
say a text rectangle dot Center so what
is the centre-right of that object and
that attribute will be um the result of
display width divided by two and
basically display height divided by two
so display width divided by two and then
display height divided by two and that's
the center of our text rectangle then
once all that's done we do the same
blitt as before only with different
variables so we would do game display
dot blitt and then we blitt that to the
text surface and then what are we
bleeding there is the text rectangle so
clearly um that makes a lot of sense but
now we need to create this function
return
the text surface and the text rectangle
so for that we'll just do that right
here and this function name again is
going to be defined text underscore
objects and what we pass through here is
just the text right whatever that the
text for that object is going to be so
text we're passing message through right
we're passing message through text and
actually what we should do as well as we
should pass color so we'll pass message
color and then this is text and color so
we'll pass those things through and then
we're going to say text surface equals
font dot render and we want to render
the text true and then the color
whatever that color of the text we want
it to be and then at the end we return
text surface and then the way that we
get the rectangle like that corresponds
to all the stuff around the text we just
have to do text surface dot get
underscore wrecks empty parameters and
that will be the rectangle around so
that's returning the text surface in the
text rectangle and then you can see down
here text surface Tex wrecked and then
we do what we wanted to do with it
so um the message to screen that should
be read so now that text should be
centered so let's save and run that and
let's go ahead and just crash and now
you see that our text is actually
centered completely on the screen so
we'll hit Q to exit and and that's that
now there's a few other things first of
all that text is ugly and then all the
other things that we'd already brought
up in the previous video that we want to
change so we still want to change the
icon we want to make the text a little
bit more readable maybe choose a
different font um and a whole host of
other things so anyways hopefully you
guys enjoyed that got that text Center
so that was one major fix oh and then we
also want to make a snake look a little
more appealing so all those things
coming up thanks for watching stay tuned
thanks video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
