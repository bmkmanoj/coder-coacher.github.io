substituted in so it will look now like
this what we can then do so the the data
has been substituting through these
variables what we can then do is we we
run this query and it returns I see the
0 rows or 1 row depending on if the
username in the password match so
hopefully you understand that at this
point now what happens if the user was
to enter some some values that actually
modify our SQL query which is here so
for example let's say the username was
inverted a sorry single quotation mark
equals no sorry in single quotation mark
or two quotation marks equals quotation
mark let's just say the user entered
that as the as the username and they did
the same for the password so because
they're free to enter anything in the
form we've picked up these variables
using this and now we're transferring
these variables into here so now
username let's just copy it and copy
over them pet copy and paste over I mean
that's our there and copy and paste that
over to there now let's get rid of this
because that just showed us and the
example so the username is now equal to
this value here and the password is also
equal to this value in below so let's
just look at the highlighted value in
blue well this is actually done if I
take the blue away you can see it's
modified our SQL statement so obviously
our users of our website can't see what
we're processing inside of PHP but what
they can do is fiddle around with the
website until they can make a very good
guess or an exact guess how our SQL
statement is structured now what this
query reads is select ID from users
where username equals nothing or nothing
equals nothing and password equals
nothing or nothing equals nothing
now nothing equals nothing so that's
true
and nothing equals nothing so that's
true therefore what we're doing is we're
returning a row or a couple of rows so
let's copy and paste this into our
database to see what results we get
let's click go okay so we've been
returned with our two rows in our
database or our two records rather so
what we've actually done is just by user
input and me demonstrating user input
we're going to actually create the
application later what we've done is
we've returned two rows now so we've
entered the password as this as this sum
let's just go back to it we've entered
the password as this here or the
username is this here and the password
is this here and we've now automatically
gained access to this whatever
registration system however we're
creating it so this isn't always the
case it depends on how its programmed
this is why we're going to go through an
example program so that's just basically
a bit about PHP or SQL injection in
general but with PHP obviously it's the
same as same vulnerability so now we
know that what well now we know what SQL
injection is and we've seen an example
of them you you know now that a
statement can be modified and you can
and a statement can be modified to let's
say delete records we're not going to go
into anything too complex this is just a
representation of it but we can do
absolutely anything we want to our
database more or less so I'm going to
talk now just about the first the first
way to protect against SQL injection
this doesn't actually prevent the user
input we're not doing anything in PHP
but if we go back to our home and we go
to privileges and we edit privileges for
our user let's say root our localhost
this is what I'm using at the moment now
you can see here that we've got ticks
for absolutely everything now let's say
we were creating a website and we were
logging in and well we were connecting
to our server and we were also we're
also connecting to our database and
reading values from a database let's
just say we were just
just reading values from a database
we're not creating anything so we might
want to unpick that we might not be
altering anything so we might move out
and tick that so you can understand
uncheck things that you might not want
to do so if we might select but we might
not insert we might not update or delete
and we can get rid of all of these so by
getting rid of all of these we've
already limited our privileges for this
specific user
therefore if someone was to come in and
try to inject her or change your
statement server-side to say delete your
entire database then they might not be
able to do it because you may have
unselected the privileges so at the
moment because I'm working on a local
computer my privileges are set to
everything just in case you know
depending on what I need to do so that's
one way that you can protect against it
so only select the privileges that you
absolutely need on the website so if you
I mean it's very rare that inside a web
application you'd want to say drop your
entire database so you can you can you
can move this or drop tables you might
need to drop tables but you can you can
uncheck specific ones so that's
something to think about while we carry
on with our actual PHP code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
