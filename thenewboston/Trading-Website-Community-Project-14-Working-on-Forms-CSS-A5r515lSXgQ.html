fourteenth video and in this video we're
going to be tackling some more of the
form that CSS file and the first thing I
want to do is add a class called
container now what this container class
is going to do is it's pretty much going
to be responsible for setting the width
of the form now I chose with up 740
because this is going to be the default
size for the form now remember we have a
total of seven eighty to work with in
the main area where this form is going
to be however whenever we have 7 40
pixels and we add the padding on each
side of 20 on the left and 20 on the
right that's when we end up with 7 80
pixels so that's why i chose 7 40 it's
going to work out perfectly so the next
thing i want to do is i want to show you
guys something and that is the error
messages whenever the user makes a
mistake and they try to enter an email
that's not valid or maybe they you know
put a dollar sign for their username or
something and they try to submit this an
error message is going to pop up now as
you can see this error message is kind
of red with white lettering and it has
some other attributes through but
anyways that's what we're going to be
styling right now this error message so
the class for this is air almost made of
error just typing that and of course
this is the styling color white
background color of hexadecimal d 0 0 0
0 0 and it also has a padding a 4 pixels
a margin of 10 pixels and a font family
ariel and also a font weight of bold and
there you go there's your air class
again that's this little thing right
here with that styling that's what you
have so after this I know we're only
working on the registration page right
now but eventually we're going to be
working on a feedback page so I'm going
to go ahead and pause my video right now
and I'm going to come back and code this
all right guys welcome back and that is
what i coded in the meantime basically
the feedback page i know that i didn't
uh you guys might not even know what i'm
talking about but whenever we cut our
feedback page i want to throw that inner
file because we're going to need it
later on so for now just keep it out of
your mind and i'll discuss that when the
time is right now the next thing i want
to code in here is a class for the
fields now the fields are pretty much
any form element for example um we're
going to have input boxes and we have
the email we have the password we have
text areas we're going to have drop-down
menus eventually and these are pretty
much the fields so the only thing I want
to do is I want to add a little margin
so if I didn't then all of these white
spaces will be push up together and it
would look like one big white box so
that is why I need a class called field
and I want to add a margin bottom knot'n
arjun margin bottom of seven pixels
there we go now after this what I want
to do is I want to give the the user a
hint oftentimes whenever they hover over
on one of these input areas for example
their username whenever they hover over
the input for username it says 20
characters maximum letters and numbers
only and for password it says 20
characters maximum basically hints
whenever you know you may have a
question on some field it just clarifies
things so in order to make that hint the
first thing we need to do is style it so
in order to style it in order to add the
action of this is going to pop up
whenever you hover over that
field you need to go ahead and access
your class field and add the action
hover Wow okay take a deep breath hover
there we go I knew I'd get it eventually
and after this I'm going to add a class
called hint now this is going to be the
main styling for that hint as you can
see it's gray kind of transparent with a
you know white lettering a bunch of good
stuff so the first thing I want to do is
position absolutely make sure I sped the
right yep position is absolute and I
also wanted to display it as a block
element now I'm going to add a margin
and I already figured it out on the
perfect placement for this but it's
negative 30 pixels zero zero in on a
form of seven um whoa what is this form
I forgot 740 pixels the correct spacing
is 650 pixels and whenever we are need
to change the width of our form we have
to remember to change the width of this
and for font size go ahead and make this
15 pixels oh let's see what else do we
need to take care of the color we didn't
change that yet just make that white and
the padding 7 pixels 10 pixels and for
the background as you can see it wasn't
a solid color it had kind of a
transparency to it and that's where
we're going to be doing we're pretty
much going to be making a black but
transparent so let's go ahead and do
that right now so background of rgba and
if you watch my css3 and html5 tutorials
you know that this is of course red
green blue and the last one is alpha 0
to 1 and let's go ahead and make the 0.6
so this is going to give us a black
semi-transparent background now the last
thing I want to do is give it rounded
corners and I am just going to go ahead
and copy these babies right here give it
around the corner of 7 pixels and there
you go whenever you can copy please do
so now the last thing I want to
do is I want to make this hidden by
default I only want this to show up
whenever we hover over it so by default
if we leave it like this right now it
would just show up all the time but we
only want this to show up on the hover
obviously so in order to hide this by
default what you need to do is you need
to access the default class the class
that first loads whenever you load the
web page and put display to none so
basically this hint is not going to
display until you hover over it and then
when you do it's going to take all these
settings and pretty much pop up on the
screen giving you that nice interactive
feeling so we only have three more
classes to code in this file and then
one really small short CSS file and then
crack your knuckles because we're going
to get into the programming so thank you
