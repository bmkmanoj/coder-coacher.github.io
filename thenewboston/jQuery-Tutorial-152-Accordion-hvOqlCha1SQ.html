with a video tutorial for the new Boston
in this video we're going to take a look
at the widget in jQuery UI which is the
accordion now the accordion will open
and shut a particular element depending
on obviously where you place them we're
going to look at a few options that we
can use to change the functionality of
this however this is more or less how it
works
so you have a header area which you
click to activate a main content area
now by default we have a few problems
with the accordion that you might like
to change so we're going to have things
like resizing issues and we might like
to change the icons as well as well as a
couple of on mouse-over events or events
that we do that happen with our mouse so
for example at the moment I have this
set to click so when I click on an
element or header it shows the content
but we might want to say roll over and
show content so we're only going to be
looking at a few options and we're not
going to be taking a look at event in
this case again this will just get you
started with the overall concept so the
first thing we want to do is we want to
go ahead and actually create this area
that we're going to put the content into
so the first thing we need to do is
create an overall div and we need to
give this a name and I'm going to call
this let's just say content and inside
here we're going to need to supply a few
things the first of which is a header
and we're going to create a link inside
of this header and the location of the
links just hash because it won't
actually go to a different page and
inside of this link it will be the title
so for example about me now directly
underneath this header we're going to
create an area with the content that is
displayed once this header is clicked so
so that should be div the div here is
going to be the area that whatever is
displayed so inside of here let's just
say a little about me okay so now let's
take a look at that you can see that
that's just a header here with a link
and then some content so not really much
at the moment we can go ahead and create
two more of these just to get a good
demonstration of how this works
so we create another link portfolio for
example with a link as a hash and inside
here so this is my portfolio
and then the we don't really need an ID
for that and then the last one header
three and a link inside of here again so
it's interesting that these could be
perhaps generated from a database table
as long as you keep this structure it
doesn't matter once you apply the
accordion widget to this it will
actually pick up on all of these values
so these values can come from absolutely
anywhere they don't need to be static so
it could be for example a settings menu
in a user interface there's a wide
variety of options so now the last one
I'm just going to do is contact and then
inside a div with no ID my contact
contact details okay so let's go ahead
and preview that make sure everything's
there yet we've got the three headers
and the three content areas now we need
to go ahead and actually set up the
accordion now this is extremely simple
in its purest form however we're going
to look at three different options we
can customize this with so the first
thing that we need is obviously jQuery
then the jQuery UI j/s file and we have
UI j s which we're going to be working
in here to create the accordion and then
change some of the options we also need
this stylesheet here which is found with
a package when you download jQuery UI I
do have a video on downloading that so
we need to reference this content div
and turn it into an accordion so it's
extremely extremely simple we just go
over to UI and we use a selector to
select the content area and we just
write accordion so we're applying this
widget to this content here and what
this will automatically do is pick up on
all of the properties or the the
elements we've given it so the headers
and the content and when we refresh
that's turned that into an accordion so
it's an extremely easy way to implement
this into your website now the one thing
that we have at the moment is we have
varying space inside of our content area
and this has this has only taken up as
much space as it needs so for example
inside a little about me if we were to
say I am a web developer a break after
that you can see that this is now
smaller than this area here well it's
not that if you would have say more
content down here you would have a lot
more so for example we can break down
just again and more so when we refresh
we've got a larger area here than we do
have with the others so what in actual
fact we don't know anyway okay so we'll
go from the basis that we want all of
these to be the same size down the page
and we want to keep a maximum size to it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
