third photoshop project and in this
project we're going to be creating an
ice planet and space looking photo so
the first thing we want to do is make
sure we're in our background layer and
go ahead into the black foreground color
and grab your paint bucket tool now go
ahead and paint your background black
this is going to give you a nice space
looking background now aside from this
right on your background layer go up to
the filter noise add noise and make sure
you're on gaussian and monochromatic and
not uniform what this does right here
the noise is add an amount of white
speckles to your photo go ahead and
click somewhere between nine and eleven
then go ahead and click OK what this is
going to do is add variation of white
speckles and now give you the nice
starry looking look so now that you have
space with some stars in it go ahead and
create a new layer and this is going to
be our planet so to do that go ahead up
to the elliptical marquee tool and you
can go ahead and make the shape of your
planet now know it if you just go ahead
and start dragging you can
make ovals with a your mouse and you
don't want to do that what we want to do
is hold down the shift key and this is
going to make sure that you can create a
perfect circle so once you do that
create a perfect circle and this is
going to be the shape of your planet let
me go ahead and close it now once you
have the shape of your planet go ahead
back to your paint bucket tool and fill
in your entire planet black now this is
going to be the outline of your planet
and i'll tell you why we do this later
the next thing we want to do is paint
the texture and color on our planet so
go ahead and select the brush tool make
sure you're on a nice fading as you can
see you don't want this hard edge right
here one a nice fading edge i'm going to
use about three hundred and go ahead and
click the color you want as you can see
i'm going with a nice like a light tan
color just because i think it will look
good like as a planet and the last thing
that you're going to want to do is go up
to this brush settings and you're going
to want to choose a texture make sure
that none of these are checked besides
texture and you're going to want to make
it overlay and get a nice rock texture
so here's a nice rock texture right here
as you can see you have a bunch preset
but I'm going to choose the rock one
and make sure you're on about anywhere
from 60 to 70 scale and make sure you're
in overlay so once you have that you can
start painting as you can see when you
paint it gives you a nice planet outline
now I'm going to paint heavier in my top
left side then my bottom right side
because I want to give it the effect
that it's kind of a light source is
coming from here and it's a kind of
shaded down there kind of like the
planet earth does or any planet for that
man or come to think of it alright so
once you have that you can go ahead and
we can start adding a glow around our
planet so to do that you're rid of this
go up to layer and make sure you're on
layer 1 instead background now layer
style and blend options now we're going
to be working with outer glow and inner
glow now for our outer glow make sure we
have a checked and go ahead and click
this what this is going to do is allow
you to pick the colors for your outer
glow I won't mind be a nice blue like
that a nice light blue so I'm go ahead
and click OK as you can see I have blue
on this side white on this side and
click these little tools right here
change color so go ahead and click OK
and I want my spread 0
and I want my size to be
I'm going to have mine about 20 right
there and opacity about 60
and as you can see we now have a nice
blue glow around our planet and for our
inner glow usually you just want to
leave this at default say your opacity
to 75 and set your size the about 10
this is going to give you a nice glowing
ring on the inside of your planet so
once you have that click OK and as you
can see now we have a nice glowing
planet now we can either leave it from
there let move this more to the center
now as you can see we can either leave
that behind I want to do a little
something extra so usually what I do is
go to my background and go to filter
render lighting effect now I usually
like to add a spotlight from top left
since remember we shaded in the bottom
right to give it that little how do you
say shadow effect well I like to add a
spotlight so it looks like the lights
coming from the top left now make sure
your intensity is full and the focus is
the one that you can kind of play around
without like my kind of wide I'm going
to leave mine intensity 100 focus 78
don't worry about any of these now click
OK and as you can see we night we now
have a nice lighting effect it looks
like there's some light source coming
from the top left and if you want to do
something even extra go up to filter
render
lens flare and you can add these cool
star looking lens flares the 105
millimeter prime is probably the best
one for the Sun or the main lighting
effects so good and add that in the top
left and i'm going to make mine about
115 brightness now go ahead and click OK
now as you can see we have a star light
source and plan it and I'm just going to
go ahead and add filter render lens
flare I'm going to go ahead and add a 50
millimeter ah right about there and this
is just for background star just because
it looks cool so now as you see we now
have a full scale planet effect
