and now that we understand functions and
aggregate functions I want to show you
guys how you are typically going to use
them in a useful manner because if we go
ahead and we look at like the items
table yeah we can go ahead and figure
out the average of all of these or we
can add up all the bids but that isn't
really useful I mean it's kind of a neat
piece of neat piece of information but
that's not something we would actually
use when we were making a website like
eBay what we would typically do is we
would want to find out not the price of
all of the items on the website but
maybe the average price of a single
sellers items or maybe how many items
did I don't know user number eleven have
for sale one two three so let me go
ahead and show you guys how to make
aggregate functions for a single person
or for a single parameter so let's go
ahead and let me think of a real-life
problem say we wanted to figure out how
many items seller number six was selling
and by the way seller ID these are just
like different sellers so let's say that
my ID number is number six and I'm
selling a microwave 48 boxes of frogs in
shampooing which I had someone else fill
these out but I guess I'm selling
shampoo maybe it's the brand shampooing
I don't know but anyways I'm selling
three different items so let's go ahead
and figure out how to calculate that so
select now the next aggregate function I
want to talk to you guys about is called
account what count does is you give a
parameter and that counts all of the
rows in the column for example if you
were just to count the name in from
items it would give you like a hundred
items because that's how many items are
listed on that website
however if you only wanted to count my
items you would add a clause after this
for example where seller underscore ID
equals six so remember my seller ID is
equal to six so this is only
say okay count the number of items where
I am the seller so now if we go ahead
and hit go check it out now it comes up
with that answer three items because
what was i selling oh crap I forgot
already I remember two of them like a
box of frogs in shampoo what was the
other one oh yeah a microwave box of
frogs and shampoo so basically you could
go ahead and count anything you can go
ahead and count the name or count the
cost it doesn't matter what you count
but as long as you have that clause
let's see if I nope copy the wrong thing
so as long as you have that clause count
rows from the items where seller ID
equals six now what if you wanted to say
okay I wonder what the average price of
all of my items are well we can do that
as well select average cost from items
now if we run this it's going to go
ahead and figure out the average cost
for all of the items on the entire
website but I only want to get the
average cost of my items so what we do
is we would add a where clause seller
underscore ID equals six now we go ahead
and run that and check it out the
average price of my items my microwave
box the frogs and my shampoo if you add
them together and get the average it's
around 80 bucks pretty cool huh
so that is you know a more useful piece
of information maybe you wanted to give
everyone their own profile and at the
top you would have their statistics you
would run a query like that and show
their statistics right atop the webpage
so now that I got that taken care of I
want to show you guys one more thing and
that is how to run several aggregate
functions at once now what we can do is
we can just go ahead and run each thing
then put a semicolon at the end run a
query again put a semicolon at the end
but I want to show you guys a shortcut
in order to run several aggregate
functions at once let's go ahead and tie
everything we learn together so far
and let's see let's say we were okay
we know my items already I'm seller ID
number six let's get another good seller
sort by seller ID okay number twelve has
a bunch of items a hairdryer or
Playstation a used car a bikini and an
air conditioner so I'm guessing that
they live in Florida with those things
but anyways that's what we're going to
be a you know running our data on so
first of all let's go ahead and count
all of their items so in order to do
that we can just go ahead and select
count now again since the rows don't
really matter or what column you want to
count because any column it's going to
come up with the same number which is
like five or six whatever it was so I'm
just going to go ahead and hit count all
as item underscore counts now remember
whenever I hit as since we're creating
our own custom columns what we're going
to do is I'm just going to name it item
count and therefore you're later on it's
easier to see what because I'm going to
be doing a bunch of different jobs or
functions and it's easier to see if I
give each one a custom name what
function I ran now
another function I want to talk to you
guys about is Max and min mi M whenever
you run this max it's going to get the
highest value so if you had three
different items one was ten dollars one
is twenty dollars one was thirty dollars
the max would be thirty in the min would
be ten
so again Max is the highest value of
that list and min is the lowest value so
let's figure out which item costs the
most so max cost of course because we're
working with price and we'll just name
this as Max so whenever we see it we'll
just name it as Max that's what I just
said
just wanted to say it twice so now we
already know average let's go ahead and
get the average price of their items
average cost and I'll just name this as
average from items now again if we run
this query right now what it's going to
do is it's going to get it's going to
count all of the items get the maximum
cost
and get the average cost for the entire
website but I only want to figure out
that the item count in the max in the
average price where seller ID equals 12
so that's what I'm going to go ahead and
run this and check it out so again
seller 12 who is will say he's my friend
named Tony he's selling five items his
maximum item is selling for $5,700 that
must have been the bikini and the
average price for his items were
fourteen hundred and twenty-one and
about a quarter so now if we go over in
the items table and verify this we'll
just make sure that the max check it out
a used car for fifty seven hundred
dollars and fifty cents so that is
indeed has maximum priced item so there
you go that is how you can run several
aggregate functions at once again the
easiest way is just to put each on a new
line and then make sure to give it a
nickname or name it add something
because whenever you're figuring it out
later on it's easier to go back and look
oh yeah that's the max or that's the
average so that's your little tip and
there you go so guys take a deep breath
you are done with functions and
aggregate functions thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and I
will see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
