video what I want to do is I want to
introduce you to lib GDX because I'm
going to be making a little mini
tutorial series on how to develop games
for Android with Android studio and this
is the framework that we're going to be
using it's actually a game development
framework and to understand why we even
need to download this and use it we need
to remember that even for making a
really basic game there's a lot that
goes into it
for example even I don't know just look
at this thing right here you have to add
the functionality to add the character
to the screen you probably have some
physics in there you probably have some
collision detection if you bumps in the
stuff maybe some audio so this looks
like the most basic game ever but even a
really simple game has a lot of
different pieces to it now what this
framework is is essentially a tool that
packages all the libraries all the stuff
together and it also takes care of a lot
of the backend stuff the complex stuff
so we don't have to worry about it so
that's why we need this that'll that's
what it's going to do and let me show
you guys how to get started so go to
either this URL or type the libgdx into
google the URL might change but it will
always be the first one that pops up and
click download now we want to choose
download setup app and whenever we do it
it's going to give us a jar file we want
to keep it we trust it and when we
double click it check it out it's going
to give us this right here now this is
essentially a jar file that's going to
help us set up our project now the first
time we set up a project it's going to
take some time because it needs to
download a bunch of different files and
kind of like set everything up with an
Android studio but after that it's going
to be really fast so again make sure
that we get this right so the first
thing the name is just the name of your
game the name of your project I'm just
going to name my Bucky Blaster because
that sounds sweet now the package of
course we learn whenever we were just
making regular apps it's your
website and reverse domain notation so
mine is the new Boston dot Bucky blaster
now the game class is just the name loop
class of course we can just leave that
at default the destination is where do
you want this project or your game to um
you know just be stored and I'm just
going to store mine where I put all of
my desktop Android projects and I
already made a folder and this is just
an empty folder let me show you guys
this so what I did already before this
top Android projects see this is the
folder I made it's just a blank folder
nothing in it and this is just where I
want to on my computer save the project
so I'm going to browse through that
again where was it just the Android
projects in this folder right here and
the last thing you need to give it is
your android sdk URL because it's going
to use your android sdk pretty much to
set everything up behind the scenes so
how do you get that the easiest way is
this if you open up Android studio you
go to configure from here you can go to
project defaults project structure and
this pops up the URL so copy this the
first one is the one you need the
Android SDK ctrl C the bottom one is the
JDK we don't need to worry about that
and also back out of here I anyways once
we have the URL for that we can paste it
right there now under here sub projects
with this what you can do is you can
actually develop cross platform so you
can write your code and you can run this
game on desktop or iOS for like iPhones
iPads even just web games but I only
want to concentrate on making android
games in this little mini series the
extensions these are just the different
pieces I'll stop
you guys about some of them but for
right now I want to keep things really
simple so if you click generate and you
have to agree is saying a warning
different version just click yes you're
going to have another one yes and that
there would be one more but I guess
that's it now what's going to happen is
it's going to start pretty much building
your project for you and again the very
first time it's going to download a
bunch of stuff that you need and it may
take a few seconds but once you're done
it's going to give you this little
indicator right here build successful
done and some instructions on how to get
started opening your project so what I
wanted to do is show you guys that so
from here now that everything is
essentially set up for us if we go to
import non-android studio project then
we can navigate to wherever we told it
to be saved mine was in my desktop
Android projects and remember I put
everything in a folder called Bucky
blaster so I'm just going to click OK
and it's gonna pretty much open it in
Android studio now again this is gonna
take some time so I'm going to pause my
screen recorder and I'm going to come
back in a few minutes alright so once
it's done setting everything up what
it's going to do is essentially build
you a very simple default basic project
and if you run it I actually already ran
it because the emulator is slow and I
didn't want to make you guys wait you
should get something like this which is
pretty much just a red screen red
background and their little own offices
are logo their little graphic in the
bottom left so if you see this you are
good to go ready to move on to the next
step
if you had any problems with anything
then please ask me in my forum a lot of
people are willing to help but for now
thanks for watching and I'll see you
