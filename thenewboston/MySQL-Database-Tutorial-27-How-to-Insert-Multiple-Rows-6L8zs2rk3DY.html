27th MySQL tutorial in I don't even know
what I'm going to teach in this tutorial
I think I'm just going to wing it but in
the last tutorial what we did is we left
off with inserting this row of data now
whenever we did we explicitly told it
that we want to insert an ID a name and
a cost but we didn't give it any values
for the seller ID in bits now by default
there are some times when you cannot
give it a value and it's going to go
ahead and just insert the default value
which was in this case 0 now the default
value for numerical numbers not the
other kind of numbers the numerical
numbers the default value for numbers is
0 in whenever you have strings of text
or characters like this that might be a
better way if I just highlight the
column name instead whenever you have
text the default value is null it's
going to say n you ll and it basically
means nothing whenever you see the word
no it means nothing empty void space
nada
so again the default values for numbers
is 0 in the default for text is not
however some tables will not allow you
to insert no or no value some tables are
going to explicitly say that you have to
insert a value for every single column
and if you don't you're going to get
error message so just be prepared for
that you know in the last story I showed
you guys how to insert only some columns
just be prepared that depending on how
you create your table you have to or not
have to insert all the values and I'll
teach you guys about that whenever I
show you guys how to create tables in
like two or three tutorials but for now
is I just want to warn you guys so heads
up so what I want to teach you guys in
this tutorial is how to insert multiple
rows of data so what you can do is you
can just go ahead and type a bunch of
insert into values and you know just
make a bunch of those statements and
insert them row by row by row or you can
do all in one query and I'm going to
show you guys how to do that right now
so go ahead and hit insert into
say hit a lot whenever I say hit I
usually mean type answer into items and
of course we want to do it the proper
way so ID name might as well insert
everything cost seller underscore ID and
bids now after this go ahead and type
the word values just like before now how
I like to do it is I like to type the
word values right here and whenever I'm
working with multiple rows of data I
like to put each row on a new line so on
the first line again what do we have one
two three four five five items in each
row or five pieces of information for
each row or each item one two actually
I'm going to use one two okay calm down
take a deep breath one two three four
five now again after every piece of
information you need a comma after every
row basically so I'm going to add I
don't know let's just say three rows for
this tutorial and my mouse isn't working
there we go
so that and this one now remember after
the last row you don't add a comma
people do this a lot and if you do
you're going to get error message so for
the first piece of information again I
think we left off at 103 we inserted
like beef on a stick or something so
this is 104 and I'm going to sell some
beef whoa take it easy caps locks I'm
going to order or excuse me sell some
beef chops my favorite kind of chops and
I'm going to sell these for $7.99 my
seller ID is one and bids equals zero
now my next item is 105 of course and
I'm going to sell some jelly pockets my
favorite kind of pockets and these are
450 each and again one for seller ID
that's Bucky Roberts and zero now for
the last thing that I'm going to sell
it's 106 and what do I want to sell they
go out sack of ham
and I'm going to sell this for 995 quite
the deal with gas me and my seller ID
and number of bits so as you can see
basically the rules are quite similar to
what you would expect you go ahead and
write insert into and then you write the
order and number of columns basically
how do you want to insert your data so
whenever you type values each of these
is a new row of data again how do you
insert data well however you defined it
up here now just remember after each row
there's a comma except after the last
one if you're programming this in PHP or
something there would be a semicolon
right here but since you're just writing
this in phpMyAdmin you can just leave it
out so now let me go ahead and hit go
and well looking pretty good so we can
go ahead and verify this if we just
click on the items table do a little
browse or by ID descending and come on
baby no whammy no whammy there we go so
there's my nice beef chops jelly pockets
in the sack ham by the way if anyone
wants it quite the deal and no bids so
that is how you insert multiple rows of
data again I like to take each row and
put it on a new line it just makes it a
little bit easier now I want you guys
about one last thing when it comes to
inserting data to be honest this is one
of those things that I don't even know
if I should show you because it's
usually a waste of space but it's
information that may come in handy one
day
so you can also insert items into a
database or a table rather using a
select statement now let me give you an
example of when you would do this say
that I don't know say that you had a
website and you just spot out eBay
because you know your website is pretty
successful now you want to merge your
websites together so you have all these
items in your table but they have all
their items in that table so are you
saying that we're going to have to hire
some guy to go through and physically
type like a thousand or two thousand
insert statements no what you can do is
you can insert data into a table from a
simple select statement now again I only
have one table items here but pretend
that we have
have a different table setup with the
exact same structure named more items
and it just had a bunch of other items
so what you would do is something like
this insert into items and you would of
course write how you would want to
insert them ID name cost seller ID and
bids and now instead of writing values
which you would have to explicitly type
each piece of information row by row you
can just use a select statement so
select ID name cost seller underscore ID
and bids from more items now this more
items table is just a fake table so
oxygen in a fake table so again if you
had another table then what this would
do is it would select all of the rows
from that table and it would insert them
into your items table in this order
right here so again remember whenever
you're doing this is probably better to
use a where Clause because if you don't
use where clause then it's going to
select every single row now again I
don't have a fake table but this is how
you would do that basically take all the
rows from another table and insert them
into a single table so I guess it's good
if you're merging tables but otherwise
why do I say that this is not a good
idea because at first glance it might
seem quite useful well it's not a good
practice because then you're going to
have the information on this table and
this table and as we know one of the
rules in MySQL whenever you have
duplicate information it's usually a
waste of space so guys please this is
your warning so basically um that's it
that's a tutorial you may use this
whenever you maybe you're making a new
table with your high-priced items or
your new items that you want to appear
on your homepage but generally stay away
from it that's my warning so anyways
thank you guys for watching and yeah
don't forget subscribe and me on Google+
all that good stuff send me a million
dollars on my website and I'll see you
in the next video in the next video
we're going to be talking about updates
see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
