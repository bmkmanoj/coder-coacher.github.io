lesson of creating a number object I
feel that it is time to move on to
string objects now much more interesting
type of objects but don't throw number
objects I said that so let's go ahead
and in order to create a string object
we need NS string class and from that
class you go ahead and you know assign
it whatever object name you want I'm
gonna name my first string s because I'm
very creative and then in order to
create a numbers objects go ahead and
press equal the @ sign and to double
quotation marks so anything you type in
here like cats my keyboard shake and
hold on me cats don't like C bananas I
guess there's skip a chocolate I know
how to spell chocolate though do I even
know how to spell banana be a na na s
there we go thinking Quinn stefani for
that and let's go ahead and type any
string and you also for the purpose of
this tutorial and as string you're gonna
want another string and tester but don't
set this to equal to anything else yet
we're just going to need this later on
so what's the most basic thing we can do
with a string object well NS log that
stuff as always and check this out you
know how like percent eyes to prune out
integers and percent F this print out
floats well percent at sign is to print
out any type of object so let's go ahead
and print out a string object right
there so check this out cats don't like
bananas be any anti anti yes so anyways
this goes ahead and prints out a string
object now I said percent a that can
print out any type of object like even
uh don't a done number objects is so let
me go ahead number NS number let's go
ahead and put like start just name n or
something easy and now I'm go ahead and
make a number object or real quick
number
number with integer and let's go ahead
and put 120 right in there because I
mean why not so now let's go ahead and
just copy this paste that crap below it
and everything move when I copy it like
that and now go ahead and print out on
number our object so as you can see cats
like bananas 120 we got a fine-looking
program going on but anyways the point
I'm trying to demonstrate is you're not
only limited to bringing out one type of
object percent a means you can prune out
any type of object you could possibly
imagine so go ahead and delete that
because we don't need any more we're
here to talk about shrinks that was just
a little example so let's go ahead and I
might as well show you some of the cool
methods that you can do with shrinks so
at let's go ahead and get rid of that
the first thing that you can do is
there's a method to calculate the length
of a string now this is probably one of
the most common one so length of string
is percent i and as that integer
variable just go ahead and type your
string and call method called length on
it now the cool thing length is a
built-in method so check this out length
of a string is 22 and the cool thing
about this I mean it's not really that
cool but whenever you're calculating the
length of a string space is counting as
well so check this out one two three
four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12
13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 BAM
so that's just to explain that space is
count as well so now what do we want to
do is call another method that is pretty
common and this is where that tester
came in handy so remember this tester is
a string object it's not equal to
anything what we want to do is copy the
contents of string s into tester so the
formula got the formula the method for
this is NS string a method from NS
string class and its string with
string replace a string with string and
replace s and now you take s and copy it
into tester so now we're gonna have two
identical strengths pretty much so NS
log that stuff app and just go ahead and
put like copied string is percent a
tester and let's go ahead and see if we
messed up oh no we didn't copy each
string is cats don't like banana so that
is how you get a copy using the string
with string and what that means is
replace this string with the contents in
this string whoever came up with that
name is very clever but they made it
super long than idiots so anyways the
last method I want to teach you and
again I'm just teaching you some really
common methods there's like a million
not literally probably a couple hundred
but I'm just teaching you the most
common ones let's go ahead and take that
test or method I mean test our string
and let's go ahead and set it equal to
the old string but upper case the string
so what tester is going to be equal to
is this string S which is cats don't
like bananas upper case
pretty cool huh so now let's go ahead
and NS log that stuff and set it equal
to like upper case is percent a and then
just print out tester again so build and
run that and check this out upper cases
cats don't like bananas you use a
computer program so I mean what I want
to do is just introduce you to the
basics of string and some of the methods
that you can calling them again there's
also a lot of methods about like you can
compare tester to s and see which one is
less than greater than if they're equal
to each other I mean that takes way too
many if statements it's like that but I
mean these are pretty much the most
common methods that we're going to be
using if I build a computer program
later on where I'm going to need another
mess
um then I'll explain that one as the
time allows say that so uh the cool
thing about this is that each of these
strings once you set it equal to
something I mean you can't really change
it the only way you can change it is
explicitly set it equal something else
and these are called
I forgot what they're called like unmute
Abul or something anyways you can't
change these strings
you can't like take the word case out
and make it a new string so we learn how
to make unmute Abul strings but there's
also mutable strings that means
changeable strings and I know this may
be confusing right now but that's
probably where we're going to be going
over in the next tutorial it's a whole
different type of string and yeah it's a
whole lot more dynamic string so you
know I guess enough talking about in
this tutorial we'll wait for that for
the next story so thank you guys for
watching if you want any of this code
gonna copy it put it in my forum link
below so I think you one last time to
good subscribe and I'll see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
