in this jquery toriel i'm gonna
introduce you guys to the newly newly
released jquery user interface 1.8 this
was released I believe about a week ago
and the cool thing about jQuery user
interface is that it provides you with a
huge array of these great user interface
tools that are so easy to implement into
your website there are some basic things
that you have to understand about jQuery
which we sort of went over a little bit
in the first two tutorials but the best
way to learn something is to actually
get down and just start doing it and
sometimes people can talk about it and
people can show you how to do it but you
really can't learn until you do it
yourself
so I'm sort of gonna introduce you to
jQuery user interface I'm gonna show you
how to download it I'm going to show you
how to create your own themes and then
I'm gonna sort of let you dive in so
we're discover it for yourself so I'm
just going to point you in the right
direction and after I show you how to
download it and I'll show you what it's
all about I'm gonna go through and
detail all the custom components that
are inside jQuery user interface so to
get started I went to jQuery comm and up
here at the top you see a link to jQuery
UI go ahead and click on that and
there's some stuff you can read here
about jQuery UI there's a lot of stuff
you can read here actually but right now
I'm gonna show you what jQuery UI has to
offer
I'll show you to the demos and
documentation link right here you see
there's interactions widgets and effects
and you can see there's these draggable
drop but there's just a lot of different
options of things you can do and I'm not
gonna run you through all of them right
now but I am gonna say that they're
really cool so go ahead and click on
themes as well and I'm going to click on
gallery right here and now you can see
what's what some of these these are I'm
going to call them widgets what they
look like and you can see things like
accordion and tabs and if you remember
in the earlier Dreamweaver cs4 tutorials
we were going over Adobe's version of
spry assets and a lot of the stuff they
had looks similar to this but this is a
much more updated cleaner
quicker faster version well it isn't a
version of Adobe Sprite but it has a lot
of the same things in it and it also has
some new things that are completely
different and I think better and cleaner
and much more document and then the
Adobe spy stuff but anyway as you can
see over here to the left we have all
these different themes and you can click
on them and you can see that as soon as
you click on them it's gonna change the
colors and the theme of these individual
pieces of the jQuery user interface and
what's cool about jQuery UI is that all
of these pre-configured themes are ready
for you to download right now it's it's
as easy as finding which one you want
and when you go to the download page
which I'm about to show you all you have
to do is select it from a drop-down menu
and then you extract it you extract the
zip folder into your web page and voila
is right there for you so
now that I've introduced you to the
gallery to the themes I'm gonna let you
explore them I'm gonna let you check
them out there are a lot to view and you
can also create your own you can that
mean there is a ton of options here and
I'll let you run through those and we
will go through go through these later
in more detail but as you can see I mean
you would just have complete
customization over how you want your
your widgets to look so let's get to it
let's go ahead and download let's go
ahead and download these these pieces of
jQuery UI and I'm gonna go ahead and I'm
just gonna go with the UI lightness
theme so up here at the top I'm gonna
click on download and as you can see it
pops up with some options here like
there's all these different components
and they're all selected and basically
all these different components are
individual pieces of the jQuery UI that
you can select yourself you can select
all of them you can select a few of them
I guess it really depends on what you
need but since we're gonna go through
and we're gonna check out each one of
these components individually in this
jquery series i'm gonna go ahead and
download each and every one of them and
that is what the default is for when you
click on the download all of them are
selected you can see that here 30 of 30
selected so over here to our right this
is the drop-down menu i was talking
about you see all these different themes
that were created for us already and i'm
just gonna go ahead and stick to the one
that they have as the default which is
UI lightness and there are some advanced
theme settings here we're not gonna
worry about that right now we're gonna
download version 1.8 because that is the
newest version and
you see that it is for jQuery 1.4 plus
and in the past tutorials the jQuery
version we downloaded was one point four
point two so we're good to go
so I'm gonna click on download and I'm
gonna save this and you can see that is
completed the download I'm gonna double
click on that and I'm gonna select all
other components inside of this folder
I'm gonna copy them and then I'm gonna
go to my local host I'm gonna go to the
web folder which that is where my local
host is inside the www root and you can
see I've already created this jQuery UI
folder and so inside the jQuery UI
folder is where I'm gonna paste all the
stuff that I just copied and this might
take a second you can see this 3.27 Meg
which is considerably large but with
with all the components that we get it's
it's not that bad
all right perfect
so since this is just an introduction to
jQuery UI I'm gonna go ahead and have a
look at what this page looks like and
you can see it looks sort of similar to
the stuff that we are inspecting on the
themes you can see these these widgets
and these pieces not all of them some of
them are on the example page that comes
with the download and you can see how
the thing that we created is displayed
and so now that you have been exposed to
jQuery UI I have a feeling that you're
you know you're seeing this stuff and
you're like wow you know I didn't even
realize all this stuff was out there for
free for me to go download and for me to
check out and use for free so that's
that's the beauty of open source
software that is that is why I'm an
advocate of open source software and why
I really love companies that choose to
allow people to come and develop and use
their stuff for free because it's a
great product so that wraps up this
tutorial in the following tutorials
we're gonna go ahead and check out all
these different components and we're
gonna look a little bit deeper into
creating our own theme and hopefully you
guys are excited and pointing around and
looking at all these things being like
wow I really didn't notice and I could
do all this and in the next tutorials
we're really gonna dive into jQuery UI
and at the same time we're gonna learn
jQuery we're gonna learn how to
manipulate all these different things
and how to use them on a on a day to day
basis so I will see you guys in the next
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
