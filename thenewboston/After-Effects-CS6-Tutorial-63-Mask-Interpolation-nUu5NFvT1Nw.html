Blackbird I'm going to be going over
mask interpolation in After Effects cs6
with you for this tutorial and basically
what I'm talking about is when a shape
changes into another shape so I made a
circle here and I changed it so it goes
into like a flying saucer looking shape
and as you see I mean it kind of gets
like gross looking when and not very
nice looking when it transforms it just
like turns into like a blob it's not
very nice-looking and everything like
that so I'm going to show you how to fix
this to make it a little bit nicer and
tell you about the different parts are
different properties in the on the way I
guess so the way you need to do it is
come up to window and we need to click
on mask interpolation now yours is
probably going to start at whatever you
keep key frame rate is which is probably
24 it's going to have linear vertex
paths checked and then this is probably
going to be at like 9 so these are
probably your default settings and we'll
start from there and I'm just going to
select these two keyframes because these
are the ones that it's interpolating
between and hit apply and we can just
look and see what happens
added keyframes on the mask path and a
whole bunch of vertexes and here it goes
this is what it does so let me click off
so you can see a little better I mean
it's still not perfect you can see down
here we got a part going in and a part
coming out which makes no sense and this
is coming in and this is coming in so we
want to make it look nicer also it's got
a whole bunch of points maybe we don't
want that many points so
I'll show you how to fix that so I'm
going to hit control Z to go back and
we're going to we're going to change the
key frame rate and that's how many key
frames per second it's going to have in
between so we only have a couple options
so I just let it go down to 15 because I
didn't feel like it neat this one needed
a lot of key frames in between now down
here on use linear vertex paths you can
check that if you're going from like a
square into like a Pentagon or something
like that where all the the lines are
linear and they don't have Bezier
handles that aren't curved or anything
like that but uncheck that to get more
fluid organic motions now the bending
resistance is how fluid it is during the
transition so the lower the bending
resistance the more fluid the higher the
more rigid it is the quality is a how
like is how nice you want it to look
like the edges and everything while it's
transforming the add mask path of
vertices vertices I guess that's how you
say it allows you to add extra points in
between and it'll it'll make the
interpolation a lot more smooth so
usually you want to have that checked
because that's the main reason why we're
going to use this we're going to add
vertices vertices in there to make the
interpolation more smooth pixels between
vertices right here if you lower it
you're going to have a lot more points
if you increase it you're going to have
a lot less points so I felt for this one
we didn't need a whole bunch of points
so I put that to 15 matching method you
pretty much just want to keep that on
doh and then use one to one vertex
matches you don't really ever want to
have that checked the first vertices
match you want to always have that
checked because using which vertices you
start from is a pretty crucial if you
create if you create your interpolation
and it's all like messed up and it looks
all bad so you might want to change
which which a vertices start from and
that is you can right-click click off
let me click on a point and you right
click and you go to Mass shape and path
and you can hit set first vertex and it
will change it so that's kind of like
when you start drawing your motion path
it's going to start from there as you
can see it changes how it how it works
it's a totally different transformation
than the last one so I'm going to keep
it on the top because that's where we're
working with before
and it rotates around and kinda looks
cool so let's uh let's hit apply and
we'll see how let's look at this first
and this is how it started like a blob
and everything now I'll hit apply I
actually got two selected two keyframes
first and then hit apply now let's check
and see what it looks like I mean it
looks a lot more fluid and nicer click
off I'm going to hide this real quick
and then we'll do a ram preview and just
look at how it worked
so I mean that looks a lot more nicer I
mean more nicer isn't a very
grammatically correct correct word I
mean stumbling with my words right now
but it's okay you guys get the idea this
is how mask interpolation works use it
to smooth out your shapes when you're
transforming them into other shapes
that's the main reason that I use it so
hopefully you guys learned how to use
this and you can use it in whatever
you're doing next I look forward to
seeing you in the next tutorial have a
good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
