Robertson welcome to your very first
tutorial in chemistry now I know there's
probably a cute little girl in college
out there thinking um
Bucky your voice is so sexy there might
be some chemistry between us well cue
college girl I'm sure you're right
however that's not the kind of chemistry
we're talking about today in these
tutorials we're going to be talking
about this kind of chemistry the study
of the composition and properties of
matter and the changes it undergoes like
what the heck is matter never even heard
of that before
well here's my definition chemistry is
basically the study of stuff now what
does that mean in everyday terms it's
basically figuring out whenever we take
something and break it apart what is it
made of what stuff is make makes of that
stuff and how can we combine two things
to make more interesting things so we
pretty much take stuff break it apart
see what's inside it and then once we
find the ingredients we use those
ingredients to make other stuff so
you're like alright it sounds pretty
interesting but I'm not entirely sold
yet well here's a couple cool things
that you can do with chemistry you can
make medicine for example say that there
is a disease that is going around like
the new black plague or something and no
one can find a cure for it what they
would need to do is a bunch of chemists
would need to get together and you know
find this new awesome chemical and
develop this new medicine that can fight
that disease so you know if you're into
that you can do that
another thing is developing new types of
fuels because this is what they're
working on right now you know the fuel
and gas that we put in our car is like
dirty and it releases a bunch of harmful
byproducts into the environment they're
trying to develop a new type of fuel now
that is clean doesn't hurt the
environment at all it's also more
efficient than gasoline or oil whatever
diesel whatever the heck you run your
vehicle on so hey if you want to go
ahead and do that you can go ahead and
do that but what I am interested is in
this one solving the mysteries of the
universe that's why I studied studied
chemistry because I had a bunch of
questions about the universe and in
these tutorials we're going
answer mall if you have any questions
about the universe where we came from
what's going to happen all this crap oh
yeah that's we're going to be getting
into some deep crap
so get ready so on the subject of the
universe there are two main things in
the universe and I say two main things
there are only two things in the
universe there's matter and there's
energy now the definition of matter is a
substance or material
you're like a K and matter energy what
the heck does this mean what matter
means in everyday is turn and I'm pretty
much going to take what chemistry books
tell you and explain it to you in terms
that you can understand matter is all
the stuff that you can touch and feel
it's just stuff you can put your hands
on and even some of the stuff you can't
for example your book is matter your hat
is matter you are matter touch your
computer it's made up of matter it's any
material that you can touch and it's
even stuff like oxygen and carbon
dioxide all that is matter to so it's
basically anything that you would think
of as a thing now the only exception to
that is this little bugger right here
and this is energy now we separate
matter and energy because like you can
study matter in a way that you can look
at it and it has properties but energy
is like a whole different beast so we're
getting into that later on and that's
why I define it is well little kids gets
when they drink soda and that should be
good but what little kids gets that's
like something a little kid would say so
I'm not fixing that typo at that so let
me go ahead now and talk to you about
the three different kinds of matter and
if we want it technical then they're
actually more than three different kinds
of matter there's actually a fourth one
called plasma but we'll worry about that
later
so matter comes in three main types the
first one is a solid now solids have a
definite shape and a definite volume and
what I mean by this is if you have
something like a piece of ice you can go
ahead and you can see the shape of it
and it doesn't change unless it melts of
course and that's something different
and it also has a volume a set volume in
volume
you just means how much space does it
take up now the particles in solid if
you look at a monitor microscope they're
packed - really tight together and jam
together and that's why when you pick up
a solid it doesn't flow it doesn't move
around it's like it stays still it's not
like a gas or a liquid where it can move
around all those particles are
jam-packed and stuck together now a
liquid on the other hand it's defined as
well this is in definition but here are
some properties no definite shape but a
definite volume for instance an example
of a liquid would be water now what do I
mean by no definite shape a definite
volume if you had a cup of water it
would take up a cup the same area no
matter what shape it was in for example
if it was in a tall skinny glass or a
short fat glass like a plate or
something if you dumped it on the floor
it would be a different shape but it
would take up the same area in the
universe it would take up a 1 cup no
matter what so anyways the particles in
liquids or they aren't jam-packed is
tightly as a solid they're like kind of
clumped together still kind of connected
in a way but they have room to flow so
you know it's solids are jam-packed and
liquids are kind of clumped together but
they kind of got some wiggle room now
gas on the other hand the particles and
gas they're just all over the place
they're like a bunch of kindergartner
kids left you know wild roaming around
the school they just kind of all spread
out do their own thing gas has no
definite shape or no definite volume an
example of a gas would be steam whenever
you boil water it converts to a gas in
that gas is called steam so again like I
said the particles in gases are all
buzzing around crazy in the air right
now there's a bunch of oxygen and some
other gases and it doesn't have a shape
and you can't like measure the volume of
it so maybe it'll be easier if I show
you this picture right here now this is
a picture of a solid is in this beaker a
liquid is in this one let's call this
this looks like what's blue
a blueberry pie no no this is like a
rock I guess and this is some kool-aid
and this is some let's say oxygen in
this one so in this rock if we look at
all the little particles and if you
can't see this change your video
resolution on YouTube to a 720 in
fullscreen and you should be good if you
look at all these little particles
they're all jam-packed together and they
can't move much so that's why this solid
it doesn't flow like water or gas now
water if we look at these particles
they're still kind of packed together
but they're kind of connected it's like
kind of they have room to wiggle so
that's why liquid can change shape
because the particles can kind of slide
and slip around now this gas however it
has no shape and no volume it's going to
take the shape of whatever container you
put it into it's just going to spread
out wild so these particles are just
zipping around the air like I'm going to
do my own thing do whatever the heck I
want so they're all like kind of going
crazy so that's how particles if you
look at these things under a microscope
this is what you would see in solids are
all jammed packed together in liquids
they're like kind of cool easy flow and
kind of clump together but kind of not
and gas is just like wild crazy kids
Scheffer do you remember the show wild
and crazy kids I want to go watch it
right now so on that note I'm going to
pause the video and I'm going to go on
youtube and watch some wild and crazy
kids but anyways thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
