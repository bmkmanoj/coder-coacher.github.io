Photoshop tutorial last time we talked
about basic brush settings and this time
I want to be talking about the modes
that you can use with your different
brushes now of course the one that we
talked about before is the normal mode
and this is for just basic painting and
drawing when you have a blank canvas of
an image and the next mode I want to
talk about is the dissolve mode
well this brush does is give you
scattered pixels along the image
the next mode I want to talk about is
the multiply mode the ones we skipped
have to deal with using layers in since
we don't know what those are yet they
won't really be very useful right now
but the multiply and screened mode are
very similar they both combine the
foreground color and whatever color
we're using for the pixels to make a
whole new color as you can see since
raising red they come up red with the
colors of the fish to produce a new
color on the image
now what the lighten color does is use
the foreground color to lightly overlay
the pixels as you can see not only does
it ripples but also produces a light
shade of light we're using in this case
red the next mode I want to talk about
is the overlay mode now the overlay mode
has several modes underneath it in the
same category what the overlay mode does
is enhance contrast and saturation and
as you can see the different modes the
more intense they are is they move down
so as you see the most intense how my
contrast series and how much saturation
of color that it actually brings out now
the last mode I want to talk to you
about before we get into the basics
right here is the luminosity now what
this does is illuminate or darken the
pixels when you use either the black or
white paints it just makes your image
darker or lighter you usually want to
use this when you're using a very light
opacity and of course the last ones the
basics ones I want to talk to you about
is hue saturation and color hue of
course affects the you saturation as you
can be it bring up more of the natural
colors image in color is the same as the
color replacement tool that we talked
about in the last tutorial dresser
places the color with a light shade of
your foreground color
and these will make a lot more sense
when we actually begin to use them in
projects and they kind of look like they
all do the same thing now but once you
start using them you'll see that there
are a lot different and very useful so
now that we cover it all of the basic
modes in the next subject we're going to
be talking about the paint bucket and
gradient tool and if you missed anything
or want to review what we went over
today you can go to my website the new
Boston comm and I'll give you a
step-by-step tutorial of everything we
went over thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
