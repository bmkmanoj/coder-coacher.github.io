tutorials where I'm going to try to make
your life a little bit easier so the
first thing I want to show you guys is
how to add these little icons to your
quick launch a lot of you guys see these
icons but never really knew how to add
or delete them from your quick launch so
here's how you do that um go ahead and
find any program that you want to add
and it's really easy all you got to do
is right click it and press add to quick
launch and there you go it's it'll be
added to your quick launch so if you're
really lazy and don't want to scroll
through your whole menu that's what you
do another thing that people keep asking
me in on my channel is how do i check
what processor and ram i have this is
even easier than the last thing like if
you're upgrading or something and want
to see how much ram you got in your
computer just click on your Start menu
and go to my computer right click it and
click properties this is going to tell
you what processor and ram you have
right now I have a 2.83 quad-core and
four gigs of ram so this this is what
that means one other thing that people
keep asking is how to check their IP
address so to do this open a web browser
and go to I p chicken com this is going
to pop up your IP address I really don't
want to show you guys mine because I
don't trust you guys pretty much so if
you want to try to hack your
ex-girlfriends myspace page then this is
a good start another thing that you guys
might find useful is how to clear all
these recent items if you have a friend
coming over in you have a bunch of
pictures of your naked uncle's in your
recent items and you don't know how to
get rid of it here's what you do right
click recent items and click clear
recent items lists again this right
click button is saving us a whole lot of
trouble so that's all you need to do to
clear this list once you clear that
there will be
nothing in here and a couple more things
i wanna i guess i'll tell you guys um if
you wanna if I'm vista or vista you
always have a little thing that pops up
on the bottom right-hand side of your
screen that says hey you don't have a
firewall or hey you don't have virus
protection or spyware protection all
right maybe we know we don't have it but
we don't need you telling us every five
seconds so if you want visit a shut up
and quit telling you here's what you do
open your star panel and we're on your
run bar click security or not click type
it in security sensor then press enter
and go ahead and press change the way
security center alerts me then say don't
notify me and don't display the icon and
pretty much leave me alone it's not
recommended by vista but it's
recommended by me so if you don't want
to be annoyed click that will save you a
whole bunch of trouble so what I'm here
to do in the last thing I want to show
you guys how to do is a speed up your
computer using or optimizing all of your
processor speed so to do this again
let's open our trusty start menu and
type in power options and press ENTER
now by default I believe your power
saver is clicked or balanced one of
these two what you want to click is high
performance by default Vista only lets
you use fifty percent of your processor
this is a so it'll save on power and
also be so your processor won't overheat
or anything like that but what you want
to do is click on high performance as
you can see it's a little waste a lot of
energy but it gives you a ton of
performance so if you want your computer
to perform awesome and speed up your
computer and destroy the environment all
in one fell swoop this is what you need
to do click this so now that I tight you
guys how to do all that stuff hopefully
your life on your computer is a
little less annoying so make sure to
subscribe to my channel thank you for
watching and I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
