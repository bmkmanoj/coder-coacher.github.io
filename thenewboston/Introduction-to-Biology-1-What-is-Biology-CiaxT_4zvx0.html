may have noticed my older videos are
gone but don't worry I'm in the process
of remaking them and they're going to be
better than ever I've decided to start
over with a general intro to biology
which is what this lecture is going or
scuse me which this video is going to be
about for those of you who haven't seen
biology before you might not understand
everything that I'm going to talk about
now but I promise I'm going to explain
everything in my later videos so just
stay tuned in this video I'm going to
tell you what biology is why it's
important and I'm going to give you a
couple of examples of different branches
of biological study biology is basically
the study of life it's the study of
nature things that have lived in the
past things that are living now flowers
dinosaurs you can see here fish animals
anything you can think of that's alive
that's what biology is the study of
biology dates back to the start of
mankind millions of years ago people
have always been curious about what's
around them they want to understand the
animals that are around them the plants
that are around them and how these
animals and plants act and how these
animals and plants could benefit mankind
but the systematic study began in Greece
about 2,500 years ago there are many
many many different branches of biology
many different things you can study this
is just a really really short list we
start off with botany which is the study
of plants zoology the study of animals
anatomy is the study of observable body
structure you've got bones teeth and
leaves petals stems anything like that
plants animals anything you can see and
observe physiology is the study of the
functions of body structures and systems
what do bones do what do teeth do what
do leaves do how to how do they cert
what purpose do they serve
there's embryology which is the study of
embryo development in plants and animals
Jen
headaches is the study of inheritance
and variance and organisms for example
some people have blue eyes but some
people have green eyes ecology is the
study of an environmental relationship
between plants and animals animals and
animals plants and plants the study of
how organisms interact with each other
within the environment and we also have
taxonomy which is naming and
classification of organisms modern
biology is based on several theories I'm
going to talk about the four big ones
that I know of we start off with cell
theory and it is the notion that all
cells come from pre-existing cells and
organisms are composed of one or more
cells and the cell is defined as the
basic unit of life I know this might not
make sense to everyone but like I said I
will explain everything in a lot more
detail in later lectures the second
theory is the theory of evolution by
what's called natural selection this
just means only the strong survive only
the strong reproduce and pass their
genetic information on to future
generations the third theory is called
the gene theory it evolves what is
called the central dogma which is DNA to
RNA to proteins information contained in
the DNA gene which are called genes
these genes are copied from DNA and
transformed into something that's called
RNA and then eventually RNA is read to
form proteins which are the building
blocks of our cells and everything up
the last theory is the theory of theory
of homeostasis this is the maintenance
of the conditions under which the
organism can function this includes
temperature pH ion balance like I said I
know you might not understand all of
that if this is your first time but I
will explain it soon now I'm sure a lot
of you are thinking why is biology
important why do I need to know all this
stuff well there are many many many
reasons why why it's important
for example agriculture people have been
using biology thousands of years to
figure out how to make plants and
animals that will produce more food drug
development a lot of our antibiotics and
pharmaceutical amount of molecules drugs
all of that come from plants come from
other microorganisms mom bacteria fungi
things like that infectious diseases are
also called by caused by microorganism
and without this study of biology
without studying these things we would
have no idea how to cure them or how to
kill them or how they cause the
infections that they caused but in the
end all of this is related to human and
animal health and basically how to
improve the lives of humans and their
surroundings but that's all I have for
my introduction I hope you enjoyed it in
my next video I will be covering the
theory of evolution and naming systems
and classification</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
