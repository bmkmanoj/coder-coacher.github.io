welcome to your fourth tutorial on Adobe
Premiere Pro now in this tutorial we're
going to be going over something called
the timeline which is an extremely
important part of Premiere Pro so what
the timeline is is is pretty much a
visual representation of your movie so
yeah we go ahead we pop a DVD in and we
see how everything looks nice but
someone needs to put that all together
someone needs to slice up all those
cliffs put a title exactly where they
want it to be and that's what the
timeline is so before we even get
started we need to import some footage
and I'm also going to import a picture
so let's go ahead and hit file import
and this is how you get footage from
your computer to the program so you can
either click one file and hit open and
it's going to import that one file or if
you hold down ctrl you can select
multiple files so I'm going to go ahead
and import 36 and I don't know 112 just
two random ones and hit open and it
imports both the files now I want to
mention this the very first time you
import a file I already edited these in
other podcasts so my computer already
recognizes them but it may say
conforming on the bottom right corner
right here and there's going to be a
little progress bar make sure you wait
for that progress bar to complete or
else you might get some mistakes
whenever you try to save your final
video so a lot of people have that
problem they don't wait for it to
conform and I just want to mention
please wait for it to conform there now
that I'm done with my little Spiro let's
go ahead and import something else so I
want to import that main picture that I
used as a title so let me see if I can
find that in my downloads it's the only
thing I downloaded so go ahead and open
this and it's going to import all of
this crap into the project panel so now
you're saying all right Bucky how do I
get this crap from the project panel to
my main movie well what we need to do is
we need to go ahead and select one of
these clips and by holding the icon and
dragging it go ahead and drag it on your
timeline now what the timeline is is
it's basically a visual representation
and of your movie so you're saying all
right so right here would be 16 seconds
right here would be 32 seconds 48 and so
on so right now our entire movie looks
like it's about two and a half minutes
long pretty cool but what we notice is
our rate this movie isn't starting at
the very beginning and it isn't starting
it starts like three seconds in so what
we need to do is click this clip and
drag it over so it starts at the very
beginning and now we can see that all
right we do have some footage popping up
so basically in order to move these
Clips around just go ahead and drag them
left and right or if you want to drag
them on other tracks which I'll be
talking about in a little bit you can do
that by dragging up and down but you
usually want to make sure that you start
at the very beginning so make sure you
bump that all the way to left so as soon
as the movie starts playing your video
starts playing if you had it like this
then your movie would play for like 16
seconds and it would just be black and
no sound for 16 seconds before any of
your Clips popped up so go ahead and
bump that all the way to the left and
now we'll give you a tour of this
timeline so the very first thing we
notice is this thing right here this is
called the time display this pretty much
says all right at this point in time
that's where you're working and if you
want to change the point in time say you
wanted to add a title around 15 seconds
you would go ahead and move this blue
thing with a red line coming out of it
kind of reminds me of a spay lien you
know what I say spanning alien spaceship
with a laser beam shooting down from it
move it to around 15 seconds and then I
would go and drop a title on track 2 so
now my video plays for 15 seconds and
then the title appears and then it plays
it again so basically I just want to say
if you want to go to a different point
of time in your video clip you can move
it around with this and this time
display just pretty much displace where
in your video you're looking at so
another thing I want to mention is that
these tracks video 1 2 3 are pretty much
like layers you can only see what's on
top so now if you can see
at 12 seconds I'm displaying this clip
right here because if you zoom down to
my laser that's the very first thing it
hits but now when I look at this picture
it seems down and it hits this picture
so that's why since this picture is
laying on top of the video that it can't
see the video so if we were to play the
movie it would show the clip in the
video and excuse me it'd show the video
clip and then the picture would cover it
up for about 10 seconds and then start
playing the clip again and that's why so
make sure whenever you're arranging your
video clips to keep in mind whatever is
on top is the thing that's going to be
displayed and if anything is underneath
it then it's going to be hidden
just like transparencies in high school
so aside from the time display and the
current time indicator I want to talk
about this thing this is the viewing
area bar and this pretty much is saying
alright it's pretty much the zoom so you
can zoom in two different ways you can
scroll with this viewing area bar which
I hate or zoom in and out using this
little slider at the bottom there this
is the way I always oome this is the way
I recommend doing things
so always oome with this thing now this
other bar right here again I already
know what I'm guessing you already know
this is the time like two oh eight means
two minutes and eight seconds into your
movie I don't really need to go over
that but this bar right here you may be
a little confused about see this bar
that you can kind of move around and has
these white little angle brackets next
to it this is called the work area bar
in 99% of the time don't ever touch this
because it automatically fits perfectly
with your movie but for some reason you
want your final movie to be shorter than
your actual editing you would move this
so it's shorter or longer but I just
wanna if you're getting like a movie
that's a minute longer than it should be
that means you accidentally hit this
that's why I wanted to point that out
so aside from that what's next these
little buttons right here probably the
only one you'll ever use is a snap
button now what the snap button does is
say you wanted to add this title in your
movie so what you would do is you
to add it right at eight seconds so you
would move your current time indicator
to eight seconds and check this out
whenever you're dragging this if you
have that snap button selected at admin
automatically pops to that line just
like that however if you don't have it
selected check it out it doesn't pop to
that line so it may be kind of hard okay
so is it right oh nope right there no
not quite okay right there I don't know
so that's why I typically like to have
snap-on because it pops right to your
line and it's going to make editing a
whole lot easier so that's what snap
does another thing is if you ever want
to temporarily hide a track for example
you're saying alright I have my title on
top of this video right here but I
really want to see what's going on in
the video right here so I did I don't
want to remove it completely permanently
but I just want to hide it temporarily
what you can do is you can select this
track and click this hide eye button and
it's called taco track output and
temporarily it hides it so even though
the title stare there you can pretty
much see through it so when the eye is
up there it's normal and when it's
hidden then there you go
so aside from the hai track you can also
do that with audio and you're saying
alright how can you see and not see
audio it pretty much mutes the track or
unmutes it sort of saying alright
this track is annoying I don't want it I
don't want to delete it but you know I
don't want to listen to it right now
and go ahead and click that little
speaker and it'll mute it whenever
you're editing so aside from that you
can also collapse and expand the tracks
by using this little arrow maybe you
have a bunch of video tracks and you
know you don't want a big mumbo-jumbo
like this so you might want to go ahead
and collapse everything or you might
just want to go ahead and collapse the
audio and expand video maybe you find
that easier to work with you know it's
really up to you now you're saying all
right so I have this video clip right
here and I have this title and then I'm
going to go ahead and bring in this
video clip eventually but alright what
if I need like another title what if I
needed another track in order to add
another track what you would do is you
would go ahead and right
click here and you would hit add tracks
and that's where you can add all your
tracks because I don't know typically
whenever I'm doing my podcasts I have
one on my camera one on her camera in
the titles and stuff so I typically only
work with three but if you're making a
real big movie and you want more that's
how you do it so now we have about eight
seconds in the title pops up and then it
goes back to my camera for a little bit
and then let me move this so it goes to
her camera so there we go that's like
our mini movie that we just created so
let me go ahead and play this entire
thing we can play this in two different
ways whenever we want to preview our
final movie we can go ahead and hit this
play button right here and we can stop
it or a nice little shortcut and this is
a whole lot easier is you can just hit
the spacebar so let me go ahead and hit
the spacebar and we can watch our final
movie for like the next 30 seconds I'll
narrate to our I'm like saying oh I'm so
awesome I'm so awesome hey want to see a
cool title that I popped up oh there it
is there's my cool title I popped up and
okay enough of that okay now back to me
talking back to me talking and what do
you got to say about this and that pops
over to her oh I gotta say this and that
and this and there so there you go
there's our final movie I actually heard
the audio that you guys probably
couldn't hear so it was kind of
mumbo-jumbo rambling but anyways there
you go there's a quick overview of the
timeline hopefully you understand all
these widgets and gadgets through now
again a couple of these things like I
don't know toggle sync lock in tako
track lock you can understand them later
when we talk about locks and um I don't
we really don't use it that often so I
really don't want to throw everything at
you but hopefully you got a better
understanding of the timeline now and
you can at least make a makeshift movie
now so for now thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and I
will see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
