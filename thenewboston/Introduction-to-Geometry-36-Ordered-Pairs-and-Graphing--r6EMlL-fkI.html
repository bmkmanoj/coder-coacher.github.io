this is called an ordered pair and it's
you've got an x coordinate and a
y-coordinate and this is how they're
written X Y this point right here is 0 0
is called the orange origin that's where
the two set of axes x the x axis and the
y axis meet at 0 0 so first we're going
to do some practice graphing so remember
this is X comma Y so this is the x axis
this is the y-axis so we we're at zero X
so we stay here and we move up so we're
here on the on the y-axis and we're
going to go up three so one two three
this is our first point the next one is
over two we have an x coordinate of
positive to a y coordinate of negative
two so that's our second point three we
go over 1 2 3 up one and then negative
one down one
point for so when we write the equation
of a horizontal line it's just y equals
a number and for the vertical line its x
equals a number so we're going to write
the equations for this month for these
lines this is line one and this is line
two and don't forget that these lines
right here these are just the axes so
this is a horizontal line so we're going
to write it with x equals and this
number right here is whatever number x
equals so x equals to this horizontal
line because it's horizontal it's y
equals and y equals the number that why
hits every time so negative three so the
last thing we're going to talk about our
points of intersection so it's where two
lines meet the two places they have in
common it's the one place that two lines
have in common so this is point a and we
want to name the point using a ordered
pair so to get to a I'm going to go to
on the x-axis so my x coordinate is 2
and I have to go up to for my
y-coordinate 4b I have to go over to so
if I have to go left this is negative 2
and up to
and Percy I have to go over to to the
left and down two and notice how since
this is a y equals a number the wise
were the same and this was x equals a
number so for these two the exes were
the same so that was just a quick review
of graphing it's going to help us for
our next video where we're going to talk
about the distance formula</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
