video I want to talk to you a little bit
about something that happens behind the
scenes
whenever sea actually makes a program
and strings specifically and it's called
the string Terminator so it's actually
not as cool as it sounds but it is
pretty cool and I'll show you guys what
I'm talking about right now I'm just
gonna type Bucky Roberts right here and
of course we know that this is a string
now whenever sea makes your program and
compiles it and runs it what it actually
does is it needs to know where the end
of the string is and this is just for
memory management it's not really
important but what it does is it adds a
special character to the end of your
string called a string Terminator so
what this is is it's basically just a
special symbol and of course we don't
actually print this out or the user
actually never sees it but it is there -
just tell see this is the end of the
string the next piece of memory is you
can like store something else in there
now why I'm mentioning this you're like
alright why even telling me because the
user never sees it we don't have to put
it in there manually so what's the point
well the reason I mention this is
because uhm whenever you're doing stuff
like calculating the length of strings
or calculating how much memory you're
gonna have to set aside to store a
string you need to include that as well
so in order to determine the length of
strings it's every single character and
this whitespace every single piece of
whitespace actually counts as the
character - and you have to add that
shirring terminator so let's see how
many how much memory we would need for
this string 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
13 so it has 13 characters including the
whitespace and we would need 14 bytes
and of course that one extra one is for
the string terminator so if you ever see
that little issue um or if you're like
seeing how many bytes to shrink hook up
and it is kind of off that's why now now
that you understand that I want to
mention something else that might be
kind of
using whenever you create a string like
this you're actually not creating one
big chunk of memory you're actually
creating something called
an array now an array is it's pretty
much just a list of items of the same
data type in what I mean is you can have
a list of integers like eight twenty
thirty four you can have a list of
characters like ABCDE
and what this string is is this actually
a character array so what the computer
sees is just a list of characters it
sees a B and then you and then a CKY
space so on and so forth and this is
actually important because we can do
pretty cool things with array so oh uh
let me go ahead and create a simple
program now and I'll show you guys how
to actually create an array um it's
different than um the strings we've been
using before
so anytime you want to create an array
you first need to tell see what type of
data you're going to use so of course
with a string it's a list of characters
in that CH a R and C so the next thing
you need to do is you need to give a
name pretty much like you name variables
you needed a name your array and I'm
just going to store my name Bucky your
Robert so I'm gonna name mine name now
um right after this go ahead and press
those brackets that are next to the P on
your keyboard or at least there next to
the P on mine and in between these
brackets we need to tell it how many
bytes this string is gonna take up now
remember my name Bucky Roberts with the
space included it's 13 characters
however we need to set aside some space
for the string Terminator look string
Terminator at the end so I'm gonna put
14 right there so basically we said
we're gonna create a list of characters
it's gonna be called name and it's going
to hold 14 or pretty much set aside 14
bytes of memory for this and then just
like a variable we'll set it equal to
Bucky Roberts and of course everything
ends with the semicolon so now what we
can do is pretty much just print this
out like graph
and of course what are we gonna put my
name is I just put yeah keep it simple
percent yes and I'll put that on a new
line now after this of course like I
said just go ahead and type name and
when you run this hopefully it says my
name is Bucky Roberts pretty sweet all
right so why the heck would they make
this um like this programming language
where you need to make a list why didn't
they just put string name equals Bucky
Roberts wouldn't it be easier well the
cool thing about this is because is
pretty much that you can do a lot of
things or a lot more things with an
array or a list of items and lemon guys
let me show you guys what I'm talking
about right now so first of all I want
to show you guys how to access an
individual item or element as they're
called in your array</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
