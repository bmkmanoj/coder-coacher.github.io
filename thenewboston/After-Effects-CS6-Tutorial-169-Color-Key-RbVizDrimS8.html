Blackford here with another after
effects 6 6 tutorial and what we're
gonna go over today is color keying in
After Effects and we're going to use the
effect called color key when you have
some video footage in your in your comp
here you can if I watch this I can see
that it moves around a lot
now what I want to do first is kind of
suppress the amount of green screen that
we actually have to key out by creating
a mask around this object that we're
keying out so what I'm gonna do is I'll
just come out to where I think it's like
it points out the farthest like it goes
out pretty far right here and then I'll
make up a mask and this is called a
garbage mask so I got this shape here
now I've cut out the amount of green
screen that I actually had the key out
now if I need to I can animate the mask
path may open it up animate the mask
path if the gun actually moves out of
the mask path there or out of the
garbage matte there
and it looks like it no comes close so
it looks like we're probably good for
this now if you want to you can animate
the points to follow this a little bit
more but I mean that you're gonna have
to key out this part anyways for this
section here so it doesn't really matter
so what we're gonna do now is apply our
key and we can apply it right to the
footage if you want go effect keying
and then let's go to color key and we've
got our key color here and all we need
to do is take our dropper and click on
the dropper here and we want to select
this green and I like to select it
pretty close to pretty close to the
actual object so we selected it there
now all we need to do is move this color
tolerance button here and it starts
eating away at the green and once we get
it to a decent amount here so we've got
it to a pretty decent amount and if we
go in and look there's still some on the
edges we've got this edge thin over here
that we can use to increase our to
decrease it on the edges so if I put one
in it'll bring it down that much and
maybe two so
at 2:00 it starts eating a little bit
into the gun but we noticed that it's a
little more prevalent over here in this
so maybe we can try to take our dropper
and drop on this color so we got that
and then increase Oh
I clicked on the wrong thing it looks
like
well let's just increase our color
tolerance a little more and oh there we
go
now there we go it's a in the arm a
little bit if there's a little bit of
green left on the edge that's fine for
now because the next effect that we're
gonna add on will suppress the edges
there and go into your effects and
presets over here and type in spill and
spill suppressor will come up it's under
keen so the same place that we got the
color key we can get this bill
suppressor just drag that over onto our
layer and if we zoom in to the edges
here we can see there's still some green
and we've got a decent amount of green
on this so let's pick our green again by
using the dropper tool come over here
we'll pick this green and it's changed
it to like a little kind of like a black
now if we move the suppression here we
can change how much green is actually in
so it kind of changes the green - what's
all along the edges so I mean up higher
is probably better so let's try maybe
150 you can go all the way up to 200 and
that's it if you try to use this slider
the slider only goes to 100 so that's
just use from 0 to 200 I don't know if
you can go beyond no you can't so it's 0
to 200 so now we've got something that's
been Quito and kind of looks fairly
decent the actual color key here it's
not the best thing to use
well it's quick and it's easy I'll go
over this edge feather real quick I have
never used edge feather when I'm trying
to key because it just doesn't look good
but you can do that
throughout the edges sometimes companies
will do that are like studios will do
that if they're on like a cheap budget
and the client doesn't like care too
much about it also sometimes when year
king it eats away like at the edge of
the at the edge of the object there and
maybe you can throw like a little bit of
a feather on there to like smooth it out
just a little bit or if you can even do
point five you know you can't so that I
mean you can use it for that so we've
got this heat out it's ready to throw
onto a background through 1 &amp;amp; 2 so if I
go a layer new solid and just add any
type of background we'll make it like
some kind of red or whatever below now
it's going to be over top now if we go
ahead and look at our alpha channel here
and turn off the red we can see that
we've created an alpha channel with the
color key there so that's how that color
keying works and that's really quick
using the basic color key effect in
After Effects and then there's other
kinds of color keying methods and After
Effects that are a little bit better
this key light right here is really nice
and I use that most of the time when I'm
clicking and I'll go over that in
another tutorial
so thanks for watching this one
everybody have a good one
we'll see you on the next Keane tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
