slash on live gamer for the new boss Tim
and in this tutorial we're going to be
taking a look at coercion now basically
what this means is let's say you have a
sub or a function and you want the user
to be able to pass either an integer or
a double to it now you could make two
functions one that and uses an integer
and one that uses a double and have a
different name for each of them but that
can get a little confusing later on so
what you want to do in this situation is
use what's called coercion now let's go
ahead and make a little demo application
for this so we'll go ahead and select
windows forms application and we will
call it coercion and go ahead and click
OK so we'll wait for that to load and
once that loads we'll go ahead and open
up our toolbox and add a button to it
now I'll set the text value of this to
coercion demo and we'll set the name to
button coercion okay so now we're going
to do is we're going to just make this a
little bit bigger and we'll double click
on our button and this will open up the
code that handles the click event of
button coercion so now what we're going
to do is we're going to create a sub
down here so we'll start off by creating
private sub and then we'll just call it
show data type and for the arguments
we'll type by Val num as integer and
we'll go ahead and press Enter so now
what we're going to do is we're going to
type message box dot Show
and we'll just type this is an integer
so the user is going to pass an integer
to this sub right here and it's going to
tell them that it's an integer now what
we can do is we can make a copy of this
sub so we'll start off by typing private
sub show data type and instead of using
an integer for our arguments we will
type by Val num as double and we'll go
ahead and hit enter and then we'll type
message box dot show this is a double
okay so now we have two copies of the
same sub and one handles an integer and
another handles a double so what we can
do is we can come up here and we will
create a variable so we'll declare my
num as double and we'll set it equal to
23.4 and now I'll do is we'll type show
data type and for the argument of that
we're going to pass my num to it so now
if we go ahead and run this you can see
that form 1 opens up and here's our
button and if we go ahead and click on
coercion demo it's going to say this is
a double now let's go back here and make
this an integer and we'll set it equal
to 23 and if we run this again and click
coercion demo it says this is an integer
so basically what we did here is we
created two subs with the same name but
we have different arguments for it one
has passes a an integer to it and
another passes a double so whenever we
call this sub right here and put a
variable in it or a number
what Visual Basic is going to do for you
is it's going to automatically select
the sub that's going to work best for
what you're given so since this was is
an integer it's going to automatically
select
integer and so this since if we create a
double right here it's going to
automatically select double so you can
make as many of those as you want and go
ahead and practice with some coercion
making multiple copies of one sub or
function and using different data types
in the parameters and then once you got
that down and you're not going to forget
it
go ahead and move on to the next
tutorial and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
