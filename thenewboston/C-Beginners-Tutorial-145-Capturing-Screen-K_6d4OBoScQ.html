forty fifth c-sharp tutorial that I'm
making for the new Boston and in this
tutorial I'm going to be showing you how
to capture an image of your screen so
for this tutorial
all you need is a button and a picture
box once you have those on your form
just go ahead and double click on your
bottom alright so the first thing that
we're gonna want to do is create a new
bitmap and a pit map is basically just a
type of image and we're going to be
using this bitmap to store the image of
our screen capture so I'm going to say a
bitmap I'll just call it D instead of
equal to a new bitmap and this bitmap is
going to call for the width and the
height of basically this drawing or this
bitmap and we want it to be the same
size as our screen so we're gonna be
using the screen class to get that size
so let's say screen dot primary screen
and the primary screen is basically just
the screen that has its passed bar at
the bottom and if you're using multiple
monitors then you only have one monitor
that's displaying this task bar right
here
and then we're going to want to use the
dot operator to access the working area
property and the working area is
basically just everything on your screen
and then again using the dot operator to
access the width property and the width
is basically just the width of your
screen and then we're gonna want to do
the same thing only the height of our
screen not the width so I'm just going
to say dot each here alright so now we
have our bitmap all set up the next
thing we need to do is create new
graphics in order to draw our screen
captures or this day graphics G equals
graphics from image and our image that
we're going to be using is bitmap so
we're just gonna say beep alright so now
when we draw the screen it's going to be
displayed or stored in this be variables
bitmap all right so now to capture a
screen we're going to be using a method
inside of the graphics class we're gonna
say G dot copy from screen and the first
parameter that it calls for is a point
and it says the upper left source and
basically just the point on your
bringing it what you wanted to start
capturing and we wanted to start at the
upper left so zero zero and then we
wanted to capture the entire screen so
just gonna say point dot MD and then
same for the point upper-left
destination and this is basically just
the point in your bitmap at which you
wanted to start copying the image to and
you wanted to start at the beginning the
bitmap so we're just going to say a
point dot and deep for this as well and
then finally the size of our screen that
we wanted to capture basically just the
rectangle that we want it to capture on
our screen so we want to say screen
primary screen for our primary screen
working area for basically the entire
screen and then we're just gonna want to
say dot size since it calls for our size
right here alright so now everything
should be stored in this bitmap right
here so we can just say picture box long
its image is equal to this bitmaps image
they're just going to say picture box
one dot image equals B all right so now
if you go here and click this button we
should get a screen capture of our
screen yep perfect and if I was like
resize this right here and then capture
again then you should see that yeah now
in this picture my form wasn't as big
because I took the screen capture when
my horn is smaller all right so now
another thing that you could do is
basically just repeatedly a screen
capture your screen to give the illusion
that it's a video so you're gonna need
to be using this system dot the writing
namespace right here and then this
basically going to be copying this code
right here into a method that we can
thread so I'm just gonna say void blah
and then paste this down all right so
we're basically just going to create a
new thread I'll just call it tea instead
of equal to a new thread and the method
that we wanted to thread is this flaw
right here sometimes like blah and since
we're not invoking it we don't need to
put the two parentheses after it and now
in order to basically start this thread
we're just going to say P dot start now
the one more thing that we have to
we're just gonna have this basically
being an infinite four loop so that it
just repeats this code over and over
again and the reason that we're going to
be threading it is just so our program
doesn't breathe and we'll actually be
able to see the images that it's
capturing I'm just going to say four and
then put two semicolons in there
basically is putting two semicolons in
there I'll just make it infinite and
then I want all this code are here to be
inside of the for loop so I'm just going
to enclose it in curly braces all right
so now I need e bug here and click the
button it should basically just update
this over and over with our screen is
captured yep if we move it you see it
like shifts the image if I was to like
open one of these right here dialogue
see it shows up in the screen capture as
well in the picture box and it like
moves with it since it's actually
capturing it over and over again so yeah
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
