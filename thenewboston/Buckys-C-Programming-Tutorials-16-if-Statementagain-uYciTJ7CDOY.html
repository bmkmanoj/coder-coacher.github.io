your sixteenth C++ tutorial and in this
lesson I want to talk to you guys about
something called the if statement now
the if statement is basically a simple
way to have your computer program make a
very simple decision so before when we
were programming we built simple
programs and it pretty much just ran
line after line after line of code
without question so that's nice and all
but sometimes you want to have your
computer program make a simple choice
for example you might have some code
that you only want to run sometimes and
you're saying all right why would I even
put it in there if I only want to run it
sometimes well for example if you're
making a website and you had a message
on there that said hello Bucky well you
would only want to show that message
whenever I logged in you wouldn't want
to show it whenever a guy named Tommy
loggin or a girl named Jessica logged in
so you would say if the user is Bucky
then say hello Bucky so you can see that
unlike before when you just built a
program in your granite from top to
bottom now we have different routes
different choices that our computer
program can make and the basic basic
decision that each computer can make is
made using the if statement so the
syntax for the if statement is
incredibly simple you go ahead and type
the keyword if and in between
parentheses right after you're going to
give it a test now go ahead and add
curly brackets and if that test is true
then it's going to run the code whatever
you put in here if it's not true then
it's not going to run the code so you're
going to say all right um the test is is
the user Bucky and the code would be say
hello Bucky on the screen or something
like that so that's basic example but of
course that isn't real code so let's go
ahead and make a real program that
actually works so the basic what people
typically do is they have a variable
first of all so let's go ahead
make int X and set it equal to 10 so now
we have a variable equal to 10 they
might want to test this to see um is
this variable equal to 10 so go ahead
and say if X and now in order to make
these simple tests we use something
called comparison operators and when
you're testing numbers there are six
different ways you can compare numbers I
know you think is equal or not equal but
there's a lot more first of all you can
test is X equal to 10 is X not equal to
10 is X less than 10 greater than 10
less than or equal to or greater than or
equal to let's go ahead and test it
besides something other than 10 so we
know X is equal to 10 if we want to test
if it's the same as 10 we go ahead and
write equal equal 10 and you're saying
all right first of all slow down this
doesn't make sense why would you not
just write if x equals 10 because that
makes sense
well the single equal sign is they
already reserved that for setting a
value equal to the variable so if you
did this right here it would think that
you're trying to set X equal to 10 and
your program is not going to work right
so that's why whenever you're comparing
a variable and value you need that
double equal sign so this means all
right test if X is equal to 10 and if it
is let's just go ahead and give
something stupid C out um OMG IM pritty
that means pregnant and ghetto talk so
let's go ahead and NL and let's go ahead
and run this and see what happens build
and run and on the screen that says OMG
I am
Bragi and why did it do this because we
had a variable X and it was equal to 10
and then we said all right if X is equal
to 10 then go ahead and print this out
on the screen and it was so print it out
but if you had something like if X is
equal to you know 87 now we try and
build and run it you see that our
computer program didn't print it out
because 10 is not equal to 87 so you're
saying all right
I know how to test whether a value is
equal to a variable but what if I want
to test if they're not equal I want to
make sure that these values are not
equal well the sign for that is a
explanation point equal sign this means
all right if X is not equal to 87 print
this out and it's going to print it out
because it's 10 equal to 87 no that
doesn't even make sense so it's going to
go ahead and print that out so that's
why we get oMG I am per Iggy
so aside from that let me go over the
basics less-than and greater-than if X
is less than 87 is 10 less than 87 yes
and by the way whenever we have a test
and that test is true we say true
whenever the test is wrong we say false
so it's 10 less than 87 yes 10 is less
than 87 so we call this test true and
it's since it's true it goes ahead and
prints it out oMG I am praying now let's
go ahead and be like is 10 greater than
87 No
10 is not greater than 87 so that's why
it didn't print it out right there so
aside from that there are two other
simple ones I want to go over with you
guys there is less than or equal to so
if you add something like is 10 less
than 10 and you just had a basic less
time then you try to run it and it
wouldn't work because 10 is not less
than 10 10 is the same as 10 well what
if you want to test the value is less
than or equal to another variable well
we go ahead and we have our variable 10
is it less than 10 nope or is it equal
to 10 yes
so this is indeed going to print out oMG
I am braggy and of course there is
greater than or equal to but I'm not
even going to show you example because
it's pretty self-explanatory what we
have so aside from testing a variable
against a value I just want to tell you
guys that you can go ahead
and test two variables such as 43 so now
we're going to say all right is X arm
greater than or equal to Y aka is 10
greater than or equal to 43 let's go
ahead and go and run that and we see
that 10 is not greater and it's not
equal to 43 so we can test two variables
and we can even test two numbers like is
five greater or equal to three
and we go ahead and run that and we
print out oMG I am pretty but this
testing two values is the least common
thing people I don't want to say always
but I've never seen it where people had
two values in here it's either one
variable or two variables if we go ahead
and we just had this code right here
then it wouldn't make sense just to
forget this whole if statement just like
that unless you don't know how to
compare numbers then you would have a
problem then you shouldn't be watching
this story but for now I just wanted to
talk to you guys about the if statement
and how we can use it to make a basic
decision again technical terms whenever
your test is positive we call that a
true test whenever your test is negative
and it doesn't make sense we call that
false so the code inside the if block is
only going to run when your test is true
as you just saw and again we have two
equal signs for equals explanation point
equals means not equals greater than
less than greater than equal to less
than or equal to so now you are pro with
the if statement so thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
yeah see you next story</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
