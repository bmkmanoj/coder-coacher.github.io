After Effects cs6 tutorial you're
watching the new boston youtube channel
and i'm your host buddy Blackford in
this tutorial that we're gonna work on
we're gonna keep on continuing our color
keys and we're gonna go over a technique
called a linear color key and that's
just an effect that is used in like a
preferred method it's kind of like the
color range color key that I went over
last tutorials so let's go ahead and
check that out
on here I've just got some video footage
of this aka on a ak-47 I think it is
correct me if I'm wrong but I think
that's what it is on a green screen
background that I put a garbage mask
around to just so we don't have to key
out everything so we're gonna start by
adding the effect of linear color key so
let's add that in fact King linear color
key now what we got here is it's going
to show us the different previews here
what it was before and what it is after
so we're gonna keo this color this green
color by using the dropper first and it
works just like the color range where I
can start getting out these this
fuzziness and softness and all that
stuff
by using this matching softness and we
can also add to the different greens
that we want to take out by using the
plus and minus droppers on here so if we
check out our alpha now there's probably
some alpha is still showing through oh
we got most of it there's only a little
bit down there of the green so let's try
to get that out so that's out now and
you see how I did that by going to the
Alpha down here and just finding where
it's black and white so I can see it
better and just taking that out let's go
back to RGB and we still got the green
around the edges that we can try to get
out using tolerance and softness and
things like that so the preferred method
to use this type of keying is to get in
close with the here and then use the
same color key again to put back in
colors that we might have taken out so
let me just try to take out some more
color here take out some more green
so we got that that was pretty nice
some green around the edges here so if
we can get these and that one I took out
too much soom right in there
now we want to come in let me check the
Alpha real quick and see what it looks
like if it's yeah it looks like we took
out some too much so let's just go back
in let's apply the color key linear
color key again King
I'm just right-clicking to bring this up
layer color key and what we do this time
has come down to key operation and we
change it to keep colors and we click on
the colors that we want to bring back in
so like maybe this black maybe that's
not good enough there just try this
there we go that's a little better
just going to our alpha and so it's not
in there very well so let's do this
again
when your color key
and let's try this
no and we want to change it to keep
colors mm-hmm
every time I tried to get the black out
some more this green comes in that's not
what we want they're gonna keep again
turn this off real quick so we can
figure out what we want
see if this works
I'm not bringing in some of that too
much of that Corrine so mm we'll just
keep what we had before with that brown
so we got that going on for us going to
the RGB take a look at it alright we can
toss on our spill suppressor here and
pick the green now we have our
suppressor on there and that all work
out and help out and now we've got some
of a decent key going on here so that's
the how you use the linear color key so
that's pretty nice and it gets the job
done
let's move it around SIF how about
decent on the looks oh yeah there we go
looking fairly good so that that's how
you use the linear color key now when
you're working with your color keys you
want to work on them a little more than
five minutes like I was just doing you
want to put some time and effort into
them and make them really nice and this
you can see that there's some green in
there in his hand that's gonna be hard
to get get out but you should try to do
it and I'll go ahead after this tutorial
after I get done doing the different key
years and show you a technique that we
can use to help out with that so keep on
watching and subscribe if you want to
keep up with the tutorials and see how
we're going to figure out how to refine
these mats and refine these color keys
so see you guys later and keep on
watching good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
