to your 36th UDK tutorial and in this
tutorial we're gonna be talking about
terrain and I apologize if my voice is a
titbit groggy but it's 822 and I just
woke up about mmm I don't know I say 8
o'clock so 22 minutes ago what the heck
did you know that that when you hover
over this thing it shows your desktop
mmm interesting ok cool anyway that uh
distracted me for a little bit but
welcome to your 36 tutorial and like I
said we're gonna be going over terrain
now if you don't know what terrain is
terrain is pretty much like the earth
whenever you create outdoor levels or
huge maps like world Warcraft and Zelda
this is the tool that you're gonna be
using to do that kuri mountains valleys
canyons even just big ole fields so
let's go ahead and jump into that right
now
so you know like I said I think it's
time to start creating turn because our
little buildings in our rooms I mean
those are nice and all but for huge epic
games we're gonna need a lot more land
so in order to create terrain here's
what you need to do first of all go up
the tools and click new terrain so go
ahead and click that and it's gonna give
you a couple options first of all just
always position it at the default unless
you have like another map you want to
work around and the patches is just
think of it like the size for now just
go ahead and put 64 by 64 and go ahead
and click next and then layer setup
we're just gonna keep it at the default
that's what we're gonna be doing most of
the time so click finish and it gives
you this huge wonking talking big old
square now this is your terrain right
here
and in these tutorials we're gonna be
working exclusively in the perspective
view so go ahead and maximize that zoom
out and bam look at our terrain there it
is so that's it that's all you need to
know on terrain now we can move on the
next topic I'm just skinned there's
actually a lot to cover on terrain so
you don't get away that easy
so before we start making mountains and
canyons and you know putting cool trees
and grass on our terrain the
first thing I'm gonna do is add a light
because whenever we're carving out this
terrain right now we're in unlit mode
and whenever we start carving things
away it's gonna be really weird if our
terrain doesn't have any shadows so
let's go ahead and add some shadows by
adding a light and to add a light I'm
gonna go view browser windows actor
classes and I'm gonna go ahead and add a
directional light and remember I
directionally it's kind of like the Sun
I said in my last Sorel so go ahead and
right-click that I mean excuse me
left-click it just select it and then
right-click in the middle and put a
directional light here now I'm gonna go
ahead and pull this light way up right
about there and the first thing I'm
gonna do before I even do anything else
is select my light see it's so small
right here and press f4 and I'm gonna go
ahead and drop down display and bump
this up to 4 right there since we're
gonna be working with a huge map we want
our icon a little bigger so first of all
we don't lose it and second of all
whenever we want to change it we can
just select it a little bit easier so go
ahead and select this again and we're
gonna want to go ahead and select the
rotate and rotate it along either the Y
or the x-axis and the reason we're
rotating this just go ahead and move it
like 15 degrees or something 15 to 20
degrees the reason we're doing this is
because whenever we're making our level
whether it's mountains or canyons or
anything we want to give the sun's a
little bit of an angle because remember
whenever you're outside fishing or
whatever if the sun's directly above you
you have no shadows and what's the point
of having the Sun if we can't have
shadows so give it a titbit of an angle
we can actually rotate it in two
directions if we want and with that
being said our Sun is good to go that's
all we're doing with the Sun so now
let's go ahead and zoom back out and
actually I want to bump this up a bit if
you guys are real good angle to work
with oh yeah right there there we go and
now let's go ahead and start making some
sweet terrain so make sure you're in
unlit mode
excuse me lit mode which we are and go
ahead and hop over to terrain editing
mode it's right under camera mode and
now as soon as you click it you get this
window that pops up with a bunch of
weird buttons and you know whatever the
heck these things are and this crap over
here and we're actually going to be
covering everything while all these
tools and checkboxes are but for now I'm
just gonna tell you guys how to build a
really simple terrain so in this
tutorial I just want to give you guys a
real quick dirty tutorial on how to
build a real basic terrain and then up
comes or else I'm gonna be showing you
guys all the little details about it so
anyways to build a very basic terrain
you're gonna be using this one tool
right here it's paint and right now
we're gonna be working on the height map
now right down here is a bunch of
different layers you can have for your
terrain the first layer that you always
have is your height map and what a
height map is is it's a grayscale map a
black and white map just like a shadow
map or a light map or when we were
working with maps with materials this is
another kind of map
wherever there's white it's gonna be
raised like a mountain wherever it's
black it's gonna be indented like a
canvas so those that's basically where
we're gonna be painting on right now
black and white even though we aren't
gonna see black and white we're gonna
see mountains and canyons that's what a
height map is so you can also make
height maps in like Photoshop or any
paint program and stuff like that but
we're just gonna be doing it in AI the
UDK for now so go ahead and have your
height map selected and go ahead and
check paint right here now right here is
your brush settings the strength of your
brush is if you think of it in real
world how hard you're pressing down on
your brush the radius I probably don't
even need explain these things but it's
basically how wide your brushes so just
go ahead and leave these somewhere in
the middle and the fall-off is the
gradient from the middle being pressed
down the hardest to it fading off on the
edges so it's kind of like fanning out
if you have a big fall off so go ahead
and leave it at somewhere like that for
now and you can go ahead and begin
painting super I'm thinking IRA just go
ahead and left click and
but nothing's really going on and that's
because a left-click remember is the
moves camera the camera around so in
order to paint hold down ctrl on your
keyboard and with controlled held down
you can go ahead and check it out oh
yeah look at that so as you can see if I
hold it in one place that might be a
little easier to see there we're getting
a nice little Ridge and so that's
basically how you paint a hold down ctrl
on your keyboard and left-click with the
mouse so maybe if I do this edge you'll
be a little bit easier to see
pretty cool huh and a nice little tidbit
of information if you hold down ctrl on
your keyboard in a right-click with your
mouse what its gonna do is indent the
map just like this but he's saying
alright Bucky that's nice and all but
first of all what kind of terrain looks
like a bill checkerboard this terrain is
kind of hard to tell what we're working
with you know this gray in purple blocks
so what we need is some nice material
some nice grassy ground covering and
that way we can really easily see what
we're working with so I'm actually gonna
be adding some nice grass and probably
some nice I don't know rocky or pathways
in the next soil but I guess you're
gonna have to watch that one too I you
know see what's going on then so for now
that's the basics of how you paint in
how you create a terrain and also don't
forget to add your Sun because it looks
better in lit mode than unlit mode as
you can see lit hash shadows unlit that
does not so in the next story we're
gonna be adding some grass but for now
that's all you guys get so thank you
guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
