why do I say that like you would be
expecting someone else anyways it's
Bucky and welcome to your 51st
objective-c tutorial in this tutorial we
are finally getting into the good stuff
and yes I'm talking about frameworks now
no matter how hard you think about it a
framework is not the process of building
picture frames so get that out of your
head what a framework is is it's pretty
much the built-in classes and methods
that come pre I guess installed an
objective-c and they're there to make
your programming life easier for example
when we import the foundation framework
the most common built-in method we use
is NSLog to print stuff out that's a
method that we didn't have to make it
came built in but the cool thing is
foundation not only has that method but
it has hundreds more just built in so
again a framework is built in classes
and methods um another framework that
you guys might be familiar with is the
application framework and this has
methods for things like creating menu
menus and toolbars and windows and stuff
and a little point of interest if you
are developing on the Mac you've
probably heard the term cocoa a bunch
cocoa like chocolate
what cocoa is is pretty much the
application and frame foundation
framework so it's pretty much just you
know a bunch of classes that you import
and methods it's nothing special so I
just kind of nickname I guess so you see
we imported this foundation framework
right here and this pretty much imports
a bunch of different methods so it would
be I'm not easier but it would be better
program practice to import only the
classes we need because there this
includes a bunch of different classes or
header files but you know this is a lot
easier and for typing on this little
screen on YouTube I like to only import
one thing so this would be
for now but if you're building a program
you should only import what you need so
let's go ahead and get to the tutorial
now the tutorial is about objects from
these classes so we're gonna be building
number objects but check this out
we built int and floats before and I
spelled float wrong irrelevant but the
thing is these are pretty much data
types we need actual objects these are
not objects you can't call a method on
it like an X X do this method so what we
need to be able to do sometimes is treat
numbers like objects so let's go ahead
and do that right now and I'll show you
have the built in class NS number is the
one you needed to use when creating
objects so I'm gonna make two objects
one named Bucky int and one named Bucky
float and I don't don't name it like
number int because you know we want to
be able to distinctively see what our
object is you know there's nothing built
in objective-c named Bucky I built it I
did it with my own hands and anyways
let's go ahead and we just created
two objects pretty much now let's go
ahead and assign them to something so
let's go ahead take Bucky int and what
we need to do is we need to set it equal
to initialization method built in from
the NS number class and what this pretty
much does is pretty much creates this
object so let's go NS number whoa I
definitely thought that way off NS
number and those this is a class right
here NS number and in this class there
is built-in method to create integer
objects and this is number with integer
right there it already typed it enforced
oh and a bunch of extra craft - thanks
objective-c you're the best so what this
method does is unless you assign a value
to your object so let's go ahead and
sign something simple like a hundred so
now this Bucky in object remember it's
not a variable it's an object with a
starting value of 100 so this is the
method that you need to use and check
this out
what about for this float do you use the
same method no I don't think so so Bucky
float each type of data or each type of
object has own specific method so NS
number whenever you want to create a
flow object that's number with float and
for the float value put like 145 and
remember floats just integer with the
decimal point point like 6 7 or
something like that so now we have an
integer object and a flow object now I
cannot stress this enough these are not
integers these are not variables so
check this out NS log at if we go ahead
and you know + % I and you're like Oh
Bucky in this is just like you know a
regular variable so let's go ahead and
type Bucky in and let's go ahead and run
this and see what we get
check this out we get 101 million in
eighty four thousand seven hundred
thirty six wTF is that that is because
this is an object not an integer so
maybe that made it clear that you know
this is an object that's the objects you
know don't even worry about what that is
but anyways you can't do that now what I
do want to teach you guys is in order to
retrieve that value and store it in an
integer or excuse me an integer variable
here's what you need to do say say we
actually want to store that very value
in an integer called like X so int X of
course and go ahead and take that object
Bucky int and in order to retrieve the
value it has built-in special retrieval
methods so in order to retrieve a value
for a month
um integer object you put into your
value this is also a built-in method we
don't have to create this it's already
built in it's a method specifically
designed to retrieve the value so in
order to take the value of float and
store it in a variable called Y remember
you want to make a float variable not an
integer one or else you're going to get
messed up stuff take your floo object
Bucky flow and the special method for
this is flow value and again these
methods you don't have to memorize them
there's usually a table you can just
look at but uh I'll put this source code
in the link below and if someone can
find the length of that table just put
it in
I just know these by heart so now we can
go ahead and since we retrieve those
values and actually put them in a
variable we can do stuff like this NS
log % I and remember % F for float and
now let's go ahead and x and y so now if
you build and run this save it hopefully
I don't get any errors check it out 100
and a 145 it should it should be 0.67
but this is how your computer stores
numbers we're learning how to fix that
later on but I mean it's close enough so
that's that for this tutorial if you
want any of the source code actually go
get the source code click on the link
below and make sure to sign up for my
forum it's pretty awesome so thank you
guys for watching and any questions or
if anyone has that link please post it
in my forum I'll thank you hundred times
but uh you know we'll be clearing this
up the next tutorials to come and yeah
don't forget subscribe I hope you guys
enjoyed it and I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
