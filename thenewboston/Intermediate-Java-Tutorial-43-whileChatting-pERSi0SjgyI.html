this lesson of course if you guys
couldn't predict I'm going to be coding
this while chatting method now what this
method does is now that we waited for a
connection we're connected to someone in
our streams or pathways to connect to
them and they can connect to us our
setup this is the code that you write
whenever or pretty much this is the code
that's going to be running during your
conversation with them so I'll just put
like um during the ok Wow messing up
already that's freaking great during the
chat conversation so again what we did
is we named this private void while
chatting and this is going to throw an
i/o exception alright so the first thing
we want to do is we want to give a
prompt that says ok you are now
connected you can now start the
conversation so let's go ahead and code
a simple a variable string message
equals you are now connected um I don't
know I guess that's good for now ok it
says you are now connected so now what
we want to do is to display this on the
screen we actually have to call the
method that we didn't create yet send
message and all this does is it sends it
so it displays on the screen message so
now once you're connected and you can
start typing says ok you are now
connected just to prompt on the screen
so the next thing we need to do is we
need to change able to type which is
another method we have to create equal
to true so remember like I told you guys
before right up in our constructor we
disabled the users ability to type set
editable false when they were not
connected to someone else well now
obviously this method is only going to
be called
while chatting when you are connected to
someone else so it would probably a good
idea to you know let the user type or
else this program would be kind of a
waste so what this method is going to do
we're going to create this method in
this method later on but it's going to
allow the user to type stuff into that
text box so now what we need to do is
during the conversation we're going to
be putting everything into a do-while
loop now you guys probably thought that
you never ever would use a do-while loop
but this is one instance where you would
use it use one so you pretty much want
to do something or have a conversation
while pretty much the client wants to
while you both want to so what we're
going to do is we're going to listen for
a message from the client and this is
how you look at strings equal to client
and in as soon as you start the program
and start having a conversation then
this is going to make more sense but
basically if they ever want to you know
stop talking to you for some reason I
don't know maybe you're boring not
interesting then they can send you the
message e n D so if the user types e and
D and sends you that message then the
program is going to stop so basically
you're going to have a conversation with
them and whenever they want to end it
just type en D and then it breaks out of
this loop and it ends the conversation
so first of all let's go ahead and code
the method to have a conversation
because unfortunately it's a little bit
more in-depth than just just this little
comment that says have a conversation
right here we actually need to put this
in a try-catch statement so try and guys
there's only like two line of code so
you know don't think I'm going to do
anything too confusing all right class
not found
exception class not found exception
that's why I freaking hate catch
statements because I usually have typos
in all of them and now I just want to
show a message and hopefully we will
never see this message so show message
and which pull like something I don't
know new line I don't know WTF that user
sent so basically whenever they send us
some information it's going to be an
object which is you know hopefully going
to be a string but if they send some
weird I don't know maybe some weird
object that we can't understand then
it's not going to be able to find the
class it's not going to understand what
that object is and it's not going to be
able to show it as a string but anyways
hopefully we should never see this
unless the user you know tries to hack
us or something
so what we're going to do first is we
want to get whatever message that they
sent in a gap guys like I said 100% of
the time it's going to be string
something like hey dude or like what's
up something like that so they're going
to type something normal into their
stream and the stream we want to treat
it as a string so of course this the
what we want to read from them we're
just going to store in the variable
message and we'll set this equal to a
string and let me go ahead and type this
first then I'll explain it to you guys
input read object there we go already
typed for me so again remember I'll
start from you know the inside and work
my way out the input is the stream or
the socket where they can send stuff to
us where we have things coming in so
again the things that I'm talking about
is their message that they typed so
whenever they send you something what
we're going to do is it views it as an
object such as you know just you know
you can have objects of a bunch of
different classes hopefully their
message is a string
so what we're going to do is basically
read whatever message they typed
whatever message is coming in to us and
you know make sure that it's a string
and then we're going to store it in the
variable message so now this variable
message is hopefully equal to something
like hey Bucky what's up or what are you
doing tonight so now all you have to do
guys easiest thing ever is to show this
or display it to us so so message and
every message it's good if you ever you
know typed on Facebook or something
every message is on a new line so just
go ahead and put new line first and that
will make sure that it's on a new line
and doesn't look like one long message
plus message so again to recap one last
time again we're getting errors because
we didn't I'll create these methods yet
but these methods take like you know
five minutes to create so when you are
chatting or during your chat the first
thing and I have a little typo right now
you are connected the first thing that
you do whenever you know that you're
good to type it's going to say you are
connected so once you're connected to
someone else it's going to run this loop
as long as the user doesn't type end
once they type end then your
conversation is over the program shuts
down but while you're having a
conversation you're going to try to read
the messages from them as soon as it
reads a message from them it's going to
display on your screen on a new line
because every message that you send or
they send should be on a new line now if
they send something stupid or if we mess
something up that you know maybe arm
they're sending an object that we can't
convert to a string for some reason this
little message should pop up says I
don't know WTF that user sent and that
should be a t and hopefully we will
never see this bug again with a try have
to have a catch so you know they're you
but anyways thank you guys for watching
in the next tutorials what we can do is
we need to code one more housekeeping
method called closed crap which is
basically going to shut down arm you
know whenever you disconnect with
someone you have to close down the
streams and the sockets all that
housekeeping stuff and we're going to be
coding the show message and able to type
method
then I think we're able to you know
start this baby up and test it but
anyways thank you guys for watching or
when you subscribe and I'll see you guys
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
