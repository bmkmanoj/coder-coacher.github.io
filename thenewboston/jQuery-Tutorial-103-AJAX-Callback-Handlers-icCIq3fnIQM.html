and this is a video tutorial for the new
Boston now we've already looked at Ajax
and sending data to a page to return an
a specific value from this page and we
did this with using a name in a text
field or some text in a text field we
click load and it returns that data now
what happens if an error occurs and
something can't be processed or for
example the page is not available can't
be found or returns an error now in this
case we need to add a hook onto the end
of our Ajax call here in order to
actually process or catch this error so
what we do is we add a dot and error and
this bear in mind comes after the main
parentheses that Ajax is within and then
we create a function inside of here and
we're going to go ahead and pull that
down a bit
now if there is an error we are going to
alert an error occurred now what's going
to happen here is we're going to change
the name of this file to Page pH which
doesn't exist and therefore we should
return an error so let's go ahead and
refresh and go ahead and type a name in
click load and you'll see that the page
says an error occurred so you might have
seen this happen on sites that use Ajax
you might have seen a pop-up coming up
just saying requests not could not be
completed etc etc etc we do have other
hooks that we can add onto the end of
this as well we can use success and we
can also use complete as well complete
so I'll just talk about what they are
and you know what how they work as
opposed to actually giving an example
complete will always run after the Ajax
you know process has been carried out so
as long as this is complete you may want
to you know you wouldn't you might want
to alert the user or you may want to
courier carry out
another operation once this age Act Ajax
request is complete we also have success
now this is different to complete
complete means that it's run but may
have returned an error but success means
that the operation has completed
successfully the request has completed
successfully so that's the main
difference between complete and success
and we can add these on one after
another we can just append them on to
each other so there we go we could have
perhaps and alert just in here and then
you can go ahead and again append on the
complete callback so that's the
generally what you do with these
depending on your use for them error is
an extremely useful one because
obviously if an error does occur you
want to be able to tell your user as
opposed to them just having you know a
blank page and nothing happening again
successful and complete a useful I'd
probably say that success is more useful
because once this has completed you can
then go ahead and do something so that's
the or rather these are different event
handlers or event callbacks after alger
Ajax requests</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
