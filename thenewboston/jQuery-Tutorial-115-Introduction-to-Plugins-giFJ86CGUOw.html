with a video tutorial for the new Boston
in this video we go we are going to take
a look at jQuery plugins just take a
look at what they are what they can do
how we would search for plugins and some
other information as well that might
help you when you're going and choosing
a plug-in to use now obviously when we
have a normal file for example I just
have index dot PHP open in my browser
we've included jQuery and perhaps an
external script if required however
that's not always necessary obviously
the external script just goes ahead and
make sure we don't need to use any
JavaScript on this page we just include
the file now if you wanted to go ahead
and actually add to the current jQuery
library there's a list of plugins
available on the jQuery comm website so
if we go over to jQuery comm we can go
ahead and click the plugins tab you can
browse here the main page that comes up
is browsing by type however let's just
go ahead to top plugins and take a look
down the list now plugins are
essentially built for the purpose of if
you have some kind of functionality you
need to add to your website however
you're not comfortable with writing it
yourself and you need a quick way to
implement something usually visual into
your script there's a lot of options
available in in the form of plugins so
just looking down this list you can see
a few already we're gonna go over and
we're gonna take a look at the let's
have a look let's find it let's just
come down the page we've got one here
called where was it gone
well I can't find the original one I was
looking for but let's just go for this
one here the rich text HTML editor now
once you've found a plug-in of your
choice go ahead and read the description
in this case this one is still in beta
testing so obviously looking out for
these kinds of things are important now
you love and find the Downloads link or
you can view the the original page that
this is from so it'll be perhaps
someone's personal blog or something and
then you can go ahead and actually
download the plug-in so another way you
can do this is to go ahead and just
perform a simple google search for let's
say jQuery plugins just here we found an
article 30 fantastic new jQuery plugins
37 more shocking jQuery plugins and
these kinds of results often show you
quick demos so they have quick online
demos as well as linking to the original
authors demos as well
these might also not be listed on the
jQuery website so you might find
additional query of jQuery plugins that
have been written by people and just
posted on their own personal website for
example and the other benefit is you'll
get reviews as well so people will be
reviewing this plug-in and giving it a
bit of a rating so they'll probably give
it some kind of rating as well as that
obviously the titles just go to show
that they've collected together a good
and you know a good collection of
plugins to show to the user obviously
they wouldn't be blogging about it if
they weren't very good so plugins can be
implemented into a page once you've
downloaded them as you would jQuery
we've already mentioned that briefly and
you would do it somewhat similar to how
we've done it here but obviously you
would always go ahead and read the
instructions on the user's website or
the plug-in description on jQuery comm
now the majority of the time when
server-side processing is required
PHP will be used because it's such an
available and easy to to write language
so if you are downloading plugins make
sure you check if you have any
additional files there that might use
Ajax requests to PHP documents so make
sure you have a PHP enabled server
before you download these or that we
know used to and make sure you're
comfortable with using this PHP
processing as well obviously there are
other web development languages that can
be used however the majority of the time
PHP is the most popular another thing to
point out is that when you return to say
jQuery com always take a look at the
version number as well we've already
noted that this re-edit are rich text
HTML editor is in beta testing and this
will have beta just here so always check
back just to see if there's an updated
version of a particular plug-in this
might be for security reasons this might
be for functionality reasons it might
even be edited or changed to keep up
with jQuery original library so you
might see new functions appear or if you
use a different version of jQuery a more
updated version you might see the
functionality in the in the plug-in
disappear because something might have
changed so always check back on either
the author's website or jQuery comm
depending where you got this from to
check the latest version now the other
thing is if we will return to our text
editor if you were to go ahead and
install a jQuery plug-in for absolutely
everything for example there are jQuery
plugins that can reference or select a
text area and limit the input of text
and display how many characters are
remaining for example now this is
relatively easy to do with jQuery alone
so a plug-in might not be required if
you tend to add a lot of plugins to your
page you're gonna find it's going to
bloat your document out with lots of
unnecessary code so by implementing too
many plugins you might be slowing down
your script so it's probably better to
only use plugins where
the work can't be done any more quickly
than you'd be able to do it or that
might not work as well so if you're new
to jQuery you probably might feel the
temptation to go ahead and install a
load of plugins and use them from
different parts of the website now apart
from the downsides that I have mentioned
you might get plug-in conflicts as well
depending on how well the plugins are
written so there are many problems to
adding too much JavaScript to a page
you're going to completely decrease the
loading time so only look for plugins
that you wouldn't be able to write
yourself not just saying we wouldn't be
able to write yourself off the top of
your head but try and research different
ways to do things before you go and
install plugins the example I gave we
could create a text area and for example
say you wanted to limit this to a
certain amount of characters this might
be called text over in another file you
might go and write something like text
dot counter for example or countdown and
this might implement some kind of system
to say allow only 200 characters and
countdown as the user starts typing now
we've already looked at a tutorial in
this tutorial series when we can where
we can do this therefore if you create
your own code and go ahead and keep that
up to scratch and keep that working well
you are minimizing Maat well you in some
cases minimizing the amount of codes you
require often plugins come with
unnecessary styling and also if you've
got if you're going to go ahead and
write your own plugins or just include
your own function functionality for
example in an external javascript file
you're also able to style this exactly
as you want you could come over to a
stylesheet and star this exact exactly
as you want not saying that plugins
aren't useful but try to only install
plug-ins where you feel like you
wouldn't be able to do anything that
would produce the same effect so that's
a quick introduction on plugins in the
next couple of videos we're going to be
picking some specific plugins and we're
going to be learning how to install them
just so we can get
to grips with downloading and installing
and implementing plugins so that was a
quick introduction on jQuery plugins</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
