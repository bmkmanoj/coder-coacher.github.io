video and this video is actually going
to be pretty interesting because I want
to talk to you guys about pretty cool
concept that we have to learn about and
see if we want to become an expert
programmer and that's this the truth is
even though we can store like stuff like
strings and characters in variables your
computer never actually stores the
character itself computers can't
understand characters over words or text
like human beings can they have to
convert everything to numbers so in
order to store that character it
actually converts it to a number and
that's how it stores it in its memory so
why am I telling you this you guys don't
care about you know the internal
workings of computers you just want to
learn how to program right well the
reason I'm saying that is because quite
often you're going to come across
something like this in your code say int
tuna and before you know how I don't
know I told you guys that you could set
this equal to 74 and like whatever
number you want it to well you can
actually set in tuna equal to a
character as well such as B so before if
you guys saw this in your code you're
like okay
Bucky told me that this can store
integers like whole numbers so why the
heck are you doing this you're supposed
to set it equal to char you idiot well
this is pretty much explaining what I
just said and another cool thing I
should point out is whenever you're
programming and C you could pretty much
use int and characters interchangeably
almost all of the time so how I got like
a ton of craft to teach you guys I don't
even know where to go from here so the
first thing I want to point out is you
know how I told you guys that include
this file right here well this C type
gives us a bunch of built-in characters
so we can actually test is this a
character or is it a number because your
computer treats everything is a number
in us humans us mere mortals we don't do
that so C gave us some cool ways to test
that that character is actually a letter
or a number so I'll show you guys how to
use those functions right now so again
make sure you have this imported because
I'm going to be using functions from
that file now the first function I want
to tell you about is alpha basically
saying is this character arm does it
belong in the alphabet is it a letter so
we need to pass in tuna because of
course we need to give us something to
test and this is going to return true if
it is indeed a letter in this case it
will return true since B is a letter so
we can just go ahead and print something
out on the screen
and we'll put I don't know something
stupid like percent C is a letter now
just go ahead and print out tuna and
check this out it says B is a letter now
you know how I told you guys that you
could use int and characters
interchangeably well this is another one
of those examples we declared B as an
integer value but then right here we
didn't press percent D we press percent
C which means print a character so those
that is one of those examples where intz
and characters are being used
interchangeably pretty confusing at
first but you guys are going to use
through it so after this I'll show you
guys another cool function and that's
this if is digit
and of course unlike is alpha what this
is going to do is it's going to test if
this is equal to a number so instead of
be in here just write the number like a
nine or something any number that you
want so of course this is no longer
going to be true because nine is not an
alphabetic character is not in the
alphabet so right here will just print
out C is a number so again we can still
use this character symbol right here
even though we declared it as an int so
run this baby and we'll say that nine is
indeed a number now another cool thing
that we can do is check this out just
copy this say we have a character that's
not a number or a letter or anything
like that like I don't know a dollar
sign well then we can use this else
condition to say C is a oh my G wTF is
that you know something simple like that
so if you run this and test the dollar
sign for alphabetic it's not in the
alphabet and it's certainly not a number
then it says dollar sign oMG WTF is that
pretty frickin cool so again right now
you guys are like okay so behind the
scenes it converts everything to integer
but I'm just going to stick with
characters for now however later on you
guys are going to see why this
information is useful and how you can do
cool things other than just test the
super character and print out something
on the screen so again now that you have
that knowledge in your brain um make
sure it stays there because you're going
to need a litter on but for now thank
you guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I'll see you guys next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
