now now represents every every input
field that we have before this checkbox
so every every password field that we
have on our page so now that we've done
that we can use this to obtain the value
of the checkbox so the password that the
user has typed the type of the checkbox
which is important because we need to
switch between text and password type as
I explained at the start of the tutorial
we're replacing these when they need to
grab the name ID and class attributes
from this field in order to actually
retain them and place them back inside
our if our password field when we don't
show the password so let's go ahead and
first of all obtain the value so I'm
going to create a new variable good
value and this is equal to probe dot Val
remember this is the same as writing
this here so essentially I've created
this previous variable just in order to
cut down having to go this pre Val every
single time so I'm just using this
previous value here and it just makes it
a lot cleaner and we're using you know
the same object over and over again okay
so now we want to grab the type of the
field so var type and this is going to
equal prove that attribute so we're
grabbing an attribute from the current
field and that's type now this value is
either going to be a text or password
because we're switching between the two
and we use this to determine the toggle
between the text and the password we're
not really using any jQuery toggle
functionality but we're doing this
ourselves by creating a new type and
switching between the two so this is an
extremely important part of the code so
now we're going to just take some
attributes from the original password
field that may exist and we won't may
want to go ahead and replace back in to
the text field first of all and then the
password field again
so we want to sort of switch these
attributes or keep these attributes when
we switch the type of the field and
because we're not switching the type of
the field we're just replacing it that
means they're all the more important so
I'm gonna say var and name is equal to
again prove dot attribute and this is
just name
we then need an ID we need to obtain the
ID which is the attribute ID and then
lastly the class as well so prefect
attribute class now you may want to go
ahead and extend this list depending on
what values you want to supply in this
password field for example if you wanted
to keep or wanted to use a max length
for example max length 10 inside here
you would have to then go ahead and say
max length equals you know Prevot
attribute and then max length so you'd
want to go ahead and take each each one
that you feel like you might be able to
use so because you're following along
the tutorial you can see how it works
and you can go ahead and modifying this
accordingly so this is extremely
extremely important okay so what I'm
gonna go ahead and do now is just go
ahead and say prove dot remove I'm gonna
leave it at that for now and just go
over to our browser and check what this
is doing so we already know what this is
doing and we've seen the checkbox being
added but once we click the checkbox we
want to remove the previous item and
you'll see how that works in just a
moment so I'm going to click here and
you can see that the input field the
password field has been deleted it's
been removed from our our DOM and the
reason we want to do this is that we
then want to create just our just before
this element here this this checkbox
elleven we want to create a new field
but with the type text using these same
attributes hence moving the attributes
to a different
Elliman so now that we've removed the
the previous object which was the input
field password we want to go ahead and
actually add a new field so we want to
go in ahead and say this dot before and
in here were essentially going to
construct a new field with a different
type and that type will be 'text so
let's go ahead and just outline our
input field as we usually would so input
type equals something and this is going
to be text we then want to go ahead and
replace all of the attributes that we
had like that we've picked up here that
existed in the original password field
because remember that was removed so we
need to really initiate I guess the
attributes so the first one will be
value this is actually extremely
important because we obviously want to
retain the value that the users typed in
in order to display in plain text format
so we can go ahead and append on the
value here so we're just starting this
string here and then appending on the
value and then ending that there we then
want to obviously retain the name of the
field which is more important than not
because the user might have specified a
particular name that they want to go
ahead and pick up in some kind of
back-end script so the name again is
name we just used this variable that we
picked up here then we want to use an
eye well reinitiate an ID as well so
this will be ID and then finally we want
to reinitiate a class or add this
variable back in so we just specify
class in here so quite a long line but
if you're used to concatenate enlarges
you'll understand the need for the plus
sign we're just appending these values
inside the where they should be and now
we're ready to preview the changes now
we're not completely done here because
we need to find a way to actually go
ahead and change this back to a password
field if the checkbox
unticked so at the moment we have this
have the functionality that require that
we require however we can't revert the
field at the moment back to the original
state and that's pretty straightforward
it might not seem like it
straightforward we might seem like we
would have to say duplicate all this
code but we don't so we'll go ahead and
test this out and then we'll go ahead
and do that so I'm going to type a
password in here and I'm gonna go ahead
and click show password now it obviously
like at the start of the tutorial you
could see the functionality and it looks
like we just you know magically shown
the password but what's actually
happened is you know follow a lot of
following this along we've removed the
original field and created a new field
but this time this field here has typed
text instead of typed password but
obviously now we've got the problem that
when we uncheck the plaintext remain</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
