Effects cs6 tutorial in this tutorial
I'm going to show you how to make a 3d
cube out of video footage that you can
move around and rotate around in 3d
space maybe you want to have it drop
down and roll across the ground or
something like that
so we're going to learn how to make that
I want to remind you that my name is
buddy Blackford and you're watching the
new Boston so this project is going to
kind of be like a compilation of the
last few tutorials that I did about 3d
space where we're going to use camera
tools our different views moving around
in 3d space and all that jazz so I
figured that this would be a good way to
create easier to use your new knowledge
to create something that you might want
to use in a project for a client so we
might as well get started now I'm going
to bring in one of the videos that I
have and I'm going to make it a 3d layer
actually actually first off I'm not
going to make it a 3d layer because my
video isn't completely square first I'm
going to scale it down a little bit
now I mean this used to be my old
company that I had as a freelance so
what we did is we took four of us
because each of us alone had a hard time
getting freelance work by ourselves so
we were just starting out out in
California and we needed a way to get
into the industry and make a name for
ourselves freelancing because when you
freelance you make a lot of money but
you don't always have consistent work so
we created a collective where it was
four of us and we said we could do
everything we had an audio guy motion
graphics guy a 3d guy and another guy
that wasn't very helpful at all but he
was there to help pick up some other
help out with like menial tasks and
things like that so let's just start out
enough of my little story there let's
create a use the rectangle tool here
so we can create equal sides on our
video here so drag hold shift and you'll
get your rectangle tool and we're
creating a mask there let's move our
mask to where we want it which is
preferably probably in the center here
oh damn clicked off everything again
hate when that happens I'm just going to
click on this and it's going to have
everything there so that's good enough
so there we have our base right there
we're going to use this layer here by
duplicating it a few times and just
arranging it in 3d views so I'm going to
come here to my four views I have my
active camera here which I'll have
zoomed out like that right which I'm
going to change to my custom view and
where is everything on that I click on
here oh there's the custom view
and I can't see anything right now
because I haven't made it a 3d layer yet
so let's do that and now we can see
everything now you can see that's right
here and right here in the top view I'm
going to zoom out of each my view so I
can see what's going on I mean besides
the custom view I don't need to zoom out
of that I'm going to duplicate this
layer by holding ctrl and pressing D and
I'm going to go into the top view move
it down a little bit now I'm going to
have to rotate this with the orientation
here and I think it's this one right
here to 270 yep I'm going to zoom in
here and I got to get this on perfectly
into the corner so I can make a square
zooming in here we're going to do this
for each side I'm going to click on my
position there we go
and then move the x-axis OOP a little
too far it's going so fast for some
reason let go now looks like it's right
on there right on each other now I want
to go into my custom view here and
switch to my unified camera tool and I
can zoom around and then zoom in to make
sure they're connected and it looks like
they are so we're good there now the
good thing about video footage is it's
on both sides so we don't have to worry
about flipping our layers or anything
like that which makes it a lot easier
now let's switch back to our selection
tool by pressing V that's the hotkey
let's click on this layer and duplicate
it and we're going to move that layer
now over to the other side now just move
on the x-axis because we already have
everything else set up correctly zoom in
move it using the position
click off our mast there because we
don't really need to see it anymore and
when you when you click on it one of
these things down here it does it for
the view that you're in it we can see
the mask and the other in the other
layers or in the other views it looks
good
we're just going to make a square so I
mean we're going to take this layer and
duplicate it and just come down</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
