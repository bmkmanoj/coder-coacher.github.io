tutorial I'm going to show you guys how
to create a custom launcher icon for
your app now by default we're just
giving this Andy the Android looking
icon pretty boring so what we usually
want to do is we want to make a custom
icon that's I don't know some kind of
cool shape or our company's logo
whatever the one that I'm going to use
just for demonstration is this right
here I just made it in Photoshop like
two seconds and whenever you're making
it make sure that it's 512 by 512 that's
the size and also make sure that it's a
ping don't use JPEG or gif or anything
like that
512 by 512 ping and you can make it
transparent it doesn't have to be a big
solid square like this you can have some
transparency and if you look at like the
phone icon these default icons you can
see that they have some see-through
aspect two of them so uh yeah once you
have that hop over to this URL right
here so this is the Android asset studio
and if you don't feel like typing this
in then you can just go to google and
type in Android asset studio it's going
to be the first one that pops up and
this is a really cool tool that anytime
you want to make like any graphics or
icons that your app needs
I recommend this it probably has
anything you're looking for what we want
to do is we want to create a launcher
icon so click launch our icons and look
at this so the first thing that we need
to do is we need to upload our image now
if you're like alright why can't I just
take this image that I created in
Photoshop or whatever and just add it to
my android project well I'm sure a lot
of you guys could probably already guess
this but since Android devices are
different resolutions they need
different sized icons to display so
instead of just creating all of these
sizes manually which would take forever
what we can do here is just select image
and double click our 512 by 512 pin and
as you can see it's going to create all
of the different sizes
that we need and we don't have to worry
about what sizes they are we don't have
to you know worry about naming them this
tool does it all it's awesome now of
course we do have a couple options here
usually you don't really want to change
anything but if you ever want to say
okay said to these rounded corners um
you can select none that gives you a
nice square you can also choose like
bevel circle gives you a perfect circle
icon whatever again these are pretty
much just our all personal preference so
I don't really need to talk about it in
this tutorial but one thing I am going
to recommend is after you select what
you know whatever your default shape you
want to choose choose generate web icon
too so this is going to give you a
higher resolution optional icon and
later on when I talk to you guys about
distributing apps I'm going to show you
guys why you actually want this but for
right now just make sure it generates
that as well and now you can click
download zip so this is going to do is
it's gonna pretty much create all of
these icons at different sizes and it's
going to give you them in a nice little
downloadable folder so double click that
and check this out so this earlier one
is when I was recording five minutes ago
and I learned that my microphone was on
mute so I can just go ahead and delete
that but once you have those downloaded
the first thing you want to do is
extract them all since it is in a zip
folder now and now check them out so
again in all of the subfolders it gives
you a nice little different size for
example in the hdpi this size is 72 by
72 in the xhdpi this size is 96 by 96
whatever but now we need to figure out
okay these are just in my downloads
folder I want to actually add them to
the project so let me do this let me
move this on the right-hand side and
just through Windows Explorer navigate
to reentered project so mine is in test
and again that's just this one that I'm
testing out right now and if you go to
app source main rez you can see okay
these are where I need to stick all my
different size graphics now another
thing I want to point out is that make
sure that you don't name these anything
different you see how their name icy
launcher by default that's the default
name that Android says okay whenever I'm
looking for a launcher icon I'm looking
for the graphic name I see
launcher so again if you name them
something different then you're going to
have to change some settings in the
manifest so just keep the same name I
just want to you know warn you guys so
from here all you have to do is say Co
hdpi hdpi
drag that and override it
go back m mm now another thing I want to
point out people say that you can
actually just copy all of these and
paste them directly into your app
directory however when I do that it
doesn't work out it gives me some errors
so that's why I like to manually just
drag all these in move and replace and
do this for every single one now another
thing I want to point out point out a
bunch of stuff here you see that by
default your android project
it only has hm X and double X however
whenever you download it it it gave you
this Triple X folder as well so what you
can do is you can actually take this
entire thing is just drag it over here
and then it will give you another size
icon that you didn't have before so that
is it ladies and gentlemen we can now
close out of here
and if we build this project let me
pause it and rebuild it so check it out
we now have a custom launcher icon
pretty sweet so yeah that's how you
created that's how you use Android
asses studios and now you're going to
have a custom launcher icon on every
single device so thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and well
I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
