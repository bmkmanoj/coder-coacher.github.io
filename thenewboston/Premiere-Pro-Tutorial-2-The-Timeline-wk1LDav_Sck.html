tutorial in Adobe Premiere Pro and in
this tutorial we are going to be going
over how to move clips on the timeline
and we're actually going to start making
our movie and actually adding a title to
it so let's get started I'm in the last
tutorial we learn how to capture video
so now we have a bunch of clips right
under our project panel but they're not
actually part of a movie yet anything
that we want to make in our movie goes
down here on the timeline and if any
time I'm talking about these panels
timeline or project or program and you
can't see him all you need to do is go
to window and make sure there's a
checkbox biome a check box means they're
on the screen and if they're not checked
then they're not showing up so as you
can see our project panels checked and
that's why we can see the project panel
right here so go ahead up to your
project panel and look at the first clip
that you want to use on your movie and
go ahead and select from the tool list
the selection tool or you can press v
that's what that little V in parentheses
means if you're on another tool and you
want to use that just click V and see it
automatically moves that so go ahead and
click your selection tool and go up to
the first clip that you want to use and
don't click it click it and hold it and
this is also known as dragging it down
into video one now as you can see it
also moves the audio along with it and
if you don't want the audio to move
along with it then I'll show you how to
get rid of that later but for now we do
so we'll just keep it how it is and as
you can see under the program this
little video pops up in this video right
here is the frame that you
working on it was blank before this
program right here is pretty much your
movie whatever is in here that's pretty
much what your movie is and since we had
a bunch of clips for nothing before
nothing showed up but since we have a
clip now we are actually making a movie
so let's go ahead and play this and see
what our movie is just a video Corey
doing a little robot there and it's
going to go through this whole timeline
and play until it comes to the end of
our movie and then it's going to stop
now before we get started and make some
more stuff let's get familiar with the
the definitions or whatever you might
call it in your timeline the lingo right
here this little 8 15 this is the
current time of your movie what this
means it's eight seconds in 15
hundredths of a second into your movie
now if you want to change that then you
want to go over here this little blue a
little pointer with the red line stick
in town is called your current time
indicator this moves to different points
in your movie okay if you see you right
now Corey's kind of grabbing his heart
and if you move it a little over here
then you see a picture of us in the car
well let's go to the very beginning and
this will take us and wherever this is
is where you can like edit your movie
and stuff so since we want to start from
the beginning let's just go right at the
beginning right here these little
triangles next to video one video to
video three so the triangle pointing
down or right or expand or collapse a
trick now if you see this track right
here in your you already edit it and you
don't want to work out anymore or you
don't want to look at it because it's
taking up space just click on that
little arrow and it'll collapse it and
what this says is all right we can't
edit this or work on it anymore or we
don't want to see all the details with
it but if you do want to see all the
details with it then just click it so it
points down and now you can see all
details see right now we're not working
on anything in video 2 so let's go ahead
and click that as you can see it gives
us a little more space to work with now
right down here is something called the
zoom and what this does is allow you to
look at more or less of your timeline as
you can see right now our timeline is
about seven and a half minutes long but
say we want to zoom in on very like from
0 to 30 seconds and we want this whole
timeline be very precise in 0 to 30
seconds all we would have to do is
either click this button right here
which is zoom in and as you can see my
Tom might change it from one minute or
we can zoom in more to 14 seconds zoom
in even more three seconds and then
consumed in real far and this is of
course if you didn't figure out zoom out
let's zoom out all the way as you can
see my timeline is now 13 minutes long
so if you want to work with long clips I
mean long clips then you want to be all
the way zoomed out but if you're working
on a very small clip that's only a few
seconds you probably want to zoom in and
this zoom slider here I don't know why
they added this is pretty much just to
be more precise I guess if you don't
have enough energy to click the button
then you can be lazy in just slide it so
it's really just extra feature Adobe
added just because because it had a lot
of time on their hands but uh that's
pretty much the whole timeline and I'm
these buttons right here this one right
here is set display angle and this one
right here is show keyframes don't even
touch these because they're just going
to make things way more complicated
usually no one ever touches these but
they had to add them just because they
could and just cause someone complain
probably before but leave these just how
they are let me just show you what show
keyframe those actually i'm not even
going to show you with that because it
would just annoy me but uh anyways right
there is a your basics of your time
that's all you need to know for now and
that's all we're going to be working
with so study your timeline I practice
zooming engine mount zooming in and
zooming out and try to try to move some
clips down your timeline like we did
right here and once you get familiar
with that then you can move on to my
next tutorial where we will be working
with the title but thank you very much
