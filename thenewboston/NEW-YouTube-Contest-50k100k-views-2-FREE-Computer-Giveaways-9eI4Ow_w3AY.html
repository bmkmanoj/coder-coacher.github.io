make a video real quick talking to guys
about a couple things the first thing I
want to do is congratulate rock band fan
74 winning my last computer on my
computer giveaway so rock band you
should be receiving the computer and
mail sometime next week and since this
contest went so well I've decided to do
it again with a little different twist I
have a picked up to dell dimension 8200
where i actually ones right here you can
see it on the screen it's on the floor
so you can't see it in other ones right
here i installed ubuntu on it just to
see if it was working and it was
actually I did it to both of them that's
what she said but anyways um this
contest is a two-part contest the first
part is when this video that you're
watching right now it's 50,000 views I'm
going to give away the first computer
tip and I'm going to give it away to the
person who leaves the comment when I see
that it is hit 50,000 views so once it
hits 50,000 views I'm going to look in
the most recent comment just like last
time is the winner and once the video
that you're watching right now hits
100,000 views then I'm going to give
away the second computer so I'm giving
one way when it hits 50,000 views to the
first person who leaves a comment once
it does and I'm going to give the second
one away once a hitch a hundred thousand
once I see that comment and again to be
eligible to win you must be a subscriber
so if you're not already subscribed go
ahead and do that now click that little
yellow button to your right and just
like last time I will pay for shipping
the ship these computers to you if I
choose your comment is the winning
comment and the last thing I want to
talk about um after I picked a winner
from the last contest a lot of people
were complaining and thought that I new
rock band fan 7 well I just want to tell
you guys that I genuinely have never met
him before and just to avoid any
confusion
like that on this tutorial once I see
that the video has hit 50,000 or 100,000
views I'm going to take the camera in my
hand go show you guys open my browser so
I can't have any uh false whatever
whatever you want to call it i'm going
to show you guys meet clicking on this
video and i'm going to show you guys
live which comment i pick its first one
so this way there can't be any arguments
or any discretion or anything like that
so that's what I'm going to do so again
make sure your subscriber and wait for
this video to hit 50,000 on a hundred
thousand views then start comment annoy
and hopefully I choose you so good luck
I hope you win a new computer make sure
to visit my site at the New Boston calm
and thanks for watching and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
