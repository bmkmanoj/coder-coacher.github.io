tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
show you how to do things on a web page
such as enter text into the text box and
click a button so for this tutorial it
might obviously have a web browser two
buttons and a text box and they're gonna
want to have our web browser just
automatically lo yahoo.com is going to
be blog so in order to do that just
select your web browser go over to the
properties panel and set the URL here -
Yahoo da alright so now I'm gonna be bug
it should automatically load yahoo.com
yeah and the first thing that we're
going to be doing is putting text inside
of this text box right here so the first
thing we're gonna have to do is get the
ID of this element so it's gonna right
click on it and click inspect element
then we're just kinda want to get the ID
of this element so the ID of this text
box is P underscore all those numbers or
just going to double click on it and
copy it ctrl C so now we're just going
to double click on our button and we're
just going to have it put the text in
this text box inside of this text box is
search text box on the web page so it's
gonna double click on this button right
here I'm gonna do just like the for web
browser one do the document properly get
element by ID I can get B that we copied
and then we're gonna want to do dot
inner text this look before only instead
of getting it we're gonna be setting it
so we're gonna be setting that inner
text to whatever the user inputs in the
text box so we're going to say the inner
text of this element or the text of this
text box is going to be equal to
whatever text is inside of this text box
so now when we debug here to below the
page load and our
in this text box I'll type in Adam click
this button and text should be now on
this in the step box
yep right on the web guru to change this
to something else like Adam this button
puts it right in there perfect
the next thing we're gonna have it do is
click this button for us so we don't
have to click it we just click this
button and I'll click this button for us
so just like before we're gonna have to
do the ID of the element
all right click on inspect the element
find the ID right here and search submit
double click on it copy it double click
on this button now we're just gonna do a
document if the element by ID I'm gonna
be getting the button paste in the ID
for it and now right here we're gonna
say not invoke member and basically what
this means is it'll just invoke a method
on the webpage we're gonna have it
invoke the click method so we're gonna
type in to click and for all buttons
it's click so if you wanted to have it
click a button you just click really
just in this format capital C and
everything else so now I'm gonna do bug
here type in you want to search for I'll
just say Adam click this button and it
should search or well first read of it
put in a text box now click search and I
should share to the search if it's
searchable and we got a few results all
right so how do we get this click how do
we know that it's click well what you
can do is you can right click on here
inspect this element go over to scripts
and then every search for click you'll
see that there are other methods that
they have right here such as mouse down
double click and stuff like that but
that's not that important you'll mainly
be dealing with clip so that's pretty
much it for this tutorial so see you
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
