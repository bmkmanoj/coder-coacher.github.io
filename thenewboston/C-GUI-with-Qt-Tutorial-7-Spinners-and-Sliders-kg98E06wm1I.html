video and in this video what I'm going
to do is I'm going to start teaching you
guys about layouts in cue and I also
want to show you guys how to sync
widgets' together now this is a pretty
cool technique and what I mean by sync
widgets I pretty much mean connect two
or more widgets so say you have two
completely separate widgets on your
screen um would you say there are two
widgets that displayed a number what I'm
going to show you guys how to do is when
you change one of them the other one
changes alongside it it's a really cool
technique really useful but before we
get started with all that we need to go
ahead and include some crabs so the
first thing I want to include is a Q H
box layout now what this does is I'll
talk about more about this later on but
anytime you want to layout things on
your screen like the widgets how they
appear in your GUI a layout helps you
determine the size and position of the
widgets now of course you can go ahead
and do this in the design mode manually
right here but it's better if we see how
this is done in code because it's going
to give you a little more understanding
and a little more control over your
application so now what I want to do is
include something else and again I'll be
talking about that more when I actually
code it is a cue slider and also a cue
spin box now these are the two main
widgets that we're going to be using now
what a slider is let me think of a
website where I can't think of any
websites right now but you know that you
can grab that little nub and slide it
left and right a Photoshop has this a
lot whenever you're like altering values
or levels or something but you'll see
later on it's pretty much a slider that
you can slide left to right to adjust
the value and a spin box is oh man I
can't it's really hard to explain but
it's a little box with a number in and
it has an up and down arrow and when you
click the up on the value changes by 1
then 2 and 3 and if you click down it
goes to then 1 0 so that's what a spin
box is and that's what a slider is and
what we're going to be doing is linking
these two together and eventually you
no connecting them and syncing them
together where if you change one the
other one changes automatically or
automagically depending on how you say
it so of course I already have the main
framework pretty much the cue
application and the return code right
there anywhere do you know what that
does so now what I want to do is I want
to talk you guys through how this
program is going to be put together even
though I said that we have two main
widgets a slider and a spin box what we
need to do is we need to build another
widget and this other widget that we're
building is going to be basically the
main window now inside this main window
that's where we're going to put our
other two widgets so technically there
are three widgets two inside another one
but right now we pretty much have to
build the container for the other two
widgets so in order to build the
container put cue widget and that's why
I love about cue everything like pops up
automatically so let's go ahead and give
a name main window since this is pretty
much the widget that's going to be the
main window and in order to create a
widget just go ahead and put new cue
widget looks pretty good so now what I
want to do is we have a window that
appears on the screen so now let's just
go ahead and give it a title or uh you
know pretty much the title that appears
at the top of the window so main window
and the function set window title and of
course just like before we'll say that
this program is
how many chicken wings did you see what
I just did I accidentally typed how many
chicken windows I wasn't named that's
kind of weird that my fingers did that
but anyways hmm interesting
but anyways we'll say this program is
for people I don't know maybe we're
making a program for a pizza place where
people can order chicken wings
I don't know freaking first thing that
popped into my head don't hate guys so
this is going to be the main title for
the window now what we want to do is now
that we built the container that the
other widgets can go inside we can go
ahead and start building those other
widgets which is a slider and a spin box
so let's go ahead and build Q spin box
and we'll just name this one spinner
like the spin asagna cow and new Q spin
box so now do the same thing for slider
Q slider and of course might as well
name just slider to you know kind of go
with the flow new Q slider and let's see
if I need to do anything else here okay
now in the constructor whenever you
build a slider object you need to tell
it what type of slider you're going to
use now just so I don't confuse any of
you guys the type of slider we're going
to use is a horizontal slider that
pretty much means it slides um left and
right so horizontal there you go
basically we're not sliding this thing
up and down we're sliding it to the left
and right simple enough that's how you
build a spinner and a slider so now what
we need to do after we build these two
things is we need to set a range of
values because these are basically two
different tools that allows us to change
the value of a number so in order to set
the range of this just go ahead and put
spinner which is two ends not one not
three
set range and we'll set it how many
chicken wings can people order I mean
one two fifty I say I mean if you need
more than 50 chicken wings then I don't
know maybe you should get one of those
new diet pills because that is just
crazy so now we set the range for the
spinner now we have to do the exact same
thing for the slider now the reason that
I want to do this explicitly is well
first of all I put slider right there
that's embarrassing now the reason I
want to do this specifically to set the
range to the same values is because
remember any time that we set a value on
the spinner the slider is going to be
set to that value so if this one goes
from 1 to 70 and this one only goes to 1
to 50 what happens when you slide this
one to 70 this one's going to be like
whoa whoa whoa I don't have a 70 so
that's why we needed to give them the
same exact range so that's all the time
I have for in this story in the next
story I'm going to show you guys how to
link these two widgets together and also
how to make the layout make it so every
widget appears nice and neat on your
program</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
