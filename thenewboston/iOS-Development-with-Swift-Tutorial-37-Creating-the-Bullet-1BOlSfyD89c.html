dude pretty much fire in his gun let's
go ahead and create that bullet node so
he actually has someone to fire and
actually before we do that here's how
it's gonna be created first of all I
already added the image this is the
bullet that I'm gonna use and actually
already added the star ball even though
we aren't going to be working with it in
this video what head and just edit it to
the project why not so I pretty much
have to say use this image for the
bullet and also whenever we create it
create it right here by default right in
front of the gun so that's the two
things that we need to remember whenever
we're creating it
so back in shooter scene let me just add
a comment like creped bullet node
alright so I'll just name it's great
bullet node and what it is going to do
is it's going to return an sk sprite
node now of course this is the type of
object that you can actually use in your
game and interact with and it can be you
know used for collision detection it
pretty much is a really cool object
that's it simple enough so of course
before we add it to the screen we need
to say where to add it and that is based
on this guy's positioning so we need a
reference to him before we know where to
place the bullet so let suit her node
that's our dude equals self shout node
with name what's your name what's your
name his name is shooter node actually
sounds like a pretty cool name for a
regular person my name is shooter
shooter node yeah not that much once I
hear it out loud all right now shooter
position set this equal to shooter node
that position easy enough so sooner
position is pretty much to the position
of that dude now what I want to do is
just get his width because I don't want
to place the node right on top of him I
don't want to place the billet right
there it's gonna be based on his width
and once we have is with we can say okay
add that much to his position and then
Oh appear on the right-hand side of him
so we got him we got his position let's
shoot her with shooter node dot frame
which is the rectangle around him that
size and the width of the rectangle
around him directing her around right
Dave around MA right so now that we got
pretty much all the properties from the
dude that we need we can go ahead and
start making the bullet spray so just
named a bullet why not and again set
this equal to SK sprite node so this is
the object that we're gonna be returning
but we have to set a bunch of different
properties on it first of all what image
do you want me to use for this sprite
will how about what is the name of it
bullet dot ping all right so that's the
image that I'm using now the next thing
you have to tell me is where do you want
me to appear by default now again the
position of this is gonna be changing
whenever we click and fire it but by
default the very first position is right
in front of the gun right there now
whenever you're making a game it's
always a good idea to actually find the
exact height and width of this guy and I
don't know like this gun isn't in the
direct center of it so you might be like
- like 42 pixels down but I'm just gonna
go ahead and kind of give you guys a
rough draft so for the bullet dot
position we need to set this equal to a
point on the screen using CG point make
the first one is the X positioning in
other words left inner
right and again that's based on wherever
the shooter is so the serger position if
I can go ahead and get the X property of
that this is just going to give us the
position of the shooter now what we want
to do is we want to take it and position
it to the right on his right side so in
order to do that we need to add a value
so we need to add shooter width over to
and that'll be a pretty good location
and for the Y how far down to you on it
well we'll just go ahead and use the
shooters position now again this might
not be directly on the tip of the gun
but it'll give us a pretty good idea I'm
not gonna like go and figure out every
single individual pixel so and now it's
giving me a warning because we need to
make sure shooter with it's actually
equal to some value and now what we need
to do is we need to give a name just
like before so again whenever we did it
with this dude we pretty much did
everything all plows driving through my
road right now so we pretty much did
everything through interface builder and
all these settings on the right hand
side but now I'm just doing it for
grammatically again nothing really weird
here now for the bullet dot remember
that physics body we want to do is we
wanna set the SK physics
body and the first thing we wanted to do
is we want to give him a bounding
rectangle so what is the size of your
rectangle well just use the bullet frame
size good enough
and this just pretty much puts a square
um around the bullet a frame in that way
we can set up collision detection later
on and one last thing that's kind of
weird what you need to do it for the
physics body you need to say uses
precise collision detection and set this
equal to true cool so again all of this
is just setting up the bullet giving out
all the pretty much the basic properties
of it but it's just doing it through
code instead of interface builder and
now since we said that we're actually
going to be returning an S case for it
note one last line of code just returned
the bullet so this creates your object
and boom you're good to go it's in
memory right now so this isn't actually
shooting out and for that we actually
need to apply some cool physics effects
I'm gonna be showing you guys that in
the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
