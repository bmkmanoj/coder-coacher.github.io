video and in this tutorial what I want
to do is I want to start working on a
full mobile responsive website now the
reason I wanted to do this is because
instead of just teaching guys the basics
like I have before and not really doing
anything with the knowledge that we're
learning I think it'll be a little more
fun if we start building a full website
using the techniques that we learn so
that's what I'm going to be doing
however Before we jump right into it I
need to talk to you guys about something
that appreciate to talk to you about
before so you finally decide that you
want to make a website responsive so
maybe your boss came to you and told you
about this website yet you need to work
on or maybe it's just some I don't know
you're doing it for school or something
but you have a website kind of like mine
that is not responsive at all so of
course the reason that you want to make
it responsive is so it looks great on
mobile devices small screen devices well
now you have a couple options the first
thing that you can do is like we saw in
the first tutorial and I think what was
that website liked at lay or something
whenever that screen started to shrink
stuff started changing and it was
adaptable so that's the first type of
responsive website we can make however
we also have another option we also have
the ability to make a pure mobile
responsive website now what this means
is whenever usual user is on a mobile
device and they go to your website right
here what you can do is you can detect
that they're on a mobile device and send
them to another website and you guys
probably saw this before right now the
sub domain for this is wwq org if you
ever saw a website with the M sub domain
what this would mean is it's a mobile
site and it's a site that's not only
responsive but it was made specifically
for mobile devices so when do you choose
one and when you choose the other
well it really depends on exactly what
you want to do see my website right here
if you look at it and if you ever um you
know have a client or something take a
look at their website and start looking
at the features on it right now I have
this chat feature which uses a lot of
bandwidth I mean it really isn't a big
of a problem because these desktop
browsers are very powerful and you can't
even tell the difference whenever you're
doing it with that in these
notifications they update in real time
so there is they're pretty much always
connecting to the network in you know
updating right now not an issue with
this website because like I said your
desktop browsers are really powerful
however with a mobile browser on a
mobile phone you don't have the same
advantages even though you may think
that they were better than they were
like 10 years ago
they aren't nearly as powerful as a
desktop browser so you need to consider
even if you could make a really good
mobile design for this chat it would it
would be too taxing on your mobile
browser so instead what I want to do is
considering all the features that we
have built in and considering the fact
that I don't want them to load on a
mobile browser or else it'll just be way
too slow and laggy I decided that we
should make a fully responsive mobile
site so that's what I did
right here I've been playing around a
little bit with it and that's what we're
going to be learning in this story so
again the benefits of this is whenever
we connect to this we don't even load
the chat or the notifications about at
all this is website specifically
tailored to the mobile experience and
it'll be fast because it does have to
load all those resources it's responsive
so it's easy to touch tap with the
fingers and of course look at this maybe
you're looking at it on I don't know an
iPad like this size maybe just a smart
phone like this no matter what way you
stretch it or grow it it's fully
responsive as well
so again that's why you may choose to
make um a responsive website like they
did in tat Li just by adding some media
queries but in this little tutorial
series or a project series I'm going to
be showing you guys how to make um a
true mobile responsive website and that
is why I chose to do that and also all
the techniques that you're going to
learn you're going to be able to
understand how to pour them over to a
responsive website like tat Li but once
you learn how to do this then um well
every door is going to be open and um
you guys are going to be like true
responsive web designers so I'm going to
shut up now that's the little demo this
is what we're going to start making in
the next tutorial so that's what you
have to look forward to I'll see you
guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
