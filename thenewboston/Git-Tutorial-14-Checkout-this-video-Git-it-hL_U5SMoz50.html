sweet get tutorial and in this video I'm
going to be teaching you guys how to
undo changes to your working directory
so why would we ever want to do that
well let me go ahead and give you guys
an example so say that we just got this
sweet new site developed called dogs in
its pretty apparent by looking at it
that it's going to be the next big thing
probably a little bit bigger than
Facebook but you know we ain't sure yet
somewhere around there so of course what
we need to do is we need to start hiring
developers to expand this website so we
get the best developers there are out
there and what he does is we hire him
and he comes in and he's like okay well
here's the thing
he actually lied on his resume and he
isn't the best developer he's actually a
tomato can and he has no idea what he's
doing so the first thing he does is he
starts messing up our website by
renaming these images to like a pix or
something because he doesn't even know
that it doesn't matter he thinks he can
just change it to the same name
whatever so he's like all right let me
just go ahead and save this
doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo eating
potato chips looking at this website now
and check it out the entire websites
messed up the homepage is freaking not
working because he renamed a bunch of
stuff and he wasn't supposed to so right
dude you're fired get out of here we
don't need you anymore but we still have
this website that's messed up so what we
need to do now is we need to basically
turn whatever files he was working on in
the work and copy and we pretty much
need to take the files from the
repository which remember are the good
files and replace them with whatever
files he messed up here so how do we do
that well the first thing that we could
do is we could type git status and hit
enter so we are reviewing his working
copy and we can see that he only messed
up modified it said but really no it
means he messed up one file index.html
so again what we
like to do is take the files from the
repository which is the main project
files which are good files and we need
to replace them so we can get a working
copy back in the condition that we want
it so how do we do that pretty freakin
easy what we can do is hit get check out
- - space index.html and hit enter and
what this did is it basically this is
what check out means check out means
take something from the repository and
make it your working copy so it pretty
much took that file index.html from the
repo and I made it your working copy and
what this - - actually does is it has to
deal with branches and we'll talk more
about branches later but I just want to
mention it because I didn't want you
guys to think I'm skipping over it
it basically means we're not checking
out a branch we're just checking out
this one file index.html and again if
you don't understand where branches are
we're going to be covering them more
later but now when we type get status
and hit enter it says you're working
copy is now the same as your repository
if we look at our website and refresh it
our homepage is now fine again basically
what it did is it took our working copy
and it over wrote all the files with the
good files from the repository so that
again is how you undo changes whenever
you mess up files in your working
directory and how you get the good files
from the repository or any old versions
back so I'm thinking as for watching
very simple tutorial but definitely
useful so uh well that's it I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
