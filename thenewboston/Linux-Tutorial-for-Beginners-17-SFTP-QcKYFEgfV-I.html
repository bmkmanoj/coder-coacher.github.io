video I am going to show you how to
transfer files to and from your server
using SFTP so in the last tutorial what
we did is we set up our SSH keys so we
can actually connect to our server and
in this tutorial what I did is I just
made a couple quick files resembling
some kind of website so this is the home
page and I also made another directory
that just has some other quick web page
in there and we need to get these files
to our webserver so what we're going to
do is we're going to use SFTP which is
kind of like FTP hold on a second there
is this truck in front of my house who's
delivering furniture to someone they've
been there for like half an hour and
it's freaking annoying but anyways SFTP
is a lot like FTP but it depends on the
SSH protocol so make sure you have your
key setup and you're ready to hop it in
this video so it's incredibly easy to
connect to your server using SFTP so
just type SFTP that's the protocol and
then what computer are trying to connect
to so root that's the username and this
is the address of our server so it's
kind of you know a lot like SSH we just
use F SFTP instead and boom look at that
since our keys are already set up we
don't have to do anything weird no
passwords we're connected how awesome is
that
so just to make sure that we're in the
root directory of our server at first
let's just do CD dot have to do LS - LA
alright so we're now in the root core
directory of our server now if you guys
are familiar with Apache where all of
your I'll show you where all of your
webpage files are supposed to go are in
the HTML directory and in order to get
that use CD bar
ww HTML so from here if you do LS - LA
you can see that we have two files in
here by default and these are just
sample files that whenever we got the
server from digitalocean
they give us these two files you know
just so we have something to look at
so this index the HTML file that's what
we're looking at right here but of
course we want to replace it with our
own so what we're going to do first is
we're going to take this index.html file
from our desktop and this is the one
that I made and I'm gonna put it on my
server right there so how do we do that
it's actually really easy make sure that
you're in the right directory so PWD yes
that's where I want to put it and now
you just write put and then type in a
file from your own computer so that file
that I just showed you guys was on the
desktop and it was called index dot HTML
so this is going to do is it's going to
put this file into whatever directory
I'm at which is the main HTML file so
just hit enter and boom look at that so
now if i refresh my server look i forgot
i actually wrote that but yeah so this
is my home page you know how beautiful
of a design is that and if you guys ever
want to take an entire directory and
move it in there at once instead of just
doing one file at a time again there's
only one file in here but there can be a
hundred if you want then I'll show you
how to do that so again make sure that
you're in the HTML file and then we
first need to actually make a directory
so I'm going to make dir and I'm going
to make a directory called books so what
this is going to do is just going to
make a directory called books on our
server so now that we have our directory
we can start putting all of the contents
of books into that directory that newly
created directory on our server so put -
our and I'll explain that in a second
desktop books so what this - our flag
does is
says okay we're going to put this
directory on to our server but we're
also going to put it recursively that
means anything that's inside it we're
also going to add to the server so it
not only adds the directory but all the
files inside as well so boom look at
that once I hit enter it adds books in
all of the files inside it so now if I
go to books and what a name it Harry
HTML and hit enter look at that so if
you just want to enter one file then you
don't need that - R but if you want to
enter a directory recursively in other
words a directory and all the contents
in it then use that - our flag so now we
got some files on your server and I'll
show you guys something cool so let me
delete these so we don't have any files
on our desktop anymore they're only on
the server and I just deleted those
because I want to show you guys how to
download them now that I showed you guys
how to upload them and it's really easy
so what you need to do instead of put
your right get so let me show you guys
this so LS - LA alright so right now on
our server we have index.html books and
we also have another file inside books
so let's say we want to take this
index.html which is this file and we
want to download it onto our own local
computer so we just right get what file
do we want to get index.html and now
after this we need to say we're on our
computer do we want to put it well let's
just put on the desktop again so desktop
slash index.html so let me move this so
you guys can see what happens whenever I
hit enter so I'm going to hit enter and
check it out it's going to get this file
and it's going to put it right here
desktop index.html now if you guys ever
want to download an entire directory on
to your own local computer then I'll
show you guys how to do that
so let me move back
one directory and all right so I'm
looking at my server and I will actually
want to take this entire HTML file and I
want to plop it on my desktop so what I
can do is I can write get minus R
remember that means not only that folder
but everything inside as well HTML so
only folder we can download and where do
you want to put this whenever you
download it well how about the desktop
so hit enter and check it out it's going
to go on our server get everything
inside HTML directory and download it to
our desktop so check that out so pretty
cool that is how you use FS FTP kind of
a tongue twister to upload and download
files umm just practice a couple times
you'll get the hang of it but thank you
guys for watching don't forget subscribe
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
