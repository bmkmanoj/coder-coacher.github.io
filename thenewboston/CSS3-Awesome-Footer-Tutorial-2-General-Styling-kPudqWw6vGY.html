tutorial and now that we saw all the
cool functionality of this bad boy
let's go ahead and get styling this so
before I get started I do want to say
thank you to Emily Mae that's the girl
who actually showed me this it was on a
website called code Canyon dotnet and I
actually had to mod the crap out of it
so it was compatible for my website by
anyways thank you and well let's go
ahead and get started so the first thing
I want to do in the CSS file is just set
the background and this is because
whenever you're working with a plain
white background that you have by
default on every website it doesn't
really look that great because all of
the transparency settings you can't
really see so whenever you're developing
this and you want to tweak the
transparency then the first thing you
should always do is get your background
set first so that's what I want to do
and you can actually use any background
that you want but for me I'm just going
to go ahead and put body and this is how
you change the background to an image at
least background URL and in url you just
go ahead and write any image that you
have now I actually have a file already
called image wood wallpaper JPEG now I
know you guys um don't have this image
but actually if you just go to google
and type in hardwood backgrounds or
repeating hardwood or seamless hardwood
then it's going to give you a bunch of
good hardwood that you can use for
background just don't type in hardwood
because then a bunch of wieners are
probably going to pop up and you know no
one let's see that repeat now that's all
you need and of course you don't have
this file yet you can use hardwood like
I have right here or any other file you
can even use a solid color if you prefer
but it looks cooler when you have some
texture and this repeat right here what
this means is that you want to repeat
this picture horizontal and vertically
now I say that because usually whenever
you're making a background for the
website you don't
have you know mm by you know 1920 by
1200 picture usually just have a 200 by
200 square and it gets tired so this
repeat keyword means that it gets
repeated vertical and horizontally so
after we have the background let's just
go ahead and style the footer now what
this is going to be is basically the
overall footer basically the entire
thing all-inclusive so the first thing
we want to do this is we want to make
sure that it sticks to the bottom of a
web page so just like a toolbar this
footer right here is going to stick to
the bottom obviously so how do we do
that well the position of this text has
to be fixed now what fixed means is that
fixed positioning is necessary whenever
you want it to stick to the bottom
that's all you need to remember so right
now we told our browser that this
toolbar is fixed but we didn't say where
in the browser it's fixed so now let's
go ahead and do that bottom zero pixels
which basically means stick it to the
bottom there is no separation between
the bottom of the browser and the footer
margin:0 padding:0 and then we can just
do left:0 right:0 we're basically
setting everything to zero and what
left-and-right does and also along with
this width whenever you put it at a
hundred percent it says that there is no
space between the left and the right
hand side and it basically takes up 100%
width now you can actually have this
where you have some space to the left or
right
but I don't really like that um for now
this is how you develop this you can
always tweak it later now for the height
what we wanted to do is we want to go
ahead and set it at 40 pixels so this
entire toolbar or the footer is 40
pixels tall now you actually want to go
ahead and remember that because whenever
you're adding these images or these
notification icons
then you want to you know take note of
how tall they actually are and make sure
they don't exceed this 40 pixel limit so
now let's just go ahead and set some
overall properties font-family:arial um
text shadow now what text shadow is is
basically um exactly what you think it's
the shadow of the text now usually I
don't like text shadow whenever I'm
developing a webpage but for this it's
actually I don't want to say necessary
because you know you can develop it any
way you want but it makes it a lot
easier to read especially when you have
a lighter background you don't want
white text on the light background
without a shadow so in order to make a
text shadow go ahead and write this one
pixel one pixel one pixel black if you
guys aren't familiar with this property
what this basically is saying is that
the horizontal vertical blur are all one
pictures so move it to the right one
pixel
down one pixel and blur it 1 pixel and
also the shadow is going to be black if
you have like a yellow shadow it looks
kind of like a glow fun little tip now
I'm just go ahead and tighten in this
bad boy up
now what I want to do is I want to start
building that glass effect so if we go
ahead and we save this right now and
obviously we didn't do anything with the
HTML file but if this was thrown in just
like this it wouldn't look like it looks
right now it would just be a plain dumb
looking boring looking drop up menu in
order to add this cool transparent in
glass effect what we need to do is we
need to tap in the resources of css3 and
we need to tap into transparent colors
and also I'm going to show you guys how
to use multiple shadows to give you guys
this gleaming glass awesome transparent
look and that's what I'm going to be
doing in the next tutorial so I've see
them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
