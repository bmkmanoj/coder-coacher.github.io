we could have hoped for saving the
Citadel but leaving the council to die
humanity's place in the galaxy is
stronger than ever and still it's not
enough humans may control the council
but Shepard remains our best hope but
they're sending him to fight Geth guess
we both know they're not the real threat
the Reapers are still out there and it's
up to us to stop them
the council will never trust service
they'll never accept our help even after
everything humanity has accomplished but
Shepard they'll follow him he's a hero
a bloody icon but he's just one man if
we lose ship and humanity might will
follow then see to it that we don't lose
him
disengaging FTL drives emission sinks
active board is green we are running
silent we're wasting our time for day
searching up and down this sector and we
haven't found any sign of Geth activity
so he ships went missing here in the
past month something happened to him
my money's on slavers the terminus
system is crawling with him picking up
something on the long-range scanner
unidentified vessels imagine own
signatures cruiser is changing course
now on intercept trajectory campaign
stealth systems are engaged there's no
way of getting shit to possible it's not
the get bracelet the maneuvers
both of our bridges weapons offline
somebody get that fire out
mr. SP it is ready for lunch will be
Alliance get here in time
should be a lion for the fans in it we
just need to hold on get everyone to the
escape I'm not leaving either
I need you to get the crew on the beam
back shut I'll take care of children
Ashley go hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
