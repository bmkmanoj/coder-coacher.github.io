video what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
talk to you guys about generators now a
generator is actually really hard to
explain without just showing you guys
how it works
but before I get coding I kind of want
to just try to give you guys a real
brief overview so you know whenever you
just make a normal function what you do
is you make the function and give it a
name and then whenever you call it
either just runs a bunch of code or if
it has a return value then it runs up to
the return statement and then gives you
back a value well at first these
generator functions they look a lot like
you know just a normal function but the
thing is they actually don't execute all
the code at once like a normal function
what they do is say that you had 10
different lines in your generator you
could say run the first two lines and
then pause and wait until I tell you to
go on now once I tell you run the next
three lines and then pause so it pretty
much allows you to make functions with
like checkpoints in them sounds weird
and it kind of is so I'll show you guys
how to make one so whenever you just
make a function you just say the word
function that's the keyword and then you
type the name well whenever you make a
generator function which is a function
with like check points in it after the
keyword function use the asterisks and
this says hey JavaScript this is
actually a generator a special type of
function and the rest or um most of the
rest is kind of the same so again you
can name it anything you want just like
a normal function now check this out
these check points are determined by the
yield keyword so yield basically means
pause I mean that's what it means in
real life too so it's not that hard so
let me go ahead and type this and show
you guys a couple examples so I'm just
gonna return a couple stupid values here
apples bacon and what I can actually do
is I just don't only have to include you
it I can include just normal code as
well I can include if statements while
statements are printing stuff out to the
screen so say
okay this is the line after bacon and
now let me yield one more thing which is
corn so basically any time you see yield
think pause or checkpoint simple enough
so now let me go ahead and actually
create a reference to this generator so
I'll say let's sample people actually
let me say sample generator instead a
simple generator I think will be a
little bit easier to see since this
isn't really simple but it isn't the
sample sound like dr. Seuss now all
right so this is just a reference to
this function now whenever I call this
function the very first time what it's
going to do is it's going to run until
it gets to this yield so essentially
it's going to say okay I'm going to
return apples and then I'm going to
pause and I'm not going to run any of
this other code until you tell me to so
just so we can actually print out apples
what I'm going to do is this I'm going
to say simple dot next this next
function essentially means run this
generator until you get to the yield
statement so now if I go ahead and run
this check it out now take note of what
this returned what a return is an object
with the value of apples and it also has
another property called done now
whenever your generator gets to the end
and it has no more yield statements this
is going to be equal to true now since
we still have more code to go this is
going to be equal to false all right now
if you only want to print out the value
for example if you only want to print
out apples and you really don't care
about that done statement then what you
can do is just print out value just like
that so that may be a little bit easier
to see what's going on so again what it
did is it ran this function until it got
to apples returned it and then it says
okay I'm waiting I'm waiting for you to
tell me to go to the next checkpoint I'm
going to talk today so whenever I do
that it says okay I'm going to run
apples and then you want me to go to the
next one so I return bacon
and then I'm pausing so this line of
code it never even ran whenever we call
next what it's going to do is it's going
to run all the code until it gets the
next yield statement so then check this
out whenever I ran this it print out
apples right here and then it went on
returned bacon and then after a returned
bacon it hit this line of code so that's
why I printed out this and then the last
one was corn now if you guys are
wondering all right well what happens if
you say go to the next one even though
you're kind of all done with them well
what it does then is it just gives you
undefined so undefined essentially just
means hey I'm done with the generator
function that's it so that's all a
generator is basically a function where
you can include checkpoints or little
parts of your code where you can pause
until you call next so if you guys are
wondering alright
so that's kind of cool I guess but is
this useful in any kind of way the
answer is no it's not thank you guys for
watching I'm just kidding so I'll show
you guys a really simple example of and
this is probably the easiest way I know
that whenever we're talking about like
communicating with an API in promises
then you're like just demonstrate a
generator then that's kind of what
they're made for but for now I'll show
you guys like the most simple example
ever so I'm going to make a new um
generator so again function Asterix so
let me just give this one some more
space and let's say that I was making a
program to create a bunch of new users
for I don't know a website or something
and each time I created a user they
needed a new user ID so I'm just going
to say get next ID just like that now
the first ID I'm just going to say just
make it equal to zero why not you start
at one if you want but who cares
and see I really don't have that much
money for a big old server and I don't
want like a million people signing up so
I'm just going to say while ID is less
than three so I can only have a max a
number of three users on my website
again it isn't a very cool website but
it will demonstrate this point all right
so what I want to do is this I am going
to loop through this three times now
instead of just returning one two three
what I'm going to do is I'm going to use
this yield keyword that says what we
want every time we call this generator
is basically for you to return the next
user ID and then pause and wait until I
ask you for another user ID so I'm going
to yield the ID and since we want it to
actually change I'm just going to write
plus plus so the first time we return
zero and then one and then two and then
it breaks and if we try to call it again
it's going to be undefined so I'll say
what can I say here I'll say let's
create user equal get next ID so anytime
I want to use this for an out so we can
actually see what's going on create user
next and it remember this actually
returns the object with the value and
remember it said done equals true or
false right now I'm just concerned about
the value so that's all I'm going to
print out so if you run this check it
out
the very first user is just user 0 now
if I call this again then I get user 1
so now what I can do is I'm like all
right so that's enough users for now um
okay I have to go do something else
write some more code yada yada yada that
runs and then I don't know maybe I
checked my database or my server to make
sure that everything is you know that I
can support all these users all two of
them
and then I can go ahead and call this
generator again
pretty awesome eh now just because I
know you guys want to see me try to
create another one and for the state
undefined
boom roasted there you go so whenever
you try reading documentation about
generators it makes it sound like it's
the most confusing thing in the world
but it's actually really easy again all
they are is functions and they run until
you get to the yield keyword and this
pretty much says pause until you call
next again and then you can keep calling
next and it can keep returning values
until it gets to the end of it whatever
kind of way and it has normal no more
values to return and then it just
returns undefined that's it that's all
they are
so yeah generators easy peasy think guys
for watching and I will see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
