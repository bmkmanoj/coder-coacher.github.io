iphone development tutorial and in these
next couple tutorials this is the
program that we're going to be creating
will you see at the top is something
called a segment of control and what
this does is it actually changes the
controls underneath it based on what
segments you press pretty going on so
here is the switches segment changes
both of them pretty neat and here is the
button just clicks it doesn't do
anything right now maybe we'll add some
functionality later who knows but
anyways I just want to show you guys
whenever I talk about a segment in
control this is what I'm talking about
whenever I talk about switches this is
what I'm talking about and a button of
course you know that from before so what
I went ahead and did already is create a
new project I didn't want to do that
because I mean you know how to do that
already they want to waste your time
doing in this tutorial so saying re what
do we need outlets for well what
actually are we changing whoa we need
outlet for this switch and we also need
one for this switch and we also need one
for the button we don't need one for
this segment of control because all of
the functionality right here is built
into the ipod so yeah we need three
outlets to begin with because those are
the things were going to be changing
let's go ahead and put left switch okay
let's go ahead and put you i switch and
we'll we'll capitalize that switch and
let's go ahead and make another one of
these for the right switch right and we
will also make that UI button and button
so now once we created those three
objects we gotta go ahead and make
outlets to them since we want to you
know be able to interact with them so
property of course we're going to be
making three outlets so non-atomic and
retain and let's go ahead and I be
outlet so it actually makes it outlet
you I switch take that right close
enough and left switch so let's go ahead
and copy this right here and let's paste
the toys one for the right switch and
one for the UI make sure to change it
right here button and just go ahead and
name this button so make sure I don't
have any typos only a few probably so
now what we want to do is aside from
declaring outlets on three of our
objects we also want to have three
different built-in methods we want one
for when you change this it calls a
method one that when you click either
one of the switches it calls method and
one that when you click the button
because we aren't going to be adding any
functionality to this button but we will
later on so might as well have a method
for it so let's go ahead and might as
well make those right now but I be
action will do the main one main control
switch and this will be the method
whenever you switch your segmented
control this is what's going to be
called so let me just switch back over
here and of course it's going to take
the parameter of ID sender so now let's
go ahead and copy this because the only
thing that's going to change is the
method name and we'll name the switch
switch change and make sure you don't
name anything switch in your program
because that's already something that's
built in and the last method is called
button pressed so this is the method
whenever you switch the segment and
control this is the method ax it's going
to be called whenever you click one of
them switches and this is the method
that's going to be called whenever you
press a bun easy enough so go ahead over
in your arm
implementation and as you can see I
already got rid of all my comments aside
from these but they can stay there
pretty cool so what we need to do first
is synthesized those three outlets so it
actually creates getter and setter
methods for us so go ahead and
synthesize left switch looks good and go
ahead and add synthesize right switch
and we also want to add synthesize that
button so now we have access to that
left switch right switch in button now
it's so aside from that what we probably
should have done is just go ahead and
copy these little babies right here so
we don't have to retype the header whoa
whoa whoa whoa whoa don't want to do
that so go ahead and copy that right
there yeah and at the body body and body
just because I always forget the Get Rid
that semicolon and you know give it a
little more space give us some space to
breathe do you know what I'm saying all
right so let's get rid of the hard stuff
first this main segments of control is
switch now check this out before I even
get started let me explain to you guys
this whenever you pretty much here's I'm
try say how does your program know
whether this switches or this button one
is selected well it knows what one is
selected via a built-in method that's
called select segment index now whenever
you click the first segment index is
going to be equal to zero whenever you
click the second segment index is going
to be not equal to 0 so this one is
equal to zero so that's how we can write
the code for this and this one is not
equal to zero so let's go ahead and say
alright main control switch this is the
method whenever you hit that segment of
control which I'm just doing so let's go
ahead in in order to say all right when
we're on the first one show these when
they're around the second one show these
so all you need is a simple if statement
and what just popped up what I miss here
oh nice let's go ahead and keep all that
stuff really if down maybe no I'll get
it I'll get it if now what could I
possibly all right that's just making me
man now I know what's going I know it's
a click to make it stay up by anyways
i'll type it in myself i see how this is
going to go all right if center which is
that segment of control in all right
select did segment index there we go
that's why i was talking about this is
either going to be equal to 0 if the
first one is chosen or it's going to be
not equal to 0 if the second one is
chosen so now i gotta write my own body
help that exact if anyone else i'd make
that stay up please tell me so i don't
embarrass myself again alright so if
it's exactly equal to 0 then we want
this to show up so what exactly we want
hidden well we want these both of these
buttons the show and we want this button
to be hidden so go ahead and let's do
that right now so how we do that is if
it's equal to 0 so if that first switch
tab is clicked left switch in the
attribute for this is hidden and set
this equal to no because if it isn't
hidden we want to show of course so now
let's go ahead and copy this and paste
it and just go ahead and push rights
which we don't want that one hand
neither but that button that button
hidden do we want the button hidden yes
of course we do so now else somewhat
right yeah there we go that's what I'm
talking about so let's go ahead and copy
this I guess you guys don't have to
leave me a comment anymore copy this and
now let's go ahead and reverse mall so
check this error here's what I'm doing
when we click this first one it's going
to be equal to 0 these two switches are
not hidden but the button is then when
we click the button we want to hide the
two switches and show the button so go
ahead and just reverse everything
hit in we want to hide this we want to
hide this and do we want to hide the
button no we don't want to do that so
that is all the coding we have to build
for this main control switch on in the
next tutorial I'll show you guys the
coding for the switch change and also
will be starting to build this all these
objects in interface builder so it's
going to be a pretty sweet and
definitely informative tutorial so I
think you guys for watching don't forget
subscribe and I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
