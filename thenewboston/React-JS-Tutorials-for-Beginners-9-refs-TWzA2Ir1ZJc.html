video I want to talk to you guys about
refs now before I explain exactly what
refs are let me go ahead and talk you
guys through exactly what we're going to
be doing so essentially whenever the
user edits these comments we want to
allow them to pretty much type some
neucom in here and hit save and then
it's going to save it right here so this
action is actually broken up into two
parts in our code so the first thing
we're going to need to do is we're going
to need to get the value of whatever
they typed in and that is kind of step
one and we do that whenever they hit
save and step two is going to be taking
that value and setting it equal to this
chunk of text right there so in this
tutorial we're actually just going to
take care of part number one which is
getting the value of whatever they typed
in so let's think about how to do this
for a second before you just jump right
into it so whenever they hit edit this
text area pops up which is this right
here and then they throw some text in
here whatever their weird comment is and
then we have to get the value of it so
we pretty much need a way to reference
this text area so we can get the value
of the text that they typed so let's
think about this I mean I guess we can
give it an ID right well wait a minute
that won't work because if we have
multiple components multiple different
notes they can't all have the same ID so
can we just say like this components
text area well that won't work either
because we can actually have multiple
text areas and what if we have a
component with like three different text
areas so all right how do we solve this
problem well the solution is to use refs
now refs
are a way that you can get a reference
to one of your child elements so
whenever you need to refer the text
areas value which is the text they typed
in we need to give it a ref so how do we
do that well right after text area you
add a new attribute called ref now you
can give this anything you want and I'll
just say new text so now when we refer
to the new text
ref it knows that it's talking about
this element right here and again the
reason that this is better than ID is
because if you render all these with the
same ID it won't work because you can
only have a unique ID in other words all
of your different components have to
have a different ID so now what we can
do is now that we have a way to
reference it let's go ahead and in our
save function let's actually utilize
that so what I'm going to be doing is
whatever they typed in I'm just going to
be storing it in a variable and I'm just
going to name it V al for value so this
is going to be equal to whatever text
they typed in in this example this
distances
and how do we get access to it well you
first need to say this dot Refs
dot new text we just copy that too lazy
to type five more letters all right
so now this is a reference to this
element right here now if we just set it
equal to distance actually going to be
equal to the whole text area object and
that's not what we want we actually want
the value of this so again the value of
this is actually going to be equal to
whatever they typed inside which is in
this case bacon so now we got bacon
stored in this variable Val now remember
I said eventually what we're going to
want to do is set this equal to this
text right here but for this tutorial
since I just want to cover reps on let's
just go ahead and log it out on the
screen so console.log and um I might as
well add new comments Wow right like
that so whenever we hit save what it's
going to do is it's going to get the
value of this and then it's going to log
out new comment bacon new comment hey
now or whatever so everything looks good
let me refresh this and alright so I
know you guys probably can't see in my
console but I'm going to hit edit and
then instead of hi my name is Bucky I'll
say this equal to bacon snakin and then
I'll hit save and then the logs out new
comment
bacon sneaking actually looks like
smacking about what mzo alright so that
sums up what I wanted to cover in this
tutorial and that is whenever we need a
reference to one of the child elements
that get rendered out instead of giving
it an ID we can give it a ref and then
in our code whenever we want to refer to
that element we just call this refs and
then whatever we named that ref and then
we can do whatever we want with it in
this case we got the value of whatever
the user typed in to the text area and
logged it out in the console so yeah
there's part one to saving these
comments and part two is a little bit
more tricky but we'll get there so then
guys watching I will smell you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
