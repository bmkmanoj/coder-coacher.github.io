your sixth Python tutorial and then this
story I'm a teaching guys what strings
are now actually I've already used
strings a bunch in my last couple
tutorials but now I'm going to actually
tell you guys that they actually have a
name and I'm saying actually a lot so
get used to it
so whenever I did something like I typed
out just um like a bunch of characters
like hey now that's a string and it gets
his name because a string is a string of
characters just a bunch of characters in
a row or it can be even a single
character to stand alone now as you can
see this one used double quotes but you
can also type them in single quotes same
thing and it's still a string um it
doesn't really matter if you use double
quotes or single quotes when you're
using a string or quotes it's the same
thing but in some cases Python is not
going to understand if you don't use
them in a particular way so let's say
for example you have a conjunction like
he a jerk see you have the single quote
right here so that means that since you
have a single quote in your actual
string you can't put single quotes
around it like this you can see the
problem is pretty clear right here
Python is going to view this is the
beginning of a string and this is the
end of a string so this is an entire
string because single quotes mark the
beginning and the end and then it's
going to see this one over here but wTF
is this so to combat this problem we
need to use double quotes around here
like that and now when we print it out
it's going to know what we're talking
about or another thing that we can do if
you just are dying the use single quotes
you can put he's a jerk and you can have
something called an escape clause or
escape character and that's the
backslash right here now whenever you
use a backslash when using a string
Python is going to look to
the next character whatever it is it's
going to say alright this has no real
meaning he just wants me to print it out
it has no piece of the code besides just
print it out however it looks so instead
of saying all right here's the beginning
here's the end it's going to say art
here's the beginning we know this is
just a regular quote because this
backslash right here so I guess this one
would be the end so it kind of tricks
Python and let me put go ahead and press
Enter as you can see that works too and
it only it isn't only useful when you're
working with a single quotes like that
it's really also useful whenever you
have a double quote like Bucky said and
then you have these little things like
what quotes are really used for hey now
um he said that to me see in this case
if you put quotes around here and try to
print it out now this whole thing in
here is a sentence it just has double
quotes in part of the sentence
now these double quotes aren't part of
the Python programming language but
Python doesn't know that what it's going
to do is says alright this is a
beginning and this is a n since those
are double quotes
I'm just computer I can't understand and
this is a beginning and this is ant but
what we see is no this is actually an
entire sentence right here and it just
has quotes in it because that's part of
the English language so we need a tell
Python to start acting right so what we
do is whenever we use double quotes as
part of the English language English
language and not actually part of our
program language we need to tell Python
to ignore those using escape characters
just like that now Python will see this
is the beginning don't see anything here
don't see anything here they're
invisible to me and this is the end
perfect
BAM a little too easy and let me just
show you guys what would happen because
I know you guys let's go fishing
fizzing same thing if you guys actually
try to print this out
you'd get a syntax error so I'm not just
making this up you actually would get an
error and the last thing I want to talk
to you guys about is how to join strings
now just like I showed you guys numbers
can be stored in variables you can also
store strings in variables so say you
have a equals Bucky and B equals Roberts
any time you want to join me strings all
you have to do is add a plus sign
between a plus B BAM look at that now
that's all you would have to do and then
what Python does is add these two
strings together in a one string of text
so again you have a plus B and you can't
just put a B like that or a comma B what
you need to do to get your desired
result is actually put a plus B and that
little plus sign this is called
concatenating a string and concatenating
a string means just adding it together
you would actually probably want to
change a to something like a Bucky with
a space over after it and go ahead and
press Enter now once you do a plus B it
looks like a regular name so again that
little addition sign right there
concatenate strings or adds them
together into one long string and again
you need that because if you don't
you're going to get an error message so
that is pretty much the basics of
strings I know it's kind of boring but I
needed to tell you guys it or else you'd
be lost in the future and that's how you
can catenate strings or join them
together so um there is your very boring
tutorial on strings I promised these
will get more interesting for not that's
just a little something you need to know
so again thank you guys for watching and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
