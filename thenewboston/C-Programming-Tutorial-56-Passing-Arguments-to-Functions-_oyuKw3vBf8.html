video we're going to be done with coding
these stupid little rookie functions
it's time to step our game up a notch
because I'm going to be teaching you
guys how to pass arguments into
functions so what the heck does that
mean
well sometimes your function is going to
need an extra piece of information in
order to work and by that I mean if it's
calculating the weight of something or
in this video I'm going to be showing
you guys how to take any amount of
Bureaus and convert it to US dollars so
of course the piece of information that
you're going to need to give your
function is how many euros do you want
to convert so again it's not just going
to print something out on the screen and
do the same thing over and over again
it's going to take a number in this case
and convert it so it's going to be
pretty sweet so it's better if I just
shut up and actually do this so first of
all what's going to do is it's going to
crunch the numbers whatever value you
give it and just print out on screen
we're not getting um any we're not
returning anything back to the function
so just write void and in the next video
I'll show you guys what happens when you
actually do return something back but
right now let's just stick with the
basics so like I said what we're going
to do is we're going to give a euro
amount and it's going to convert it to
dollars so convert to dollars is
probably an appropriate name for this
function and what piece of information
does it need from the user well it needs
a euro amount and I'm just going to put
that as a float since it could be like 1
and 1/2 euros or whatever you call them
I know it's a float give me a break guys
so basically in here you're making a
variable what type of information are
you going to be passing in well it's
going to be a float and what do you want
to call the variable well just euro we
know how to make variables so after this
of course your curly brackets we have to
first let me add that return statement
so I don't forget now what I want to do
is since we already have a variable for
Euro I also want to add another one for
float USD this is pretty much going to
be our answer
and the formula to convert euros to
dollars is just take whatever amount
euro and multiply it by one point three
seven so pretty freakin easy and now
let's just go ahead and print something
out on screen so printf and this
function will just say um we can format
it like percent F to two decimal places
euros and then we'll put a little dash
and we'll say that what it was in USD or
US dollars and we'll kick it to another
line
so if coverts the first one is euro and
the second one is US dollars so very
simple stuff what we pretty much did is
recreated a function that takes any
amount of euros converts it to dollars
and prints out the result on the screen
so now we just need to do the boring
housekeeping stuff say when you want to
use this function well right around here
is good for right now
and then of course we need a prototype
it so whenever our program comes across
that it doesn't get confused
so now of course we're using this
function right here and we actually
don't want that in there because that's
just a variable what we want to do is we
want to give it some Euro amount so make
a new variable right up here I'll just
name it like euro price one and we'll
just test it out really easy to make
sure it works so basically say that we
have a one euro in our traveling
overseas early Siam I live in America
and we need to know on what the US
dollar amount equivalent of this is so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
take this value which is equal to one
and I'm going to pass it as an argument
into this function so this pretty much
says run this function right here in for
your placeholder you
this one so wherever this euro is it
pretty much treats this variable euro as
one so it's going to say okay one times
1.37 let's run this bad boy and check it
out
one euros equals one point three seven
US dollars pretty sweet now another cool
thing is this remember that I said that
you can use this function as many times
as you want without having to recode
everything well this is actually one of
those useful examples say that we have I
don't know five and a half euros we'll
name this variable year or price to what
we can just do something like this do
this one for one and do this one for
five and a half and how awesome is that
no need to code this over and over and
over again you can do this as many times
as you want
piece of cake and actually to tell you
the truth you don't even need a variable
name at all since this euro price too
and your price 1 is equal to a float you
can actually just pass in a float right
here so what if you had I don't know
21.3 euros well what this is going to do
is just going to say whatever values in
here treati is euro euro pretty frickin
awesome so again that is how you pass an
argument into a function again an
argument is just an extra piece of
information that your function is going
to need so well plain and simple that's
how it's done um hopefully you guys
understand if you don't then ask me in
my forum and I'll be happy to answer for
you also if you want the source code for
it then look in my forum all the source
codes there you probably already knew
that anyways thanks for watching and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
