suspension now the suspension is the
area of the go-kart between your frame
and the tire it consists of a couple
bars we're going to have a bar right
here and it also consists of something
called a strep or a spring so those are
the two main pieces and then of course
that's how your frame attaches to the
player now the reason that you're going
to attach your frame directly to the
tire and you need this thing called
suspension is because it pretty much
acts as an absorber so whenever you're
riding over bumps it not only helps
protect your frame from getting beat up
but it gives the passenger and the
driver a nice smooth ride so let me go
ahead and show you guys have to add
suspension so when we're going to work
with a double arm system which is pretty
much to pivoting arms right here and
they connect to the frame like this
first on all of these you have a little
bearing which is like a little plate it
slides in and go ahead and slide the
other one right now so I have both of my
bearings in here now go ahead and slide
them into us see if I can get a lined up
and bolt it through all right there's
one
once you have one in the other one goes
into rather easy all right there we go
so right now just kind of sag there
doesn't really do a whole lot so what
we're going to do is we're going to put
another arm on up here and then we're
going to connect both of these arms to
something called a steering knuckle and
that knuckle is going to
to the tire so there are a lot of parts
to put on involving your suspension but
it's definitely worthy it's not
something that you want to overlook and
skip so there's one arm right there and
now what we need to do is we need to go
ahead and add the other arm so go ahead
and grab that and adding this is the
exact same go ahead and put your
bearings in now go ahead and put one
bolt in first there's another one now go
ahead and play these up and then we can
add our serial number so now that we got
our suspension arms and you can now
install the steering knuckle now if you
don't know why you need a steering
knuckle the reason that you don't want
to bolt your tire or wheel right onto
these arms is because these arms only
allow padding up and down whenever you
hit a bump what's going to happen
instead of drilling your frame these
arms are going to sway up now padding
your ride now again like I said these
only go up and down they don't go left
and right so if you put the tire on
right now you go straight the entire
time so that's why we need a scare
knuckle what a senior knuckle does is it
allows you to turn the tire left it
around
is actually where your steering is going
to hook up to so then it's going to pull
this way or this way allowing you to
steer the go-kart left and right so this
is really easy to put on just go ahead
and make sure their bracket it in place
takes one bolt on top right there and
then a bolt on bottom now the bolt on
the bottom uses a regular washer a lock
washer and then a knot we're going to
put those up watch your lock washer knob
alright so now our main suspension
system is pretty much complete the only
other thing we need to do is hook up
something called the strut and we'll do
that in the next video but now check it
out whenever we hit a bump we can now go
up and down and also whenever we hook up
the steering our wheel can now turn left
and right so this is much a much better
system than bolting the wheel directly
onto the frame because then you're going
to have a wheel that takes all the
absorption all the bumps and it's going
to damage your frame and also you
probably want to be able to steer your
go-kart so now that we're done with this
like I said in the next video we're
going to be covering the stroke</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
