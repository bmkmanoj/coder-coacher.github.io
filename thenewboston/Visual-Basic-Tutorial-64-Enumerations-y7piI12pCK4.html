slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
talking about enumerations
now if you remember from all of the
previous tutorials we've been using
variables now these pretty much have no
limit except for integer has a limit of
I think for billions of them so there is
a limit there but you can pretty much
put whatever you want into it now let's
say you want to limit a user so that
they can only put a certain value in so
let's say if you want them to tell you
how many doors that car has you wouldn't
want them to be able to put 523 because
that's impossible so the way you can do
get around this is by using enumerations
and what enumerations is is pretty much
creating your own data type and you can
create as many variables as you want
based off of that enumeration so let's
go ahead and create a project and we'll
give this a little practice
so go ahead we'll go to new project we
will select windows forms application
and we will call it enumerations and
we'll go ahead and click OK now we'll
wait for this to load ok so now let's go
ahead and we will come over here to our
tool box we'll add a button and we will
just set the text to enumeration and
we'll go ahead and set the name to
button enumeration
okay so let's go ahead and open up the
code for forum one and now what we're
going to do is we're going to create an
enumeration now to do this we're going
to declare like we would a method or a
function by starting off with the
keyword public or private so this guy
case will do private so private and then
we're going to use the keyword enum for
enumeration and now we have to create a
name for it so let's just call it day
action and you see it gets that light
blue color and they actually we're going
to be using that in the upcoming
tutorials we're going to be learning
several different things and we're going
to use them all in one application
so private in um day action and then
we'll type as integer you have to
specify a data type for that and now go
ahead and press enter now we have to
populate our enumerations with possible
values so we'll just type awake equals
zero asleep equals one and let's just do
coding equals two okay so now we can
create a variable based off of this day
action such as we would make a variable
that's an integer value so instead of
doing private action as integer and set
a value to that we would do it as day
action now we can make as many of these
as we want and they will each be their
own separate things holding different
values so now what do we want to do
we'll go ahead and set that equal to two
which is going to be coding so we'll go
ahead and create a click event for
button enumeration and we'll go ahead
and show what action is currently being
performed so we'll type message box dot
show action dot to string
so if we go ahead and run this we're
going to get form one right here and
when we click enumeration it says coding
now we can set de action to different
values as well
so if we'll give this a little bit of
time to load so we'll set it equal to
one and it should give us asleep so if
we go ahead and run this and click
enumeration we get asleep now you don't
have to set it to an integer value or
let's say you create an enumeration as a
string or anything else so you would
have we have all of these names right
here for the possible values so instead
of actually putting in the integer which
we may not know what it equals so if we
put in 0 we will what if we don't know
that means awake so what we can do is
type day action and you can see here
down in intellisense it gives us several
options so we can do a day action dot we
can do a sleep awake and coding so if we
click awake action is going to be equal
to zero and it's going to be equal to
awake so to set it equal to something
that you want that is the name in your
enumeration you type the name of your
enumeration dot and then whatever you
name you have for that certain value so
if we go ahead and run this we'll go
ahead and click enumeration and we get
awake so go ahead and practice with the
numeration x' make some that are other
datatypes besides an integer they may be
a little confusing at first they were
for me it's kind of a little bit hard
concept to grasp I fear a new programmer
so I'm go ahead and practice with those
and we're going to be using in the next
upcoming tutorials so just get used to
them so you won't be confused in the
next tutorial and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
