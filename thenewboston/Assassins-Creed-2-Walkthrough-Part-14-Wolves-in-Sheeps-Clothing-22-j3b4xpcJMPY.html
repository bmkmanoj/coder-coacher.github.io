to the second part of wolves in sheep's
clothing or you know wolves and sheeps
caught or something like that
doesn't matter it's the second part and
in this part of the mission
we pretty much needed to defend Lorenzo
de Medici and get him safely to his home
without him getting chopped in the
throat so go ahead and if you have any
more guards he'll I'll kill them off so
let me take care of this guy one pig up
you see his eyes on that was awesome and
let me take care of this guy and then he
didn't speech but the man who did this
to you asked okay so now we have to
pretty much take him home but the thing
is that there's like pretty much a huge
war going on inside the city so he's
probably going to end up getting in a
couple of flights and you need to go and
make sure that he doesn't die and if you
remember his health is in the top left
and right now he only has about ten and
a quarter left so I got a try to stay
close to him and make sure that if he
gets in the fight anymore right there
and don't get too far away ahead
actually I think he would get too far
away ahead of them
he actually just stops and then just
staying there's and he's probably going
to get cloned so you'll see the little
green crosshairs and right now he's
getting attacked and I'm probably gonna
have a message the group you hired is
under attack and by that I mean a
residue Medici so now we got to kill off
all these guys and it's actually gonna
be close because he only got two health
left so since we're real close to this
house we got some of his buddies to
helpful so go ahead and destroy this guy
step back I in the back and just sucker
punch this guy and there we go
thanks for the help Lorenzo just stand
there and now the rest of the mission is
pretty much just a huge dialog for TSA
I'll let you listen it
Lorenzo's been wounded up little
aforetime what's the password
polizia open the m'lady to vote come in
quickly
wait I am in your debt
tell me why did you help me you are not
the only one who lost a brother to the
Patsy my name is Ezio Auditore your
javonni's son your father was a good man
he understood the owner loyalty the
Pazzi thoughts of scoring the palazzo
della signoria we cannot hold them off
much longer
no if they get inside their murder our
supporters and put their own Devils in
power then my survival would mean
nothing I have to Francesco Pazzi help
save our city I'll be Tony

money so that's the mission don't forget
