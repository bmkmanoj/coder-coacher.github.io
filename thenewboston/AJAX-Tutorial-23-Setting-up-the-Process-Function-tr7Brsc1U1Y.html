actually let me write that down so I
don't forget it on my little cheat sheet
in front of me
23 welcome to the 23rd age X tutorial
and now that we got the create xml
httprequest object done what we can do
now is we can actually use that object
however we want to so the first thing I
want to do is I want to take care of
this process function now remember this
process function is the function that we
called as soon as our web page loads so
let me go ahead and show you guys how I
create it and how I think is you know
the best way to handle this function of
course process and let me go ahead and
give myself a little more space to work
with here all right so remember that
this function like I said gets called as
soon as the web page loads so the first
thing that I like to do is I like to go
ahead and make an if statement that says
okay if XML HTTP now why do I like to do
this what's the point well what this
does is it checks that if XML HTTP if
this object is not void and a lot of
people like to set up their this
function kind of in a weird way whenever
they're building this function they like
to make a bunch of different parameters
for this they pretty much try so hard to
make this not void but the thing is that
it's okay if you return void because we
are checking it right here if you return
void if their browser isn't compatible
with it then nothing runs you don't get
any error because if you're saying okay
if you can't create that object then
this if statement it isn't even going to
run so it's kind of like a built-in
check so now what we want to do is this
code is only going to run if pretty much
you can run Ajax on your computer so now
what do I want to do well I like to put
anything in here in a try-catch
statement
and you usually want to do this with the
heart of your Ajax because remember even
though you may code everything correctly
in here everything may not go your way
because there are always errors with
communicating with servers and this is
generally a rule whenever you build a
computer application that works with you
know networking talking to a server even
though the code mate might be right
you may have a bug in your server or you
know your communication may be down
maybe your Internet's out so that's why
you put everything in a try-catch
statement so try to communicate with a
server but if the server's makes mess-up
or anything then just go ahead and catch
your air II because error and error
handling is awesome and if something
goes wrong maybe my internet shuts off
we'll just alert the error and this is
how you do that
e to string you know what this basically
means is whatever error you have maybe
it says dude your effing Internet's down
then it just go ahead and it converts it
to a string and it makes it you know in
a alert box which is pretty much like a
pop-up in JavaScript so now that we
handled any errors let's just go ahead
and see what we want to try so the first
thing we're going to do is this XML HTTP
which is the object that communicates
with the server and we want to open now
this is what a lot of people get
confused about because then thinking
okay this opens a connection with a
server and this is probably a poorly
named function because it confuses a lot
of people but this is what it actually
does the open function does not start a
connection with a server I'm going to
repeat that this function does not start
a connection with the server it only
kind of configures your connection
settings so it kind of sets up you know
how you're going to send the data to the
server where you're going to send it and
some other you know settings too but
basically remember that whenever you
call this function it doesn't connect
with the server it pretty much sets up
the connection that you're going to have
so let's go ahead and talk about that
right now the first parameter is
basically only just go ahead and type
all this get</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
