welcome to your twenty-third tutorial
and in this tutorial I'm going to be
building a simple program and I'm going
to be using the for loop and I'm just
going to be using it to show you guys
that it is actually useful outside of
just showing you guys examples so what
we're going to be doing is we're going
to say we're going to start with $10,000
and we're going to invest in the stock
market and we're smart enough to earn 1%
each day on our money so it's end of 20
or 30 days how much money did we make so
you know it's a little funner program
than what we've been programming before
it's a little cooler a little break from
just basic examples so before I get
started I want to mention this in our
formula for calculating interest rate we
need to use a function called power and
that's included in the see math library
so make sure you include this before you
get started in this tutorial so let's go
ahead and get down to it now we're going
to be calculating interest rates and
stuff like that so we're going to be
needing to work with decimal points like
0.01 0.02 for 2% but we already know int
so can we use integers when working with
decimal points like this no we can't it
is for whole numbers only like 98 for 54
it's or whole numbers without a decimal
place so in order to use a decimal place
we need to have a new type of variable
and that's called float float is
basically the datatype that allows you
to work with decimal places there are a
couple different ones but this is one of
them one of the most popular ones so
let's go ahead and make a variable
called a and this is going to be the
amount we're trying to figure out how
much money did we make the next variable
we need is called principle so floats P
equals your principal amount in in
everyday terms how much money did you
invest how much money did you start with
well say we just had $10,000 laying
around so let's go ahead and start with
that
I wish I had $10,000 around but hey we
can dream can't we so now let's go ahead
and say this our last variable is rate
so I'm going to set it equal to R and
that's how much interest do you want to
earn each day and let's say we can earn
1% each day and that's point o 1 if you
had 2 percent it would be 0.02 make sure
not to put 2 or 1 for this you need
point o 1 and or else it's not going to
work so let's go ahead and use the for
loop to run through each day so what
this is going to be doing is looping
through each day one by one one two
three four five six seven days and each
day it's going to give us a dollar
amount how much money did we earn that
day at one percent so of course the for
loop is going to loop through days let's
go ahead and make a variable called day
in today and we'll start at day one
obviously and the next parameter needs
is how long do you want to invest your
money for so let's say on 20 days so day
is less than or equal to 20 days and of
course day plus plus because one day at
a time we're not skipping any days and
we're not taking any vacation time here
so now the formula for interest rate
exists the amount of money that you earn
is equal to the principal amount times
and in parentheses put this actually no
not yet the principal amount times the
power and this is where you put
parentheses 1 plus the rate and this is
would be let me go ahead and type this
out I can't talk and tell you guys
financial formulas at the same time the
formula for calculating interest rate is
this the amount of money you're going to
make is equal to your principal
investment times 1 plus rate in the rate
would be point zero 1 in this case 2 the
day exponent so it would be like umm one
percent 1.0 one percent to the 20th
power so I mean it's a weird formula but
that's how you calculate just trust me
it works
so anyways now what we have to do is
just print out on the screen how much
money we're going to make so let's give
it a nice little
print thing arm let's go ahead and print
the day first and then just want to give
it a nice little spacer here there we go
and then we go ahead and write a a is
the amount of money that we're making
and then go ahead and we'll print this
on new line each time so let's go ahead
and run it and you'll see what I'm
talking about whenever I run it so here
is the day to the left one through
twenty we start off and at the end of
the first day if we invest $10,000 at
one percent we earned a hundred dollars
at the end of that first day at the end
of the ninth day we almost earned eleven
thousand dollars if we invested $10,000
and we earned one percent each day for
twenty days at the end of your twentieth
day you would earn over twelve thousand
dollars well you would actually earn two
thousand dollars but calculating the
money already had in there you would
have over twelve thousand dollars that's
pretty sweet huh so now you know why
everyone wants to get in stock trading
because basically by just sitting at
your computer and clicking buttons
making trades you can earn two thousand
dollars in twenty days pretty sweet huh
so since you know this is fake money and
we're just dreaming let's say that we
could we were a genius like Warren
Buffett or Bill Gates and we were smart
enough to earn 3% each day now let's say
we invested this for 30 days so go ahead
and let me run this whole mama check
this out
if you invest in money for 30 days and
you earn just three percent on your
money each day at the end of 30 days or
one month you would over double your
money you would have twenty four
thousand dollars and more and enough to
go out to Taco Bell so that is pretty
sweet and this makes me second-guess my
career as a computer programmer and kind
of makes me want to get in the stock
market but by the way before you guys
get into the stock market earning 3% a
year would be good nowadays earning 3% a
day is virtually impossible unless
you're like Warren Buffett so anyways
there is your tutorial on a useful way
to use the for loop in program and also
you know some
financial advice - the formula for APR
so there you go and I hope you guys
learned at least something from this
thorough and hopefully I didn't get you
addicted to the stock market because hey
we got more c-plus supposed to learn
guys so thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe and yeah
I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
