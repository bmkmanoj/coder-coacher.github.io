today today well I'm gonna be teaching
you about using multiple artboards in
Adobe Illustrator cs6 now in our board
is a region of a document that contains
printable artwork so they're useful for
working with multiple artwork elements
and the artboards are also used as like
crop areas for printing so if you have
like an object let's do it like a local
rectangle here and half of its cut off
only the part that is within the
artboard is actually going to print so
you can do some some artistic things
with that change this color here so next
time I do something it looks a little
cooler and more understandable see there
we go
anyways let's get back to the artboards
so you can create from one artboard to
100 and they can all be different sizes
and you can put them anywhere on the
screen and there's different ways to do
this you can use the new dialog box and
I'll go over these the artboard tools in
the tool panel and the artboard panel
itself so you can specify custom names
for your artboard you can rearrange the
layout and you can reorder artboards and
duplicate them there's a whole bunch of
things you can do with them so artboards
are an important part to Adobe
Illustrator cs6 so let's go ahead and
create an artboard by using the tool on
the tools panel and it's a rate here
this is the artboard one our board tool
shift and o is the is the is the hotkey
I just lost what was called now you can
go ahead and drag in the workspace
and you have just created a new artboard
I click on this little X right there
it's going to delete the one that I just
made now if you want to create an
artboard within in artboard you're going
to hold down shift and then drag and
it's going to create another it's going
to
create an artboard for you now you've
got a second artboard within your
artboard now if you have an artboard
that you like and you want to keep them
the same you want to be able to
duplicate your existing artboard so what
you're going to do is you're going to
click the artboard that you have
selected or that you want to duplicate
it's going to say it up here artboard
one you're going to click on this icon
right here say new artboard and then
you're gonna just place it and move this
over a little we're gonna place it and
now we have a new artboard that is the
same you're able to rename the artboard
up here which is handy so we know now
that these are the same now you can also
create multiple duplicates so you can
alt click so if i go to new and then I
have my artboards over here let's move
them over I hold down alt and click I'm
able to make new ones so that's very
handy so now I've got multiple artboards
here and these are like multiple pages
if I move I could just click off here
let me delete this one so for your last
airport you're gonna want to let go of
the alt button and go to and click and
it won't let you make any more so you
can scroll through your artboards down
here which is nice and now you can see
some of my airports aren't aren't in
order so being able to scroll through
and go to the artboard that you really
want is helpful now there is an artboard
panel and we can open this up using
window and then artboards and we can
quickly go through our boards here
you can create a new artboard as well
and this is or this is the icon for
artboards the couple squares that are
going here and usually it's right below
the layers panel if you're on your
defaults if you want to use in our board
that has a preset a preset size then go
up here to the preset section and then
we've got a whole bunch of different
things so I want to use iPad this time
and now it created an artboard for me
here which I can move over that is the
size of the iPad as you can see it's
bigger than the letter 1 so that's
pretty neat
I showed you how to get rid of our
boards by clicking the little X here now
if you want to get out of the artboard
tool you can just press escape on your
keyboard or you can just go to and click
a different tool so I have this selected
if I click on my selection tool I'm out
of there so either way is up to you we
can go into our boards panel here and
delete as well we can delete out our
ports and now if I look here I've only
got one left
and there we go if you go to view you
can go to fit artboard and window and
that helps out to Center your airports
now if I have artboards a ton of them
and i want to fit them all in a window
let's do that real quick I'm just going
to start placing our boards around
there's a few artboards there I go to
view fit all in window all my artboards
are going to be fit in the window so
that is very handy so that's all I
wanted to show you about our boards this
time in the next tutorial we're gonna
learn how to mess with the artboard
options up here and we're gonna be able
to change them and figure out a little
bit more about our board options and use
like a little dialog box and everything
like that so thanks a lot for watching
stay tuned for the next tutorial where
you can learn a lot more about using
artboards see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
