configure ready to go the first thing I
think that we should do is actually make
that link or the button or whatever you
want to have so they can click on that
because right now our little program is
looking pretty empty so let's go ahead
and do that so outside over PHP just
make a simple html5 file an HTML HTML
you don't even really need a head just
the body alright so basically the only
thing that I'm gonna do is I'm just
gonna have one link and it's gonna say
log in and whether whenever they click
it they're gonna log into Instagram
that's gonna do everything for them so
of course yours is gonna be part of a
website or something a little more
complex but I just want to show you guys
the real basic way of doing it right now
so make a link a href leave this blank
for now and it's gonna say login and
this href or the address that you want
to send them to is actually very
specific and you need to code this in a
very certain kind of way
so it's HTTP colon API dot instagram.com
/ o a uth slash authorize and basically
what this link is is it Instagram said
okay any time you go to this link we're
gonna give you a piece of information
that allows you to authorize your
account so that's all this is doing so
anyways I'll throw out authorize in the
question mark and put client ID that's
the first parameter and for right now
just set it equal to X X X and we'll
fill those in later
now the second parameter redirect
underscore you are I
and we'll just go ahead and set this
equal to X X X 2 and the last parameter
of course you separating them with a an
ampersand is the response underscore
type and set this equal to code this is
actually always gonna be equal to code I
don't even know if he can possibly set
it equal to anything out so I I really
don't even know why the API has it in
there but of course what's gonna happen
is whenever they click login then we're
gonna send them to this address right
here but we need to pass in a couple
parameters the first one being our
client ID which is this so in order to
do that you just code PHP right in there
and you just get up echo out your client
ID and of course since it's not a
variable it's a constant you do not need
any dollar signs or anything like that
and I'll show you guys the result of
this in a second and this is actually
supposed to be URI alright so basically
right now we have a boring website with
a link on it and hopefully um whenever
well show you guys I said I just refresh
this and upload it and now if we go to
index dot PHP and hit enter we see that
we get a very basic login length and if
we inspect this element we can see that
the client ID is indeed our client ID
and even though it doesn't say our
client IDs our client ID in our redirect
URI is the proper thing now whenever we
click this check it out well let me just
go ahead and I'm already actually logged
in but typically what it would do is it
would say this so you clicked it and it
takes you here and if you're already
logged in well that's what it does and
it allows you to enter your
now if you enter improperly like I'm
just banging letters right now and click
login then it says okay try again
nice try so I'm going to enter it in
properly and click login and what it's
going to do now is it says ok this is
the authorize authorization code that I
was talking about and once you click
this it's going to take you to that let
me see if I can get it this redirect URI
right here which is and next up PHP as
you can see that's where it redirected
you to but now what it does is it gives
you this little bit of code right here
so you're like all right Bucky why the
heck did it give me this code and what
can I do with it well that's a very good
question and in the next sorrell I'm
gonna be I hate when people drive past
when I'm making a freaking tutorial but
anyways in the next tutorial I'm gonna
be answering those questions and you
guys are gonna find it quite interesting
so I think eyes for watching and I'll
see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
