Roberts and welcome to very first
tutorial in C programming one of the
most popular programming languages in
the entire world and also before I even
start showing you guys how to code or
what programs you need to get up and
running I want to mention this whenever
you're watching these videos make sure
to watch them in 1080p and also full
screen and that's because I'm going to
be recording my entire desktop so if
you're just on YouTube and you try
watching it in that little video player
then it's not going to work out so again
watching in full-screen 1080 everything
is going to be crystal clear now I'm
also guessing that you guys probably
already know what C is used for and
that's why you want to learn it maybe
you want to make like a computer game or
something but for those people who are
just watching these videos and maybe
they just want an idea of what you can
do with C it's basically used to make
any software on your desktop like all of
these programs you can make and see also
you can make computer games and you can
pretty much um use it to program any
electronic like robots vending machines
stoplights your microwave could be
programmed and C so it's basically a
very widely used programming language
the only thing that you really can't do
with it is you can't like make website
so if you want to learn a programming
language to make websites then I
recommend checking out my PHP videos
that's probably a better place to start
so again if you want to program robots
make computer games and awesome software
then you guys are in the right place so
there are a couple of things that we
need in order to get you know up and
running so we can actually code a C
program the first thing is of course a
place to write the code now you can just
use anything like notepad or if you even
have this this basic notepad right here
but look at this thing it's like the
ugliest program ever I highly do not
recommend this so again you need some
place to write your code and another
thing that you need is a special program
called a compiler now what a compiler
is going to do is it's going to take the
code that you write and turn into code
that the computer can understand the
ones in the zeros so that's the job of
the compiler so of course we need to
download one of those because you know
it doesn't come on Windows by default so
how are we going to get both those
programs well if you go to Google and
you type in code blocks and hit enter go
to this website code blocks org now
after you go to that what this what
we're going to do right now is we're
going to download a piece of software
and it's actually completely free which
is freaking awesome and this is not only
the place that we write the code such as
it's like a awesome version of notepad
but it's also a compiler built into it
so this one program has every single
thing that you need and like I said free
how awesome is that so go to downloads
right here and it's going to say ok you
have to choose a couple of options the
binary release the source code or source
code from the SVN what we want to do is
just get the binary release it's the
most easiest way and then of course it
says okay well operating system that you
have while I am using Windows if you're
using something else then choose your
options on here but I'm going to click
Windows and now I have one more option
to select and that's what I'm piece of
software do you want to download this
basic setup this one that has this men
GW option whatever that is and this one
with all of this stuff with some numbers
after it well I'll explain the different
versions right now what you're typically
want to use is this min GW setup and
this first one right here is just the
raw program it's just the IDE basically
just the notepad part of it now this
next one this mingw this is the compiler
it's it's what you need my guess is that
you don't have a compiler on your
computer already so download this one
and then after we write our code it's
going to
us to translate it to a program that the
computer can run in that we can test out
so again you guys are going to want to
download this one and this is just a
different version and it says right here
um later I read it earlier but it's a
new version and it might have some bugs
in it so this is a stable one right here
the IDE and the compiler so I actually
like to download it from a source book
source Forge kind of a tongue twister so
go ahead and click that link right there
I hate these download pages they're like
one little thing and like 87 ads but
anyways um then this is probably going
to take a little bit to download so I'll
pause my video and um just unpause it
when it's done download</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
