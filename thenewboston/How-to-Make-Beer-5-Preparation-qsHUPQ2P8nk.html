mixing stuff together is we need to make
sure that area is clean this includes
the carpet all surface areas because
like I said the number one reason for
bad batches of beer is contaminated
beard so make sure you what down all
your surfaces especially if you have you
know a dog or cat and they got their
hair all over vacuum your house clean
your kitchen and then you're ready to
move on to the next step now the next
thing that we need to do is we need to
measure out five gallons on our
fermenter now it would be nice if this
you know had little increments on the
side that says 1 2 3 4 5 but it doesn't
this is actually a 6 gallon fermenter in
our recipe calls for only 5 gallons of
beer so how do we know how much beer to
add well an easy way to do this is to
measure up 5 gallons of water in your
bucket and pour it in here and mark with
5 gallons is now remember our beer is
going to be sitting in here so we need
to make sure that anything in here and
this whole thing included is sanitized
now this sanitizer right here calls for
one ounce per five gallons of water now
you guys probably can't see it but I
already measured out five gallons water
right here so go ahead and pour your one
ounce of sanitizer in and mix that up
and once that's mixed what we can do is
we can actually add it to here and Mark
the five gallons levels now if you don't
have a big bucket like this what you can
do is you can just get a gallon of milk
or and of course you don't want to use
milk you want to use this solution well
you can just go ahead and pour five of
those one gallon things so again if you
don't have a bucket with increments on
it you can just go ahead and use one of
those but now let's go ahead and pour
this in here and Mark the five gallon
level alright so go ahead and grab your
funnel set it right on top and Joby's
going to pour all about gallons in here
and it's good to make sure the bubbles
overflow too because he wants something
you want the top of your hand sanitizes
especially right here there's a lot of
bacteria out on this part of your hand
so I'm just gonna use a sharpie to mark
the 5-gallon level right here and also
the cool thing about my fermenter is I
just noticed this there's a little Ridge
right here exactly at the five gallon
mark so if this ever washes off or
something I'm always going to know where
the five gallon mark is right here now
sanitizing the rest of your foam is
actually really easy go ahead and get a
tow or a container I bought this at
Target and it's one of those totes that
you use you know maybe you put it in
your attic the store old closing or old
crap and fill it up with about 10 to 15
gallons of water and make sure you add
sanitizer I already mixed all the
sanitizer in so now this is a sanitized
solution you can just go ahead and set
all your equipment in there so put the
funnel in there mister monitor the
airlock the bum will make sure the
airlock in if anything's floating just
make sure it's immersed and you can
actually throw your entire bucket in
there and if you don't have one of these
coats what people do a lot of the time
is they actually just fill up their
bucket with a solution and put
everything else in the bucket but I like
to put my bucket inside a bigger tote
because that helps me roll around and
get everything sanitized now for the
sanitizer right here your equipment only
needs a sin therefore I don't know if it
was 2 to 5 minutes but a short period of
time so even though we keep it in there
for longer it's not gonna hurt so go
ahead and just leave it in here and then
whenever you need it is gonna be
perfectly sanitized and ready to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
