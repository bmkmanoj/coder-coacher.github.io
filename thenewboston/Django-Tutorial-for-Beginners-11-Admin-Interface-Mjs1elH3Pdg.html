get started with this video I need to
tell you guys a little story has nothing
to do with Python but I just need to
vent so last weekend I went to LA and
when I was flying back I sat next to
this really huge guy and I really didn't
even mind to be honest but the one thing
that bothered me was he didn't even care
that he was taking up like half my seat
like he could have easily moved a little
bit and you know not invading my space
so much but he was just like oh I don't
even care just like hanging over she was
like squished up against you know my
little rail so I was like alright what
am I going to do to get this guy you
know back in the sea so I try to twist a
little air thing on top and blowing it
on him thought that would send him a
message because you know I didn't want
to just ask him and then he didn't move
and then I was like alright what if I
just started coughing because then he's
gonna think I'm sick and then he's gonna
make her want to get away from me you
know maybe clutter up so I started
coughing and he didn't move but you know
what happened he started coughing for
some reason I was great now I got this
huge guy that's coughing all over me so
you know that's what I did for four
hours all right
a minute 15n didn't learn one thing
about Python so that was my story hope
you liked it alright so in this video I
want to talk to you about Python admin
so Gengo already comes with this thing
called admin which pretty much has a
bunch of cool privileges and before I
start showing you guys all the cool
things admin can do we actually need to
create the admin so pop open terminal
and in order to do that just go ahead
and type Python manage that py create
super user create super user got it all
right so it's going to ask you a few
questions username I always just type in
admin now it's going to ask for email
just put anything in there like admin it
example comm of course whenever you're
making this in a production environment
you would want to take the time in
actually fill out something that's real
now password I'm just going to read
pass 1 2 3 4 pass 1 2 3 4 again in a
production environment this is going to
be something that should be you know a
lot more safer and secure other than
password or something but now what you
can do is boot up your site and go to
the admin section so this is already
pre-populated and that's because I just
use the same one on all my development
Django projects we'll go ahead and type
in admin pass 1 2 3 4 or whatever your
username and password is and hit a log
in so we can see already our a so this
is pretty much a administration of the
backend pretty much access to the
database however well I was kind of
hoping for in this is you know a way to
edit that albums table and the users
table one that'd be cool if we could do
that well actually we can so if you go
to music in admin right there I'm going
to show you guys how to have it so you
can pop up albums or songs in there or
whatever tables you want to be able to
manage from your admin area so just go
ahead and delete this alright so the
first thing we need to do is just import
albums so remember where that was from
models import the class album now
another thing we have to do one more
line of code is we just need to tell
Django that admin or excuse me the album
class should have an admin interface in
other words make that um album stable up
here right there I kind of for you
saying album admin admin album whatever
so admin site register album so we're
going to register this album class as an
admin site now go ahead and refresh this
and check it out so under our musics app
we can now see albums now whenever we
click this we can see our two albums
that were in their high school myth read
by Taylor Swift and if we were like
alright you know what this was
supposed to be middle school all we have
to do is click it and then we can see
the details view of that album so I can
change it to middle school or let's just
change it to like skate bar something
super different so skate park save and
continue editing and that's going to
keep you on this page or you can of
course just save it delete it and the
cool thing is you have this cool little
um what's called breadcrumbs at the top
so you can navigate around easily so
again this is the admin section and
there's a lot of stuff you can do but
for now I just want to give you guys a
real quick basic overview you know get
your I don't know what's it called your
tongues a little bit let your whistle
does that mean something weird perverted
if so nevermind just want to give you
guys a real quick introduction get you
guys excited about it so then guys for
watching I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
