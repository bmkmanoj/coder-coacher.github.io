welcome to your 24th tutorial and in
this tutorial I'm gonna begin talking
about object-oriented programming what
objects are and I'm also going to be
showing you guys some built-in objects
in JavaScript so object-oriented
programming is definitely one of the
coolest features on JavaScript but it's
also one of the most easily
misunderstood so if you ever took a
javascript class or maybe you're taking
one right now
or maybe just someone tried to explain
objects to you it sounded so confusing
and it was just totally twisted and you
didn't really understand anything and
also if you ever read any books then it
was like what the heck are they talking
about so everything up until now has
been pretty easy with computer
programming I mean we pretty much could
read something or watch the video and
understand it but object-oriented
programming it kind of throws a twist on
computer programming because everything
was kind of set out for you before but
now we're going to be beginning to kind
of make our own datatypes and stuff like
that
so before I confuse it any further let
me just say this I'm going to be making
it really easy to understand what
objects are so just stick with my videos
and trust me it's going to be a whole
lot more simple for you
so let me just say this if you don't
even know what an object is I just put
it in the most basic terms an object is
pretty much a weird piece of data that
has its own properties and methods for
example I'm not talking about computer
programming language here I'm talking
about real life if I was an object bucky
Roberts I would have my own properties
and my properties would be like things
you could put in variables like hair
color brown arm favorite baseball team
Red Sox
I color brown car blue height 5/6
weight 180 whatever even though I'm not
180 just saying alright so now we have
an object with all these properties and
aside from properties I can also have
something called methods now methods
would be the thing that the object does
so let's list some methods for Bucky
Roberts drive a car eat hot pockets make
video tutorials play call of duty so now
you can see that an object has two
things properties which are all the
variables and methods which are all the
things that the object does so now
combining those two things you have a
pretty good blueprint or outline of me
of my life of my object so let's go
ahead and take a look at some of the
properties and methods that are already
built in JavaScript so let's go ahead
and make just a regular variable called
tuna and we'll set this equal to some
text like hey I am a tuna fish
explanation point we'll check it out did
you know that this variable tuna is
indeed an object with its own properties
so in order to get the properties or get
the methods of an object we need to use
something called a dot separator in
order to do this the syntax is this go
ahead and list your object which is in
this case tuna then go ahead and add
your dot separator and after this you
can go ahead and list all the properties
or all the methods that are associated
with this object so like I said even
though you may not know it tuna has a
property in it then this is built in the
JavaScript already I'm not making any of
this up it's called the length just like
that and what this does is it counts how
many characters are in the variable
which honor this is probably somewhere
close to 18 or something and it pretty
much is listed as a number it's one of
the properties associated with that
variable so if we wanted to write it out
on-screen just write document
right and then we just go ahead and
write tuna dot length so let's go ahead
and save this refresh and see what we
get 21 I was a little bit off but
anyways now we can see that this object
tuna which is actually a variable it has
a property of it called length and that
length pretty much tells you a little
more about this tuna object so that's
basically one of the properties that is
built in javascript but for example one
of my properties would be like Bucky arm
hair and that would say brown eyes that
would say Brown - arm weight that would
be like 150 so that is basically what a
property is so like I said objects have
two things properties and methods we
already took a look at properties now
let's go ahead and take a look at
methods and in order to do this we don't
even have to learn anything new because
we've been using something all along and
that is document dot write and then this
is how you write something out on the
screen like hey now brown cow so I know
I didn't talk about this really before
because I didn't want to talk about
object-oriented programming but now it
is time to understand what this all
means well believe it or not the
document is actually an object itself if
you're looking at your web browser right
here you see a bunch of little pieces
the toolbar the you know your favorites
the X maximize minimize and this big
white box right here that's pretty much
the body of your web page it's a big
white square and in JavaScript language
this is called the documents of your web
page so that's where the object the
document gets its name from it's pretty
much the document so all these pieces
those are called different things but
this is the document object if it had
properties it would be white rectangle
for sides maybe it could be maybe you
could calculate its perimeter or area or
anything but those would be all the
properties associated with it now the
method
with the document it can do basically
one thing we learn so far and that's
write text on the screen so now you can
see that just like before you write your
object name to the left hand side which
is document and to the right hand side
you write the method and this method is
called right so that's why you can use
objects and methods to actually do
something so for example if you're
writing something with my object you
would write Bucky right here in order
write eat hot pockets right here or you
might write Bucky make tutorials right
there but now the object is document and
one of the methods is right and of
course I don't have to tell you guys
what this means
it just means write text out on the
screen so all I want to get through you
guys in this tutorial is there are some
objects that are already built in
JavaScript and in order to use them you
go ahead and write the object name with
the dot separator and you can either
write the variables or properties right
here or the functions and methods right
there so that is what a dot separator is
and that's the basics of objects it's
pretty much pretty much as something
with its own properties and methods
simple enough so now are you saying all
right that was interesting and also now
what do you want me to do like go ahead
and memorize every single object that's
built into JavaScript well you can do
that but it would be kind of a waste of
time the reason I'm showing you guys
this is because in the next tutorial I'm
going to teach you guys how to create
objects of your own and like I said I
gave you guys an example like Bucky eat
hot pockets and stuff but we're going to
be making objects and having them do
computer related stuff like pop-up alert
boxes and open windows and maybe make
some calculations or something so now
that you understand the basics of an
object and how you can separate things
using a dot separator we can begin
making our very own objects so I know
this is a little confusing and different
than what we've been learning before but
trust me once you learn this a whole new
world is going to be open up to you and
your life you're going to feel fulfilled
so if you had any empty feeling in your
heart before or maybe you were depressed
trust me this is the best this is the
best medicine object-oriented program so
that's all I have for you guys that's my
inspirational speech for this video so
thank you guys for watching in next
video we're going to be creating our
very own objects so I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
