let's see sixth I think HTML tutorial
and in this tutorial I'm going to start
talking to you guys about something
called pseudo classes now pseudo classes
is something we got in css3 and it gives
us more control or the styling of our
website so let me go ahead and add
something again I cleared everything out
in my main CSS so we're pretty much
working with this main blank template
and I'm going to go ahead and additive
and I'm going to give it an ID of mommy
now I'm going to be giving it this ID
name because I want to represent how
this is a parent of all the things
inside because I can't remember in my
XHTML tutorials if I talk to you guys
about parents and children but basically
whenever you have a tag anything inside
that tag is the child for example this
paragraph is a child of this div in this
div likewise is a parent of this
paragraph so that's kind of the
structure everything inside something
else is a child of it and you can also
say it like this this paragraph is a
grandchild of this body so anyways I'm
going to be saying child and parent a
lot so I just didn't want you guys to
get confused I think I'll you know
mention that so let's go ahead and add
some pet excuse me I saw I messed up
here I'll go ahead and say Bucky is the
child and mommy is the parent so anyways
what would I say I think I say tuna and
bacon derp that sounds like something I
would say so I'll go ahead and throw
that in there and I'm going to add about
six actually about five children because
that fits nicely in my screen recorder
so basically my setup is this I have a
div mommy which is the parent of these
five children now these five children
all belong to the class of Bucky so
you're saying okay Bucky why the heck
would you do that well I did that to
demonstrate something called a pseudo
class now like I said a pseudo class is
basically a way that we can have more
control over all of the elements or in
this case all of our children so let's
go ahead and I'm going to show you guys
an example of something called the enth
child which pretty much allows us to
represent one of these children
according to a number so say P n - child
and yes this is a - or - however you
want to say it you can have something
written like this and what this would
mean is any paragraph that is the third
child and we can go ahead and apply
attribute to it get styled I don't know
I'll just turn the font green or
something so what happens if we go ahead
and save this and run and Chrome we can
see that any third child that's
paragraph gets styled with that green
color pretty weird huh but it's kind of
useful and you're saying okay buggy let
me look at this again I understand that
if you have a bunch of paragraphs that
are children of another thing in this
case they're children of this div tag
right here then the third child would be
green but Bucky this has to be the most
useless thing I've ever seen in my
entire life
if I wanted this effect right here then
I could just go right here and apply an
inline CSS style to this one it would
save me a whole lot of time and I don't
got to worry about this child and a
number of stupid crap like that well I
want to say this you are absolutely
correct
and that's why this technique right here
using just one child singled out it
isn't the most commonly used technique
in other words it's kind of useless what
people typically do is they add keywords
or formulas in here so you could write
something like odd and that is actually
a keyword that css3 recognizes and now
whenever you refresh every odd element 1
3 &amp;amp; 5 every odd child now gets styled
that color so saying okay that's kind of
more useful because then if I have a
site that's you know maybe a list of
links and I didn't know if there are
going to be ten links or 20 links or
maybe it's a cool site that changes
every day now you could have every other
one styled and if you have a huge list
of stuff it's kind of useful to change
every other color because then it's
easier to see so maybe you know
having a christmas-themed on I don't
know let's say you're making a site like
YouTube where you had a huge list of
videos so every odd one would be green
and every even one would be red so let's
go ahead and change it and check it out
so every odd one is green every even one
is red in another way this comes in
handy is if you have a huge table like
if you have an auction site like eBay or
something you could have every other row
a different color and it's going to make
your items a whole lot easier to see so
not only with paragraphs but you you can
also apply this to table rows and it's
going to make your life a whole lot
easier so again that's what they more
commonly use the nth child for instead
of just singling out one element and
another thing I want to point out is you
can also write formulas in here like for
n plus 1 or something and you can use
these complex formulas if you want to
say only turn every four rows blue oh my
voice crack right there that's kind of
embarrassing sorry I'm just starting to
go through puberty a lot of changes in
my life right now but anyways if you
want to like change every fourth row
like four eight twelve sixteen blue you
can do that using these formulas as well
but we don't got time for formulas for
this tutorial I got to move on to the
negation pseudo classes in the next
tutorial I got crap to do I got people
to go through so anyways thank you guys
for watching don't forget subscribe and
I'll see you guys in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
