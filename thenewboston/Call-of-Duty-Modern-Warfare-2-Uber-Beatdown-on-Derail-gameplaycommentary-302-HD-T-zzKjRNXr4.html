am playing a game who use a nice quick
scope right there of death match on
derail with a Barrett 50 Cal as if you
thought it probably could have guessed
at this point stopping power sleight of
hand pro and steady aim and in this
video I am going to be talking about ooh
that was a nice headshot right there but
most of you would have not been able to
put most of you know yeah most of you
would have not had been able to pull
that off epic fail on my part I'm going
to be talking about my perks setup and
I'm not and what I think at least not
saying what you guys should have but at
least what you like what I would
recommend for you guys maybe it okay I
was going to say maybe I don't use a
sniper on this map okay um that's I'm
going to talk about my sniper setup in
this game my sniper setup is always
sniper that being intervention or
Barrett 50 Cal whatever I whatever I
prefer what I feel like using at the
time actually I just want to say
something about choosing your gun when
you're choosing your sniper look at what
you play if you play regular games use
the intervention over Barrett if you
play hardcore the bullet weapons do more
put bullet so I'd recommend either using
a Barrett I mean not a not a Barrett
a wazoo or wa2000 is wazoo as like I
like to call my brother legend called
him or a mmm 21 EVR which is a very good
sniper rifle in itself which not sure
why the m21 wasn't an actual sniper
rifle in Call of Duty 4 it was just a
regular assault rifle that unfortunately
sucked
okay um my sniper loadout or my sniper
setup for this game is usually stopping
usually no not usually as always dr.
tower pro sleight-of-hand pro unless I
don't have the pro part of that yet and
steady aim or steady aim pro which or
Ninja Pro depending on if I'm playing
searching on steady aim pro reason why a
snipers use it is because if you have
not if you do not know this by now you
either don't snipe or you never use or
you never used it
it lets you hold in it lets you hold
your breath longer as a sniper so let's
say you know when you hold if you're
gonna play on your xbox or whatever
system and you hold down left trigger I
think it is our left analog stick that's
what it is or whatever I don't even know
what it's called whatever the button is
to hold down or to hold your breath so
you can steady what you where you want
to shoot the time that you get to hold
your breath extends
so you could hold your breath longer
take more accurate shots take your time
with your shots and it actually is quite
helpful at times
stopping power and stopping power Pro
stopping power Pro usually does usually
wouldn't help you unless you're going to
use no not stopping power Pro usually
doesn't help with a sniper class I mean
the pro part of it stopping power always
helps with the sniper class that it
should be a default for a sniper class
when your sniper class the pro part of
it is usually not needed unless you want
to use our unless you want to shoot down
like UAV or something like that because
yes you can hurt a chopper gunner a
Harrier helicopter whatever the hell you
want to shoot down but you can uh but
what you can't but you're not going to
be able to put enough shots into it that
where it's gonna actually shoot it down
a sleight-of-hand pro is definitely is
actually probably the most important
weapon when it comes to your sniper
class is your sniper class unless you
feel like a noob and don't quickscope or
don't know how to quickscope or anything
like that which I'm not calling you if
you don't know how to quick scopes I
don't leave a hate comment what you can
do is what you should do is if you don't
know what sleight-of-hand pro does which
you probably should because it's one of
the first perks that you get that should
have been a two for one right there what
what it does is it lets you get into
your iron sites or sites faster which if
you don't uh which that helps by getting
it to your scope or if you're using an
ink house ago going up to the egg hug
scope you're using a lot faster which it
really does help for no scope are not no
scoping you don't use your scope and no
scope for it for a quick scope down here
if you're a running gunner sniper
which most professionals either most
professionals or MLG players have either
done or probably our snipers or at least
know how to snipe and what you do is you
put on you put on sleight of hand pro
and it lets you go and it lets you
instead of like this taking like a half
a second to go with your scope it takes
about half time so it takes about a
quarter of a second to go into your
scope which even on if you're getting at
your sidearm that's even helpful and
even an even just the sleight-of-hand
alone if you don't snipe and want this
knife if you don't even have sleight of
hand Pro just put on or if you've never
use sleight of hand start using it it's
very helpful and watch I just want to
say painkiller noob so I hope you guys
like this I hope you guys like this
