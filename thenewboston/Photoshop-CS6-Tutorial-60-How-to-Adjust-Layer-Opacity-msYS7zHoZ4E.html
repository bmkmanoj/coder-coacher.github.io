tutorial about layer opacity in
Photoshop cs6 my name is buddy Blackford
and let's get started by going over this
it shouldn't take too long only a couple
of minutes to teach you about the
different to teacher about layer opacity
now what I have is just one layer here
and I have a text layer you just all you
need is just one layer opacity is the
transparency of a layer and if I click
on it in the layers panel up here there
becomes a little slider and if you move
the slider and makes your image more
transparent when you go to the left or
more opaque when you go to the right and
that affects how you are how the layer
is seen now the opacity slider has
hotkeys that you can use which is pretty
cool if you press one it's going to
change the opacity to 10% so let me go
onto the layer here and press 1 and set
the opacity to 10%
if I hit 4 it's going to change it to
40% and it makes a noise on my computer
for some reason I don't know why but
those are the hotkeys if you just want
to do that real quick so you can change
the opacity of any layer except for a
background layer or a locked layer
however if you want to change the
opacity of the background layer all you
need to do is unlock it and then you can
apply the opacity that way so opacity
affects layer styles and blending modes
just remember that while this fill
opacity here which is this let me go
back to my layer here this opacity here
which is called fill it affects the
pixels that you paint on or the like
shapes that you might draw on here using
like the shape layer or anything like
that so and it does that without
affecting the opacity applied to like
Lehr effects like
these effects down here your different
layer effects like inner glows or color
overlay or something like that doesn't
affect those so that's it for opacity is
really quick really easy and I thank you
for watching have a good one everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
