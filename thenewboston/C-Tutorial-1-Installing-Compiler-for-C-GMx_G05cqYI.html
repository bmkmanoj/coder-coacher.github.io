C++ tutorial and then these tutorials
I'm going to be teaching at a program
language c-plus plus now I'm going to
assume that you guys have no programming
experience so I'm going to start with
the very basics and the first thing that
you need to get started is something
called a compiler and to do that going
to Google I see I have fire work Firefox
open and type in dev C++ then search at
Google and the first thing that you'll
find the first result is called blood
shed software so click on that and then
and then go to the download page and
click download now click on the dev C++
link right at the top and this will give
you a page where you can go to the
download page click go to the download
page and then from here you can download
as you can see all of your downloads for
a compiler and you're going to want to
click the first one most likely download
from SourceForge and what this is going
to do is give you a compiler for C++ now
what a compiler is is pretty much a
program that lets you type in C++ code
and run it on your computer so
talk more about compilers later but once
you download that I'm not going to click
that because it's going to try to
download my computer and I already have
it but you can X out of that and once
you finish downloading it you can go to
start all programs bloodshed and click
on dev C++
they click on it here we go now
I guess you can say Kyle's what a
compiler is this will give you this just
click X is um it allows you to run code
to a specific piece to the specific
application because a C++ is a language
that you can use on either your computer
or a cell phone or a traffic light or
anything like that and instead of
writing new code every time you wanted
to type it to your computer and you
wanted to use a new code for a traffic
light if your program a traffic light
you only have to write one code and the
compiler changes all of it for you so um
that's a little background about a
compiler you didn't really need to know
that but but anyways once you have dev
C++ open all you need look its file new
source file and once you have this we're
ready to begin working on c-plus plus so
I hope you enjoyed your first tutorial I
hope your download goes well so stay
tuned for the next of my tutorials and
we're actually be getting into some code
and if you haven't already make sure to
subscribe to my channel thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
