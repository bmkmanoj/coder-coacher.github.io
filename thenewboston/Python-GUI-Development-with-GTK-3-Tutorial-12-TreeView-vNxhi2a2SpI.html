in this video I'm gonna show you one of
the coolest features of gtk and that is
a tree view now a tree view is a way
that you can display data in kind of a
grid format like rows and columns now
it's cool because it comes with a lot of
built-in functionality like how to sort
your columns how to filter out data and
a lot of stuff that would usually be a
pain in the butt to write gtk comes with
an already built in and it isn't just
text that you can display in here you
can display progress bars and images so
let's say you want to make a program
that allows users to download music from
the internet well you might want to have
all of their each song on a new row and
then like a progress bar to show you
know the progress of the download this
would be perfect for that and you know
million other reasons so in this video
what I did is I already plopped in a
list of tuples right here and I'm just
going to display like um it'll be like a
database of people their name their age
and their profession but uh in the
future tutorials I'm gonna show you how
to add progress bars and images and how
to sort and do a whole bunch of stuff
but before we begin check this out you
see we have a bunch of data right here
typically this data will come from
database or whatever we can't just take
this and put it directly into the tree
view we actually need to convert it into
a new type of data called a list store
first so illicit or is basically the
same thing as this but it's just
compatible for a tree view now here is
one of the coolest things you guys are
like okay what happens if I display this
data to the user and Bucky wants to
update his name so you're probably going
to have to update it in the list store
and then you have to go to the tree view
which is the thing that's display to the
user and finally what row and column it
is and do that sounds like a pain in the
butt well it doesn't work like that all
you have to do is update it in your list
store in automatically updates in the
view it's super awesome so I'm gonna
shut up and show you guys what I'm
talking about all right
sorry converts data to lists store and
just write list that tree views can
display all right so we just have a
given name I'll write like a people list
or and set this equal to g TK lists or
now for the constructor what you have to
pass it in is what type of data is it
going to hold now if you look at my
tuples each row is a string and then an
integer and then a string so that's what
we have to pass in just so it's aware so
string int string and now we can pretty
much start adding rows to the list store
so what I'm going to do is I'm just
going to loop through people and then
row by row I'm going to add these to the
list or this is easy stuff so right for
item in people people list or append
this item
all right so all this does is it loops
through people which is this right here
and one by one it takes these and adds
them to the list store so now that list
store again what we can do is we can
stick that in the tree view and it's
going to be beautiful but before we do
that I'll show you guys one cool trick
and that is just how to access your data
if you need to so now it's in the people
list store and let me just do something
like this so since row and people list
or prints oh I just do a row show you
guys another cool trick - so this is
going to do is just going to loop
through your list store and it's just
going to print out all the data in that
row now if you only want to print out a
certain bit of data such as like here
let me comment these one by one in
Toronto so check this out first so again
what we're doing right here is we're
just looping through Arliss store and
printing out the data so we can access
it that way and also if we want to do
something like print out the third
column remember 0 1 2 so whenever I run
this then it prints out all of the data
in the third column aka this item right
here so there we go that is how we can
access that and let me comment those out
so they aren't so let me get rid of this
I'll put it on my github page so if you
guys want it but I don't want it to call
it over my program that was just a
little quick example all right so the
next thing we have to do is we need to
make a tree view and we need to say that
hey whenever we make our tree view this
is the data that you're going to display
so
item that is displayed all right so what
I can do is just this sorry people tree
view keep things really self-explanatory
and we need to set this equal to a tree
view and what we pass in is just a list
store all right so now we have a tree
view and is connected to this data now
remember at any time we want to update
something for the user we don't have to
you know worry about the tree view all
we have to do is change it into the list
store and now automatically updates in
the tree view since they're connected
pretty sweet so now what we're going to
do is we're actually going to go through
and we're gonna start building the
columns so why do we have to do this I
mean we already told it what data it's
supposed to display why do we have to
tell it what columns do well this is
another cool thing so say that um like
you want to make a program to list all
the users but they also have an ID
number but the ID number is just for
your records and you don't really want
to display it to them well you can say
okay only display this column and their
profession but keep this hidden or maybe
we can say okay we can add a button to
either hide this column or display it so
it gives us a lot of control and
sometimes there's data that we don't
want to display but still have in our
database so it's pretty awesome so I'm
gonna do for I call title the enumerates
name-o explain like I'm doing in just a
second age and profession heart and I
spoke refreshing wrong there we go I am
a moron alright alright so what we do is
we go through one by one and we build
columns now whenever we build a column
we have to give it a title and the title
is just what appears at the top of the
column and then you know just like um
Microsoft Excel or something all of your
data appears below it so what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna go through this list
right here and the first one we build is
just gonna have the title name then age
then profession now if you guys didn't
know whenever you are looping through
something like this you can enumerate it
and what that does is it gives you a
counter so you don't have to do anything
like I equals 0 and then you know like I
plus equals 1 oMG you know what just
enumerate it and that's what that does
so you know pretty cool tip and I'll
show you guys how to make these right
now so the first thing you need to do is
you need to make a cell renderer and
this is how do you want to draw the data
inside that specific cell now the reason
you need to do this is because like I
said it isn't just like a boring
spreadsheet like Excel we can only
display text you can also display images
and you can also display progress bars
so you need to tell your program exactly
how to draw or render the data now I'll
just say um how to draw the data now for
this example remember we're just drawing
plain old text no images or you know
cool progress bars or graphs or anything
like that so renderer equals
right there
so render text rnd are you are alright
looking good alright so now we got a
renderer that can draw text so now let's
use it so for each column what we're
gonna do is we're gonna set it equal to
g TK treeview column now the parameters
are of this our first what's the column
title so it's going to look through in
the first time it's gonna be the name
the second time is gonna be agent and
third time it's gonna be profession the
next parameter is just your renderer and
the third one is just that counter
variable which is I and we can use this
for sorting so whenever we want to sort
it will say sorts and it kind of gives
it an ID number for the column that's
all we're doing right there and I want
to add this just say uh so I know is
column number a be a little bit easier
to understand all right so two more
lines of code the first one is now that
we have a column created we just have to
add it to the tree view so and that is
people with tree view all you do is
append the column a pent own column so
all this loop does is it creates three
columns and then adds them to the tree
view and now the last thing alright make
sure are you nice and organized is just
the add the tree view to the layout
and for that you guys already know this
layout's pack starts which review true
true zero alright so if everything looks
good let me go ahead and run this and uh
I was thinking of the title and I
accidentally with that instead of text
alright so the text I was confusing it
with title anyways it's me being stupid
but there you go
alright so check it out we now have this
beautiful tree view now right now we
can't do a whole lot to except click on
these rows and nothing happens well in
the upcoming tutorials what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna show you guys how to sort
your columns and this is only one more
line of code so you know it's super easy
and also how to add progress bars and
also whenever you click then you can you
know have a call back and it'll print
something out on the screen so a whole
bunch of cool stuff if this looks boring
then wait to you guys see the upcoming
tutorials so enough of me blabbering I
will see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
