Android tutorial for the new boss in
what I'm going to do in this tutorials
kind of give you guys an overview of
what this package holds and what
everything means
but basically before we do that I want
you guys go to the window tab and then
Android SDK AVD manager click on our
device and hit start and probably you
want to scale the size down because a
lot of times it's pretty big so I like
to put six for the screen size and
that's going to be about 46% of what
normally would launch and hit OK or
start and there we go our emulators
started now now I'm going to talk
through like said basically this package
and we're going to add a couple
additional folders for developing for
Android
now the first folder that you guys see
is SRC standing for source and this is
the code of all of our Java that we're
going to develop and here's our package
name that we set up within our package
name here's our Java class called
starting point now we can add additional
Java classes within here activities that
we're going to use so that just think of
the source as where we're going to keep
all of our Java anytime we're working
with the source it's going to be Java
now the djinn folder again you see our
package name within there and within
there we have a Java again a code called
AR this is basically our resources we
aren't going to do anything with this
ever because basically it generates
itself automatically if you open that up
it kind of shows some resources that
setup it's kind of a reference point and
it's nice that Android will basically
generate that for us so make sure you
never mess around with that one and then
the Android 2.2 this is where all the
magic is this is what where the power is
for the most part this is our platform
again you guys can see the jar it comes
or there's a Android jar in there and
basically this holds a ton of different
projects or packages I'm sorry ton
different packages within those packages
they have classes and within those
classes they have
methods so we can use some methods from
this package these packages as well so
that's a ton of power as you can see
there's a ton of different packages and
I said a ton like a ton of times but
yeah there's a lot in there basically
just like our package except they have a
lot more classes and a lot more methods
within those classes then what we have
set up so basically that's where the
Android SDK comes in handy and we needed
because of all the methods the assets
folder we'll get into later within the
series basically you can keep some
resources in there and use the assets
decoder for the most part and get those
resources but mainly what we're going to
do or at least start out with for when
we're using resources like images and
layouts and all that good stuff
we're going to do that within our
resource folder right here as you can
see there's three drawables this is
where we're going to save some of our
images and this is where we're going to
yeah pretty much just our images as you
can see there's three different folders
you're probably wondering why are there
three different folders well Android
phones some are have a pretty good
density or pretty good resolution to
them some don't so basically what you
can do is if you have an image that
you're going to use for a game or an app
app basically you can save a high
resolution or high density image within
this high density pixel for the most
part folder and then you can have that
same image the same name but of a lower
resolution that you guys have set up
within like the low resolution drawable
and also that stands for medium so again
that you can have the same name but if
you create a three different images that
have different resolutions you can save
them within the appropriate folder and
then when you reference those images in
Java
basically the SDK is going to know which
one of those images should be run on the
phone for you know Optima optimization
for the most part so that's pretty cool
and that's why they have three different
drawable folders now our layout folder
this is going to be our XML basically
our layout
this we're going to get into the XML for
the most part if you double-click on
this main one it has it set up for us
already this is a main XML called the NL
it is this hello world starting point
they did define that for us already and
you know that's basically where we're
going to set up our layouts and XML now
the values tab basically you can keep
values in other references such as
strings and then you can reference those
strings within your layouts or within
you know your job as well so again
that's just four values we're going to
what we're going to do quickly I'm going
to add two new folders we're going to go
right click on a resource folder right
there and go new folder and we're going
to type this or spell this folder a or
our aw for our our our folder and we're
also going to select this package make
sure it's in the right place and make
sure it's the resources and all
lowercase R R hit finish and this is
where we're going to save some sounds
for application so that's going to be
useful we're also going to create one
new folder we're going to call this one
layout minus sign land hit okay
basically that is going to be for when
our phone is tilted on its side if we
want to have an alternative layout we
can put that there we'll get into that
later but I just want you guys have
those folders set up now the last thing
that we're going to define our I'm going
to kind of describe for the most part is
the Android manifest this is where
everything for the most part comes
together if you guys click on it and go
down here on the right side you can go
into the actual XML code it's a little
bit easier for me to explain basically
it resources everything that we have
like the version or the API level the
application and the application icon
which is set to a default that they
imported for us as you can see within
the drawable folder our application name
that we set up when we create our
project our starting point class our
activity for the most part
that's the activity bracket so this is
for one activity called starting point
that is within our application basically
it's and if you go over here
this activity is our launcher item so
when our activity starts it's going to
look for the launcher item and start
this activity starting point so
basically that manifest pulls everything
together and adds your resources for all
your different activities and you can
set up some sweet stuff in within here
as well now if your application needs to
access the internet or you know you want
to pull some data from a text message
that someone gets and then you post it
on their Facebook wall without them
knowing basically you're going to use
permissions you need to get permissions
like I want to use the permission of the
Internet and you would define those
permissions within the manifest and then
when someone downloads your application
off the marketplace they're going to see
which permissions your app needs such as
oh it needs the internet oh it needs you
know a receiver of some sort oh it needs
to access my camera what is this
application doing basically they're
going to see that and then if they want
to download it they can but that's
basically the only place that they're
going to see what permissions we're
going to use we're going to do that
within the XML server within the
manifest so basically that's kind of an
overview only other thing I want you
guys to do real quick is just
right-click on your whole package go to
run as Android application that's going
to load up on our emulator again what's
going to happen well I'm just going to
briefly talk through everything that's
happening as it's loading or it's
installing onto our emulator it's
looking for the launcher item like I
said within the manifest that calls this
starting point class and then it will
call this starting point class that we
set up right here which is an activity
class and within the activity it sets
the content view to our layout main I
know this is quick overview but our dot
layout domain which R stands for a
resource folder then our layout folder
and then our
xml again which looks like this so it's
going to set the content view to that
and that's basically kind of a quick
overview of how the activity works for
the most part and i'll catch you guys in
the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
