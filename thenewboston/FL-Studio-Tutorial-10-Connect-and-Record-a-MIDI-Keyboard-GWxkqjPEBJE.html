tenth FL studio tutorial and in this
video I'm going to be teaching you guys
how to set up a MIDI keyboard to use
with FL studio now the first thing that
you need to do before you go to any of
these settings is you need to install
the keyboard itself so it's compatible
with your computer and the only thing
you need to do in order to do this is
just install the driver now there are a
couple of different ways that you do
this depending on which keyboard you
bought it may just come with a CD that
you pop into your computer pressing next
next next it's good to go another thing
that you may have to do is go to the
website like Yamaha or casio whatever
keyboard you got and then you installed
the driver from there download it
whatever but typically if you have a
newer operating system as soon as you
plug the USB cord in from your keyboard
to your computer it's going to recognize
it and it's going to install a basic
driver so that's what I did
from this keyboard right here I just
plugged it in in my computer is like
alright you plug something in we're
installing the driver you're good to go
so it's very simple so that depends on
again whenever you get your keyboard
just look at the instructions and that's
going to give you the installation
instructions so once your keyboard is
installed now what we have to do is we
need to enable it in FL Studio or make
it compatible so this is how you do that
up in options go to MIDI settings or you
can also just click f10 if you're
feeling pretty lazy now these outputs
right here are irrelevant right now the
input is what we're worried about
these are pretty much are all of the
external things such as our electronic
keyboard that we want FL Studio to
recognize so make sure that you have
whatever you just installed your MIDI
keyboard and hit enable and you know
that it's enabled because it says on and
this thing is gold right now so now you
can go ahead and close it and you can
test it out by just hitting some keys on
your keyboard and you should be able to
hear it in FL studio so how frickin
sweet is that so now you're saying
alright so I can tap this crap and
you know it plays I can hear it through
FL studio' not that cool well I'm
concerned with is how to record my music
using FL Studio so this is how you do
that the first thing that you should do
is open your piano roll and now go ahead
and delete these notes because I'm going
to go ahead and start with a blank piano
roll and instead of just right-clicking
here's a little short tip you can also
hit this button right here and this is
the select button now if you go ahead
and drag a bunch of notes at once you
can hit delete on your keyboard and it
deletes multiple notes at once so once
you're done with that make sure to click
the draw button again and you're back to
the draw button so now like I said there
are two different ways that you can make
notes in the piano roll you can just
click it with your mouse or like I said
we're going to be learning how to record
with your MIDI keyboard now that it's
set up so before I start recording I
want to show you guys this make sure
that you have this three to one selected
now if it's selected it's going to give
you a countdown so instead of just
hitting record and then you
automatically have to start playing real
quick this is going to give you a four
beat countdown and then you start right
there so again always make sure that you
have this now you're saying okay how do
I record well it's easy go ahead and
press this record button right here and
once you press it this pop-up is going
to appear make sure you press automation
and score and now you see that the
record button is active now whenever you
press play it's going to give you that
four B countdown and as soon as the
countdown ends you're going to start
recording and whatever you press on your
MIDI keyboard it's going to record in
the piano roll so let me go ahead and
get my hand all ready and I'm and make
sure see my mouse is right here so I'm
not hitting any notes so I'm going to go
ahead and press spacebar right now on my
computer baby and now press stop
whenever you're done and now you can see
that as soon as you press stop all of
the information
that was captured during that recording
session is now appearing on my piano
roll right here now the cool thing about
this is whenever you go ahead and play
it
air-cool it records the entire thing so
you can just you know play it again rock
baby all right so now we can go ahead
and get rid of that countdown because we
aren't recording anymore Rock Me Baby
all right pretty sweet but now I'm
looking at this and I'm like wow I
thought I was a great piano player but
it turns out I'm not I held that Ino too
long and you know maybe I wanted to do
you know play a different note here
maybe I wanted to play G instead of E so
I'm like you know what I either can
record it again or I can just go back
and edit it at all so I'm going to go
ahead and change this shorten it up and
I'm going to move this up to G excuse me
I got whooping cough so that's the
awesome thing about playing a MIDI
keyboard over your song recording you
can play it in real life and you know if
you're a musician it may be a lot easier
than trying to hit every single note and
also if you say that you know what
this is a sweet pattern but I only want
to change one note you don't have to
record the entire thing again you can
just go and edit it with a computer or
fix any of your mistakes manually so now
again Rock baby how awesome is that so
now we combined the ease of playing it
in real life with the ability to perfect
it or edit it on the computer so that is
why MIDI keyboards are awesome and again
like I said it's really easy to set up
just install it make sure that it's
enabled and then you're pretty much good
to go so thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe and more crap
that's going to be awesome in the next
video so again make sure to follow me on
Facebook Twitter and I'll see you next
