easy part now that we're done typing all
the hard code the background
functionality to pretty much make our
app work with the SQL database what we
can do is just say okay this is the
button to add a product this is the
button to Daliya product we essentially
just need to hook up our interface with
the code simple enough and we do that
through main activity so all my imports
that we're going to need are right there
so you can just copy all of those now
let's just go ahead and get a reference
to everything on our interface all of
those widgets so edit text we called
that Bucky's input textview we call that
Bucky's text that's where we're going to
be printing everything out and remember
my DB handler will just call this DB
handler all right so now let's go ahead
and on create and do the housekeeping
stuff so buckey's inputs set this equal
to edit text going to view by IDR that
idea dot Bucky's input in the same thing
with Bucky's text equals textview final
view by dr dot ID dot block YZ text now
after this we need to set our DB handler
object and of course that's equal to
knew what my DB handler now remember
whenever we create a new database
handler it takes whereas a constructor
for parameters the context which is just
going to be the keyword this from the
other class and we can just use null for
the name of the database because we
already set it equal the constant right
here we can pass null in for factory you
know do all that behind the scenes in
for the last one we need to pass in in
so we can just pass in one but it will
actually get the value from right
here so again that's this fourth context
no no one essentially we're just letting
this class take care of all the hard
stuff and we already talked about that
before now we're going to have three
methods in here one method is going to
be for this add button remember we said
on click call the add button clicked
another method is going to be for the
delete button delete button click and
the last method is just going to be for
printing this out it's going to be real
simple like three lines of code so
whenever we do that we'll just call a
method called print database we want to
take any parameters at all and it's
giving us an error because we need to
implement that method right there so
this is just going to be public void and
it's not going to take any parameters
the only thing that it's going to do is
it's going to set the text of this to
every retrieve when we call data-based
assuring simple enough so the first
thing we need is a string and we might
as well just reference it through DB
string it's like set it equal to the
database Handler dot and remember that
method was called database to string so
this is what we coded in the last
tutorial and we're just taking whatever
string we retrieved which pretty much is
the product name of every single row and
we're going to store it in that variable
and now we just take that buckey's text
which is our text widget and set the
text not set enabled set the text equal
to DB string
and after this what I want to do is I
want to take Bucky's input and I also
want to set the text equal to blank
right there and the reason I want to do
this is because well I'll explain this
all in just a second essentially we are
going to print the database whatever is
in our file after we add a new item or
after we delete an item so whenever we
type watermelon
and add it then what's going to happen
is it's going to print out watermelon
down here but then just to make it a
little bit easier on the user where we
automatically are going to erase the
text that was in here so that way they
didn't add watermelon and the word
watermelon so chillin up there so this
just makes it a little bit easier on the
user if you refresh your input forum so
they don't have to delete it manually so
now to the database RA so now we have to
implement that add button clicked so
public void add button clicked and
that's also why we didn't need a
reference to those buttons up here
because whenever we add the on click
method it pretty much takes care of all
the hard work for us which is really
awesome
alright so product and set this equal to
new products
Lucky's input thoughts get text that's
two string and let me type all this in
then I'll explain what's going on so DB
Handler and product product and print
the database all right so whenever they
click the Add button what we want to do
is we want to say okay they're going to
have type something in here like I don't
know what's something that you can have
in your store tennis shoes so we're
going to take tennis shoes add it to the
database so we're going to save it to a
file and then we're going to display
tennis shoes down here now if you look
in our code whenever we add a new
product to the database we don't just
add the string we actually create a new
product object in every time we create a
product object it sets the product
property to whatever we pass it in like
tennis shoes so remember this is the
database Handler and whenever it adds a
product to the database it only accepts
a product object so if you look at
product
to add a new row to the database it
doesn't accept a string it only accept a
product object so whenever we pass in
the object it's going to extract the
name the string value and then it's
going to insert that string into the
database so again this products is just
normal objects normal Java code this is
making everything compatible so it can
insert it or extract it from the
database and this is just hooking up the
interface with all of our code and of
course we know what this does it pretty
much makes a string up here on the
screen and the only method that we need
is that delete method and that's public
void delete button clicked and my
alright and also another thing I always
forget to do is make sure you pass in
your views as your parameters if you
don't then it's not going to register
that onclick method or whatever you set
on click as alright so to delete an item
pretty simple we take string and I'll
just name it something like input text I
set this equal to
all right so all we're doing here is
we're getting whatever text the user
jotted down in that little input and
then whenever we call DB Handler
remember we're going to delete product
now delete product this indeed takes a
string so we don't pass the product here
we actually pass the string value so the
input text we can just pass the string
value right there and then we're going
to print out the database on the screen
so again you can set up your database
handler it a little bit differently but
this should work so let me go ahead and
start my emulator all right so hopefully
whenever we type something like bacon we
can click Add and add it to the database
and then we can let's add a few more
tuna oops not press ENTER and like
meatball and then if you ever want to
delete one you can just type in tuna and
it will delete tuna or whatever word you
type in it will delete it and again I
know that um I can't really demonstrate
it but if you if this was installed on a
phone or if you're testing this on a
device and what you can do is you can
turn off your device and then you can
turn it back on and all the information
in your database is going to be saved so
pretty cool and that is pretty much the
basics of how to work with the SQLite
database to save data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
