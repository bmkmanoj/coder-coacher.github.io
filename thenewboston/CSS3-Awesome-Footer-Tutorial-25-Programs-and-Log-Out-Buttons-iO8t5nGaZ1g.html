believe so many of you guys are still
watching this who would want to put up
with me for 25 videos you guys would and
congratulations because we only have
like three videos to go max and in this
tutorial what I want to do is I want to
show you guys how to make this program
button which is actually very simple and
also this logout bond and actually these
are probably the two most easy things to
make on this footer so you guys are in
luck this is like pretty much a free
tutorial so the program button and um we
might as well go ahead and add a comment
for the logout button log out guys
here's the thing I was always wondering
is logging out two words or is it one
word like a logout I don't know go ahead
and answer in the comments section
because I've always wondered that by
anyways for the program button of course
the first part is easy the first thing
you do whenever you want to make a
button is you add a list item list item
yeah yeah Bucky I knew that already man
let me go ahead and copy this could have
typed it already but and to add any text
on that what you do is you add programs
now on my whip so what I want to do is I
like to make this a little bit different
because we're gonna have a bunch of
programs like a group chat where it's
like a private chat room a private
messenger which is like an instant
messenger built into the website also
all these different programs on my
website but I don't just want to make it
in a usual list because then it doesn't
really look like I kind of want it to
mimic like operating system and that's
what this the point of this entire
footer is it kind of mimics an operating
system within your browser so in order
to achieve this effect what we did is we
built an unordered list in here now
that's why I had to style it a little
bit differently because right now we
already have an unordered list the
entire footer is in the list items are
buttons so whenever we make an unordered
list in here
unordered lists unordered lists what we
need to do is we need to give the class
drop up now it knows that okay this
isn't just a normal unordered list that
you're building your footer this is
actually a special drop menu that kind
of resembles and we already styled this
we don't need to do it again
it's Styles pretty much the programs in
your operating system so of course
whenever we add a list item in here and
I can just make one end copy at a bunch
of times whenever we make a list item in
here a href say that this is you know
maybe you made a group chat or something
you can add a link to the group chat
hold on got a itch in my ear and now
it's going to display is its own little
section and I always thought it would be
a cool idea to make a little icon but
you know I'm just kind of lazy maybe you
know a couple people chatting or maybe a
little message blurb it may be very
calculator you can have like a one two
three four bun anyways it would be cool
if you added a little image icon right
here
but for now we'll keep things simple
this is how you add the items in your
programs drop up menu so what do we have
a group chat like a instant messenger
let's just go ahead and to add two more
meme generator that would be awesome to
have for your website hmm I wonder if
anyone's developing this Oh
Bucky's room comm coming soon and also a
forum would it be cool if you could have
a social network with a forum and you
know a bunch of other programs that
people could work on open-source hmm
there's a website linked below
plug plug anyways that's how you create
a very simple programs menu just like
this it's basically an unordered list
within an unordered list
it's called unordered list ception coin
that copyright it don't use it or out so
I'm gonna see yeah JK alright now I'm
going to show you guys the next easiest
thing and if you thought that this was
easy just wait till you see what I'm
about to show you
guys now so the first thing we need to
do is add another button so list item
list item and of course we want some
text on our button and by the way I'm
making the logout button right now and
as you can see all of these buttons
right here they float to the left
automatically so we're basically going
to build this toolbar and all the
buttons are going to be pushed up
against the Left home account profile
two columns programs but the logout bun
I want to make it on the right-hand side
so in order to do that the first thing
we need to do is href a log out we need
to add some text to our button now
actually in this the entire class the
list item go ahead and write right
probably probably should pick
different words to say that right right
type the word right there we go now what
this does is it make makes this button
float to the right-hand side now we
already said that okay we already styled
all of it so whenever we add the class
right to a list item in other words a
button it takes that button and it
pushes it to the right-hand side so
that's why this logout button isn't
budded up with the rest of these buttons
it's on the right-hand side just like
that and guys if you think that there's
more that we have to do guess what we
don't that's it how freaking sweet is
that so basically in this tutorial we
cover two buttons the program's menu
which is basically a menu within the
menu menu ception or unordered reception
whatever the heck I called it and also
the logout bun basically like a normal
button but you float it or push it to
the right hand side of your screen
boom roasted in the next tutorial we
only have one more thing to cover and
that's adding these little notification
icons as well as this little I don't
know what we what did we call this thing
like the notification blurb that pops up
so on my website I have it where it's a
little envelope and whenever you have a
new message you can just hover over it
and check your messages a real quick
it's
pretty or someone sends you a new friend
request you can hover over it and see
who requested you be because you know
you don't want to go to your friend
request section everyone's lazy that's
another click anyways thing guys for
watching them kids subscribe and I'll
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
