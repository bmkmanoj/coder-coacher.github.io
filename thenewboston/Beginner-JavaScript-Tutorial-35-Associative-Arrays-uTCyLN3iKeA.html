JavaScript tutorial and in this story
I'm going to teach you guys how to use
something called an associative array
now it's kind of different and then the
arrays we've been learning before for
one main reason instead of using array
index numbers to access the elements in
our array we can use strings of
characters instead
so basically words instead of numbers so
let's go ahead and let me show you guys
an example because if I try to explain
it it'll just confuse it if I show you
guys an example it'll make it really
easy to see what's going on
so I'm going to make an array called
Bucky and I'm going to set this equal to
new array let's just go ahead and leave
a blank for now now like I said before
we learned that you can make an array
using index numbers like this but what
an associative array does is it allows
you to use strings of characters such as
the word color and this would set this
basically what associative array is it
associates a word with another variable
instead of a number so now we can set
Bucky color equal to
Bucky's favorite color which is blue
it's actually a tie for blue and white
but you know how to use blue it's
shorter it's like so aside from that we
can add other elements to the Bucky
array so instead of you know 0 or 1 or 2
we can make Bucky array index food and
this might be equal to my favorite food
which is Hot Pockets or mac and cheese
it's a tie but you know might as well
throw hot pockets in there so now as you
can see basically all an associative
array is is instead of numbers like 0 1
2 you can replace it with characters
such as color food name hair color and
how you access this is the exact same so
now we can go ahead and like make
document rights and do something stupid
like
Bucky's favorite food is and then just
go ahead and add a plus and now again
like I said to access and the element in
the array you write the name of your
array and then you write the index which
is either food or color right here so
this is going to print out Bucky's
favorite food is hot pockets hopefully
as long as I didn't miss anything up so
I launched it in Chrome and refresh it
and actually I need a semicolon instead
of a colon there and now I get Bucky's
favorite food is hot pockets so let's
take a look at one more quick example
and just throw color right in there so
now we have an array Bucky that has two
elements in it
Bucky color which is equal to blue and
Bucky food which is equal to hot pockets
so now it's going to say Bucky's
favorite food is blue which makes
absolutely no sense whatsoever but hey
at least it works so check it out
Bucky's favorite food is blue maybe I'm
talking about those kablooey because
whenever I was in fifth grade I these
things called kablooey
they're pretty much a jawbreaker but
they like dyed your mouth blue
what you know why would you want your
mouth dyed blue I don't know about I was
in fifth grade and I absolutely loved it
so so anyways that is what an
associative array is it's really simple
it's just a little bit different than
the arrays that we've been learning
before so anyways now you know the
concepts of an associative array and by
the way let me mention this whenever
you're working with arrays in building
programs later on like calculators and
looking at data and stuff you don't
really use associative arrays as law as
much as you use the other type of array
but they're always nice to know if you
ever come across it so anyways that's
all I have to say in the next tutorials
we're going to be stepping away from a
race and going into another topic so for
now thank you guys for watching don't
forget subscribe and uh yeah I'll see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
