check for is um the content itself so
this is oh sorry this is no different so
what we just need to do is say dollar
underscore post and we need to specify
our contact underscore text and my text
editor online here seems to have got a
bit funny so I'm just going to save this
file and when they close that I'm going
to reopen it in our plain text editor so
we're going to have to deal with plain
text for now but that doesn't really
matter okay so now what we need to do is
that we've checked if we've set the
contact name we've checked if we've set
the contact email and we've checked if
we set the contact text this doesn't
mean that the value actually equals
anything so the next thing we need to do
is we need to check whether these fields
are empty considering they're all
required we need them all to equal at
least one value so we are first of all
going to set them into their own
variable so we can use them a lot easier
inside of our RAM inside of our if
statement so what we're going to I'm
going to do is create an individual
variable for each one so contact
underscore name this can obviously be
anything you like and then we say equals
dollar underscore post and then we say
contact name so what we're doing is
we're just taking this variable here and
we're putting it into a contact name now
you might be asking why aren't we doing
this outside of our if statement and the
reason we're not doing this outside of
our if statement is because this post
might not be set and we're going to get
what's called an undefined index or an
undefined variable error because we're
we're assuming this value exists before
we've checked that they're set so
remember to always declare variables
inside after you've checked for them
being set so now I'm going to say
contact email equals dollar underscore
post
contact email so we're doing exactly the
same thing for each value the waste
submitting contact underscore text
equals dollar underscore post contact
underscore text
okay so we've now got all three
variables from our form let's just go
ahead and echo these out we can put an
echo in front of here and what this is
going to do is just going to echo out
each value so if we click Save Changes
and we come into here let's go ahead and
click send you can see that the form has
been submitted but nothing's happened
with regards to PHP because we've
checked using this is set language
construct so now I'm going to do is I'm
going to type Alex my name I'm going to
type let's say my email address in here
and then I can just type a small message
in here so hi for example now let's
click send and see what happens okay so
you can see that the first variable has
been picked up here which is the net in
the name field and then here we've
picked up the email address and then
here we've picked up the message so
let's go back to our editor and let's
get rid of this echo part six we don't
actually want to echo them out to the
user now after this we can check for
their existence so we can check if they
equal nothing so let's go if not empty
contact name and so using this and
operator again not empty
contact email so empty is basically
checking with this value is equal to
null and not is saying we don't want it
to be empty so in making sure this is
equal to true by saying we don't want it
to be empty so we're saying and not
empty contact on the score text so let's
go down now and we inside here we need
to do something if these do exist or
these do equal something so for now I'm
just going to echo out okay okay so
let's go and try and submit the form
without any data okay now let's put say
a B and C in here click send and that's
okay so that's worked and what we can
actually do is specify an error message
if this if these are our if one of them
are empty well in fact no these are
going to be or because what we're doing
is we're checking if if either of them
or if if one out of the three of them is
empty so we need to use this or instead
of and so I'm going to echo here if else
I'm going to say all fields are required
okay
so let's click Save Changes and see what
happens here so let's click send all
fields are required now we can type a B
or C or an C and click ok so if we were
just just type in a and B here and we
click send all we're still getting oh no
sorry sorry my mistake completely they
should be and now the reason I got
confused there is because we what we
would do is if this if this if statement
was if empty if empty empty empty we
would say if empty contact name or empty
contact email but we're saying not empty
and we don't want any of them to be
empty so many apologies for that okay so
if they are not empty what do you want
to do well that's easy we want to send
an email to us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
