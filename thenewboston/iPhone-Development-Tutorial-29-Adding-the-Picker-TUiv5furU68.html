development tutorial and in this store
we're going to be working in the date
Packard class so go ahead and open up
the interface file for that and the
first thing that we're going to want to
do and pretty much the only thing well I
guess it's not the only thing now that I
think about a little more is we want to
add an outlet and what this outlet is
going to allow us to do is go ahead and
once we have that date pecker on the
screen allow us to get the value from it
and then you know do anything we want
with this so you I date picker and i'm
just going to name my date pecker like
that so now all i need to do is of
course property non-atomic retain good
good I be outlet and just go ahead and
copy this because we are way too lazy to
type that whole thing again and paste
that right there so now well I said this
program is going to be a picker it I
allows you to pick the date and then you
click a button and that button pretty
much pops up an alert about which
oppressed so we need to go ahead and add
action to that button I be action just
name it press button looks good enough
so now what you need to do is make sure
you go ahead and file save this or you
can go ahead and build it if you want to
do that bill will check for errors as
well and we don't have any so we're good
to go so now what we want to do is hop
in the interface voter and start
building this view so go to date pecker
XIB and it will open everything for you
so the first thing that we wanted to do
is add that bottom bar to simulate that
bottom toolbar that's going to be on the
bottom obviously so go ahead and with
your view selected and your attributes
go bottom bar toolbar and now you see a
toolbar most simulated thing is going to
pop up on screen pretty cool so from
here let's just go ahead and drag over
this day picker by the way this is it
right here it looks like low slot
machine kind of drag it over and
position it where you want it
and right there there we go make sure
it's snug on all corners you don't need
to line up with any blue bars or
anything like that so now what we wanted
to do is that's all we need to add for
the day picker go ahead and add a button
and remember this button is pretty much
just gonna output um what date you
picked on screams you're really simple
so go ahead and add a title like press
me and I make an explanation point
because you know so sometimes you got to
be harsh with these guys all right now
the only thing we have what to do is
connect everything so let's connect our
button first um cannot connections
inspect your eyes from touch up inside
go ahead and drag it over to files owner
which is the day pecker class and
remember we created in a method called
press button in there so go ahead and
connect that and now remember we also
build outlet for this date picker right
here so we can grab the value from it so
go ahead and select your files on our
control drag over to your date picker
and the outlet you want is that date
pecker outlet that's why didn't in mind
you probably named your something
different so actually the only thing we
have left to do is code well let's go
ahead and do this first file save
interface builder quit interface builder
the only thing we have left to do is go
ahead and code this press button method
but uh it's probably going to take you
know about four minutes to do and I
don't really don't want to run out of
time so I'm going to be doing that in
next tutorial so there's a little
preview of what you guys have in next
Laura so for now thank you for watching
