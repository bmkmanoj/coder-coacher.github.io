video and in this world I'm going to be
telling you guys how to do a very simple
command and that's just print stuff out
on the screen so of course go ahead and
delete this right here and give yourself
some room to work with I like having a
blank line above and below makes it
stand out especially whenever I'm
teaching and of course whenever we want
to tell our program to print something
type in the word print F and then two
parenthesis now of course every
instruction we need to end with a
semicolon so go ahead and put it right
there
and this is a command to tell our
computer like I said to print something
out on the screen and the thing that you
put in between the parenthesis is the
thing that you print out now like I said
your computer can work with a bunch of
different types of data like whole
numbers on numbers with decimal points
negative numbers however whenever you
want to work with words or text you need
to include it or excuse me you need to
put it in between double quotation marks
so do that and then you can just type
what everyone type like Bucky is awesome
so check it out this is good to go we
can now build and run that and it says
Bucky is awesome right on the screen how
freaking awesome is that so now you're
thinking that this program is probably
the coolest program I ever seen but I
want to go ahead and print another line
you know got to enhance this program so
printf do it again
semicolon double and what am I going to
put on Bucky is awesome and I'll put
Bucky is cool so then we're like ok
going to go ahead and build around this
huh okay that that's kind of what I
wanted but I thought it was going to be
on a new line well the reason that this
second one isn't on a new line is
because we didn't tell our computer
program to put it on a new line all we
said was print out Bucky is awesome and
then print out Bucky is cool and what
did it do oh it printed out on the same
line so in order to move
things to a new line you need to
actually use a special character and
that's backslash n now this has special
meaning and C and it pretty much says go
to a new line so now whenever you run
this close this one it's going to print
out the first one Bucky is awesome in
that new line it's not actually going to
print on backslash n it just knows to go
to a new line and continue printing the
other thing and there are a couple of
these special characters that you guys
probably want to take know of one of
them is slash T and that just makes it
tab so says Bucky is awesome tab Bucky
is cool and whenever you're making
things like tables taps coming in handy
a lot and I don't know if you guys are
going to be able to UM recognize this
one but slash a actually makes a sound
on your computer I don't know if my
screen recorder can pick up the audio
coming from my computer but if you run
this I don't know if you guys heard that
but there is a beep I just heard my
headphones this /a is short for alert it
pretty much says um play your computer's
alarm alert or beef noise so actually
run this code in your compiler and you
guys can hear what your computer sounds
like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
