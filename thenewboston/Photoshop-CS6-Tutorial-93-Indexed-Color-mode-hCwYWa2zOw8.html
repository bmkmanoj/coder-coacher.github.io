buddy Blackford here and I have another
awesome Photoshop cs6 tutorial for you
today and we're gonna learn about the
indexed color mode and I'm gonna help
you understand it a little bit so the
index color mode can be found when you
go to image mode and then there's a set
here called indexed color and it pops up
and it gives you some options that you
can work with and good to note that
there is a preview button here to check
off if you want to preview the different
settings that you've been selecting so a
little bit about indexed color mode
before we get into it it has two
advantages it creates images as small as
like grayscale so not a huge file size
and you get color instead of just shades
of grey so there's a bunch of different
options here where you can select how
many colors you want 256 is the most
that you can put in the index color mode
so you can't get like millions of colors
like with RGB or CMYK but you can get a
decent amount here now why would you
want to use index color mode well it's
good for images that are displayed on
webpages or ones that are used in like
if you're making graphics or like a
PowerPoint presentation or something
like that so like anything computer
generated like computer generated
presentations and things like that so
just remember that the drawback is you
can have only up to 256 colors you get
to actually choose the colors that you
want so there's a couple presets here
and then if you want it you can come to
custom colors and you can use these
different colors here see like this
stuff here so that's a how you can
select your colors there so let's get a
little bit into what's going on with
these options so we've got our palette
here it's got a bunch of different sets
of
colors here we've got web which is gonna
give you the web colors you got a local
selective not totally sure what all
these mean because I don't use this song
that often but if you're going to like
test them out you can always check with
the preview button here before you
actually apply the index color mode so
you can just let go through and look to
see what you want as you can see there's
not a whole lot of different stuff
that's going on here so colors here you
can control your color forced here means
it forces what's called a lookup table
and that's a group of like colors that
you have selected that Photoshop uses to
create the index color based upon so you
can force it to use like all the web
colors here which there's 216 web safe
colors you can have it use those you can
or have it save those what it does is it
holds a specific color so if you choose
black and white then it's gonna hold
black and white pure black and pure
white and that makes the black so much
more richer so more richer that's not
that's not what you're supposed to say
but you guys get the idea so then
there's primaries here which is a red
green blue cyan magenta yellow black and
white and then you've got web which was
the 216 and then you got a custom where
you can pick your own that you want so
the next thing we got here is a
transparency check off and it's going to
preserve the transparent areas of the
image if you have some in there and
there's no transparent parts of the
image in this picture so I don't have to
worry about that in this one but if you
do then click on this to preserve the
transparency now come down here into the
options we've got mat and what this does
is it fills any transparent spots
in your image with a specific color so
you can go to custom and pick the color
or you can pick from these couple
presets that you have here netscape gray
that's a new one that I've heard of well
never use it we've got dinner here and
this pretty much blends in the image the
colors of the image a little bit better
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put
this on done real quick and put this to
web all right and now if I click and
unclick the preview button you can see
that this is what the dinner would none
has on it if I go to diffusion here you
can see that it blends it in a little
bit better
here's pattern and then our noise here
and that they're just different methods
here of blending in and usually
diffusion is pretty good we've got our
mountain here and that's the amount of
dinner that you're gonna use so let's
put this at a hundred percent so that
looks like so that's a hundred percent
and let's make sure it's you have to
make sure it's going on and then what's
to put this down to like 15 percent I
hit 21 instead of 15 but there's 21
percent so you can see like the
difference going on there I'm gonna put
it back to 75 because that's what I'm
like on this one and then you got the
check box for preserve exact colors and
that's basically pretty much always want
to have that checked it selects the
check box or you select the check box to
hold a color measurements in the lookup
table so I wouldn't pretty much always
have that checked so I'll hit OK and
your image changes into something like
this so that's what the index color mode
looks like and you can tell it's like a
little grainy and everything like that
it's trying to keep all the colors and
images with only 256 colors so remember
that this photo had millions of colors
in it and now it's dropped out to 256
and Photoshop does its best to
um keep all the detail that it can in
there it looks like it did a very good
job over here with the hair and like on
the bracelets and things like that so
and this has a really small file size
and can be used in web images and like
PowerPoint presentations so just
remember that and that's all I want to
teach you about on the index color mode
so thanks for watching this one and I
hope you guys can use this information
on your next project
thanks everyone have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
