FL studio tutorial and in this video
what we're going to be doing is we're
going to be learning how to tweak the
settings to achieve our own custom note
whatever sound we're going for so the
first thing I want to mention is again
make sure you have your 3x oscillator
open from the last tutorial and let's go
ahead and go over these knobs right now
because we already went over these
buttons basically the different buttons
or the different shape of the sound
waves makes a different sounding sound
or a different sounding note so the
first knob right here is this volume
knob and of course we already learned
that that turns the volume up for the
different octaves now by default it
doesn't have a volume button on
oscillator 1 and that's because if we we
don't need it there's other way to
adjust the sounds and this pretty much
ensures that we at least have something
you know coming from our note we don't
want to program a note that you can't
even hear so basically you only have
volume on oscillator 2 in oscillator 3
so if you want to include different
octaves lower octaves that is how you do
that so for example right now we have
the note that sounds like this and if we
want to include oscillator 2 just turn
that up half way oscillator 3 so as you
can see our note is getting lower
because we're adding lower octaves so
let me just go ahead and add 50%
oscillator 2 and I'll keep oscillator 3
down all the way I don't want my note
that low now actually I'm going to turn
them all down and it's going to help me
explain this tutorial a little bit more
so the pan of course we can probably
already guess what that does since it's
set 50% right now you're going to hear
perfectly and maybe you're wearing
headphones you're going to hear
perfectly in both ears evenly if you
have computer speakers then you're
either going to hear on the left or
right so you can also
have one pan in one direction and
another pan in a different direction so
now oscillator 1 is panning to the right
nostril later 2 is panning to the left
well I'll go ahead and set that back up
to 50 all right that looks pretty good
so now this is where we're back at so
the next thing I want to talk to you
guys about the CRS and fine what this
does is it actually changes the tone of
your note both of these knobs pretty
much change the tone of your note now
the difference between these knobs is
that this changes it in large increments
in this fine fine Tunes it so let me go
ahead and play this I'm going to hold it
hold down the less-than key on my
keyboard so the note continuously plays
kind of sounds like aliens trying to
dial earth aliens life or nope alright
so anyways I'm having too much fun with
that so as you can see the tone changes
in large increments now I'm going to do
with fine so again if you want the tone
to change by a lot then use the course
if you want to fine tune it then go
ahead and press the fine so that's
pretty much what everything does
oscillator one two and three armed let's
see what we didn't cover we covered all
these knobs and the different buttons
and I think we're good to go
of course there are some a lot more
things up here but um either those
self-explanatory or I'll explain them
whenever we get to that but right now
let's go ahead and say that alright
alright my note is sounding exactly how
I wanted to actually let me get a decent
sounding note all right so I like that
note so now I want to add it to my
pattern so let me play this pattern
right now we need a beat we need a beat
alright so say that I want to play this
right here right here right here
and like that so now don't what's gonna
psyche done Denton doesn't something
like that so let's go ahead and play it
and listen to our awesome sound need to
be we need to beat what the heck
something is messed up so let me go
ahead and solo this and check it out
alright definitely not the sound I was
going for right now it just sounds like
and that like I said is not exactly what
we wanted so in order to fix that what
we can do is we can actually close this
channel settings and we have to select
this channel and you do that with a
button on the right so select it and
press the piano roll or excuse me the
keyboard editor or me I don't know this
is a freaking button right here so what
this does is it opens up pretty much
your keyboard now remember the keyboard
is basically the note of each little hit
so right now since we have everything
playing on this right here which is c5
or your middle C what it's going to
sound like it's just someone pressing
that button on the on their piano and
holding it down like say say say say say
that's not what we want so let's go
ahead and change this by changing this
first one to will keep that at C and on
the second one let's do something like
this keep that one to C and let me just
go alright so that's going to sound
decent I guess
so now once we change the note itself or
the tone it's gonna sound less
monotonous and it's gonna sound like
someone is actually playing the piano so
let's go ahead and play this biatch
actually one change it right there
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
all right so that sounds pretty good to
me or good enough you know it's just a
frigging tutorial I'm not trying to make
a you know the world's greatest song
here but now let's just go ahead and
play this biatch need to be need to be
so again it's probably not your favorite
song but that I just wanted to discuss
because a lot of people whenever they
are working with three-times oscillator
and they try to add the notes like this
then it just sounds like and no matter
how they got their notes sound so again
if you bring up the keyboard editor that
is how you get different sounding notes
with your own custom tone so anyways
thank you guys for watching in the next
video I'm going to show you guys how to
make this sound even better and also
some other awesome tricks that are going
to help your music production so again
