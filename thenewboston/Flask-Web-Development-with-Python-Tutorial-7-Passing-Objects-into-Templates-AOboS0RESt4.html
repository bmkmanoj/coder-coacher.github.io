tutorial I am going to show you guys how
to use other types of Python objects in
your templates so right now what we
already learned is that we can pass
simple variables into your template and
we pass them like a username we can also
pass in I don't know a simple integer
like a user's age or ID number but what
happens when we want to pass a more
complex object like an entire Python
list can we do that and if so how is it
done well in this example what I'm going
to do is I'm just going to make a really
simple webpage and we're gonna pass in a
list of food and we'll say that it's
like a user shopping list or something
and then we'll loop through it and then
display it on a web page so let's first
make a new template and we'll just name
this like a shopping the HTML so this
will be their shopping list and let me
copy this so we'll work on that in just
a second that's going to be the template
but for now let's go ahead and take care
of the backend the routing so just copy
this because I'm lazy and we'll just
name page shopping all right
so whenever the user goes to this URL
what we want to do is we want to make a
function shopping and now since you know
the entire point of this web page is to
display a grocery list let's just go
ahead and make a list so I'm just going
to say like a cheese what else is on my
list tuna and beef looks like this
person has a very healthy diet cheese
tuna and beef art so we have a list how
do we throw it in to our template whoa
and you need to copy that I'm not that
lazy alright so render template what
HTML template are you going to use well
we're just going to use shopping the
HTML and
just like any other variable we're
actually just going to pass it right in
so now whenever we do this you're
shopping template basically has access
to this food variable which is a list so
usually just don't want to print this
out because I don't know it just is
going to look ugly to the user so what
we're going to do is we're going to make
an unordered list and we're going to
look through our Python list and print
each one out as an item so let's just go
ahead and start out with an unordered
list now inside here working on them
through food and print out each item now
remember I said anytime that you have
non HTML in your template what you want
to do is you want to surround it with a
curly brace and those percent signs
this means that don't read this as HTML
interpret it is Python or flask so we'll
say for item in food and what this is
going to do is it's going to loop
through this list three different times
and it's going to treat each item as
item so there you go and before I
continue I just need to signify the end
of my loop by writing n4 so inside here
we can just basically write plain old
HTML so list item and remember each time
we're just going to print out the item
so the first time it loops it's going to
be equal to cheese the second time it's
going to be equal to tuna in the third
time it's going to be equal to beef so
now let me go ahead and run this and
what was my URL shopping
so shopping right there so cheese tuna
and beef and of course if we ever want
to go back and add another item like
toothpaste and restart that and
everything should work beautifully so
again whenever we use flasks we aren't
only limited to passing in strings and
integers we can also pass more complex
Python objects like list and our
templates are going to be able to handle
those fine as well so again we are now
understanding the power of flask
learning all the cool things that we can
do with it and I'm not sure where we're
going to be covering in the next
tutorial but as always it's going to be
freaking awesome so see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
