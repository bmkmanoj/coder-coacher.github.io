and this is a video tutorial for the new
Boston now in the art Laster example
we've looked at left joining where we
returned let's give you an example in
the SQL tab we have said left join pets
on where people to ID equals pets people
ID so if we click go we're giving a list
of people on this hand side and the pets
that relate to them on this hand side so
we've got two different tables people
where we've got the ID which is unique
to each person and we've got pets where
when we're ignoring the ID for now but
people ID is one for Alex and two for
day or so we're just displaying this
information now what happens if for
example we have got dog which is
relative to two people ID 2 which is
Dale but we delete Dale from the
database so let's delete down from the
database let's go ahead and run this
query again and click go now you can see
that it's not returned it's only
returned Alex and cat and fish because
because Dale now doesn't exist
now what happens if we want to display
data on the right-hand side even if the
corresponding value on the left-hand
side doesn't exist now for this we use
the right join we've used left join but
if we change this to right join what
we're now doing is even if this people
ID doesn't exist we're still displaying
it because we're right joining so let's
click go and see what a result we
achieve okay so we've got pet cat fish
and dog dog still exists in the database
in this table pets but the owner does
not exist now in people so why is this
useful why can we use this right join
well in this case it doesn't really make
too much sense unless we were saying you
know the dog is now I don't know
homeless and it's been abandoned the
user no longer exists so it could be a
pet owners website for example this user
might unregister or yeah unregister so
so
they might delete their account and now
dog is left homeless so that's just an
example a silly example but I'm sure you
can understand where where this is going
so for left for if we want to represent
the data on the left even if it doesn't
have a value on the right we use the
left join if we are on the if we want to
represent the data on the right hand
side even if it doesn't have a data on
the even if it doesn't have a value
because it corresponds to where after
the on the keyword on the left hand side
we still show this so we've shown this
as null so inside PHP we can make this
comparison and say that dog doesn't
actually have an owner so that's
basically the difference between the
left and the right hand side joins so we
use left join if we want to display data
on the on the left even if it doesn't
exist on the right and vice versa with
the right join we display data on the
right even if it doesn't exist on the
left</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
