welcome to your 16th tutorial in this
awesome Ajax chat room and in this video
we're going to be beginning to style
pretty much the layout of the interface
and we're going to start with a CSS file
and then I'm going to do the HTML file
some people like to do backwards but I
think for this video it's going to be
easier this way so here it is here's the
interface of course we have just a very
simple table here and we have two main
areas the areas where all the messages
are going to be and of course the area
where the user can pick their color and
under it we have a little forum where
they can of course you know right there
message so this is just the interface of
course nothing is working because it's
not connected to my server anymore so
for now we're just going to go ahead and
style everything so the first thing I
want to do is make a new file and just
save this as chat CSS all right looking
good so before I get started you know
making any cool like layouts or anything
let's just go ahead and style the
overall what I put Boyd body so these
are going to be the general rules for
basically the entire arm chat room I
guess you could say so font family I'm
going to make mine my microphone making
weird noises that should be better
tahoma why can I not type as soon as I
start making a freaking tutorial i can
type so now the entire font is going to
be tahoma on everything now the next
thing I want to do is you see how the
main table has a black border of 1 pixel
and it's not exactly butted up against
you know the edge of the website um if
it was then they look weird actually let
me go ahead and change it real quick and
show you guys you see how it looks a
little little weird when I do that well
what I want to do is I want to give a
margin of five pixels and then it pushes
it away and it doesn't look like you
know it's built into your browser so in
order to do that just go ahead and
give your body a margin of five pixels
now for the font size I'm just going to
go ahead and set this as 12 pixels and
for a text align go ahead and set that
at left so this is pretty much going to
be your basic default styling so now
what we want to do is we want to style
the overall chat room itself so this
section so later on I'm going to make a
diff called content not content see how
you may confuse that and the border of
course as you can see this is a 1 pixel
solid black border and it also has a
margin bottom of 10 pixels so order 1
pixel solid black margin bottom of 10
pixels and that's just so everything is
in but it up and you know tight close
together now the next thing we need to
do is we need to style this input area
right here so the border is a little bit
different color it's them well let me go
ahead and show you guys so of course the
input and this is going to actually
style all inputs on your entire web page
so if you want to only style this input
for example if you have you know more
than this chat room that you're making
then what you can do is you can give it
you know a span or an ID but for right
now we'll just go ahead and stick with
this so border the color is 999 which is
basically really dark gray and 1 pixel
and solid and for the font size I'm
actually going to set this to 10 pixels
now what we did is we basically style
the overall you know pretty much your
entire chat room and this is just the
chat section itself and this input is
just this little input field right here
so now what I want to do is I want to
style this position or excuse me this
area now this area where all the
messages appear i'm going to call scroll
so basically what we want to do is we
want
create a div and we want to make sure
that the user whenever we have messages
that get too much and they are longer
than the area itself that the user can
scroll down or scroll up and see the
previous messages so that's what area
I'm going to do right now let me get
myself a bit more space alright so
remember this is a scroll area right in
here so scroll now the first thing
position relative so it doesn't appear
all crazy all over my web page and I
want to give a certain width which is
340 pixels and of course the width in
the height of yours is probably going to
be dependent on you know where you're
sticking it on your web page but for
right now this one which happens to fit
nicely in my screen recorder is 340 by
270 pixels and also for overflow this is
actually pretty important go ahead and
put Otto now if you don't know what
overflow is you know how this little
area right here the scroll area is 340
wide by 270 well what happens when we
have a bunch of messages and it exceeds
that height well whenever we have
overflow auto then that means that let
the browser handle it and what the
browser does is it puts a little scroll
bar right here and that's the exact
function that we want if you don't want
to scroll bar for some weird reason then
you can go ahead and override that with
another CSS property but for right now
auto is just fine all right so basically
we did all the styling except for this
little area on the right hand side this
is scroll this one I called color picker
and this is actually the last element
that we want to style and for this what
I want to do is I actually want to just
Center align this this little palette
right here so text align center and
actually even though it says text align
it actually centers everything um you
know nice little tidbit of information
now the padding
top we're going to go ahead and set that
30 pixels and what that's going to do is
it's going to move this palette down 30
pixels because I just thought it looked
weird when it was budded right up
against the top and also you see how it
has kind of space to space to the left
and right well that's what I want to do
I want to add padding left of 10 pixels
and that's going to make sure that it
isn't butted up against any corners and
the last thing I want to do is I want to
add a border left of 1 pixel solid black
now a lot of people ask me this in I
think it's kind of like oh man got
freakin whooping cough it's kind of
ticking me off I think it's kind of
funny because everyone's like hey how
did you get a horizontal line because or
excuse me a vertical line because you
know whenever you're coding you can make
horizontal lines with this tag right
there well I always uh you know make
like the border left or board array of
something one pixel and solid and
everyone's like how the heck do you make
a vertical line is it like VR tag right
now you just have to make the border of
something one pixel and anyways that's
my nice little boring story about you
know of vertical lines hope you enjoyed
it but the good news is um first of all
you don't have to listen to any more of
my stupid stories about borders and
second we are done styling the chat room
in the next video we're going to be
building the core HTML file which is
basically you know a frickin important
piece of the chat room and then we have
one more file to go the big old master
javascript file where everything comes
together something guys rushing number
