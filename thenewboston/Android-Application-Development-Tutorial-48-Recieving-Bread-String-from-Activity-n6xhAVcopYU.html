tutorial and in this tutorial we're
going to eat some bread from the most
part um so in the last Oriole again we
basically set up this intent sentence
carrying this basket and within that
basket it has a piece of bread which is
their string reference and again that
piece of bread is going to be called key
so if I'm like hey can I have a kind of
that key and you're like what if you
hand me a piece of bread you know what
I'm talking about so basically we've set
up everything we need to within this
data class for the for sending data and
then we're going to open up our open
class and what we're going to do is go
in with in our on create method and we
could create a method like get data or
something and then set it up within the
brackets but I'm just going to do it
within our on create method because I
don't want confuse you confuse you guys
too much but make sure you guys are
doing this before or at I'm sorry after
you initialized all your variables or if
you had all your variables within your
oncreate method do it below those as
well so what we're going to do is
basically create a new bundle and this
bundle is going to be called got basket
so say bundle and then we have to import
bundle we're going to say got basket
first then you guys will have to import
the bundle I was kind of messing around
with this just now as my video is
rendering from the last tutorial so and
how we're going to set up this bundle is
basically the previous tutorial you know
gave us some context from the last class
and we're going to reference that we're
going to reference the intent so what
we're going to do is we're going to say
get intent and this is a method so a
parentheses and basically that's going
to get the intent that was passed into
the class and hit dot and we're going to
say get extras because we added extras
to the intent in the last tutorial and
now we're getting those extras so just
click that and that's what our bundle is
going to be equal to basically it's
going to get that basket for the most
part and then
we're going to do is we're going to say
we're going to set up a string that's
and we're going to set the string up
above our class so it can reference be
referencing multiple methods so we're
going to say string and we're going to
say got spread for the most part there
we go and then now we need to set up
this got bread basically to the bread
from the last class so we're going to
say basically refer to this bundle that
we just set up which is going to get the
extras from that intent that's being
passed in so we're going to say got
basket dot and you can say get string
because this is a string object so we're
looking for a string and as you can see
it takes a key within its parameters and
so we're just going to click that and if
you guys remember we cleverly labeled
our key in the last tutorial key so
basically that's the file name that we
set up for our bread variable or bread
string from the last class so basically
just going to set this got bread
variable equal to our bread variable
from the last class so hopefully you
guys kind of get get that concept then
all we're going to do is set up our text
view which is basically our question
text view to this string that we just
got so here you go this is why we had to
do it before below our initialize
because otherwise it won't have the
reference to that string that text view
so we're going to set this textview
equal to which is question we're going
to say dot set text and then we're going
to label this as got bread so now we can
pass a question along through through
our application I'm just going to kind
of get out of here and then run it and
as this writing I'll just talk over this
again okay so basically our got basket
is getting the bundle or getting the
extras from the intent that's being
passed into this class and then our got
bread is looking through that got basket
so hey man I'm hungry I need some bread
and they're gonna be like hey bread is
called key so if I'm like hey I can kind
of a bite of that key you guys hand me
some bread I know it I know you've been
watching these two tour
so otherwise it won't make much sense
but basically this is the reference
called key and that's going to be
basically a bread string and then we're
going to set up again this textview to
our string variable that we just got
from that intent so let's check out make
sure it works again you guys have to
define this open class width and
manifest as well then we're going to hit
data we're going to say we're going to
say Jessica Alba is dot dot dot and then
we're gonna say start activity we're
going to get an error of course Jessica
Alba would crash my application here
let's see what's up real quick if we
can't find it we'll edit the video most
part looks like this open class is
having the activity or the problem here
and I forgot to set up the radio button
basically the bridge from XML so I'm
going to set that up real quickly then
the initialize method and just kind of
have to refer that pretty important
radio group and we're going to find that
by ID
so if you guys ever get discouraged and
you like mess up and like something's
not working properly
everyone does it don't worry about it so
hopefully you guys are kind of
understand this data thing a little bit
better than before and we'll kind of you
know hopefully make sure that works
let's change that splash to like one
second so I don't have to listen to that
again alright hopefully everything works
now but uh alright that's better data
and then we're gonna say Jessica Alba is
and then startactivity perfect as you
can see there's our text Jessica Alba is
so that's pretty much this tutorial next
tutorial will kind of set up these radio
buttons and probably that's about it so
I'll catch you guys then and have a good
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
