fourteenth java game development
tutorial and in this tutorial if you
even follow along with the last couple
saw roles and you saw that animation
play out then you probably notice
something kind of wrong with your
animation now the code worked fine
but whenever you watch your animation
you could see that it was flickering
kind of like the screen would show up
and it would blink like it was supposed
to but the it would look like the face
was flickering on and off and if you're
wondering why this flickering happens it
has nothing to do with your code kind of
but what happens is whenever we're
drawing to our screen using our Java
program what the user sees is what
you're drawing as it's being drawn so
whenever it's drawing it doesn't have
the whole image displayed it shows
through it so you kind of get this
flickering
images on your screen and pretty much
what happens is if there's too much
flickering you start to get seizures so
what we want to do is take away this
flickering and if you're like alright
how the heck can I get rid of flickering
this is a pretty big problem for me to
handle well fortunately people have been
working on this for a long time and they
found a perfect way to get rid of it
what they use is something called a
buffer and what a buffer is is pretty
much instead of drung right to the
screen it would draw to kind of like an
image that isn't to the screen and then
it will copy that whole image over so
instead of drawing directly on your
screen you could just copy everything at
once and bam everything is already right
there you don't have to do all your work
for the user to see you just copy copy
copy everything's right there to access
for you so what that pretty much is
called buffering and this works
absolutely awesome and then after this
they found an even better way they're
like alright what if we had two buffers
so instead of even having to copy that
what we have is two images drawn
separately and we would just point to
one image then when the other one was
already point to another image and
and that one is ready to point the other
one and bam this is what's called page
folding now all this is pretty confusing
and to write all this code I mean we can
do it but it would take up a lot of
space so thankfully Java already wrote
all this code for us and it's called a
buffer strategy and all we have to do is
include some simple built in methods in
the buffer strategy class that's already
built in the Java and bam we get rid of
flickering tearing whatever you want to
call it the one problem really is we
have to rewrite our entire screen class
in I mean it's going to be a lot of work
but in order to get rid of all that
flickering if you don't want flickering
inner game which you don't because it
would suck um you need to kind of
rewrite your entire class and that's why
you need to include these imports buffer
strategy and buffered image and pretty
much all these imports that I have right
here so I'm going to minimize this and
we're going to begin writing our final
screen manager class now if you're
wondering are what happened to the
screen class we're going to get rid of
that completely and replace everything
so let's go ahead and write a new class
don't forget to use your imports and I'm
going to walk you through how to write
the perfect screen class we're going to
call it screen manager so again let's
crack our fingers and get ready to code
the first thing we want to do just like
the screen class is go private private
graphics device VC and what this is
going to be is a object to our video
card right here through graphics device
and for some reason whenever I play call
of duty for like 14 hours I type weird
so I'm probably going to make a bunch of
errors in this but I'll fix before you
don't worry about it now let's go ahead
and make a constructor for this so
public screen manager or whatever your
name your class it doesn't need to be
the same as line and what we need to do
is pretty much
graphics environment e equals let me
just copy that again equals graphics
environment get info uh right there get
local graphics environment and with this
pretty much do is get all your graphics
on everything that's on your graphics
card and set your video card in set it
equal to the environment get default
screen voice so there's a bunch of stuff
that your graphics card can do and we
want it to point to the monitor so now
our graphics card object vc has access
to the monitor and let's just write a
little note give vc access to monitor
screen same things but why not be
repetitive right so now what we're going
to want to do is built into your
graphics card here's a little history of
your graphics card that you need to know
bill into your graphics card there's a
bunch of display modes that are already
built in there the problem is our
program doesn't know what graphics card
what computer this is going to be on it
doesn't know what graphics card this
program is using and it doesn't really
know what display mode is compatible
with the program so what we need to do
is get all the display modes from the
graphics card and we're going to compare
them against display modes that we have
preset and we're going to match them up
and when once compatible we're going to
use that one so the first thing we need
to do is get all the display modes from
your graphics card so let's go ahead and
make a method public let's go ahead and
make a little get all add Bowl DMS for
display mode so anyways public display
mode this is array it's built in get
compatible there is photo right display
modes and what this method is going to
do is get all your compatible display
modes on make sure iced powder all right
there we go
and all you need to do is this return
video card dot get should be right here
get display modes right there I see it
and as you can see that popped up
because it was already a built in method
and what this is going to do is it's
going to get all of your display I
probably spelled that wrong right there
it's going to get all of your display
modes that are built into your graphics
card and we need to write this because
every one that runs our game is going to
have a different graphics card so that's
why we need to do all this code so
anyways it's going to take all of those
things all of those display modes and
store them into an array so whenever we
call this method it's going to give us
something to compare it against and in
our next tutorial we're going to be
writing a method to compare the display
modes we got to display modes your
graphics card has and we're going to be
finding the perfect match just like
match comm so it's going to be amazing
don't forget to check it out and I will
see you then
so thank you guys for watching don't
forget subscribe and I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
