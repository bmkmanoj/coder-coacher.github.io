illustration tutorial on the new
Boston's YouTube channel so I'm gonna
show you a couple things this time we're
gonna go over the grid and we're gonna
go over moving around with the hand tool
and I'm gonna show you how to mess
around with the grid and stuff so the
grid as you can see up here it's it's a
checkerboard display that you can help
to align your text or your graphics or
whatever you're using here in
Illustrator and the grid here it appears
always behind your artwork so it doesn't
get in the way and when you use
different commands such as snap to grid
you can align the objects to the grid
line which is pretty handy if you want
to use the grid now you can adjust these
so that the grid lines are bigger you
can see them better you can change the
color and everything I'm going to show
you how to do that and pretty much when
an object comes in between two pixels of
the grid lines it's gonna snap to the
grid so you can I think you can adjust
that so it's a different but I'll check
that out not totally sure but we'll see
in the preferences so let's go to view
and down here you can hide or show your
grid so this is how you get it on so you
can follow along and then we've got
another thing down here called snap to
grid and you want to turn that on for
this tutorial and that allows us to snap
our objects to the grid line so let's go
on here and check out our preferences
let's go to edit preferences and we're
going to go to guides and grid so down
here is the grid section we can change
the color to whatever we want now I
could change it to blue if I wanted to
okay and now they're all blue depends on
what you want to want to use like this
kind of reminds me of like the graph
paper that we used to use in high school
and college
so it's kind of handy you can see it a
little better it's up to you what you
want to use and you probably want to
change it to something that's not a
color that's used in your project so
let's go back to the preferences and
we've got other things going on here
guys style you can specify if you want
lines or dots so I hit dots that's what
the dots are gonna look like now if I go
to move this guy you can see that he can
snap right there to the dots if you if
you look wondering what's snapping check
out the left foot here and snapped right
to it so go ahead and try that out when
you have this snap to grid command all
right now let's go back to the
preferences and guys and grid I change
this back to lines now when you can
change out how much we want our grid
lines to be grid line every 72 pixels
let's change this to like 150 and we'll
hit OK you can see that the grid lines
are a lot bigger dial and something like
this in my opinions easier to work with
I'm not going to need to go into all
these super small grid parts within what
when I'm using just like these images
here and you can see that this is
snapping to each of these grid lines as
I'm going through it it also moves in
between you can see right now the right
foot of this dock is snap to that grid
line if I move up now the left foot of
the dog is so that's how you can see
that's how it's snapping right there you
and that is remember that's because we
have the snap to grid selected if I take
that off I start moving them around he's
not snapping it's using the smart guides
to snap so and that is the snap to point
that's why that's on if I take that off
as well it's not going to snap to
anything it's just gonna be free free
flowing around
all righty let's put that back on and I
must go back to our preferences we can
check out some more things we've got
grits and back and show pixel grid so
grit grits and back and that pretty much
displays your grids and back of your
artwork if I unselect it it doesn't
obviously and this pixel grid show pixel
grid when you zoom in it's going to
automatically show the pixel grid when
you go above 600 percent zoom so let me
turn off the grid and then I'll start
zooming and let's go to 600 let's go up
to actually we've got to go greater than
600 so 800 and I got to be in the actual
pixel view I can remember where that is
pixel preview there we go now we got a
grid going on here I go lower there's no
more grid so it's when you're in the
pixel preview mode is when that
particular option that you can select is
useful if I go off of it it's not gonna
work as we just demonstrated earlier
because now we're in a vector mode all
right so the next thing I wanted to show
you what we're soon did now is the hand
tool and the hand tool is down here and
it's a handy tool that I like to use a
lot and it's especially useful when
you're zoomed in the hotkey is H and
what it does is it just moves what
you're working on and round it doesn't
actually move it around it moves the
actual like view around and this way you
don't have to use those sliders
it's basically the same as moving your
sliders or out it's moving your view
along the along the artboard or whatever
along your screen
and what's cool about it is that it's
got a couple hot keys that are it's got
the H hockey where you can just switch
to it or if you're like using any other
tool if you hold down spacebar which I
just did I'm holding down spacebar right
now it automatically switches to your
hand tool and that's pretty sweet as
well if I hold down the I already just
said that just went over holding down
spacebar so I mean that's pretty much
all there is really for the hand tool
and it's it was a it's a useful tool but
there's not much to talk about with it
so that's why I just added it out to the
end of use and the grids - toy tutorial
so hopefully you guys got a few new
tricks up your sleeve using the grid
using the hand tool and all that jazz so
thanks a lot for watching I look forward
to seeing you guys in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
