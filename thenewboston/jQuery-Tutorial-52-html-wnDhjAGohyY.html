and this is a video tutorial for the new
Boston in this tutorial we're going to
look at the HTML attribute in jQuery now
the HTML attribute will do two things
the first use of it is to take HTML text
or HTML code I guess from a particular
element and the second will actually
input text into a particular element so
the first thing we're going to do is
we're going to create a space that we're
going to retrieve some text from so I'm
going to create a paragraph just here
and I'm going to write some text in here
now I'm going to reference this
paragraph with a unique ID just so we
can reference it when we create our
external javascript file I'm going to
call this just text so now we can
actually grab the text from this
paragraph using the HTML attribute and
we reference it using text so the next
thing I'm going to do is create a blank
paragraph down here and I'm going to
give this an ID of copy and you'll
notice that I haven't actually applied
any text into this paragraph now I'm
going to go ahead and create a button
and this is going to allow me to copy
this text into here so I'm going to
create a type of button and I'm going to
give this a value of copy and we also
need to give this an ID as well so we
can apply an event handler to it so we
know when the button has been pressed so
I'm just going to call this copy now in
fact I'm not because I've already called
this copy I'm going to call this copy
underscore button okay so now that we've
done this we need to create an external
javascript file we've already included
jQuery however we need to go ahead
create a new file and save this inside
j/s the j/s directory so I'm going to
call this HTML Jas
okay so now that I've created the HTML
j/s I need to go ahead and include this
on the page so I'm going to create
another script tag and in that script
tag their type is again text forward
slash JavaScript and the source is j/s
/h TM ljx so now that HTML j/s is
included on our page we can start to
create an event handler for this button
retrieve the text from here and then
place the text inside here so let's go
over to HTML j/s and start to create our
event handler so use a dollar sign and
inside of this we need to reference what
we want to check for an event and this
is copy button it's our button on our
page so I'm just going to type copy
underscore button now just in the
meantime I'm going to come over to my
browser and refresh to see what we have
we have this copy button the paragraph
here and then there's another paragraph
underneath that would be copying the
text too so copy button click so
essentially when the button has been
clicked we want to perform a function
inside of here we create a function as
normal with parentheses and then square
from our curly prevent parentheses as
well we're going to bring this down and
then inside here we need to perform this
specific operation which is to take the
text from this paragraph and then copy
it into here so the first thing we need
to do is retrieve this text here and
we've called this ID text so we can
essentially create a new variable in
JavaScript and I'm just going to call
this text and that's going to be equal
to and again we're referencing an
element on the page and this is text dot
HTML okay so now the HTML function has
taken the value inside of this paragraph
so the text variable in JavaScript will
now equal some text in here what we can
then do is use the HTML function again
to actually place the reference of this
text inside of this copy paragraph so if
we come down a line and we just simply
go ahead and reference copy and then say
dot HTML
texts so let's just run over this again
we check for the clicking of the button
we store the text that's currently in
the text paragraph the first paragraph
and we store it in a variable called
text we then apply the HTML to this text
button in here okay oh this text
paragraph sorry so let's go ahead and
test this out when I click copy you'll
see this duplicated the data so because
we're using the HTML function this means
that we can actually copy HTML text from
one paragraph to another in this case
obviously there are better uses for this
for example data might have retrieved
from a database you might want to put
into a paragraph a span a div but if I
was to for example enclose this text in
a strong tags you'll notice that when we
carry out the same operation it does
actually carry the tags over as well so
the HTML function in jQuery is used to
grab HTML data from one area and then
you can also then go ahead and put HTML
content into another area</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
