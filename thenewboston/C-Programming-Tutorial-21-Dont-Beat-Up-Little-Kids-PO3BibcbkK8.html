video and I actually just want to tell
you guys a story that happened to me in
this story and that is this last night
some software came to me it was the
biggest software company in the world
and they're like Bucky you're the
greatest programmer ever so we want to
tell you about a program we're making we
plan on building a robot that's going to
replace every teacher in school I'm like
okay well what do you want me to do in
there like Bucky we need you to build
the brains for this robot so I'm like
listen leave me alone I got this so I
rolled up my sleeves and I started
coding I'm like okay well the teacher
needs rules to go by so what are they
going to check for well they're going to
check for if the students studied enough
and they're also going to check if the
students beat up kids because that's the
only two criteria and what makes a good
student so first make a integer variable
say int hours studied and for now just
by testing we'll put it like the optimal
student studies for 60 hours a week at
least now let's go ahead and just write
a comment right here reg okay what makes
a good student a good student studies
for like I don't know 10 or more hours a
week in this student just testing arm
head study 60 so that's good now what
else do we need to test for we need to
test for how many kids they beat up this
week so int kids beat up and again we're
just testing and we'll put zero right
now and let me give myself little space
and we'll say the rule for a good
student is they have to beat up zero
kids so in order to have a good student
they need to study for ten or more hours
and also they need to have beaten up
zero kids I don't think that's you know
that much to ask for so now what we need
to do is we need to make a simple
decision to allow our robot to you know
go on something so we can't just use two
if statements because we actually need
to test all of these in one decision if
we're just testing for our studied or
kids being up then we need to if
statements but we need to
test both of those things together so
how do we do that well we do it like
this in your test and actually let me go
ahead and write the prints first so
we'll print F and just for something
like you are a good student so basically
like I said we need to test two things
so how do you test more than one thing
well in between your parentheses give
yourself a little space to work with and
in the first piece of the puzzle you add
the first test so test one now what you
do is you add two ampersand signs and
then in another set of parentheses you
add a test two now what this is going to
say is basically test two conditions if
both of them are true and in this case
if they studied for ten more hours and
they beat up zero kids print out you're
a good student
so our studied test if this is greater
than ten actually greater or equal to
ten and for test two test if kids be up
was exactly equal to zero or we can even
say well that's the easiest way to say
it so basically if this is true and this
is also true then print out your good
student and check it out in this case
our kid to be the zero study for sixty
hours so it should print out you are a
good student now of course if we have
something like okay how many hours did
he study well he only studied two hours
how many kids did he beat up well we
actually beat up nine kids that week so
of course if we try to run this it would
not run that code because both of these
were false and not true now whatever
saying okay well what if he was really
smart kid what if he studied for
actually 80 hours that week however he
was in a bad mood I don't know maybe
something happened to him so he beat up
12 kids
well it says okay I'm going to test this
this one is true right here good job you
did you know the adequate amount of time
however this is false you beat up some
kids dude so what's going to happen is
this is true and this is false so this
entire thing is not going to run because
this only runs if both of these tests
are true so again like I said look at
that even though you studied it the
proper amount of time you beat up the
kids so that test was false so again the
point of this tutorial and you know I've
to tell you the truth with no software
it came to me that was just an example
but anyways the point of the story is
whenever you want to test more than one
condition then what you need to do is
use those ampersand signs and that means
this has to be true and this has to be
true and if so run this code and another
thing is you can use as many of these as
you want you can put ampersand test 3
test 4 test 5 just separate all of your
tests with these two ampersand signs and
what this would mean is this has to be
true and this has to be true and this
has to be true if one of them is false
then this code does it run so hopefully
you guys enjoyed my tutorial um I'm
gonna go beat up some kids I'll see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
