welcome to a what I say this is buggy
you can clearly see who's talking right
now but anyways welcome to a quick
little update video um I haven't made a
video in like a week so I was like why
not just do update video tell you guys
what's going on my channel answer a few
questions that I've been getting a lot
over and over again the first most
common question I begin in my inbox who
is the winner of the last starcraft 2
game now this is actually my copy right
here that i play i mailed the person
their copy it was a girl in England um
definitely the most deserving person who
wrote me she asked me not to give a lot
of personal information so I'm actually
not going to give anything more than
that but anyways it was a girl in
England so if I didn't contact you
you're not the winner i'm sorry but if
you definitely deserved it and if you're
watching I hope you enjoy your game um
along the same lines of starcraft my
name on starcraft 2 is the new boston
how original is that so if you want to
play with me on starcraft not in any
other creepy way if you want to play
with me on starcraft 2 i'm add me as a
friend the new boston then whenever i'm
online just ask me play a game and i'll
do with you um i'm not that great in
fact I kind of suck so you know take it
easy on me um what else so don't talk
about yes you know I've been teaching
iphone development and how to create
iphone apps whoa in case you're
following me in the app store my name is
the New Boston all of my apps that were
99 cents not three of them on right now
their memory extreme and chicken
bouncing test your brain power I think
that's the name of them I'm not charging
anything for him anymore they're all
free and i also have a new game coming
out she'll be coming out in the next
couple of days um it's my best game yet
that's going to be free too so no more
charging for my apps my games if you
want to download any of them they're all
free for you guys so i decided not to
make any money off of those just get my
name out there and uh why not give them
away for free they're pretty cool so
definitely check them out
and for those of you who have been
buying my games and learning for my
tutorials when you download my games and
you say ra I wish I knew how to make
this if you wanna if you want a tutorial
on how to make any of the games that you
downloaded from the App Store just write
me in my inbox relieve a comment on this
video and if I get enough request then
I'll actually start making tutorials on
teaching you guys how I made the games
that you guys just spot so actually not
bottom there free but you guys just
played so if you want any tutorials on
how to make those games let me know and
if enough people respond then I'll teach
toros on that I actually was going to
teach tutorials on openfeint in cocos2d
next but I since i upgraded my xcode um
I've been getting an error with
openfeint so I got to fix that before I
can teach you guys how to do that in
cocos2d I might do that in a month but I
might not in the reason i'm holding off
on this is because for some reason and
this is probably because i have a huge
java following but you guys are keep
asking me to make tutorials on android
in android development so if you guys
would like this rather than openfeint
cova studi on the iphone let me know
this and i can begin a series of android
development tutorials actually here's
i'm going to do um let's just do this on
my website the new boston calm it's
forum i'm going to set up a pull in tell
me what's Orioles you guys want next
Android openfeint cocos2d or how to
create iphone games the iphone games i
have in the app store right now so vote
on one of those for and whatever has the
most votes that's what swirls i'm going
to be creating next um so aside from
programming mobile apps and stuff like
that one definitely going to be doing in
about a month is making a new series of
how to build a computer tutorials so you
guys are saying all right you already
made this series like two years ago
and it was pretty sweet so why would you
make another one well after I made that
series and it's actually one of my most
popular series I've got a lot of not
demands but you know question asking how
to do things that I didn't cover in
first of all I want to do it again
because I now have a HD camcorder that's
going to be a lot better quality you
want to make these tutorials the next
question I got is after I built my
entire computer they wanted to see it
turned on and they wanted to see an
operating system installed so in this
new series i'm going to show you guys
how to install an operating system and
one huge thing probably the biggest
thing that i didn't cover is on the old
computer i built i had onboard video so
i didn't need a video card but tons of
people want to learn how to build or
rather how to install a video card so
that's what i'm going to be doing in
this new series showing you how to
choose how to pick out on where to look
for and how to install properly a video
card on your new computer so that's
pretty much all i have to say for that
the last thing that kind of reminds me
of and kind of going back to the
starcraft thing is there's this guy on
youtube we've there either starcraft HD
tutorials or nuts or no starcraft HD but
anyways i know one guy his name is husky
and he records his starcraft gameplay
and he has the best quality um gameplay
recording for your computer screen and i
don't know what program or what settings
he uses to do this but the quality of
his gameplay is amazing again his name
is husky and here in cords starcraft 2
games on his computer so here's what I'm
asking from you guys if anyone can find
out what program he uses and um you know
if it's common program what settings he
uses as well and let me know so I can on
record starcraft 2 gameplay as well
please do that for me because um i
looked around a little and i could find
some programs like come
Camtasia and camps to do and also
something called fraps I think but I
don't think any of these programs unless
I'm just doing them wrong they owned a
record like 15 frames a second and there
aren't the quality that he has so if
anyone can figure out for me how he gets
this awesome HD quality um please let me
know and I will start recording star
graph to it is and I'm also probably
going to start having starcraft 2
tournaments once I learn how to record
and post them on my channel so um with
that being said that's all the updates I
got for you again don't forget to add me
on starcraft don't forget to vote what
torial tutorials you want me to make
next be expecting computer building
tutorials with operating system
installation and also video card
choosing an installation and probably
the next month and also find out for me
how husky makes these awesome quality
tutorials because I know how to make
good tutorial recorder I mean tutorial
what's it called resolution whatever is
called high-quality computer tutorials
but this is a little different than
recording a video game on your computer
so um yeah that's what I'm giving you
guys and that's what I want from you
guys so thank you guys for watching this
update I'm sorry not giving anything
away this time but maybe next time I'll
have a giveaway so again thank you guys
for watching don't forget subscribe and
I will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
