slash on live gamer for the new boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
taking another look at the select case
statement so this time instead of using
an integer we're going to use a string
so we're going to start off by creating
a string so dim my string as string so
that equaling now what we're going to do
is we're going to get my string from the
user so we're just going to ask them to
enter a string and then my string is
going to be equal to console dot read
line and now what we're going to do is
we're going to start our select case
statement so select case my string we're
going to do a case hello and we'll just
do console dot write line goodbye and
we'll do two more cases from your case
goodbye then console dot write line
hello
and now we're going to do a case um
let's just do fishing and then we'll do
console dot write line boat okay so now
if we run this it's going to close out
right before it's done so we got to add
console dot readline now in some of my
very first tutorials I said that this
will let you read the line or the the
program before it closes out and that is
true but what it actually really does is
that it waits for you to press Enter
so whatever you type in there in the
line that it's reading it's going to
move on to the next statement once you
press ENTER so if you press nothing and
press Enter
then it's going to go ahead and in our
case exit the program because there's
nothing after this let's go ahead and
run this and if we type fishing is going
to say boat but we have one problem
problem with this if we type fishing
with a capital F it's not going to give
us anything so what we need to do is
make this case insensitive so to do this
we're just going to type my string dot
to lower and we need to make sure that
all of our strings inside of our cases
are lowercase and you can see that they
are we have hello goodbye and fishing
and they're all lowercase so now if we
run this we can type fishing in any way
we want it's going to give us boat back
now one other thing we need to cover is
what happens if I type in something
that's not in our Select case statement
such as dog it's not going to return
anything so to deal with this we're
going to use what's called case Alice
and this is very similar to the else in
the if-else statement it's going to
cover anything that you
have in your cases so if my string to
lower is equal to anything other than
hello goodbye or fishing then it's going
to go ahead and we'll have it right
console dot write line I don't know what
you're talking about so now if we run
this we can type in anything in here and
it'll say I don't know what you're
talking about
so this is a very fairly simple tutorial
but the stuff I talk to you and this is
very useful and go ahead and practice
some select case statements once you
have that nailed down go ahead go ahead
and move on to the next tutorial and
