is Bucky Roberts and welcome to another
awesome freaking tutorial in this video
series what I'm going to be doing is I'm
going to be teaching you guys how to
make a sweet awesome epic footer using
CSS now I want to teach this to you guys
because first of all it's an awesome
feature that you can add to your website
in second vall I'm actually making a
social network right now and I put this
footer on it and everyone was like oh
this is awesome
how the heck do you create something
like this so instead of you know answer
everyone's post and you know going to a
long explanation I figured it would be
easier and better just to make you know
a tutorial series so then everyone can
learn how to make it and second of all
like I said it's going to be open source
eventually so then you have a little bit
better understanding of the code so
let's go ahead and take the tour of it
right now so what this is is it's
basically a toolbar similar to Windows
but the cool thing about this is first
of all it looks awesome it's transparent
and you have all sorts of cool menus
first of all you got home buttons you
got different drop up menus that you can
go and um this is actually for my social
network I have the stream and different
messages pictures so I'm going to be
creating this um like I would for my
social network but you can actually use
the knowledge to easily add it to any
website you just change a couple links
and bam you can use it for your website
so like I said this is all your main
account your profile and the cool thing
about this is that usually whenever you
have a drop-down menu you have something
like this it's just all links in a list
well with this not only do you have an
awesome transparent pop-up but you can
also add headings to it columns um you
can have you know pictures in it so it's
much more than just you know upside down
drop down menu basically you can have so
much interactive crap and the cool thing
you know I say there's a lot of cool
things about this but on my social
network what I have is the program's tab
right here in whenever you click a
program it actually opens up a new
tab on the footer so this is probably
like the greatest freaking footer of all
time wait a second not even done yet
over here I have my notification so when
someone you know likes your post or
comments on your picture BAM click that
now you know like I said I'm not even
going to explain how awesome this is
because clearly you know you can see so
let's go ahead and jump into how to
create something like this and by the
way if you guys are like you know what
let me just go ahead and download the
source code because I'm going to watch
your tutorials but I also want to see
the source code and you know put on my
website see how it is right now all of
the source code is going to be available
for download on my forum go to tnb form
comm and it's all there but anyways the
first thing that you need to do is you
need to go ahead and put an index.html
file and make a footer CSS file so
that's all this footer is it's all CSS
and even though you see all this dynamic
awesome stuff all of this is actually
CSS and css3 no JavaScript whatsoever
how freaking cool is that so let's go
ahead and the first thing that you need
to do like I said is create an HTML file
and a CSS file now I'm actually going to
go ahead and create the very basic shell
of the HTML file first and what I'm
going to do is I'm going to create the
shell for this and then create the CSS
file and then come back here and add all
of the HTML it's going to make more
sense that way so if you don't know what
I'm talking about just follow along so
in index dot HTML the first thing that
we need is some housekeeping stuff
doctype HTML HTML and
HTML all the boring stuff got to get
that out of the way now speaking of
boring stuff let's go ahead and head
that at the head and the body as well
make the ending body tag body alright so
now we have a very basic shell now the
most important thing that we need to do
is actually link to the CSS file so how
do we do that well it's quite easy just
go ahead and put the link of course it's
a style sheet and href 4 is whatever you
named your footer I just went ahead to
name mine footer CSS pretty
self-explanatory footer CSS and of
course the last thing that we need to do
is put type what type is it basically
telling your browser that you're going
to be working with a CSS file and don't
forget to a close your tag right there
so now what we did is we basically
created a very basic shell or HTML file
that links to this footer CSS file so of
course we're not on working in here we
need to add all the HTML elements for
the footer but before I do that I think
it's going to be easier if I actually
show you guys exactly how to style this
footer first because if I don't do that
then I'm going to be like okay let's go
ahead and style or let's go ahead and
add this list item and float it left in
your what whoa slow down slow down what
the heck are you talking about so once I
actually style everything in CSS and
then implement it into the footer it's
going to make a lot more sense so now
that I think about it what I want to do
is I'm going to be saving that for the
next tutorial so in the next tutorial
we're going to start styling the
greatest footer of all time so that's
what you have to look forward to and
thank you guys for watching and I will
see you guys in the next video
