using my email client here which is
squirrel mail now what I can do is I can
save changes on this page and our file
has been saved successfully
now what we can do is we can come in
here and just refresh and we've got an
unexpected T variable on line 4 so let's
go check this error out before we
proceed so let's go down to line 4
that's the reason is because I have on
line 3 I didn't incorporate a semicolon
at the end of my line so that Save
Changes again and let's refresh okay so
we've got a confirmation message email
has been sent to Alex at PHP academy'
org let's go over to my email client and
click back onto my inbox okay so you can
see that in bold a new email has popped
up and this is from someone at PHP
academy' de org now the subject is this
is a test email which does correspond to
what we specified in our variable here
this is a test email so if we click on
it and go in further we can see that it
says this is a test email and then hope
you got it okay so my mistake this has
not correctly processed and the reason
being can already tell you the reason
being is because we haven't specified
this in double quotation marks and it
hasn't processed these because we're not
using double quotation marks so what we
could do is we could append on double
quotation marks and then back to our
normal again that okay or you can just
enclose this completely in quotation
marks is entirely up to you okay so
let's save the changes again and resend
the email let's refresh okay email has
been sent
again we get the same confirmation
message cap let's go back to our inbox
okay we've got that again let's click on
it and you can see that now we've
incorporated the new line break
okay so what happens if we want to
specify a name by this as you can see
the things like Twitter and people per
hour have already sent their email
address through with a name attached so
we want to change this to be more user
friendly we all know we don't need to do
that
that was my test notes from earlier we
need to come into this page and we
simply need to say PHP academy' there
and in fact no we don't we need to say
from PHP academy' and then in a less
than and then a greater than sign with
the email address so let's save the
changes there let's go back and refresh
our page so we resend the email back to
squirrel mail email client and you can
now see that we need to login again
okay so I've logged back in and you can
see that the email is from PHP academy'
this time with the same subject and then
the the content of the email now you
probably notice that we've gotten a bit
of extra whitespace just before our
message and this is because when we note
not don't need again when we are are
editing this it's automatically going to
take into account I think I'm not too
sure this is a correct of me but we're
also actually going to take into account
the space before this so if we put this
on a new line
and we save I think what that will do is
it will get rid of that space before
let's just double check I'm not entirely
sure it might just be this email client
okay yes so if you find things like if
you find things like too many spaces
down or anything like that this body
string is going to be taken literally so
I could say this is a test email
and then hope you got it and if I was to
go down I am actually creating myself a
new space it's always better to use
these backslash n line breaks okay so
that is the very basics of sending an
email with PHP like I said if you're
having trouble using your local server
like if you have an ex amp in stelae
ssin then try to upload a PHP file or
create a PHP file as I have on a text
editor on an actual paid hosting service
and a server that has the send mail
activated then you'll be able to use the
mail function within PHP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
