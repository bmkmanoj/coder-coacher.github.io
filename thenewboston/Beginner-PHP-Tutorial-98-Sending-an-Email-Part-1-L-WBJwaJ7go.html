and this is another video tutorial for
the new Boston now if you've watched
some my other tutorials that I've
created you will see that I'm now in a
different environment and I'm not using
context for this tutorial now there's a
reason for this when we send mail in PHP
using the mail function and it's not
going to work from my local server
because I don't have the support to send
the email on my local server and you may
find this as well you can set this up
but I won't be talking about how to do
this on a local server as with most paid
hosting you will have access to be able
to send mail using this function so
let's go straight ahead and send a basic
email so I'm going to create a file now
called index.php I'm going to click
create new file has created that in here
for me now I'm going to click on code
editor so we can start editing this file
okay so obviously the first thing we
want to do is create PHP tags now the
mail function basically looks like this
and it takes typically in the case that
we're going to do four parameters one
after that is optional I think it takes
5 parameters in total but you can go to
the PHP manual to look that up now we
need to create a few variables in order
to put into this function the first one
is 2 this is the email address that the
email is going to be sent to so in this
case I'm going to say Alex at PHP
academy' org this is my pressing
business email address only so the next
is um is the subject so the subject is
going to be this is an email now I have
the body so this is going to equal some
text that we're going to have in the
body of the email and finally we have
the headers now the headers in this
example I'm going to show you I'm going
to only work with basic headers we are
just going to use
the from field so what going to say is
we're going to say from and then we're
going to say someone at PHP academy' to
org this is the name that is displayed
or the email address that's displayed
from so if I was say sending a mail to
someone after they'd registered had
registered say or with website and the
registration process has completed I
could send it from no reply up here at
repair company to org or I could send it
from admin at PHP academy' log the email
address doesn't necessarily have to
exist
so let's specify a body let's say we're
going to come down here and we'll start
saying and that will go up here we'll
say this is a test email I'm going to
use backslash and N to go to a new line
and then backslash and n now to go to
new lines I'm starting a new paragraph
hope you got it okay so now what I need
to do to actually send the email is use
the mail function and then pass these
arguments to actually send the email so
the first one you need to specify is who
it's to so the recipient email address
then you need to specify the subject of
the email so our subject is this is an
email then you need to specify the body
so our body here is equal to this is a
test email we go down a new paragraph
which is equivalent to two lines and
then we say hope you got it now what we
need to do is give the headers and
there's plenty of information that we
can pack into here but for now this
simple malfunction tutorial just giving
you an idea of how it works I'm just
saying from someone so this is the name
it is going to be displayed when we pick
up the email now this is all well and
good but what happens if the mail
function doesn't work well I'm going to
enclose this in an if statement and say
if mail then do something here so I'm
going to come in and say email
being sent and I can say else there was
an error sending the email just in case
the malfunction fails for one or more
reasons we can process this and say echo
there was an error sending the email
otherwise email has been sent
we can even say email has been sent to
and then specify the two variable that
we've created up here so we need to run
and test this now so I'm going to log
into my email account and we can send
this afterwards</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
