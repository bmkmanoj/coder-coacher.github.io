biology lesson and in this lesson I want
to start talking about meiosis now
before I start talking about the
individual stages and phases of meiosis
what I want to do is I want to give you
guys a real brief overview of the entire
process of meiosis and I want to do this
because after learning about mitosis
meiosis can be kind of confusing because
there are a couple key differences that
we need to take away before we begin so
we already know that most of the cells
in your body have 46 chromosomes and I
already said that chromosomes were
pretty much little packages of DNA now I
say most of the cells in your body like
your lung cells your skin cells your I
don't know maybe your stomach cells
every cell in your body except your
sperm cells in your egg cells have 46
chromosomes now in mitosis what happens
is the cell the original parent cell is
split in two and we end up with two new
daughter cells identical to the original
parent cell however in meiosis the
process is a little bit different
because first of all instead of making
normal skin cells or you know stomach
cells lung cells what we're making is
egg cells and sperm cells so we already
know that egg cells and sperm cells have
23 chromosomes each so this is the first
main difference between meiosis and
mitosis
because basically instead of making
normal cells like I said we're making
sperm cells in egg cells and also the
resulting cells only have half of the
chromosomes as the original parent cell
so again like I said that's the main
difference between meiosis and mitosis
now another thing I want to point out is
that most of the cells in your body are
diploid and whenever I say this what
this basically means is that they have
two sets of chromosomes
so let's go ahead and say that we're
looking at a cheek cell for example so
this is the nucleus of a cheek cell so
remember that I said that you have two
sets of chromosomes one set is gonna
come from your dad so here's a set from
your dad and another set is gonna come
from your mom now for every single
chromosome that you get from your dad
you have another chromosome that from
your mom that is pretty much its match
it's the same chromosome it's not the
same chromosome but it's physically
similar in both shape and size so
whenever we have two chromosomes that
match each other one from your mom and
one from your dad
we call these homologous chromosomes so
remember I said that every cell in your
body with exception of egg cell or sperm
cell are diploid or they have two sets
of chromosomes one chromosome from your
dad and a one chromosome from your mom
now every chromosome from your dad has a
matching one from your mom that is the
same size and shape and whenever they
form a pair or find their match
basically we call those homologous
chromosomes so now we know that in most
of the cells in your body you have
something called homologous chromosomes
which is pretty much the one from your
dad that matches up with the one from
your mom now we already know that
they're basically the same size in the
same shape and again those are called
homologous chromosomes now we also know
from earlier on that during interphase
all of the chromosomes in your body are
duplicated so each chromosome is going
to consist of two identical copies
called sister chromatid
so after interphase you end up with
something like this this this this this
this and this so basically this is your
starting point after interphase you
basically have all of your chromosomes
in your nucleus that are duplicated and
each chromosome is going to consist of
two identical copies as we learned
earlier called sister chromatid
so now that we have better background or
understanding of meiosis we can move on
to the different phases and we can now
understand how these individual sister
chromatid can become individual cells
sperm cells or egg cells with the
genetic information that you need or the
pieces that you need to become a human
being</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
