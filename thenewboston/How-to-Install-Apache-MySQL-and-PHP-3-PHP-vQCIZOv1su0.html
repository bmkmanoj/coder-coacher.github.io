it's video number three I believe and in
this tutorial what we're going to be
doing now that we have a patchy up and
running smoothly we can now download and
install PHP so if you go to this website
right here windows oh that's
embarrassing
not really windows dot PHP net slash
download it's going to give you all the
crap that you need in the version that
we are looking for is this V c11 x86
which is 32-bit thread safe so again
remember we have 32-bit Apache so we
need 32-bit PHP so download this zip
file right here and I actually have it
downloaded like before so once you
download that if I just close out of
here and view my downloads you're going
to have a file that looks like this PHP
whatever version it is 1:32 32-bit and
of course it's a zip file so the first
thing that we need to do after
downloading is extract it so go ahead
and hit extract all now I actually want
this right on my hard drive where Apache
is so I'm going to change the
destination path and I recommend you do
the same in that way you know you can
follow along in this tutorial see slash
PHP so just like that and after you
change the path hit extract kick up your
feet and let windows do the work come on
boom roasted so now if you look on your
hard drive there should be a folder PHP
right on the same directory is a patchy
but here's the thing all right
we set up a patchy that's running
smoothly and we also downloaded all this
PHP crap but right now Apache doesn't
even know about this PHP folder we need
to configure Apache to run with PHP it
doesn't just do it by default in order
to do that you actually need to edit
that Apache configuration file again so
let's go ahead and do that by opening up
opening up law ah nope
head or whatever text editor you have in
if you guys are don't have that open by
default I'll show you guys where it is
again if you go on your hard drive and
view Apache conf and then it's this for
httpd.conf which pretty much means
Apache configuration file how do we tell
this configuration file to pretty much
be compatible with PHP well what we need
to do is scroll all the way down to the
bottom and we need to add a little bit
of code and there is actually a few
lines of code and I took the liberty to
write it all for you guys before you
know so I won't make you guys type
everything out if you're watching this
video on YouTube there's a link below
the video and if you click that it's
going to take you to my forum where I
have all this code written out for you
so just go ahead and copy that you can
actually close out of your browser now
and paste it right at the bottom of your
file and again all this code does is
basically tell Apache hey Apache you're
going to work with PHP now whether you
like it or not Apache so go ahead and
save this crap and that's it you can
close out of your configuration file
don't touch it anymore because now
everything is set up to run PHP oh you
don't believe me do you alright you know
up I'm going to open up notepad plus
plus again and we're going to make a
real simple real simple quick PHP file
and I'm going to prove to you guys that
that is actually how you set it up since
you guys think I'm a liar so let me go
ahead and make the easiest file ever all
right so that's the dumbest thing I can
think of but you know you can make any
PHP file for now this is just for
testing and what we want to do is we
need to save this page P file in very
specific location so go to your computer
and on your C Drive go to Apache HTTP HP
or anything like that
and we now as you can see have a PHP
file that we can test so now what we
want to do is we need to actually start
up Apache I don't know if all yours is
running already but remember you go to
the command line and then from here
change directory to Apache bin and from
here just put HTTP D and hit enter and
what this pretty much does is it starts
running Apache pretty you know pretty
simple enough so now when we go to our
browser Oh what is it localhost I forgot
what we named I think it was tuna dot
PHP hit enter and look at that localhost
is running Apache in this tuna dot PHP
file interprets the PHP file just like
we wanted it to and check that out
tuna baby that's what I like to see
alright so now we got a pad - you're
running it is running smoothly we
downloaded PHP we configured it to work
so PHP is working now the last thing
that we need to do is we need to
download and setup my SQL so one less
step to go we're almost there so stick
with me and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
