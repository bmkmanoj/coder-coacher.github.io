tutorial and in this tutorial I'm
actually writing our first application
with the guys and uh first thing we're
going to want to do if you don't already
have it open is open your dev C++
compiler and if you don't know what I'm
talking about then watch my last
tutorial and I'll show you how to get it
and once you open it go ahead and click
file new source file and I already have
one open so I don't need to open one and
then you get something that will pop up
like this and the first thing I like to
do is go ahead and click save as and
save a new CPP file you can either type
new dot CPP or just type new and click
CPP from the drop-down list it should be
on there by default but once you do that
go ahead and click Save and you won't
get that it's just saying that because I
already have a file and uh once you have
that you're going to have a tab right
here that says new CPP and this shows
that you're working in that right file
so now that you got your file open let's
go ahead and start making our first
application the first thing that we're
going to want to do is actually include
a file in C++ that's going to help our
compiler and to do this we're going to
want to use the pound sign and type
include lesson sign and type iostream'
ooh aiyo stream then use your greater
than sign then go to the next line now
this is one of the things that you don't
really have to know what it does in C++
you just gotta remember to put it in
there every time but just in case you
are curious
it's a preprocessor directive and what
it does is just pretty much process the
source file before it compiles so if you
don't know what that means then that's
that's fine you don't really need to
know anything about that
but here is what you do actually need to
know C++ isn't made up of all these
things called functions and that's what
we're going to be making every single
C++ program you make including this one
we're going to be making today is made
up of functions and functions have two
parts the first part is kind of like the
title and it's called the function
header so let's create that right now so
type in the letters I and T and this
means that we're going to be working
with integer and then type in main and
then two empty parentheses this is
pretty much the title of our function
our functions name is main and it's an
integer function
on the next line open with your curly
brace and on the next line put an end in
curly brace and anything you type in
between these curly braces are going to
be statements now this piece of the
function right now is called the body
and anything you type in are kind of
like instructions for the function and
in that sense I mean here's the title
and but what do we want the function to
do well that's what we're going to be
typing right here and something called
statements so again to recap we have a
function right here it's called the
header and the statements are the
instructions for the function and every
statement ends with a semicolon but
before we get all the tone our function
what do I'm going to have you guys add
one more thing kind of like this that
you don't really need to know what it
does but you need to put it in and that
is called using and then type in a word
namespace STD and add a semicolon in
case you guys are curious again what
this does it pretty much tells C++ to
use all the basic standard stuff that
C++ uses so now that we have that is our
first rule in our function let's go
ahead and make some fun stuff or at
least it'll be fun to me the first thing
that we want to do is type C out and
this is just basic output on the screen
and then we're going to add something to
lessons that's called the insertion
operator so now we're telling C++ all
right we want you to output on the
screen something but what well let's
output first make an open quotation mark
I'm going to type a now brown cow and
then anything you type in your quotation
marks is going to be outputted on the
screen and again remember like I said
this is called a statement in every
statement you have to end with a
semicolon
that's down C++ alright we gave you an
instruction now do it so again to recap
we got the string of text that's inside
quotation marks our two left signs are
card or insert and operator and we want
you to output this on the screen and
it's just going to read just like you
type an email or reading a letter
nothing fancy just plain text on the
screen the next thing I want to do is
show you guys how to make a new line to
do that type C out output on the screen
and type end L that's L as in line not a
one
then put your semicolon so now we have
hey now brown cow in our program and on
our new line let's make something else
again
see L guys are going to get good output
on the screen at least then remember
quotation mark say don't jump that
fence 8.now Barranca don't jump that
fence end it with your quotation marks
then enter another insertion operator
and type in end L that's going to end
the other line so again type in all of
this and what this is going to do type
hey now brown cow go to a new line and
on that new line we want to output don't
jump that fence and then we're just
going to go to a new line for fun so now
we have a useful function right here but
before we execute this we're going to
need to do a couple things the first
thing that we want to do is system and
then inner quotation marks we want to
type the word pause and I'll actually if
I remember show you guys why this is
useful what this does is allows you to
stop and look at our function instead of
just running it I'll run it without this
and show you guys what it does and the
next thing you're going to want to do is
type return 0
and what this does is pretty much end
the main function since C++ is going to
run through this go go go go but it's
not going to know where to end right
here we just tell an RA return zero
pretty much RI C++ you did your job
good job we're going to end you now so
once you got this all typed go up here
and click Save or you go to file save
either one and to run it go up execute
and click compile and run what this is
going to do as you can see check for
errors and run your program as you can
see if this box comes up then we got no
errors as you can see it says hey now
brown cow
and on our new line don't jump that
fence and as you can see let's just
click out of that
if you don't edit insert that system
pause what's going to do we execute
compile and run this is just going to
run your program and I don't know if you
could see it on YouTube but it just
flashed or real quick and it didn't give
you a time to stop and actually look at
the program so you're going to have to
make sure that you have that system
pause in there so study this and again
to recap we have a function name main
that's called the header function header
this is called the function body and all
these little things are called
statements that give
instructions tell the function what to
do so study this this is a real basic
C++ tutorial and I hope you enjoyed I
hope you learned something and just wait
and after some of these tutorials will
be a expert C++ programmer in no time
