your fourth Android application
development Sorrell that's an awfully
long name I better start counting I'm
just Android tutorials
welcome to your fourth Android tutorials
and in this tutorial what we're gonna be
doing is we're gonna be going over how
to build project and also how to set up
our emulator now our emulator is pretty
much a fake cell phone that we make on
our computer so anyways you'll learn
about that later but let's go ahead and
start a new project so go ahead and get
Eclipse open actually let me jot down
the time 7:33 shut it down on my little
diary so I know when I'm running out of
time anyways go ahead and open eclipse
and in order to start a project do this
file new project easy enough now we have
a lot of different choices here but what
we are looking for is Android so go
ahead and expand that in BAM look what
you got even more choices Android
project and Android test project go
ahead and select Android project and
once that selected the next little
button should be able to click what's a
good word for able to click clickable
there we go that's what I was looking
for so we need to fill in this form
exactly like I'm gonna show you how and
you need to do that for two reasons
first of all if you fill it out
differently than me then your project
might not even work and second of all if
you fill out different than me then when
you're following along with my tutorials
it's gonna be harder to follow along
because we're gonna have different
libraries so anyways do exactly as I do
for your project name this is irrelevant
I'm gonna name mine Bucky you name yours
whatever you want for all of your
contents right here go ahead and leave
all these as default and that shouldn't
mean this radio button that says create
new project and workspace should be
clicked and use the fault location
should be checked and all the content
means is pretty much where are you
keeping all your files pretty much the
location of your project so don't even
worry about that
by default it should be right in your
workspace right where you want it now
the build target for this you want to
select Android 2.2
your bill target like you can see it's
pretty much the version of Android not
only what version they need on their
device to run but also what libraries
that we want to use so anyways
go ahead stick with me just like Android
2.2 for consistency now for your
application name go ahead and name this
the exact same is your project name so
what if your project name is Bucky name
that Bucky for your package name now I
don't know if you guys know this you
should for Marshall my Jeff laurels but
a packet is just it's just how they
organize classes in Java so go ahead and
they have a weird system if you watch my
iPhone developments Orioles then it's
kind of the same naming system but
anyways you have to start with com
always and kind of like each other class
you separated by period you know what
I'm not gonna go over a package name me
because well quite frankly it's boring
but anyways just go ahead and write comm
dot the new Boston da Android dot and
then just name your project but every
project name is Bucky if you want to
look up how to name packages go ahead
and google it because it's pretty boring
if you ask me bye anyways whenever you
write create activity if this isn't
checked by default go ahead and check it
this means well it says right there
specifies if you want to create a
default activity and a default activity
is this it's pretty much the first file
that gets called or pretty much the
first class that runs whenever you start
your program
so anyways go ahead and name this
something like main activity so what
this is gonna do is it's gonna create a
class called main activity and this is
the first class that's gonna be called
whenever you run our advice now on our
minimum SDK version go ahead and type in
the number 8 and how do we know that's
number 8 check this out on our build
target Android 2.2 the API is 8 right
there so that's pretty much what it's
asking what API
again like I said this is linked to your
Android 2.2 and it's basically saying um
what's the minimum version of Android
needed to run this application
aka what libraries do we want to use so
anyways now that everything is set up
this finish button should be clickable
and there you go so go ahead and why not
click that just like that and now check
this out right here we're getting errors
in our project but if we wait a little
bit then air is the spirit that may
confuse a couple of you guys at first
but let me tell you guys why that's
happening if you're getting errors first
of all just wait a couple seconds and
don't worry the reason you're getting
errors is because this program compiles
everything as it goes along
so anyways it compiled everything and
that pretty much means it checked our
program before I was finished setting it
up so it likes a half of it up and then
checked it for errors and since whoa you
got half a program here I'm gonna give
you an air and then it finished setting
up and then it was like oh my bad duh
you're good to go so that's why the
error went away
so if you see air just hold your horses
and uh yeah that's it just hold your
horses
so anyways go ahead and expand source
and comm dot the new Boston Android
Bucky and double-click mainactivity.java
and we see it already built this first
class for us so check it out go ahead
look around if you like what you see
which you should then you can go ahead
and run it just kidding I fooled you you
can't run it just yet and the reason for
that is this in order to run mmm how am
I gonna say this in order to run a
Android application on your computer you
need something called an emulator now
the most basic way I can describe you
guys what emulator is it's a fake
Android on your phone it's a fake Droid
pretty much that you put on your
computer so if you guys were follow
along with my iPhone tutorials it's
pretty much a simulator it simulates an
Android device on your computer BAM
there I finally got it out so anyways we
need to create one of the
emulators to run on our computer so ever
saying all right Bucky enough giving me
the definition let's just go ahead and
create one where here's what you do
first of all go up to here where this
low button is and it says opens the
Android SDK and AVD manager go ahead and
click that and now let me move this over
what we want to do is we want to create
a new AVD so let's go ahead and click
that and look at this box that pops up
what we want to do is first give a name
and I'm gonna name mine like Bucky's
underscore phone because you know why
not name of them and you also need to
give it a target and if you scroll over
this you see the version of Android to
use in the virtual device well make sure
your target is the same however you set
up your project and if you remember ours
was Android 2.2 level 8 so go ahead and
click that and all this stuff should be
good by default so let's go ahead and
click create a VD that looks good looks
good has a nice little checkbox and it
says a valid virtual device if it has a
check you know it's good so let's just
go ahead and and X out of this search
saying all right finally I'm ready to
run this dang project well actually you
needed to do one more stupid thing and I
promise you guys this is the last thing
you need to do before you actually run
this program you need to tell eclipse
that that is the fake Android that you
want to use in first of all I apologize
if I keep saying iPhone instead of
Android it's just because I keep
developing iPhone apps everyday but
anyways if I say iPhone accidentally
then you know just deal with it but
anyways what we need to do now is tell
eclipse that that is the Android
emulator that we want to use when we're
developing for this project so here's
how you do this go up to run and select
run configurations right there now what
we need to do is click Android
application expand that and click a new
configuration now we see all this crap
that pops up and here's what we need to
do in the name just go ahead and type in
new configuration whatever they give you
by default it doesn't really matter to
be honest now in our project what we
want to do is we want to browse and
select whatever project we're working on
or if you know the name of the project
just go ahead and type it in I'll let
you guys decide on that one so now after
this what we need to do is let me make
sure I got everything new config name
knit project yep we don't need to do
anything with this all right the only
other thing we need to do is go over to
this little target panel and we need to
select well you can see right here
select a preferred AVD for deployment
this is pretty much the fake Android
that you want to use go ahead and select
what one you want to use and then go
ahead and you need to hit apply
so go ahead hit apply and then well
let's go ahead and X out of here alright
so we have everything set up our what's
it called our configuration or pretty
much eclipse is configured to that
emulator we're good to go
now whenever you want to run this
program or test it out the only thing
you need to do is go up here and hit run
new configuration so go ahead and hit
this Run button and check it out a bunch
of boxes pop up and bam look at this our
program is running how awesome is this
this says Android and it has a nice
little blinky thing at the bottom and if
you have any errors go ahead and Excel
this if you have any errors then they're
gonna pop up down here but anyways we
now have everything set up and we now
should have whenever you click this
button then our emulator and our program
actually runs so if you're to this point
then you're ready to move on to the next
tutorial if you're not to this point yet
then you did something wrong you need to
watch this tutorial again so anyways I
am done talking I'm out of breath and
