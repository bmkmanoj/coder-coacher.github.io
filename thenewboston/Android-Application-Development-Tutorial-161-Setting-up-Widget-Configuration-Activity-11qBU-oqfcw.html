Android tutorial for the new Boston and
sorry I cut off that last tutorial so
abruptly but I didn't like the way it
was flowing and also it got too long so
I'm just gonna pick up right where we
left off in the last tutorial we set up
this resource called
you know XML widget stuff so we're gonna
set that up first before we set up our
other activity within the manifest so
what we're gonna do is we're gonna go to
our package name our project name go to
write right click new Android XML file
and we're gonna call this exactly what
we called you know this resource
reference so we called it widget
underscore stuff and what we want this
to be is a widget an app widget provider
so we're gonna check this and make sure
it goes into the resource folder right
here it should but just double check
make sure it's in there and hit finish
so now we have an app widget provider
and again this is what's going to be
this is what we're we're making
reference to for you know our widget
class and so we have this app widget
provider and this is gonna help us
develop our app or widget I should say
but you know we'll probably get into
that in the next tutorial but the main
thing I want you guys realize is this
configure again the configure is going
to be an activity that gets called right
when we develop or create our app on on
the home page or a home screen so we're
going to set this configure up to equal
as basically you know that configure
class we called widget configure or
config and we first need to refer to our
package name which my package is comm
dot the new Boston dot Travis and then
refer to your class name which was
widget config and that's gonna basically
say this is the activity I want you to
launch when we did do some configuration
or do some stuff before we actually
display the widget on the person's phone
so it's just going to open up that class
and now what we have to do is we have to
define that class in the manifest and
say hey we also want to make this
connection that it's going to be a
configuration type
type of class so let's go back into our
manifest and we're going to set up that
activity that is going to be our
configure activity so again just give us
some space to work with within the
application I'm gonna copy this activity
up here because it has the intent
filters and everything attached to it so
you know you kind of want to have this
format and we're just going to change
the class name to again widget config
and we also want to change the action
name and have no category so we're just
going to delete the category out of our
intent filter and we need to change the
action name so it knows that this is a
configuration type activity so what we
need to make this action name be is
again referring to the Android dot app
widget dot action dot uppercase app
widget underscore config configure I'm
sorry and that's basically the action
name that we need this this activity to
have because again this is going to do
the background information for widget
and we need to have this reference if we
you know set that up within our app
widget provider here and again this is
connected to our pointless widget class
by using this metadata the resource so
again everything kind of ties together
but we have everything that we need
defined in the manifest and that's
probably gonna be it for this tutorial
again just the configure is we have to
have this action name
if we're gonna refer to it within the
resource XML so I'll catch you guys in
the next tutorial and I hope you have a
good one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
