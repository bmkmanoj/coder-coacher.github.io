you hold ctrl and drag it'll go and like
finer increments so you don't like kind
of like blast everything out so there we
go
that's pretty good oh we got some down
here I want to get rid of we just want
to make sure while we're doing this that
we're not eating away at some of the
other footage so it doesn't look like
it's too bad right now we can keep going
let's go check out our final result make
sure we didn't eat away everything nope
put this back on I'm not seeing any not
see any green maybe something right
there we can
keep on going with this
so let's check go back to our status and
check now what we're doing is we're just
refining things to make an even better
key now look like a pretty good key but
I mean now you can see different things
that we can refine to make better now
another way we can do this is to mess
with this clip clip black again so let's
go we have to have this screen man
section twirl open and clip black is
right here and the clip black is going
to go off faster so
more this way it looks like but you can
see it's eating a lot more of the of the
image away so it was at fifth it was at
fifteen at first I think when I put it
at 15 and I'll toggle between fifteen
and thirty seven so that's 15 and this
is 37 so I mean I helped a little bit
looks like we got some a little bit of
hard edges here started me to zoom in
that fact that hard everything's not
gonna be like we're perfect let's go
back to 15 and see how our edges work
there's still a little hard but that's
what happens when you key so these are
the small things that you can see when I
was talking about don't work don't work
on a key for only like a minute you need
to work on it a little bit by a little
bit and make a better key so we got that
going on there the best way to get rid
of all this noise and stuff like that
start with clip black like we did before
remember we use clip black to get rid of
all the extra noise and stuff like that
and then go to screen gain to do the
finer tuning so that's usually the best
way to go about that the another thing
that we can use here is this replace
method down here and this usually kind
of deals with the dispel bias and
remember when we selected the skin tone
here to get the colors back in and I
started changing the bell color and
everything like that if we start
changing the colors here our replace
methods
the colors are will get a little
different this one looks like a guy like
kind of looks like it got even more
blurry or something like that
your source source brings in a lot of
green it's not
and there's none which this kind of
looks like our color key thing so to me
this hard color soft color I kind of
like the soft color the best that seems
to be working the best the next
parameter I want to go over is a screen
softness here and if i zoom in and I
look here at the edges we can see that
some of them are kind of jagged like
this one and these are a little bit
jagged but not too bad
if we add a little bit of screen
softness I'm talking like one here you
can see what it does there it kind of
softens the edges a little bit for us
and that's your preference whatever you
like better depends on how hard and
crappy or I just get but if they are
somewhat decent then you don't have to
mess with a screen softness too much the
next section we would come over here to
is the screen shrink slash grow and
sometimes you may have noticed that
there might be like some colored edge or
something like that for example if I go
grow this you can see that there's a
dark edge and this might happen to you
sometimes what you want to do is shrink
the screen edge and it'll it'll still
eat away but you can eat away at your
footage but you can get rid of that
screen word of that dark edge if you
really needed to now I hope mine is zero
I didn't even realize it and I thought
that zero was a pretty good at that
setting I guess was pretty good so I
don't really need to mess with this
green shrink grow at all in mind
so that's the end of a more advanced
tutorial on how to use key light and how
to refine your keys so there's other
stuff that we can go up for at another
time but for now you have a basic
understanding of how to use key light
and this tutorial brought you like an
intermediate understanding of how to use
key light - and now you should be able
to pretty much key almost anything with
this and it's gonna be awesome so
because key light is a really powerful
tool so thanks for watching this one
thumbs up if you like comes down if you
hate and subscribe if you want to keep
in touch and receive notifications we'll
make new tutorials so thanks a lot you
guys thanks for watching have a good one
