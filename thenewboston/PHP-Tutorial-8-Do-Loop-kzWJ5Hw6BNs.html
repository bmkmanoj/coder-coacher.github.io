tutorial in this tutorial I'm going to
be teaching you guys about another fun
loop called do loop now what this loop
allows you to do is it allows you to
execute an action at least one time no
matter if it's true true or false so
let's go ahead and let me just show you
the best way by just walking you through
the process of course we have a variable
number and we'll set it equal to 1 now
the do loop starts with the syntax do
and then go to the next line and this is
going to have a bunch of code so we're
going to be entering some curly braces
let me just move them over here so you
guys can see them easier
now in the middle this is what we want
it to do in the beginning so we're going
to say before we even tell you what the
boundaries are take the variable number
add one to it and then we want you to
echo whatever that number is and then
move on to the next line
so again this says all right here's what
we want you to do take the number add
one and then we want you to spit out
that number and show us what it is and
then we want you to add a break which
means just go on to the next line and
then after that outside of your curly
braces or curly brackets whatever you're
called we want to do this while the
variable number is less than ten so all
variables less than ten then they just
keep doing this so go ahead and save
this and show you guys I first added the
number 1 to 1 which is 2 and then it
kept doing that until it got to 10
but as you can see
that well this is a really good example
because it doesn't anyways but let's say
the number was zero now as you can see
this condition is false because 1 is not
less than 0 it's more than zero so now
here's what's going to happen we're
going to take this variable and it's
going to say alright spit out the
variable add 1 to it then echo the
number which will be 2 then go on to the
next line and it's going to spit all
that out and it's going to show us that
it's going to give us a 2 and then it's
going to come down here and says while
the variable is less than 0 it's just
going to bake whoa I wasn't even
supposed to do that all right I'm going
to stop doing that so now you save it as
you can see it just spits out that too
one time now as you can see unlike
before it allows it to do it one time
and just once if it's false but if it's
true then it allows you to go through
the whole entire process so that's why
why the do loop is useful and a lot
different than the regular while loop
and in the next tutorial I'm probably
going to be going over another loop so
study this one until you figure out what
all it means I tried my best explain it
and then when you're ready go on to the
next door
