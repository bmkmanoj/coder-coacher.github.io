surface area of a pyramid we're going to
learn how to find the volume of the
pyramid so the formula for volume of a
pyramid is V equals one third base area
times height okay now there's a couple
things we need to talk about first so ba
is area of the base so the area of a
base so the area of a base of a pyramid
is going to be the area of this square
so to find the area of a square we take
length times width which first square we
know would just be side squared because
they have equal length and width times
the height so that's our final formula
for volume now when we talk about the
height we're not talking about this
height of this triangle right here we're
talking about the height that if you
drew in would come perpendicular from
this point up here to the center of the
base so the height is the altitude drawn
perpendicular to the center of a base so
sometimes we're going to have to use our
Pythagorean theorem to solve for this
length because if you look at it this
height with this height of this triangle
and and this little line right here
forms a right right triangle with this
being the height this being one half of
the length and then this being just the
height of the triangle which just so we
don't get confused we're just going to
call this a
so sometimes we're going to have to use
that to give us our H but you have to
make sure you are taking that the line
drawn perpendicular to the center of the
base so now that we know how to find
volume we're going to do some examples
where we have to find volume so a volume
is equal to one-third length times width
times H now since it's since we're
multiplying these and multiplication is
commutative it doesn't matter what order
we multiply in as long as we multiply
the right stuff so volume is equal to
one-third and since we know that the
bottom of this is a square it'll be
eight times eight or eight squared times
our height which is this line right here
which just so happens to be three so V
equals one-third eight times eight is
sixty-four times three now we're going
to multiply these all together so if you
look the three is going to cancel to the
one-third because when we multiply
fractions remember we multiply across so
this three is like a 3 over 1 and if we
multiply across we'd get 3 over 3 which
is just 1 so our volume is equal to 64
and we're in centimeters so centimeters
cubed remember volume is always written
in cubic units so now we're going to do
one more example so volume is equal to
one-third length times width H so volume
is equal to one-third 4 times 4 H and
right here that's a seven
so volume is equal to one-third times 4
squared is 16 times 7 now I don't know
that at the top off at the top of my
head so I'm going to plug that into a
calculator real fast and if you do that
you will get thirty seven point three
three three repeating and then pretend
they gave us inches this would be inches
cubed now that's all we're going to do
with volume of a pyramid but make sure
make sure you come back and watch the
next video which is gonna be our final
video in this series for intro to
geometry and then after that we're going
to go into geometry with which takes the
things we learned in these videos and
makes us do something a little bit
harder with them so make sure you come
back to check that out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
