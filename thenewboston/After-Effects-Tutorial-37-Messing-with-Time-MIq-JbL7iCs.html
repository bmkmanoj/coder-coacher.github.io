Effects tutorial and in this tutorial
I'm going to be going over how to mess
with time a little bit and things like
how to put your video in slow motion how
to speed it up how to put it in reverse
and how to do some other cool stuff so
the first thing I want to teach guys is
the real basics so let's go ahead and
create a new comp I'll get that come for
my sister again right here so let me get
rid of these they annoy me so now we got
a basic comp of me my sister butter and
some toes too right there and the first
thing I want to teach you guys is the
real basics of how to speed up and slow
down this animation so let's go ahead
and click on the layer we want to work
with and actually before this got a
composition composition settings and put
this at like five an extra man that way
we can get our video but our composition
is longer so we can whenever we speed up
the video it uh well just do it you'll
see why so now that we have this video
in real time nothing new change here and
say we want to speed up or slow down
this layer so what we would do is we
would go to layer time and then you
would go to time stretch now such
stretch but you can shrink it as well
and whenever you stretch it at a factor
of more than 100 then what does is put
it in slow motion it takes your layer or
video in for every minute it would
stretch it to two minutes so let's go
ahead and actually it's change that 300
or something and now as you can see the
new duration would be 12 minutes in it
used to be for something so now when you
play is see she is three times as slow
issue would be so now let's say we want
to speed that up so now go to layer time
and then go to time stretch and then go
to something like 20 and this would make
her five times as fast so click OK and
as you can see the layer now sure
because what it's doing is it's
compressing everything and making it
speed up so let's go ahead and play that
and wow look how fat she is a nice look
at her butter that Britt and so that's
how you are either speed down or speed
up a layer again time speed up speed
down slow down or speed up there we go
time and then go to time Strich so let's
go ahead and stretch you head back to
one hundred percent and I want to show
you guys how to reverse this now there's
a shortcut to reverse it and instead of
control our control alt our iron
keyboard and if you have a Mac it's like
command optional or something I don't
know i don't use macs oh and i know i'm
probably going to give negative comments
about that but anyways the point i want
to show you guys how to reverse this
video any time you want to reverse a
layer what you need to do is go up the
layer time and then you go time reverse
layer and as you can see now you get a
little red bar at the bottom of your
screen so let me find something now
actually show a reversing right here
walking backwards proper so now play
this and now you can see that the entire
movie is reversed so it's kind of slow
now just because it's a trying to render
it don't get fooled don't think that I
mess with time remapping or anything but
yeah this pretty much how you reverse
layer again the shortcut for that is
control all are so again that is how you
slow down and speed up a movie and
that's also how you reverse movie so
hopefully combining these two things
will give you some pretty cool effects
in the next tutorial I'm going to show
you guys how to freeze frame and the
problems that come along with freeze
frame and how to correct it so in the
next tutorial you'll be able to be a pro
at freeze framing anywhere in your
animation so that's it for this tutorial
thank you guys for watching and I hope
to see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
