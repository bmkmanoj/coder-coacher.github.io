Effects tutorial and in this tutorial
we're gonna begin working with effects
now effects in After Effects is pretty
much something special you can do to the
video and this can include
changing the color of it changing the
brightness blurring your image or also
just something totally random and
different so let's go ahead and let me
show you guys how to do this first of
all you can only apply effects to the
layers you want so in order to apply it
to one layer go ahead and select
whatever layer you want to apply it to
right down here since I only have one
layer it's easy but if you have multiple
layers select the one you want to apply
it to and now after you have that layer
selected there's a couple different ways
you can apply effect to it the most
noticeable one probably is at this
effects
little tab at the top go ahead and click
that and now you see your whole list of
effects these are just grouped in
different categories so for easier
finding but pretty much these are all
effects and they have a little arrow to
expand on the right so go ahead and
click any effect I'm gonna click CC
glass that's a good one and what this
does as you see is apply a little glass
looking I don't even know to the image
so now my video when I play it I look
like the guy from deliverance that plays
the banjo but anyways no offence the
banjo players but yeah that's pretty
much what effects those it adds some
sort of special effects to your
composition and again there are hundreds
and hundred of these and you can also
download custom ones from the internet
but we'll probably get in that a little
bit later so anytime you want to delete
in effect
go ahead under your effect and press the
delete now I probably shouldn't done
that so here we redo that and what I
wanna I said I didn't want to do that
because first I want to show you
is how to toggle your effects if you're
working with effects and you have this
minimize any time you want to bring up
the effects just select your layer and
press e on your keyboard and this will
bring up whatever effects you have so
from there you can go ahead and probably
delete it just want to show you guys
that first now a different way in um
like a way most people put effects on
their screen I believe is in order to do
this in an alternative way you have an
effects and presets panel over here let
me expand it and so if you want to apply
an effect this way what you can do is go
ahead and click your layer that you want
to effect go ahead and click one of
these effects like color correction or
something and then here here's a good
one
go ahead and click 'ok no you don't have
to click expose your Bible you can
either drag it on your composition like
this or just double click it and you
will get the effect applied to your
image now this brings me to another
thing anytime you apply an effect to an
image you get this many little I don't
know like an effects control panel
you also have settings under your effect
right here but it's usually easier to
manipulate them in this little control
panel so anytime you apply to effect I
believe every single one of the time it
has little presets and this is how you
change the effect so for example we have
exposure effect applied to this and
exposure has a bunch of different
settings that's a word I was looking for
settings so again any time you want to
adjust any of these settings all of them
are in here and they aren't always a
scroll bar some of them have little
graphs and some of them have difference
though for example if you search curves
and I guess that brings me to another
thing anytime you want to search for
effect just go ahead and type in your
search box don't really need teach you
guys how to do that but again anytime
you want to search run like a color here
is all the stuff you can do with color
but I want to go
which is kind of like color and again I
want to apply this to my composition so
I'll grab it and apply to my composition
and this also lets you know that anytime
you have a layer all of the effects are
right here and you can also apply many
effects at the same time so let's go
ahead and edit curves let's bring this
down this down and as you can see some
of them are graphical some of them have
drop-down boxes let's take my red and
bring it down as you can see some of the
red disappears and another thing in the
last thing I want to point out is
anytime you don't want a view in effect
or don't want to have an effect or you
just want to temporarily disable it on
your main effects panel or right here
you have this little checkbox called FX
this means toggle the main effect off so
look at my exposure when it's on right
now whenever I talk about off the
exposure goes away whenever I talk with
my curves off the curves goes away so if
I want to toggle on both off I get both
preset so that's um well it's kind of
just useful if you want to just like
avoid it for a little bit then I guess
that's what you would do if you want to
get rid of a totally then just go ahead
and delete it but again the main things
I want to stress are how to get effects
on your composition and also that you
can have many effects at the same time
and aside from that anytime you want to
edit the settings of the effects which
every effect has you got to go in this
go you got to go in this effects control
so that's your real quick tutorial on
how to work with effects and I will end
for you guys by applying this CC glass
effect because I know you guys like that
so much Rory a CC glass there we go
right there
so again I hope you guys enjoyed don't
forget to subscribe I hope you learned a
little bit in effects we're probably
gonna be going over more in the next
tutorial but again thank you guys for
watching and I'll see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
