let's see your fifteenth intermediate
Java tutorial and this is where I'm
going to be talking about a new data
structure and this is called a priority
queue and what this is is it's pretty
much closely related to you know how I
related stacks to a pile of dishes a
queue is pretty much as closely related
to like a line at the grocery store or
something whoever gets there first has
the highest priority and that's who gets
taken care of first or checked out
whoever gets unless if there's five
people ahead of them they're the least
priority
that's who you're going to worry about
last so unlike a stack worth um the
first thing that sits on top that's what
gets taken care of then it gets popped
off in the queue the first thing that
gets there first which would be at the
bottom I guess is the first thing that
gets taken care of so let's go ahead and
view an example of this and once you do
you'll see what I'm talking about so
let's go ahead and type priority queue
you you eat a bit and I think I even
typed it slow and mess it up so let's go
ahead pry over it see Q it'll tell me if
I'm around in a second and go ahead and
type pestering that in this and I'm
going to name mine the letter Q because
that's the easiest to do and just go
ahead and copy the skin q equals set
equal to new paste empty parameters for
a constructor so now we have a queue and
I named it the letter Q because I don't
feel like typing anything longer than
that so in order to populate a queue
what you need to do is you need to offer
it something so go ahead and put Q dots
offer and what this does is anything you
pass it in it's going to be the first
priority so the first thing we pass it
in is going to be the highest priority
so I'm going to name it first and let's
go ahead and copy this two more times so
go paste paste first second
and third so now we have three things in
our queue or which is basically a line
the first thing is the highest priority
the second thing is a second that gets
taken care of and the third thing this
is the last thing that's going to get
taken care of when we're doing stuff to
it so in order to print out a queue just
go ahead and put printf so
system.out.print F and for the format go
ahead and put % s and for the argument
you can go ahead and put the entire
queue and this is how you print out an
entire queue at once so after this we're
just going to want to print out blank
lines so system.out.print line and let's
go ahead and make sure we don't have any
errors so far so run this and now you
see our queue is first second third so i
things going good as of now so now that
we know how to put elements in a queue
what you often want to do is something
called peak elements and this is a way
of looking at the element with the
highest priority without changing your
queue or line at all so let's go ahead
and in order to do the method peak put
system.out.print F and you pretty much
want to print out the entire stack again
let's go ahead and print a string
variable and for your variable it's
going to be queue but you want to call
the peek method on this and like I said
this method is going to look at the
element with the highest priority and
that's what element is going to return
to you so let's go ahead and print out a
blank line after this print line and now
it's going to return to us the element
with the highest priority if we did all
right and there we go so first it looks
at this line right here the queue and it
returned first so what that means is
this element is the one with the highest
priority
whenever I'm program and that's the
element or method I'm going to get taken
care of first
so aside from peak another thing you
want to do is whenever you're done
calling a method or done using a
variable you usually want to remove it
well it depends on your program but you
often want to remove
it and in order to remove the element
with a highest priority and you probably
want to remove it once you're done using
it you call a method on it called pole
so you call a method called pole on your
entire queue and automatically searches
through it find what element has a
highest priority and it's going to
remove it from your queue so go ahead
and put queued up pull empty parameters
because you don't need to pass it which
one you want to remove it automatic
it automatically knows what one to
remove so now let's just go ahead and
put system.out.print F and for the
format go ahead and print out a string
variable and go ahead and might as well
just print out our entire queue again so
now that we removed the element with the
highest priority our queue should now
only have two elements in it since it
originally had three but since we
removed run it should have two now so
let's go ahead and run this and now you
see it removed first so now second and
third are the only elements in our queue
so that's the basic of what queue is and
how to use a couple more common methods
on it so thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
