seventh html5 tutorial and in this
tutorial I want to talk to you guys
about something called negation
pseudo-classes now a negation
pseudo-class is kind of a different kind
of way that we can look at CSS because
up until this point we've basically
taking elements such as paragraphs and
applying styles to them but with the
negation pseudo-class we pretty much say
what we want exclude from the CSS rules
sounds weird it is so let me mention
this first I basically took everything
out of main CSS and and our regular main
website I just have five paragraphs that
aren't styled at all and it has a parent
of mommy
so we're basically working with this
five boring plain paragraphs so now the
first thing I want to do is I want to
apply an overall style to the entire
website so go ahead and add asterisks
and by the way if you forgot an
asterisks pretty much means effect every
tag whether it's a paragraph expand if
effect everything and what I want to do
is I pretty much want to turn everything
blue so now if we refresh this no matter
if it's a paragraph a div whatever it is
it's going to turn everything blue just
like that pretty sweet huh so now for
the sake of this tutorial let me change
a couple of these I want to put the
first one and third one in the Sally
class so now two four and five are in
the Bucky class the first and third
paragraph are in a Sally class so go
ahead and save that and now I'm actually
going to type out this rule because once
I type out the entire the entire rule
and then I talk you guys through it's
going to be really easy to see because
you can pretty much read it from left to
right and understand what it's saying so
for this I'm going to color it red and
now that it's typed out I want to tell
you guys what I did here I pretty much
made a negation class and what this is
saying is okay color our entire website
blue we got that done now everything
that is not in the class Bucky color red
so if you look what's not in the class
Bucky well Sally isn't in the class
Bucky and this Sally isn't in the class
Bucky so those things we say okay color
red so let's go ahead and refresh this
and if we do that we can see that these
paragraphs indeed got colored red
because the only thing in this website
that wasn't in the class Bucky was this
first and third paragraph so basically
in order to use negation pseudo classes
we are basically excluding some things
from the overall style whatever style it
inherited so in order to do that at a
colon and type the keyword not now
inside the parenthesis right after it we
want to say what things do we want not
to be affected and for this we wrote
anything that's not in the class Bucky
and since that's not affected we need to
write okay well then what rule do we
want to apply to it and we just gave you
the attribute of red font coloring so if
we look this one more time we see that
we have two paragraphs that are not in
the class Bucky and that is why those
got styled red or excluded from what
rule was inherited so that has a
negation pseudo class and in the next
tutorial I'm going to be covering some
weird symbols some other rules
concerning css3 it's going to be awesome
so thank you guys for watching don't
forget to subscribe it and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
