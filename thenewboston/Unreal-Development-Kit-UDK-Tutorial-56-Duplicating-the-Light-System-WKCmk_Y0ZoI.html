tutorial and check it out we already
have a pretty cool level where we can go
ahead and go up to the light and shoot
it out and it looks like it blows it out
but what if we wanted to build a big
level and have a bunch of these lights
well let's go ahead and figure that out
right now so the very first thing that
we could do is I'm actually going to be
putting more lights on this wall so I'm
going to go ahead and expand this wall a
little bit by X I'm just scroll out and
move it over a little bit looking pretty
good so now what I'm going to be doing
is I'm going to be duplicating these
lights so I'm going to be you know
selecting all of these things and I
don't want this wall to get in the way
so if i go ahead and select this wall
and hit this button hide selected it's
going to hide out my wall and it's going
to allow me to select these things a
little bit easier so now i can go ahead
in my side view and hold ctrl alt and
select all that crap right there and if
i hold alt in drag it's going to be able
to duplicate them a whole lot easier
without selecting that wall so now
actually what i can do is go ahead and
press this button show all and it can
bring my wall back because I just didn't
want to accidentally select my wall
whenever I was duplicating that so now
you're saying all right you do paid your
light should be good to go so let's go
ahead and test this out hit play from
here run up to this one perfect shot
that out run up this one hmm doesn't
seem Lee we work in here so what exactly
is the problem well the thing is
whenever you duplicate objects using
that technique it duplicates the objects
in the perspective view but it doesn't
duplicate the kismet see for example we
only have this first lights system set
up so we need to go ahead and change
that right now so go ahead and hit ctrl
alt and select your entire lighting
system so now what you want to do is
hold ctrl C to cut and V to paste and
now you can just go ahead and move that
over it actually is pretty good if you
move keep this one on the left and this
one on the right since then you can tell
what while use on your left and what
light is on your right however check
this out right now
if you look at the event it says enter
back through 10 enter Pachter 10 all
right this is 10 this is 10 so this
isn't a system that's set up for this
light right here these are pretty much
as to kismet systems and they're both
set up referring to this light right
here so we go ahead and play our level
whenever you shoot our light okay it
doesn't seem to be really working so
let's go ahead and fix that the first
thing I want to do is rebuild my
lighting because it is just annoying me
and let me think of a cool story to tell
you guys that take up five seconds I'm
sorry I got nothing so yeah I'm just
going to wait here awkward that was
awkward so now let me go ahead and
rebuild the system so the very first
thing we want to do is we already have
this kismet setup now let's go ahead and
change this so let me go ahead and
select this and as you notice this is
the bus that out light right here that
we're selecting so go ahead and select
your busted light and open kids met and
here is a system to the right that we
want to alter so the very first thing we
want to do is actually it's probably
easier to do this go ahead and select
your busted light and hit hide this now
whenever we high that the glowing light
is going to show so if we go ahead and
select that glowing light which is the
first light the light that takes the
damage we can go ahead and right-click
this event right here and we want to
assign interp actor to two events now
check it out instead of interp actor ten
taking damage now this inter bacter to
which is this one takes the damage so
basically with that light selected we
also want to go over here to the lit up
light and right click it and put a sign
enter pachter 22 object variables so
basically what we're doing is this
system over here references this light
over here and we're changing this system
over here to reference this stuff over
here so now what we want to do is I
guess we can go ahead and select our
spotlight in our perspective view
and in kismet right click and hit a sign
spotlight talkable 22 this variable and
the last thing we want to do is we want
to assign that busted light to this
system so if we go ahead and show all
again we get our busted light back so
now select your busted light right click
it and hit assign busted light to this
object so now we have two custom systems
the first system right here is referring
to this first light over here and now
the second system right here is
referring to this entire system right
here what's the light spotlight and all
so now let me go ahead and scroll out of
that and now I'll go ahead and right
click and play from here and we'll see
how it works so our first system
whenever we shoot it it shuts off
perfectly it doesn't affect this system
at all and now this system whenever we
shoot it it shuts off perfectly and
everything is working beautifully so I
just want to go over a couple points um
before I let you guys go first of all
whenever you copy objects that have
kismet applied to them it only copies
the visible object it doesn't copy the
coding or the kismet behind the scenes
and also whenever you want to assign a
new variable to pretty much the same
system pretty much to replace an object
in the system I need to do is select the
object in your perspective view right
click it and assign it a new object or a
new event so it's as easy as that so if
you guys are just trying to you know
copy your system and it wasn't working
then that was probably why so that's all
you get for this tutorial thank you guys
