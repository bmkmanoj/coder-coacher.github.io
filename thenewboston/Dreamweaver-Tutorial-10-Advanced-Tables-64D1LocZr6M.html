tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
to be teaching you everything else that
you need to know about tables the first
thing I want to teach you guys how to do
is delete columns or rows now I told you
guys how to insert columns or rows but
let's say that you made a table and you
have this data right here then you have
this extra row sticking out all you have
to do the easiest way I know there are
other ways but this is the easiest way
just click on the cell and drag across
until both until the entire row or
column is highlighted then press the
button delete and this will delete your
entire row or column with keeping all
the rest of the data intact now one
other thing that you guys are going to
want to be able to do is do something
called merge and split or rows say you
wanted to add a banner across the entire
length of your table right here but you
can't add half of it in this column and
half of it in this column or else oh
look just stupid so you want to merge
these two cells up add up
to do this click and drag across all the
cells that you want to merge now a black
box will appear around the edges of them
then go down right to here till this
little button it caught and it's called
merge cells click that and as you can
see our two cells have become one and
this is useful when you want to combine
cells or span one cell across an entire
length of a table so now we can insert a
banner ad at the top of our website and
keep the rest of these cells intact and
you can also do it with columns say you
wanted to add a navigation bar right
here all you would have to do is
highlight and again click merge and as
you see ourselves combined to become one
cell so now we could add a header or
banner and then have a nice navigation
bar but say you did that and you wanted
to get yourselves back where they were
all you have to do is place your cursor
inside and as you can see this merge has
now
turn into split all you have to do is
click that and it'll give you an option
of how many columns or helm in your Rose
you want to split it into since we want
to get back to columns we want to split
this one cell into two columns so I'm
going to highlight to click ok and as
you can see it turn that one cell into
two different columns now we can enter
data into each individual one some more
real quick things that you can do with
your website I mean your table if you
highlight your entire table you can
change the border color using border
color and simply selecting color as you
can see the border color of our table is
now changed you can also select your
entire table and change the background
color of any single cell or a group of
cells by just highlighting the selected
cells
go down to background and pick in color
you can also type in the hexadecimal
color if you know it and as you can see
it changes the background color of those
individual cells and this is how you can
do changing the color of one or two
cells without affecting the rest of your
table another thing that you can do is
change the border size of your entire
table by highlighting your entire
tighter table and changing this number
next to border this will change it to
however many pixels you want to change
it to so I want to change mine to five
as you can see my table now has a pixel
has a border five pixels wide around it
and the last thing and probably the most
important thing you guys are going to
take away from this tutorial is how to
align your table as you can see our
table is now aligned to the left hand
side of the website with a big open
space to the right hand side to change
this just highlight your entire table go
down here and select center or right I
usually want to put my table in the
center of the web page so just click
center under a line and as you can see
we now have a nice even space from the
right until the left and this now and
the center of the browser this is how
you can make your website appear in the
center of your browser
so now that we learn how to do the basic
attributes to our table I want you guys
to study this and try putting a banner
ad right up here and a navigation bar
right here and if you're watching this
