tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
to be teaching you everything else that
you need to know about tables the first
thing I want to teach you guys how to do
is delete columns or rows no I told you
guys how to insert columns or rows well
let's say that you made a table and you
have this data right here then you have
this extra row sticking out all you have
to do the easiest way I know there are
other ways but this is the easiest way
just click on the cell and drag across
until both until the entire row or
column is highlighted then press the
button delete and this will delete your
entire row or column with keeping all
the rest of the data intact now one
other thing that you guys are going to
want to be able to do is do something
called merge and split or rows say you
wanted to add a banner across the entire
length of your table right here but you
can't add half of it in this column and
half of it in this column or else oh
look just stupid so you want to merge
these two cells up at the top
to do this click and drag across all the
cells that you want to merge now a black
box will appear around the edges of them
then go down right to here till this
little button it caught and it's called
merge cells click that and as you can
see our two cells have become one and
this is useful when you want to combine
cells or span one cell across an entire
length of a table so now we can insert a
banner ad at the top of our website and
keep the rest of these cells intact and
you can also do it with columns say you
wanted to add a navigation bar right
here all you would have to do is
highlight and again click merge and as
you see our cells combined to become one
cell so now we could add a header or a
banner and then have a nice navigation
bar but say you did that and you wanted
to get yourselves back where they were
all you have to do is place your cursor
inside and as you can see this merge has
now
turn into split all you have to do is
click that and it'll give you a option
of how many columns or helm in your rows
you want to split it into since we want
to get back to columns we want to split
this one cell into two columns so I'm
gonna highlight two click OK and as you
can see it turned that one cell into two
different columns now we can enter data
into each individual one some more real
quick things that you can do with your
website I mean your table if you
highlight your entire table you can
change the border color using border
color and simply selecting color as you
can see the border color of our table is
now changed you can also select your
entire table and change the background
color of any single cell or a group of
cells by just highlighting the selected
cells go down to background
in picking color you can also type in
the hexadecimal color if you know it and
as you can see it changes the background
color of those individual cells and this
is how you can do changing the color of
one or two cells without affecting the
rest of your table another thing that
you can do is change the border size of
your entire table by highlighting your
entire tired table and changing this
number next to border this will change
it to however many pixels you want to
change it to so I want to change mine to
five now as you can see my table now has
a pixel has a border five pixels wide
around it and the last thing and
probably the most important thing you
guys are going to take away from this
tutorial is how to align in your table
as you can see our table is now aligned
to the left hand side of the website
with a big open space to the right hand
side to change this just highlight your
entire table go down here and select
center or right I usually want to put my
table in the center of the webpage so
just click Center under a line and as
you can see we now have a nice even
space from the right
and to the left and it's now in the
center of the browser this is how you
can make your website appear in the
center of your browser so now that we
learned how to do the basic attributes
to our table I want you guys to study
this and try putting a banner ad right
up here and a navigation bar right here
