22nd udk tutorial and it is now 1144 at
night and i just woke up so yeah time to
start making some tutorials so and this
is or a while I'm going to be teaching
you guys is how to make your own custom
material and I'm going to be showing you
guys exactly how to connect those
expressions with your material right
here in order to give you some nice cool
effects so the very first thing I want
to mention is this this big box in the
middle of the screen that's where we're
going to be working with the most this
is basically your material now all these
different attributes they're called the
material channels up like I said
sometimes I calm the material attributes
because a material is much more than
just a color or a picture there's a
bunch of different things that make a
beer material and I'm just going to give
you guys the quick tour of what all
these things are the diffuse these to
diffuse things are like the general
overall color of your material the
emissive is the glow the specular stuff
is kind of like the shininess of it the
opacity is like how opaque or
transparent or how much you can see
through your material the distortion
this kind of like how light bends around
your material whenever working with like
water or when something is really hot
and you can see those waves we can use
this property right here uh the
transmission mask and the transmission
color these have to do with how light
passes through your surfaces and let's
see the normal is actually one we're
using quite a bit it's like the texture
or the detail on the custom lighting
allows you to make your own custom light
function or light attribute I want to
say and all of these down here these are
really the ones that we really don't use
that often so these are really specific
and I'm going to be going over these
later but these are your basic swans and
those are your core aspects of material
so as you can see a material is made up
of much more than a color we get shining
this glow all the school stuff so now
that with that being said these are your
attributes so each attribute for example
this color it needs information in order
to tell our material
what color it should be so like I said
all of the information comes from
something called an expression now in
order to change the expression for
diffuse let's go ahead and find an
expression I already know what one we
need let's go ahead and search vector
parameter right here now go ahead and
grab this and drag you out on the screen
and now that you have this vector
parameter you can see a couple things
first of all before I even get to this
vector parameter let me mention this
I'll teach you guys how to navigate
around this first of all in order to
drag it's just like one of your
orthographic graph views just go ahead
and grab it and drag it around in order
to drag one of these boxes say you want
to move this expression closer to this
material you can't go ahead and drag
their else the whole thing is going to
drag so what you need to do is hold ctrl
and drag it and that's probably a good
position like right up there in order to
delete it go ahead and highlight it and
once it's highlighted with yellow just
go ahead and hit delete on your keyboard
but we don't want to delete that for now
so we're just going to go ahead and drag
it out and let me go ahead and ctrl and
drag that a little bit closer so now
what I want to talk to you guys is about
is this expression right here first of
all each of these expressions have their
own custom way of doing things so I
already know that in order to change the
color for material we're going to use
the vector parameter and I'm going to be
going over all these later on but for
now I'm just going to show you guys a
simple example of how you can connect an
expression to one of the attributes so a
vector is think of it is like a list of
numbers so that's where we're going to
use this expression because if you ever
work with color on your computer before
you know that color is made up of more
than one value it's made up of RGB and
so you need three values so that's why
we need this list right here makes sense
so we can't just give it the number like
seven because what the heck color is
seven you need like RGB value of like
you know three values basically so now I
want to talk to you guys about these
tabs as you can see we have tabs on the
right side of this box and
tabs on the left side of this fox so any
tabs that are on the left-hand side are
outputs this is where information is
coming out from any time it's on the
right hand side it's an input so
information always flows from right to
left for example it might be easier to
see if I drag this ad method out here
the add method or the add function it's
typically called an expression by Colin
function sometimes takes two numbers a
ke input from a and B and it outputs one
number simple enough pretty cool huh so
that might be a little more clear to see
but we don't want that in this tutorial
so go ahead and delete that what this
parameter function does is it just
outputs numbers so if you go ahead and
highlight it you can go ahead and change
the values RGB so every color is made up
of our G B value however in the UDK it
doesn't use the default 0 to 255 it uses
a value of zero to one I know it's a
little weird but that's how it works so
go ahead and give your r g and b any
value from 0 to 1 like point 7500 point
five and we'll leave this one at like
point six let's see how that looks so
against this nice pale looking and I'm
actually just going to go ahead and
change this to zero and that looks
pretty good nice hot pink so like I said
we can work with any value from 0 to 1
what we can also do is give a number
greater than 1 so if we take this red
and well let me go ahead and show you
guys how to connect this first in order
to connect this go ahead and take your
black output and drag it over to the
diffuse now with the black output means
is this the black output in this case
transmits the RGB all at once this red
green and blue transmits the red green
and blue data and this white one
transmits the transparency those so
that's why we're using the black output
because we want to give it the entire
list of RGB out once and again I'm not
going to be going over these parameters
I just want to give you guys a basic
idea of how
this how these things are connected in
this tutorial so don't worry if you
don't quite understand that yet but
basically like I was saying before these
RGB values by default you should always
input something from 0 to 1 but you have
the ability of adding a number greater
than 1 now whenever you add a number
greater than 1 it's pretty much going to
boost that color so let's go ahead and
pump this way up and add like the number
25 what this is going to do is boost
this color so it shines even outside the
material so let me go ahead it's my ear
there we go my ear is Asian a little bit
have take care of that so as you can see
whenever we boost the color it gives us
this kind of well as you can see I don't
know how to explain other than just
looking at it it pretty much pumps color
into this object or material so it's
kind of like glowing with that color so
0 to 1 is default values but we can pump
extra color into it give it kind of a
glowing effect so that's the basics of
how you can alter different attributes
with your material by giving them values
via an expression so pretty much all of
these attributes need some value in
order to work and the values confirm
these expressions now these expressions
you can just go ahead and click on them
and give them values or sometimes with
like the ad expression you get two
separate inputs and it calculates an
output but won't be talking about that
later on for this story like I said I
just wanted to explain you guys the
basics of what these are and how you can
connect and expression to these
attributes so with that being said let
me mention this before I let you guys go
in order to save your material go ahead
and make this check box right here and
this has says apply changes to the
original material and before I even want
to mention that in order to disconnect
your expression for a mere material go
ahead and alt click one of these check
boxes and whenever you alt click it
there Ariel is going to disappear so
that's how you disconnect it in case you
guys want to know in order to connect it
again just go ahead and drag
connect it so now that I want to save my
changes i'm going to go ahead and click
this checkbox right here and it's going
to save my changes now I can X out of
this and make sure that you save your
package by having right click and save
and now just like before we have our new
pink material right here so what we can
do is go ahead and drag and drop that on
an object and check it out our new
custom material is applied to this
object pretty awesome huh so that's the
basics of how you can connect
expressions with materials again and
this tutorial I want to teach you guys
is how to make the connections in the
next store i'm going to be talking to
you guys about all the different kinds
of material we can make in all the
different ways the expressions work so
thank you guys for watching don't forget
subscribe and i'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
