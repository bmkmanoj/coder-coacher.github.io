to your let's see third objective-c
tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
to be teaching you guys about something
called variables but Before we jump into
that I want to talk about something that
I actually want to talk about less story
oh but I ran out of time and that's the
concept of spacing now you see that
there's a space above and below this NS
log in st. alright when do I have to
press Enter and when do I have to not
well you pretty much can add as much
space as you want in between statements
whenever you run your program your
computer is going to take all the space
out it doesn't care about it so why do I
add space just so the users such as me
and you in any programmer it's just
easier to read so you know you don't
have to do in any special order I just
want to point that out first the next
concept that I want to talk about is re
we already learned how to print stuff
out to the screen using NS log but what
if we want to print it out well let me
run this first you see whenever we print
it out to our screen hey now brown cow
it's all on one line but what if we want
to print it on two separate lines well
your computer has a special character
for this and it's called the newline
character and what you need to do is
press backspace N and whenever your
computer sees this character it says
alright I know you don't want me to
actually print out backslash n I know
you want me to treat this as pretty much
hitting Enter or return on the keyboard
and moving to another line so let's go
ahead and print this and it says hey now
and on the next line it says brown cow
so whenever we type backslash n in our
program it knows to go to the next line
and that's just a special character that
you guys just have to remember and why
am I telling you this
because I'm going to be doing it a lot
in my programs and I don't want you guys
back backslash n WTF does that mean now
you know just thought I'd throw that to
you guys so now with all that being said
let's go ahead and get to the meat of
this tutorial
nest variables now a variable is
actually pretty important in computer
programming
it's a placeholder of something else so
if you can remember from you know sixth
grade algebra whenever your teacher
wrote x equals 10 on the board whenever
they used that letter X later on in
their math equation you know that the X
symbolized 10 so that's what we're going
to be doing in this computer program so
there are a couple things that your
computer needs to know before you use
variables first what kind of information
are even beholding are you going to be
holding letters
numbers with decimal places whole
numbers well we're going to be holding
integers so go ahead then keyword for
that is int and in case you guys don't
know an integer is pretty much any whole
number without the decimal place like
1080 negative 2 you know anything so now
that we got now that we talked the
computer what kind of information we're
going to be storing we need to give our
variable a name you can name it Bob you
can name it tuna I'm going to name mine
n1 and pretty much anything that you
could have for like a username on AOL
you can use as a variable name you can't
like put dollar sign at sign 72 you know
just just keep it simple so anyways we
have an int variable that's going to be
holding integers and we named it n1 so
now what value do we want to store in it
well in order to set the value go ahead
and put equal sign and put any number
you want as long as it isn't like 60
trillion just go ahead and put n1 equal
to 20 now whenever we use n1 in our
computer program it knows to use 20
instead since that's what it symbolizes
so let's go ahead and rewrite re-write
this formatting string as is called so
it makes sense let's go ahead and write
something like my fave number is and any
time you want to use a variable in a
string you have to do the special thing
you have to put % and then go ahead and
if it's integer variable press I there
are different key letters for different
types of variable but anytime you want
to use
an integer variable press % I now you
says my favorite number is hmm I want to
use some variable in here but you didn't
tell me what's very use in here yet well
in order to tell the variable go ahead
and press comma and then go ahead and
press the variable name N 1 and what
this is going to say is my favorite
number is some variable oh this is the
variable you want to use and these are
called arguments well we'll get in that
later on but that's pretty much what you
got to do so now let's go ahead and
build and run this and now you see my
favorite number is 20 so what it did is
it printed out a string and when it came
across this weird thing is said RA I
know this is a variable I'm going to be
using this variable and I know that it's
equal to 20 so pretty cool huh so aside
from just printing out single variables
you can also print out multiple
variables in well let's go ahead let's
make another variable right under and
let's just name this one n 2 and set
this one equal to 43 these numbers don't
matter
I'm just want to give you guys an
example so put my favorite numbers r % i
which is a variable and let's go ahead
and put % i again which is another
variable so now it says alright you have
one variable right here and now i need
another variable oh my g what's going on
so i already gave it one argument which
is variable and if you want to give
another variable put another comma and
put n2 so it says my favorite numbers
are variable and variable i better have
two variables here's my first one here's
my second one pretty f and sweet so
let's build it and running it again and
I see my favorite numbers are 20 and 43
you know this computer program is turned
out to be real good I might have to sell
this for millions someday but you know
let's do some other stuff to it before
we start doing that so lastly I want to
tell you guys that you can also store
equations of other variables
invariables sounds confusing oh it isn't
so let's go ahead and make another
variable code int and we'll name this
one some and I've said instead of
putting it equal to you know something
like 32 what we're going to do is we're
going to take that first variable name
n1 and the sum of the second burial and
2 and now here's what's going to happen
this sum is equal to whatever n1 plus n2
is so let's go ahead and rewrite rewrite
this entire formatting string the sum of
N 1 or let's just go ahead and put the
sum of variable and variable is variable
so now what we need to do is put N 1 and
2 and sum so now it's going to say the
sum of the first one the first variable
is n1 20 and 43 is 63 so let's go ahead
and run this and see what we get
save all and it says the sum of 20 and
43 is 63 so those are the basics of
using variables in formatting strings
and how to get variables the pram on
your screen and also the fact that you
can use equations of other variables
inside a variable you can set it equal
to another variable so you understand
this later when we actually do it um in
a program that's actually useful and not
just a demonstration but for now I just
want to show you guys the basics of how
to use variables and why they would be
useful so hopefully you guys learned a
little something from this tutorial but
not too much so thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
