Photoshop cs6 tutorial my name is buddy
Blackford and today we're gonna learn
how to warp text using the warp text
option it's pretty cool though it's a
good way to draw attention to a heading
or some kind of word in a Photoshop
document and you don't you aren't
limited to just straight horizontal or
straight vertical text so this is pretty
awesome the good thing about using the
warp text is that when you actually warp
it it doesn't rasterize it so you'll be
able to come back and adjust it anytime
you want unless you go ahead and
rasterize it later on so just keep that
in mind
so let's go ahead and start warping the
text make sure you have your text tool
is selected and select your text and I'm
just gonna click on this button up here
with the T with the it looks like it's
on top of a hill and this is our warp
text option and it usually starts out
with none bring this over here so we can
see what's going on now we've got our
different options going on here twist
our rise and bulge so we've got all this
kind of cool stuff going on here
so I like bold we've got the option to
do a vertical bulge or horizontal bulge
and then we've got we got some some
sliders here to be able to adjust the
percentage values of the different
properties so I don't want to warp so
our been so much so I'll just move it a
little bit or I can change the way that
it's warping or bulging it's the other
way so that's pretty cool you have a
nice fine to an adjustment we've got a
horizontal distortion which is going to
distort it towards one side which can go
to give it like a cool squashing effect
at the end
same thing with vertical distortion so
that's all pretty cool
we can see you can see that you can
create a bunch of different cool things
with that let's go to something up here
here we've got a bend you can see that
you can move it both ways or you can
bend it going this way or this way so
it's pretty cool I like using the warp
text every once in a while but every if
you use it too often or you make it too
huge or something like that it kind of
looks starts to look like vintage old
like Microsoft Publisher style because
remember when Microsoft Publisher came
out first came out you can make all this
cool stuff and know it ends at vs. no
one has ever seen it before so it was
really cool and it was used all the time
so just keep that in mind you don't want
to get to like caddy I guess or trying
to think of the word I can't I can't
think of it but when you use something
all the time and it gets like overdone
so just being pay attention of that but
that's all I wanted to show you it's
pretty easy and it was a it's worth
showing so that you know how to do this
and it's you can do it easily now so
