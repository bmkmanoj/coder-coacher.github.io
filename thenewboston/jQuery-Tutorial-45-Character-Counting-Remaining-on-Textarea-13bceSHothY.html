and this is a video tutorial for the new
Boston now we've already looked at event
handling in jQuery however now we're
going to create an example application
this application is going to involve a
text area with a max length a limited
amount of text that can actually be
typed into the text area but what we're
going to do is we're going to use jQuery
to feed back to the user how many
characters they have remaining so you've
probably seen this on sites such as
Twitter when you type a tweet into the
box it will tell you how many characters
the user has remaining so let's go ahead
and actually design out our HTML I'm
going to create a text area just here
and I'm going to give it some attributes
in just a moment so the attributes we're
giving it are an ID and this is used to
identify the text area I'm just going to
call this text area I'm going to create
two attributes rows and columns which
are just going to be the size so 7 and
25 there and I'm also going to create a
max length attribute and this is going
to be 55 characters so let's go over to
our browser and refresh you can see that
we've got a text area we can type some
text in let's just copy and paste over
and over again and you'll see that the
output has stopped here I can't type
anything else so the max length has
prevented us from typing anything
further than 55 characters however what
we want is a little div down here that's
actually going to relay this information
back so how many characters we have left
as we're actually typing so the first
thing we want to do is create a external
jQuery file and I'm going to save this
inside the j/s folder I'm going to call
this text area Jas the next thing to do
is go ahead and create the div
and this is going to be have an ID of
text area feedback so as the user types
this div is going to be constantly
updated with the amount of characters
that the user has left type ok so inside
text area J s we first of all need to
use the document ready functionality of
jQuery to actually display an initial
character count and this is
automatically going to be 55 so let's go
ahead and say document dot ready
so in jQuery we use a dollar sign and
then we're referencing the document
spell it properly dot ready and inside
of here we're going to create a function
now this is automatically going to be
called code in here when the page loads
so we can test this by saying alert hi
for example when we refresh the page
okay so we haven't included this text
area j/s file in our page yet so let's
go ahead and do that now so script type
equals text forward slash JavaScript the
source is going to be J s forward slash
text area is and we end the script just
there so let's go ahead and refresh our
page to see that a notice come up we've
got a an alert box coming up saying help
up saying hi so we know that our
document ready function is working now
what we want to do is set the maximum
length of the text area so we're going
to create a variable and this is going
to be called a text max that's going to
be equal to 55 now what we want to do is
actually initially put some data in this
div that's under here to tell them how
many characters they actually have to
type so we're going to reference this
and this is called text area feedback so
we want to place some text inside Teck
area feedback using the HTML function
and this text is going to be text
underscore Max and then we're going to
append on some text and then just say
characters remaining so now what happens
is when our document has loaded we set
this variable text max which we can use
later on in the probe in our code and
then we set the text area feed back 255
characters remaining so quite basic
let's just refresh the page make sure
that works we've got 55 characters
remaining now the goal is obviously when
we start to type this value is going to
decrease by one or by you know the
characters that a user is typing and we
need to get the value in order to do
this the first thing that we need to do
is check for an event and the event is
key up so when a key comes up we need to
count the the length of the text inside
the field</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
