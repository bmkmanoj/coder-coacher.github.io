Ajax tutorial and actually I should say
welcome back to myself because I have
been gone for two months my computer
well I have a couple computers but the
one that I make tutorials on it has been
busted my video card got messed up so I
haven't made a Jack's tutorial in about
two months so now I'm back here and I
figured that instead of just jumping
right back in what I can do is I
actually want to not only teach you guys
the next topic but I want to kind of
rewrite the entire Ajax program not only
so I can refresh my own brain but also
anyone who is following along so I
usually have the HTML file all set to go
and also um you know a little bit of the
JavaScript file but now what I'm going
to do is I'm actually going to take
about 40 seconds and rewrite the entire
HTML file and also talk you guys through
the new topic that I'm going to be
teaching in this little mini program and
that is working more in depth with xml
structures so after I teach this you
guys are going to have a better
understanding of not only all the states
not only how an entire Ajax program
works but the last missing piece which
is you know the X in the Ajax XML
structures so of course the first thing
we need to do is make HTML file and
doctype HTML make that simple no weird
XHTML crap taystee ml HTML head head
buddy buddy alright so now go ahead and
add the head and I'm Way too lazy as you
type all that now in the head of course
we're only going to be linking to our
JavaScript file so script
javascript and for the source of course
we have to call it tuna javascript and
now let me just go ahead and end that
script tag all right so our head is
complete again like I said the only
thing that we need to do in the head is
link to the javascript file the body is
going to be a little bit different body
body now in the body the first thing I
want to do before I start adding all the
different tags and stuff is I want to
put on load
what the heck notepad plus plus my
computer is still messed up alright so
on load what we want to do is we want to
call a specific JavaScript function now
we'll just call this process and
eventually whenever we are working with
our JavaScript file we'll have to build
that so this program is basically again
like I said what I want to do is talk to
you guys more in depth about the XML
structure so of course we're going to be
creating an XML file manually and we'll
just have it um like we'll say that
we're a company and we're going to have
it list our employees so here is a list
of artists right people here's a list of
people dot dot who suspensful now add a
couple break tags just to make it all
nice neat break break and now whenever
you want to echo amount or print them
out whatever it's called the D I believe
that we've been calling our div the D so
basically what we have right here is
pretty much to template of the very
beginning of a ajax program we have the
HTML document and the head and i think
that this is all good to go so now
before i start with the javascript file
let's go ahead and create the xml file
so file new
okay now let me just go ahead and save
this as let's just go ahead and save as
to none to XML so tuna dot XML all right
now the first thing we need to do is all
the proper housekeeping stuff so our
browser doesn't get mad at us so XML</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
