on tutorial and this story I'm gonna
show you guys how to build your very own
functions now in the last tutorial I
showed you guys are actually in the last
couple tutorials I've been teaching guys
had to use built-in functions but
there's going to come a time where
you're going to need to make your own
functions and this is useful because if
you want to use the same code over and
over again
it's useful to have a function so the
first thing that we need to do before we
even create a function is something
called defined function now we need to
define a function because when your
Python program comes across the name of
your function it's not going to know
what the heck it is so before you start
calling and using your function you
obviously need to create one
in defining a function and creating a
function is the exact same thing so to
do this go ahead and write d EF on your
screen and this means the final function
which also means curate a function next
give your function a name and I'm going
to name mine what's up and once you
named it you have to put any parameters
you're going to use so after the name
I'm going to put X and you'll see why
later
and again this creates it this names it
and I'm going to use a variable in my
function called X so that's why I have
that now in your function body you have
to write what instructions you want your
function to do so what do I want this
function called what's up to do well the
first thing I wanted to do is return a
value and this is actually going to be
the only thing I want it to do
I'm going to want it to say what's up
and then I'm going to want to write X so
whatever they put in for X I want it to
return what's up and then that name X
and now that's all the function see BAM
roasted toasted the function is created
so how do we use this function well
whenever we supply a variable X it's
going to return the value what's up in
the variable X so whenever we're writing
this in program we're going to want to
print that out
so one on the second I got it so now we
write print and you don't have to print
it you can next or as variable or
anything you want I'm just going to
print this out to show you and next how
you use your function you just call it
by the function name what's up and then
inside your parameters put whatever you
want to have for X so I want to have
let's put Tony so let me go ahead and
run this and it says what's up Tony and
let me show you guys what exactly
happened here this is our program right
here it says print what's up Tony
well wTF is what's up Tony oh you
created a function called what's up all
right
so whatever parameter this is I'm going
to throw this in for X so again that's
why I use the parameter it's like a
temporary placeholder um for whatever
parameter this is so whatever you put in
inside your what's up it gets called to
this one right up here and it just plugs
it in so again if you print out
something else grant what's up make sure
I spell it right and have something else
newb sup newb it's going to say alright
when I use the whatsup function I'm
supposed to return what's up plus
whatever they put in so that's what this
does so that's the basics of the
function and you can also have something
like a math function and not just a
string function so let's go ahead and
create another function called define or
create um plus 10 and if you can't guess
with this sort what this uh function is
going to do yes it's going to add 10 so
instead of returning a name we want to
return whatever they plug in for why we
don't know what it is it so we're just
used Y plus 10 and now we create that
now we put print and let's see
plus then I'm just kidding that says
plus then gotcha and for the parameters
you can put any number you want
so 44 and what this is going to do is
take that 44 plug it in for y and add 10
to it so let's go ahead and press ENTER
and the outputs 54 so again to recap one
more time whenever you create a function
use the you need to have whatever
parameters you're going to take and then
in your return statement
you have to write what you want to do
with those parameters or variables and
then once you call your function or
using your program this gets treated as
that variable which is y and it puts
that in for Y and does whatever you want
to do to it in this case we added 10 to
it that's why we got 44 plus 10 so those
are your basics of functions and how to
create a function and how to write
instructions for your function so pay
attention to this practice making your
own simple functions and in the next
tutorial uh I don't know what I'm going
to be doing but it's going to be sweet
so thank you for watching make sure to
subscribe and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
