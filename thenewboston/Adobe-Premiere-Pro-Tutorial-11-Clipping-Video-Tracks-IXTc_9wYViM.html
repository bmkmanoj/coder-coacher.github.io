tutorial and in this tutorial its kind
of part two of how to edit a real live
video so let's go ahead and well in the
last tutorial let me remind you guys
that what we did is we got a cool
starting point and now all of our video
and audio is synced up so say we wanted
to take this video which was about ten
minutes long and we want to split it up
into two minute segments because you
know people on YouTube their attention
span isn't that long so we want to kind
of shorten up some of the videos so say
here's a good ending point right here
and if you look at your audio then you
can see whenever you have a break then
it's usually a good time to end the
video because you don't want to end it
like a right here because you're in the
middle of a sentence or a word so
whenever you take a break maybe breather
or something that's usually a good time
to end the video so we're probably
switching topics and thinking of what to
say right here so I'm gonna go ahead and
take my selection tool or just hit V and
I'm gonna go ahead and bring all the
clips is that current time indicator
right there right there and make sure
you have snap on because whenever you
have snap on it's going to snap right to
that red line now if we zoom in all of
those clips are ending at the exact same
time so now we got our starting point an
ending point in every single clip and
every single audio file is the exact
same duration pretty cool huh
so now let me go ahead and hide track
number two and as you can see track
number one is of me and track number two
is of Lola so whenever I'm talking I
like to have track number one showing
and whenever Lola's talking I like to
have track number two shown so what I do
is I go through and I switch from track
to track but before I do that I want to
mention this I'm gonna want to do
something called applying levels pretty
much adjusting the contrast to these
video clips however if I start slicing
everything up right now I'm gonna have
to apply levels to everyone individually
so what I like to do is in my effects
I'm going to go ahead and search for
levels right now and apply it to track
number 35 and if I go ahead and hide
this one I can see the levels on this I
usually like to put them around 10 and
45 and now I know I didn't tell you guys
about this but you can also copy effects
and on other tracks paste them as well
so now all the levels that were on this
track are now on this track so I don't
know if you guys can see this or not on
YouTube but if I click hide effect and
show effect you see that there's kind of
a contrast now let me go ahead and
change that even more but at 20 and 235
maybe that will be more apparent all
right let me go ahead and do that to
both tracks again I really don't like
the boost up levels that much but just
for demonstration purposes I'll go ahead
and boost them up like that so now I
have levels applied to this track in
this track which pretty much corrects
the color in a way so now that I got all
the effects I wanted to apply I'm gonna
go ahead and go through my movie and
listen whenever Lola's talking I'm gonna
go ahead and hit cut or just to see with
my keyboard and hit cut and cut and if I
hit V and select that track I can take
it out now check out what's happening
whenever Louis knocking the cameras on
her and now ever and I'm talking the
cameras on me so remember I said this is
kind of like a spaceship with a laser
shooting down and whatever the laser
hits first that's what's going to show
up so let me go ahead and delete that
and I'll show you guys something else so
let's say I want the camera to focus on
low blow three times because maybe she's
talking three times during the podcast
so I'm gonna go ahead and cut here here
here here in here and I think that
should be good
so I'm gonna take out this piece this
piece and I don't know this piece right
here so now during the podcast
I'm gonna be talking she's gonna be
talking I'm gonna be talking she's gonna
be talking I'm gonna be talking she's
gonna be talking and then we end it on
me
and another thing I want to notice if
you say all right in my audio file
Lola starts talking here but the clip is
right there go ahead and just go ahead
and grab your selection tool and bring
that this pretty much changes the
starting point of it the one thing that
you need to make sure you don't do is
you can't change the position of it like
this you can go ahead and change the
starting point by dragging it but if you
change the position like this then
you're gonna go ahead and it's gonna
unsink the video from the audio and the
lips are gonna be moving but she isn't
gonna be talking so then you can go
ahead and slice everything up and you're
gonna cut everything accordingly and
there you have it your final product
pretty sweet huh so you can go ahead and
save it just like this but I'm not done
just yet I went ahead and I added my
levels and I went ahead and I clipped
everything but now I need to go ahead
and add the title at the beginning and
at the end and I also need to show you
guys how to export the final video so it
is awesome quality for YouTube now there
are a bunch of settings that you need to
watch out for so you definitely don't
want to check out the next video excuse
me you definitely want to check out the
next video so thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
