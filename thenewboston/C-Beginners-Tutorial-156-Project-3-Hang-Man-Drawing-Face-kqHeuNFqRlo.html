fifty sixth c-sharp tutorial that I'm
making for the new Boston and in this
tutorial when we continue working on our
hangman project we're basically going to
be drawing the head and hopefully a few
other parts on the head like the eyes
and the mouth alright so the first thing
that we're going to want to do is create
an enumeration to hold all the different
types of body parts that we're going to
turn on so we're going to type a keyword
Junoon right here and then name our
enumeration I'm just going to call it
body parts and inside of here I'm just
going to type out all the different body
parts for our hangman so the first is
obviously going to be the head then
we're going to have left eye and
remember we can't have spaces in our
elements so we're going to have to
basically just use a underscore instead
so left eye right eye then now right
right arm left arm then one for their
body so go get our body
right leg left leg alright so these are
all the body parts that we're going to
be drawing in the next couple tutorials
here in this tutorial though we're going
to concentrate on the head the left eye
the right eye and the mouth alright so
we're going to basically create a method
that will actually be used to draw all
the different body parts so I'm just
going to have if you return type of void
since we're not going to be returning
anything and drawing and it's going to
say draw body and you're just going to
cut the pass through the body part be
watch on so can you choose our body
parts of numeration for this so body
parts and I'm going to call it V P for
body part alright so something that's
going to be used for each body part is
going to be graphic so we have something
to draw with and
Faraj actually a pen sorry and so we're
going to type graphics G and said equal
to handle 1.3 graphics and again panel 1
is just this panel inside of the screw
box here for our hangman and then we're
just going to want to create a new pen
to draw with so we call it P and set it
equal to a new pen
and I'm just going to color that we're
going to be drawing with blue but you
can make it anything you want alright so
now we're going to check to see what
body part the user wants drawn or the
color of this method wants drawn so
we're going to check first see if the
head
so if V P equals body parts head then
we're going to draw a circle and I
already have all the code for this typed
out so you don't so watch me figure out
at what points to draw them but I'm
going to explore it so all right through
the head we're just going to draw an
ellipse we're not going to fill an
ellipse so it will just be like a
wireframe I guess and alright it's going
to start at 40 on the x-axis and since
the endpoint of like the end of the hang
post is on 60 on the x-axis and the
width of this is going to be 40 so we're
just going to make it be centered so you
take 20 away your use divide this by 2
so you take 20 away from 60 and then you
get 40 so we have 40 and then we want it
to be right up against the top of that
post on the Y so this would make that 50
same as where it ends and then we're
just going to make it be a perfect
circle so 40 by 40 all right and we're
not going to actually be calling the
method from inside of this drawing hang
post method but we're just going to call
it there so we can preview to make sure
that this draw head actually works I'm
going to say draw a body part and then
we're going to be drawing the head all
right and we're actually going to be
calling this this will be the first
thing drawn when the user gets a letter
wrong or they guess the wrong letter all
right so go here and yep that looks
pretty good but let's
we make the pen on two pixels thick
instead of just one and this should make
it look better
yep just thicker and it meets the post a
bit better all right and now we're going
to check to see if my caller wants to
draw on the left eye so I'm going to say
else if um VP cools the body part equals
the left eye sort of say if it equals
the left eye then we're going to
actually draw an ellipse or fill an
ellipse so we're gonna have to create a
new brush and I already have this all
typed out just like the other one so we
don't want to watch me type it but
basically I just create a new brush here
and make the color B black set the
position to 50 on the x-axis and 60 on
the y-axis so mix it around
I don't know towards the left of their
head and it will be on the left of our
side not the left of the person's side
and I think that just makes it a little
bit less confusing and then I make the
radius of the circle five by five and
this will actually turn out to be a
square but it's close enough
all right so now let's call this and
have it draw a eye instead I will
actually have it draw head and eye so
you can see where it's positioned in the
head to make sure that it looks good and
yep that's pretty good and I know you're
not going to be able to use the exact
same coordinates that I'm using I'm
trying to explain it though so it just
gives you an idea of what to do or what
to look for and how to figure out what
points or what coordinates on your panel
that you're going to be drawing at and
with this is really no trick to it you
just have to fool around with it until
you get it and then we're going to draw
the right eye so I'm going to say else
if the body part equals left eye arming
the right eye so if it's a right eye
then we're just going to draw a right
eye and just like the left eye we're
gonna have to create a new brush and I
already have the right eye code all
typed out alright and the position of
this is 63 on the x-axis and 60 on the
y-axis and send
these are both the same on the y-axis
will be parallel on the Y and 63 it's
kinda like a weird number but if I made
it 60 they're too close together and
I've committed 65 - too far apart so 63
seems just perfect and again they're
both the same size so the 1 plus I not
bigger than the other
all right and then let's just call this
to make sure that it looks good thank
you are a body part and we're going to
keep drawing right eye this time all
right
and yep goes up pretty good and finally
we have to draw them out and the mouth
is sort of hard to really understand how
it's all works but basically we're just
going to be drawing an arc so that it's
a mouth and this is actually going to be
BP not body part - BP all right so if
the body part is a mouth I'm just going
to draw an arc and the position of the
arc is 50 and then 60 and you have to
make it this because it thinks of it as
if this was going to be a whole circle
so we have to make it 50 60 which is the
same position as this left eye but it
trust me it'll look right and like I
said it just makes the physician as if
you're drawing a whole circle and then I
make the size of this 20 by 20 so it's
not squished or anything and then I make
it start at 45 degree angle so it'll
start like right here and then I make it
draw 90 so it'll go like that I'll sweep
right across so if I made it zero I
would start like up here and then be
like a sideways smile for me to only
draw 90 or if I made at nine here's zero
I'm going to draw 180 and it would this
look funny do two up all right so now
we'd be bugged here yet oh we never call
the method so we've got to call the
method to see if our mouth actually
works sequence drawn correctly and yep
pretty good alright so that's pretty
much it for this tutorial on drawing the
head in the face so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
