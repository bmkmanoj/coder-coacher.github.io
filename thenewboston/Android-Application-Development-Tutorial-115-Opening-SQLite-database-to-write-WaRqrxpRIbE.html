tutorial we're going to set up a few
methods for class and we're also going
to set up this on upgrade method because
again if our database has already been
created it's going to call this on
upgrade method instead of our oncreate
and basically all this method is going
to do is if the table exists we're going
to drop it and then we're going to call
the oncreate method so again we're
getting passed in a database at SQLite
database so we're just going to say DB
dot execute SQL again and we're going to
use the command pretty simple command
called drop table if exists space and
quotations and then we're going to give
it our table name which we called
database underscore table so for table
name exists it's going to drop it and
then all we have to do is call our on
create method so we're going to say on
create and we're going to pass in our
database so that's basically going to
you know upgrade our database so there
we go
now what we want to do is we want to
have this hot-or-not class have some
methods so when we use it within our SQL
Lite example class we can just call
those methods and it's going to execute
everything within this class so the
first method we want to have is we won't
be able to open our database so we can
write to it and then we're going to have
a closed method that will just close our
database and basically we're going to
reference just so you guys know which
variables we're using we set up this
database helper type variable called our
helper which again is just this class
here so we're going to reference that
we're going to give it the context
that's being passed in which we set up
here in our constructor so those are the
two variables that we're going to use to
open just to let you guys know so let's
get into it we're going to say public
and then we're going to say our class
name which was called hot or not
and we're gonna say open all right so we
created our open method and then we're
just going to hit enter and it's giving
us an error because we need a return
statement of some sort so what we're
going to do now is set up our database
variable that we created again public or
private up here to equal something so
we're going to say our helper and we're
going to set this equal to a new DB or
database helper and we need to give it
something with those parameters again as
you can see here our constructor for our
database helper class takes into context
so we're going to give it the context
right here called our context that we
set up within our constructor for our
class so we're just going to say our
context and then finish our statement
that's going to again pass in just our
information here get everything set up
with our database name the version so
it's just going to get everything set up
for the most part now what we also want
to do is we want to set up this variable
called our database which again is SQL
like database type so what we're going
to do here is we're going to say our
database is equal to basically our
helper that we just set up so we're
going to say our helper dot get and you
can see we can either get readable or
get writable so we could have set you
know instead of open we could say write
or something like that
more more specific method but we're just
going to say get writable because if we
can write to it we can also for the most
part read it as well
so basically just kind of overview what
we've done we have this helper from our
database helper class is just going to
give it a new instance of that object
passing in the context of whatever is
being passed into
our hot-or-not class and then what we're
going to do is we're going to set up our
database from and we're just going to
get the writable database so it's going
to basically open up open up our
database through our helper and then
always to do is we're going to give it a
return statement of this so that's
basically it for this tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
