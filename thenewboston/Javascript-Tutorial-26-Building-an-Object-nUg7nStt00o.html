JavaScript tutorial and this is kind of
more a continuation of 25 in if you just
watch 25 everything was a lot pretty
complicated and now in this story I'm
gonna be putting all the pieces together
and everything's gonna be coming to
light so in my last tutorial I got so
excited I forgot to actually put in my
strip tags so let's go ahead and do that
right now so you don't forget good
script type equals text slash JavaScript
and then in make it ending script tag
right above your head
and you're actually gonna want to be
adding one of these to body so let's
copy
and paste those right down at the body
so now you got a script in your head and
a script in your body
I'm just separate that so you guys can
see a little easier now as you know
before we made a function which was
actually an object function and we named
a computer and we set all of the
parameters equal to a value just so they
were a lot easier to work with the next
thing that we did was made an instance
where we said alright we have a variable
my new computer it's new we've never
used it before and we're using the
computer function and each of these
parameters describe our properties for
this right here so let's go ahead and
use this since we already made an
instance called my new comp we can call
any of these functions right here so in
our body script
let's go ahead
I'm getting kind of sick of alert boxes
so let's just make a basic text on the
window so let's go document right and
this isn't part of what we're doing all
we learned this before all this does is
write text on a website so let's write
document right and as you know anything
that we type into this Brander is going
to show up on the website so let's go
ahead and I'll prove that to you by
typing document right hello
so let's save that in Ando and as you
can see says hello but we want to call
one of these properties to our functions
so to do that let's go ahead and say if
we want to reference our let's reference
our CPU that would be the most
interesting say the brand of CPU I want
is now outside of your quotation marks
add a plus sign which means add to the
text
in a reference an instance the first
thing and that we're gonna want to do is
type in the variable name of our
instance and since was my Newcomb my new
comp type in my new comp add a period
and add whatever property you want so if
we want Ram just go ahead and type Ram
now if we save it and refresh it says
the kind of oops I'm in a Intel
I didn't mean Ram but the brand of CPU I
want is three it's three Giga three
gigabytes I meant to put Intel there so
let's go ahead and fix that it's kind of
embarrassing actually type in CPU say
that the brand of CPU I want is Intel
there that's a lot better now as you can
see anytime you want to reference a
piece of your document I mean uh your
object type the variables name in and
whatever parameter you want and this
will give you whatever parameter is in
your new variable as you can see my comp
CPU is Intel and we use that by this
object called computer now this might be
a little complicated to you still so I'm
probably going to be going over this a
couple times in the next tutorials until
we have it down and nail it and figure
it out until we're pearls at it but
study this tutorial and make sure you
know how to reference analyse just
output basic text on your screen so I
hope you learned a little something and
if this is cloudy I'll be clearing it up
in the next couple tutorials but thanks
