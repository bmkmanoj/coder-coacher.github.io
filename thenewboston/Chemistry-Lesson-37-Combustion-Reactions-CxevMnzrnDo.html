37th chemistry tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm gonna be talking about
combustion reactions now this is
typically the reaction you get whenever
you think of fuels and gases basically
the key thing to remember is whenever
you have a combustion reaction one of
the things it produces is heat now the
formal definition I guess you could say
is a compound that combines with oxygen
and now this oxygen is typically just
the oxygen in the atmosphere and it
produces Heat so remember we said
whenever we have a chemical reaction
that produces Heat is called exothermic
so let's go ahead and take a look at
example say we have a couple hydrogen's
and we combine them with a couple
oxygens we would end up with a couple
water molecules and aside from that we
would get a byproduct of heat I guess
that's my heat symbol right there so if
we balance this equation you can see we
have four hydrogen's on this side two
oxygens so we are good to go so again if
we take a look at the ingredients needed
to produce a combustion reaction we have
oxygen that our compound can combine
with and also heat that's probably the
most important thing you can take away
from this tutorial every time you have a
combustion reaction it produces heat
which would make it an exothermic
chemical reaction now remember the
alternative to that is endothermic which
means a chemical reaction that absorbs
heat or absorbs energy but these
chemical reactions are exothermic so
let's go ahead and take a look at one
more example in we'll go ahead and
balance this equation properly so I'm
gonna go ahead and take a look at I
think I'm saying this right naphthalene
I don't know how to say it but uh it's
the it's the compound that you find they
use it whenever they make mothballs I
know that that's just a nice little
tidbit of information you guys don't
need to remember that at all but anyways
the chemical formula for that is C 10 H
8 and we're gonna go ahead and combine
this with wow that's a really
odd-looking plus sign combine this with
like some oxygen 12 molecules that will
balance nicely now whenever we combine
these we get
ten molecules of co2 and also we get
some water molecules h2o and heat and
draw my nice little heat symbol by the
way that is not the technical heat
symbol you can just write heat or you
can leave it out some people will leave
it out whenever they're writing chemical
reactions but I like they dry that nice
little heat cloud so anyways let's go
ahead and take a look and make sure we
have everything needed it for a
combustion reaction we have oxygen now
this oxygen is typically provided by
just the atmosphere just because in the
air there's a bunch of oxygen so you
don't need to like buy it from a store
or anything and you also have the
byproduct of heat so that would make
this a combustion reaction now if we go
ahead and balance this baby we can see
that there are three types of elements
on the left hand side carbon hydrogen
and oxygen you have ten carbon eight
hydrogen and twenty-four whoa whole lot
of oxygen there so now let's go ahead
and do the same on the right hand side
and make sure we didn't mess up carbon
let's see we got ten hydrogen
let me count these up eight now oxygen
if we take a look at we got twenty from
here we got two molecules times ten that
would be twenty and over here we got
four so 24 total so if we go ahead and
balance this baby okay ten eight and 24
we are good to go
so again just remember these are called
combustion reactions and combustion
reactions use oxygen and have heat as a
byproduct which would make it exothermic
chemical reactions so anyways that's all
you get for this tutorial I know that
you know don't really learn anything new
just a couple of new terms but the next
tutorial I'm gonna be Jam packing you
with a bunch of information so thank you
guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
