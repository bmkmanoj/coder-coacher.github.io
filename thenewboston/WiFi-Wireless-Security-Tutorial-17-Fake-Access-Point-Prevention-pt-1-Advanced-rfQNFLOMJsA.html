video before we get to any of the
learning I need to tell you a story so
last week what happened is I walked into
my favorite coffee shop and I ordered a
bologna sandwich like I always do
and I brought it to my table I was
enjoying it popped open my laptop and
started checking my email and I looked
to the left of me and there's this cute
look in college girl I mean she was
adorable and I started thinking I wonder
what she's working on probably a
homework assignment
you know these college girls always
working on something and she looks at me
and she smiles a little bit and gives me
a little wave and then it just clicked I
was like oh alright I see what's going
on here I see what you're up to see what
happened is whenever I connected to the
Wi-Fi I thought I was connecting to the
coffee shop but what she was doing is
she set up her laptop is a fake access
point so I was actually connecting to
her so I thought I was just connecting
to the coffee shop but I was actually
sending all of my data to her so I got
up I walked towards her I grabbed her
laptop and I whipped it against the wall
and well it actually turns out that she
was just working on a homework
assignment so I had to pay for a laptop
but nonetheless not important the thing
is she could have been hacking me by
sending up a fake access point and in
this tutorial I'm going to show you how
so what she would have needed to do
first is in order to turn a device like
a laptop or a regular computer into an
access point what she would have done is
she would have installed two packages so
apt-get install and the first one is DNS
ma sq so DNS masque
now what this is is a package that
pretty much allows you to easily edit
DNS and DHCP settings now we know that
DNS is needed whenever you want to
translate domain names into IP addresses
and DHCP is needed because whenever
you're pretty much turning your computer
into a temporary router that people can
connect to you need to start dishing out
IP addresses for each of your clients
so whenever you have this installed you
can assign IP addresses to anyone that
connects now another thing that she was
probably thinking about installing is
something called host a PD now I already
have these installed on my computer so
that's why they ran in real quick but
you would have to write yes or just type
Y and hit enter and you'd be good but
this second package allows you to
configure your own personal computer
such as the laptop as an access point
and it also gives you some other options
so you can actually set up like a
password on it and like WPA encryption
if you want but those are the two
packages that you need so after this
what she would have done is she would
have edited her DNS mask file and these
are just her basic DNS settings so again
this covers all of your DNS and DHCP so
she probably would use leafpad so let's
go ahead and type that in there
and it would have been in et Cie dns ma
sq Kampf your configuration file now in
here let me change my settings font and
I'll bump this up to 14 so you guys can
see and alright so inside here the first
thing is for your interface at0 now if
you guys are like re I know what my
interface is all 0 w land 0 maybe wlan0
Mon what the heck is this well later on
I'm going to be showing you guys a tool
called air base and what this does is it
creates this virtual interface and it's
a T 0 so depending on what tool you use
this may change but in this example I
know that me always adjust this so you
guys can see I know that the interface
is going to be called a T 0 so another
thing you do whenever you create a fake
access point and I say fake access point
but it's really not a fake access point
it's a real access point it's just kind
of a honeypot in a way because people
think that you know they don't know that
it's coming from your laptop they might
from some company or someone more
reputable than you so you need to have a
DHCP range now what this is is it's a
range of IP addresses that you're going
to dish out whenever people connect to
your network now my actual IP address
starts with 192.168 a tid oughtta but
our own network we don't want to hand
out IP addresses that are going to clash
with it so I'm just going to go 1000 dot
10 so we're going to be in the 1000
network and this is going to be the
first IP address that I'm going to hand
out so there's my first one and of
course you write your last one
so 1000 250 you why not so we can hand
out this many IP addresses so we can
pretty much a fool a lot of people or
she would've I know our plane she was
thinking about it even if I couldn't
prove it all right now this last thing
is whenever we assign these IP addresses
how long are we going to listen for and
we'll just do 12 hours why the heck not
now after this we have two other
settings
the first one is DHCP option 3 now let
me type this so 0.1 and let me just type
this other on because I get confused if
I type and talk at the same time all
right
so these two settings in this file right
here DHCP option 3 and DHCP option 6
this one right here is going to be the
default gateway in other words the
router and we're going to pretend that
our laptop is the router so it's just
whatever the IP addresses of that and
this other one is going to be the IP
address of the DNS server so we're going
to make a fake host file and this is
going to be the DNS address of that and
if you guys notice all of these they can
just run from the access point the
router you don't need to setup like an
entirely different server this isn't
like you know a big company it's just a
little example so all of this is going
to be gold
and also whenever you just you know buy
some internet service from whatever
company and they give you that router
that's how its set up all of your DHCP
all of your DNS settings are actually on
that router so nothing new there and
some other cool things that you guys may
find handy is you can also specify
another server so this is another DNS
server because we're going to write our
own host file and if it can't find in
that then it may use the Internet
Service Providers default ones or we can
pass it in this one whatever and you may
want to log queries and also log DHCP
and this is just for kind of analysis if
you want to see what people are doing
then you can do that but make sure you
have at least these so this is going to
set up the configuration file which says
ok whenever we make our fake access
point these are the IP addresses we're
going to hand out and all the other
settings we're just going to run or
write from here so make sure you save
that in the proper location and boom
good to go now after this what we are
going to do is remember we said that
that DNS server was on our own computer
right here
so we need to create a fake host file so
I'm just called this fake host kampf and
hit enter and alright so I know that the
IP address of the New Boston com is 54.1
86.2 fifty dot 79 so if you guys want to
host a fake website on your own personal
laptop then you can do that but what if
you wanted people to whoever we're
searching for like Bucky's bacon comm
just redirect them to the New Boston
comm well then this is what you could do
and again it doesn't matter what
websites are IP addresses are in your
hosts file so let me just go like
Bucky's bacon and Bucky's tuna so now
whenever a client who connects would be
searching in Bucky's bacon comm instead
of going to the real Bucky's bacon comm
server it would actually redirect them
to the New Boston comm and she was
probably thinking about doing this with
my Gmail or my bank account because I
saw that look in her eye I did not trust
that girl so you know how to smash your
laptop but then get hacked though that's
the important thing so I'm going to save
this set up your fake host file however
you want and then that's taken care of -
this is almost too easy so let me clear
out of here and we pretty much have all
of our settings our configuration files
taken care of</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
