that many more than in Boston and in
this tutorial I'm gonna be showing you
how to be fat greedy and brush so for
this tutorial you're going to have a
panel and then users on that panel does
have graphics be created for your panel
so we have some surface to draw on so
the first thing that we're going to want
to do is create a new insensitive path
3d Abraxas go here in crete in path 3d
and brush I'll call it PGP simply new
path three o'clock and in order to
create a path gradient brush and calls
for a graphics path and we're just have
to create a new graphics a path appears
and that's it graphics path and the
graphics path will basically pulled all
the information telling the path
gradient brush what to do or where to
draw so we're gonna have the gradient
start at a center point and then move
out as it moves out it were changing to
a different color so what we're gonna
have to do here is create a circle for
our graphics path or for a path reading
bar can follow so instead of our
graphics path right here we're just
gonna say PP dot add ellipse and we're
just going to now tell it where the
server will be so what's going to be at
20:20 and then the width will be 50 and
50 well so it'll be alright so now that
we have our graphics path read and you
can just pass that graphics faculty
created through the path gradient or the
fact reading brushes constructor to
create a new path through the brush so
I'm here here now we have our pad three
and run freedom so currently on the path
gradient Russia was started
our point in a circle and slowly move
out eternity different color so we
haven't chosen those colors yet so we're
gonna have to do is set center color
property for the path reconstruction so
is the center color and I'm gonna start
out with red so red
alright so now that we have our center
color through to be a Norfolk telecom
floor color we want it to turn into more
colors we're only going to have it turn
into one color though so we surround
colors this has to be set equal to a
color array so it's color right here and
like I said going I have a traffic all
over another time yellow but you can
obviously so right now which is going to
start at the center of the circle right
here indicated by this so this is where
the circle will be located it will start
at the center of that circle and then
slowly move out and as it moves out it
will turn it yellow so now we just have
to draw a circle using this brush that
we can actually see it so we're gonna
Yuki Billy Lipps
Billy Lipps and we're just gonna have it
be in the same location as where our
brush is so that see if so we're just
gonna use our brush to paint it so I say
II and I don't indicate where we wanted
to draw this lips just like up here so
we can actually see our greeting so now
a bug here and click on the panel you
should see that there's a circle created
the center of the circle it's red and
it's slowly tended to yellow as it moves
out yep perfect
you can obviously change it any color
you want so if you wanted to start with
alive
on the white like a black or something
you could do that as well
so now let me click it yep
slowly under the black and you can
obviously make this bigger if you wanted
to one way to be like 100 and 100 and
then maybe the ellipse draw be a hundred
well
that evidence that much bigger circle so
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
on drawing it a fat reading brush in the
next tutorial I'm going to show you how
to draw other shapes so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
