your 47th objective-c tutorial and in
this tutorial we are finally going to
get to write that enum program that I
promised you guys in last tutorial you
know hopefully you watch my last
tutorial or else you're probably going
to be really confused in this one but
anyways let's just go ahead and dive
right into it let's go ahead and make
our data type to store the days of the
week and let's go ahead and have the
user be able to enter Monday Tuesday
Wednesday Thursday actually H for
Thursday forget about Tuesday and Friday
so now we have a data type and the only
values we can assign the variables are M
twhf for days of the week but let's go
ahead and do this let's go ahead and set
Monday equal to 1 and what this allows
you to do is set M equal to 1 T equal to
wednesday equal to 3 and so on and so
forth so now you can kind of use them
interchangeably so now that we have a
data type which is kind of like a mini
class once you think about it let's go
ahead and make a blank variable so enum
day and make a variable called entry
that the user is going to enter some
information now entry this variable I
mean we could go ahead and set it equal
to you know Tuesday or 0 right now or
not 0 for right now but we don't want to
set it equal to anything we want the
user do that so right now entry is set
to nothing so let's go ahead and give
the user a nice little prompt on the
screen that says enter a number of day
of the week the most confusing
instructions a user will ever enter the
number of day of the week what the heck
they're probably going to enter like
28th of February but anyways we know
what's going on that's all important so
now in order to have the user be able to
assign a value to a variable here's what
you need to do scanf I think I told you
guys this before but I can't remember
and just go ahead and put % I that means
they're going to be entering an integer
either 1 through 5 and we want to store
that
your value in the variable entry so what
scanf allows you to do if I didn't tell
you guys before I may have allows the
user to enter a number and it stores
that number in the variable entry and
these are pointers we'll be talking
about those later on but that's the
syntax for it don't forget that
ampersand sign that's not a mistake
so now entry is going to be equal to
something after they get done with this
let's say 3 or something so let's go
ahead and do a switch and I think I told
you guys this before I can't remember so
we're going to test when we spell switch
right we're going to test what number
they entered and in our blocks let's
just go ahead and say in case they
entered one it's going to treat it as a
M what do we want to do let's just NS
log on the screen um that day is Monday
looks good and then you want to break I
hope I told you guys about switch
already if not then this is probably
pretty confusing but I'll walk you guys
through it anyways so if they enter one
then entry is going to be equal to one
so when it comes across case M it's
going to say all right M + 1 is the same
thing so this is true so I'm going to
print out this so now all we have to do
is the easy stuff copy this and do it
four more times
oops
and let's just go ahead and change this
case tea Wednesday Thursday and Friday
so days Monday Tuesday Wednesday make
sure you spell it wrong Thursday and
Friday and by default if they enter
something weird like X or something make
sure you spell that right and by default
let's just go ahead and we won't even
print out a thing just break it so let's
go ahead and run this program and if it
works I'll tell you how it works and if
it doesn't I'm going to just going to
you know cry we get an error here and it
says I mean it's not air is just a
warning so don't even worry about it
it's because this is an integer and this
is a different data type but it's the
same thing we're smarter than the
computer so enter a number of the day of
the week let's go ahead and enter 4
right here you can see I entered it down
here press ENTER and it says that day is
Thursday so this is working like a
beauty so how does this work we made our
own data type called UNAM day now the
user can pretty much m and 1 is the same
thing that's what we pretty much said
Wednesday and 3 is the same thing Friday
and 5 is the same thing you can do this
by setting them equal to energy values
so now if we have a blank variable
called entry and they enter the number 3
it automatically knows that's the same
thing as Wednesday so then if you're
testing what their variable is equal to
and you come across 3 you're going to
say alright I know that's the same thing
as Wednesday so I'm going to run this so
again if we build and run this again
enter a day of the week let's go ahead
and press 3 it says that day is
Wednesday that is why it works and
that's the beauty of being able to
create your own data types with the enum
enumerated keyword so I mean you don't
really use this a whole lot unless
you're
I mean you don't really use it a whole
lot that's it's the end of explanation
but if you ever come across in
programming and see this you know what's
going on so again hopefully I told you
guys about scanf before and hopefully i
told you guys about Switch before I
can't remember I'm at like 50 tutorials
but if I have it then that's a quick
little walkthrough of how those work so
thank you guys for watching if you want
any of this code because you know you
probably don't want to type it out just
go ahead click on the link below and
it's all there free for you guys in my
forum so thanks for watching again don't
forget subscribed and I'll see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
