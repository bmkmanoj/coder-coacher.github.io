tutorial that I'm making before the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm just
showing you how to use the list view
control a little bit more we're
basically going to be removing items and
I'm also going to show you how to use a
check box there's a long list view so
you're pretty much just going to need
everything that we used in the previous
tutorial and the first thing we're going
to do is add another option to our
context menu it says items so now we're
going to double click on this so they'll
create an event handler or let me click
on this alright and eventually it's
gonna copy this code right here because
we can use the remove method inside the
list item class so since there is a
remove method inside the what's um class
we can just do LBI diagram and this it
just removes the item I'm at The
Associated system that window that form
that was for the trip so basically it
will just remove this item from the list
so it'll go through every item that is
selected and then it'll remove these
selected items so now I need you blog we
just add a few items here alright so now
we just right-click on it remove
selected items it'll remove one item or
it can remove multiple items you can
also remove a whole bunch of items at
once or every item inside the ListView
at once so in order to do that we're
just an easy clear method so right here
is going to go up again and there's a
clear method inside the list class so
gets to wispy one items and this will
basically just remove all the items
inside of this items so every item that
is in
Westview it will just be there moved or
deleted so now no matter how many items
we have inside of my ListView
it will remove them all even if they
don't handle selected so let me click
this it should remove them even though
we don't have any items selected yep now
I'm going to show you how to add
checkboxes to your list view and in
order to do that just go over to the
properties panel and change checkboxes
property to truth and obey to this we'll
just put a little checkbox right in
front of your LSB oil so now when we add
some more items here you can see the
little checkbox right in front of the
item and we can check that
however nothing's going to happen right
now and we can use that as a check so if
we wanted to remove all the checked
items to do that as well so I was bottom
air here alright so basically we can
just go through every item inside the
ListView and check to see if it's
checked and if it's checked and let's
queue and weirdest way to remove it so
of course we have to check to see if
it's checked out so we're going to say
if it's checked so if the ListView item
is checked now debug here add a few
items we check this item it should
remove it we check both these items they
should remove yep so that's pretty much
it for this tutorial so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
