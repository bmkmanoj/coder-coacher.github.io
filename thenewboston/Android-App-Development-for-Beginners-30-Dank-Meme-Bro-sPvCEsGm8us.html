course two lines of code probably going
to be the easiest tutorial in the world
get a reference to that bottom fragment
and of course call set meme text on it
so let's go ahead and get a reference
first so bottom picture fragment I'll
just name it bottom fragment and you set
equal to and this is a lot like getting
a reference to any other widget just is
a little bit weird because it's a
fragment so bottom picture fragment of
course and the method is get support
fragment manager and then you need to
find fragment bit by ID and of course
since it's a resource resource ID in
fragment two I believe it was all right
so the fragment regular is the top one
in fragment two is the bottom one so now
that we have a reference to that bottom
fragment what we can do is we can
actually
bottom fragment and that was set meme
text now we just have to pass in top and
bottom which is what the user typed in
it's now getting passed along to that
bottom fragment and hopefully if
everything works it should take the text
from here pass it to the activity and
what method we just wrote it will change
the text on there so let's just go ahead
and run this now let's just type
something like as to where glasses can't
see sharp and let's think if I this mean
so sweet
there you go looking good and that
ladies and gentlemen is how you create
the world's worst me map</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
