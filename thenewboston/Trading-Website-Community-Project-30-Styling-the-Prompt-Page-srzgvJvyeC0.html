video in in this video actually what i
did in between the last video in this
video is I uploaded the register dot PHP
file and I tested it out and everything
looks to be going smoothly however now
what we need to do is we need to make
that prompt page so let me go ahead and
show you guys what happens say a user
was the register with their name Bucky @
yahoo.com and the password of password
they submit whenever they submit it all
of their information successfully goes
into the database already but check it
out they hit submit it's good now it
should take them to a page that just has
a message on it and the message just
says um you know thank you for
registering an email has been sent
please click on the link to activate
your account or something like that so
that's what page we have to make now
instead of this ugly page so like I said
in the last um tutorial what I did is I
named that page prompt not PHP and all
this page does is it basically just
gives the user a message so what I did
already to save you guys some time is I
made the shell of this and I pretty much
included the core basic stuff that we
already did in the PHP section and in
the HTML section I just you know already
felt in the title I link to our main CSS
page and I included the header and
search code and the footer code so all
of this is done already we don't have to
do it again because we've already took
care of that in the last tutorial
however the only other thing that we
need to do in the HTML section for this
prompt up PHP page is we need to make it
a little bit different than the main
layout we don't want a section on the
left hand side in a section on the right
hand side we only want one middle
section so let me show you guys what I'm
talking about go ahead and make a div
and give it the ID of outer and go ahead
and end this baby
now this I just need this div so I can
Center what's on the inside this page is
basically going to be a box like I said
with a message in the middle so go ahead
and add another div and give it the ID
enter now in here right here is where
we're going to be creating some the
message now the message is going to say
you know um whenever we need to leave a
message to user like in this case we're
going to say you know we sent you an
email click on the link on you email to
activate your account but the message is
going to differ however since we don't
want to create a new web page for each
message we're just going to create a
simple PHP function and we're going to
call it create message now what we're
going to do is we're going to pass it in
a parameter of X or a variable and
depending on what variable this is is
what message we want to output to the
user so just remember inside here is
going to be a message that changes
depending on what we need to tell the
user so now that we created two new divs
outer and inner what we need to do now
is we need to style them so go ahead and
make a new file and save this one has in
your CSS folder prompt CSS now if you
guys are saying OMG another CSS file
this is going to take forever I thought
we were done with this well the good
news is it's not going to take forever
we only need to do we all needed to
style two quick things down in the inner
so after this tutorial we're going to be
done with it it's going to be super
quick we don't need to worry about
registered CSS or may not CSS those are
done so let's go ahead and style outer
first and remember this was just the box
that we could center everything so set
the width you go to one hundred percent
and set the text align to Center what
this is going to do is it's pretty much
going to Center the inner box so let me
just copy this and change this to enter
and now for the inner box remember this
is the box that's pretty much going to
be the message the message is going to
go in here so first change the display
to
inline-block and now just go ahead and
give it a border of let's say one pixel
solid grey and now set the width the
overall width of the website is a
thousand so I think 600 pixels will look
just pretty good and padding might as
well go ahead and set this to 10 pixels
now for margin what I want to do is I
want to set this to 10 pixels auto and
now the only other thing I want to do is
right now we have a square plain old box
sitting in the middle of our screen with
some message in it just to make it look
a little bit prettier I want to give it
rounded corners and I also want to give
it a shadow so let me go ahead and do
that real quick border this is how you
give it rounded corners and I'm guessing
you guys already know the sport or
radius of 7 pixels remember the more
pixels the more round the corners and in
order to make this compatible with
Firefox and what's it called safarian
crap what we need to do is change this
one to ma's and change this one to
WebKit so that's how we take care of the
rounded corners for all the browsers now
the only other thing that we have to do
now is we want to add a shadow and just
like this little attribute whenever you
had to make it compatible with all the
different browsers you need to do the
same thing with this as well so box
shadow and we'll make this 5 pixels 5
pixels 15 pixels and the color of the
shadow is going to be a 0 actually I
want to cap select that e zero A zero A
zero now just to clarify the different
settings right here 5 515 and the color
is this the horizontal shift the
vertical shift pretty much how much over
and how much down do you want it the
blur or how much do you want it to
spread you want a real night tice wow I
really must you want a nice tight shadow
nice and crisp or
you want it nice and blurry the more
pixels the more blurry and this is the
color you can have a red shadow if you
want this is like a gray so now just
like before copy this and twice more we
need this one moss and the other one
WebKit so copy Maz sticky here copy
WebKit sticky here so now we have a
border for internet explorer firefox and
chrome and safari and one of these
should probably cover opera and all the
other browsers too so there we go there
is a CSS we can go ahead and save this
and close it because we are done with it
the only other thing that we have to do
is now that we created this function
create message we actually need to go
ahead and create the function which is
basically going to take a variable X and
the X is just a number that gets passed
in through the URL and depending on that
number we output a message it's going to
be an incredibly simple function and
there you go so I'll see you next oriole
and that's what we're going to be doing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
