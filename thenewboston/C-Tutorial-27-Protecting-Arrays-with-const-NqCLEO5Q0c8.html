long-awaited and highly demanded 27th
C++ tutorial and in this tutorial I'm
gonna show you guys how to protect your
display functions from changing your
original array so this is a problem that
a lot of programmers have whenever they
build a display function then it's
somehow one way or another and we'll
probably I'll probably be teaching you
about this later it changes the value of
the arrays when they're just supposed to
show them so in this tutorial I'm going
to show you guys how to protect all your
functions from that so let's first go
ahead and make a function to populate an
array and I'm in int populate and it's
going to take the parameters of an array
and I'm gonna name it double and Bucky
and it's also going to take the
parameters of the number of elements in
the array so I'm gonna name my hints
limit make sure you spell it right and
now we can go ahead and begin building
this function the first thing we wanted
to do is make a temporary variable that
is going to store the value you'll see
what it does later so name it temp or a
temporary whatever you want and now we
need to go ahead and build a basic loop
so put for int I equals 0 and I is less
than limit as brought in by this limit
right here and then we just wanted to do
I plus plus to iterate through the loop
and what do we want this loop to do well
for starters let's just go ahead and
give the user prompt to enter say we're
gonna have them enter a dollar item for
a bunch of different items so C out and
let's just put something like enter
dollars for item and they say item I
plus 1
and then let's go ahead and we'll add
another semicolon and looks good so what
this is gonna do is just put a prompt
out set the limo's five it's gonna loop
through this five times and says enter a
dollar item for item number one for item
number two for item number three four or
five and why do you put plus one instead
of just I it's because the array starts
at zero so this way the prompt can start
at 1 and go all the way to zero so now
what we have to do is go ahead and have
them input that temporary variable and
it looks good and then store it in the
array where the array is the right
number is equal to that temporary
variable so now the array index Buckey
zero is going to be the force the first
thing that entered Bucky one's gonna be
the second thing they entered all the
way depending on the size of your array
now make sure I got all my semicolons
and what we can do now is go on and
build our second function right here now
now that we got a function to populate
the array we need a function to spit out
pretty much the array just to display it
to us so I'm gonna name my void spit
since void display it's you know it's so
boring and here's how you do this in
order to protect the data from being
changed you need to give it a constant
variable type so instead of int or
double you need to put Co n st and this
will keep your data constant so now we
can go ahead and put double Bucky just
like before and again we need another
variable N and this is pretty much just
gonna be the limit or however many items
are in your array so let's go ahead and
make a basic loop for and we'll just put
the same as before and I set theta equal
to zero and then go ahead and press I is
less than
and then we'll go ahead and do something
like I plus plus just iterate through it
one by one and now we can go ahead and
give this loop body or some function so
now that we have an array already we
pretty much want to go through the array
and output a price per item so let's
just make a simple output no really
think in here what you need to do is go
ahead and press price for item and press
the space and then put I plus 1 and then
put something like let's uh here we go
there's a good idea : dollar amount yeah
I put a bunch of stickers on my keyboard
so I can't tell what one is the dollar
one but I found it and now after that
let's go ahead and just output see out
Bucky with eye so it loops through the
array and let's just go ahead and end
the line so it looks pretty so right
here what we did is we built a function
to populate the array and we also built
a function to pretty much display the
array so let's go ahead and prototype
these right now so we don't forget so go
ahead and remember in order to prototype
it you have to copy that in under your
namespace STD it's copy make sure you
don't cut paste semicolon prototype copy
and semicolons now let's go ahead and
run this program to well see if it works
pretty much what we need to do is make
an array an empty array so put something
like double items and put like five
elements in it doesn't matter how many
elements but uh five looks like a good
number then make then store a variable
that well you'll see what it does in
size and set it equal to populate
since this was or whatever you named
your function right here and again you
need to pass it to things so we're going
to pass it the array first what should
we name items in the limit of the array
which is 5 so now at your semicolon fret
and now size is the return value of
populate items or size is this right
here makes sense so next we need to go
ahead and press just call our spit
function to spit out the elements of our
array so let's go ahead and press spit
and see what parameters it takes oh man
my dumb screen-capture
so spit takes two parameters um takes an
array and it takes a number so let's go
ahead and spit items since our array is
items and our size is 5 so now go ahead
and add our semicolon and let me expand
this just cuz it's bugging me and now if
we did everything you're right we can go
ahead and execute our array and it
should work out fine I hope so
I got feeling I got an error oh come on
no way I mean away me not bad so enter
dollar for item one thirty to forty five
sixty five seventy six and two and now
it's just pretty much spits out the
array so here's our first function right
here which adds the elements to the
array and here's our second function
spit that just spits them out it goes
through a loop and spits it all out and
as you can see these are the exact same
thirty to forty five thirty to forty
five sixty five seventy six to sixty
five to seventy sixty two and that is
how you can protect data in your array
and in the next tutorial I'm going to be
showing you guys what if you want to
change that data in your array and you
actually want to change the value of it
I'm going to be showing you guys a real
quick function on how to do that but for
this tutorial that's all I have so
hopefully you learn a little something
but not too much so thank you guys for
watching and don't forget to subscribe
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
