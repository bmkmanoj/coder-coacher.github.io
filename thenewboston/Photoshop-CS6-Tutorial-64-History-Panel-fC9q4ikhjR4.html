Photoshop cs6 tutorial and I'm your host
buddy Blackford and in the next few
tutorials we're going to start learning
how to work with the history panel and
on the like elementary level the history
panel gives you the ability to perform
multiple undos but it's also much more
than that you can combine it with other
tools such as the history brush and the
art history brush to have like a trio of
different tools that you can use to take
your document to the next level so the
history panel comes in a linear mode and
a nonlinear mode the linear mode helps
you keep track of your recent steps and
you can erase any of that's that that
you need to so and then the nonlinear
mode preserves all those steps for
linear and nonlinear and is useful when
you need to think outside the box so
let's get into what we're more of what
we're talking about here so what you
need to do is come up to your window
menu here click on it and then bring up
the history and it should pop up up here
with this history button up here it
should be the top one with these three
boxes and then an arrow that goes up
that way now you can see that I have
done a few things to this image here and
this is everything that's in my document
that is being recorded by the history
let me make it a little bigger so we can
see more what we're doing so I've opened
up an image added a new layer use the
Paint Bucket move things around and the
history panel records all this for you
now some things that are not recorded by
the history panel so everything's not
recorded by it so for
example if I want to hide or show this
layer using the IRA here that does not
get recorded in the history panel
options but if I wanted to do something
like make this a little smaller so if I
hit ctrl T to bring up the free-form
options and I just make this like a
little smaller and hit enter the free
transform now shows up there so then you
can see what you've been doing and keep
track of what's going on with the
history panel working with the history
panel requires a firm understanding of
how the panel functions and what you can
or cannot do with the history so we're
going to go over each part to make sure
that we know it through and through and
we can use it professionally and it's
not just a tool that you just use to fix
your undos so let's start out by looking
at the options now I probably went over
the options and one of the first
tutorials that I made where we went over
the different preferences so there's the
options and the preferences and then
there's options for the history options
so going to the Preferences now so let's
go to edit then let's come down to
preferences then let's come down to
performance and this is where some of
your history options are we've got it
right here under the history and cache
so you can optimize this the different
way here's the different amount of steps
that the history saves and I've got mine
set to 20 you can Jack that way up if
you want and that's pretty much it for
the history most of the other stuff is
for the cache so these buttons here are
about the size of your document we have
a tall thin document here's a regular
one and I just use pretty much default
every time unless I'm working on like
something really huge then I use big and
flat but almost never work on talent and
unless I'm working like on
web banner or something so what's it
okay and now I want to show you the
history options that you can set so come
into your history panel and go to the
history options here right here that I
have my mouse on click on it and we've
got a few options that I'll go over
really quick with you so we've got
automatically create first snapshot and
that creates a snapshot or an image when
the document first opens and
automatically create new snapshot when
saving and that creates a snapshot every
time you save the document and that's
useful for keeping track of changes that
you've made to a document and when
you're in Photoshop you should be saving
all the time just to make sure you don't
lose any of the work that you've been
working on so just get in the habit of
saving a lot and check that if you would
like to create a snapshot every time you
save the Wincott allow nonlinear history
and a lot that allows you to operate
history in a nonlinear State and we'll
go over that a little more later on I've
got a show new snapshot dialog by
default and that opens a dialog box with
options each time you create a new
snapshot and then make layer visibility
changes undoable which is structs
photoshop to make any changes made to a
layers visibility undoable so that's the
different history options I'm just going
to leave it at default like it was and
that's all that's going to be taught in
this tutorial we went over like the
basics of what the history panel was
what it does and it's like the different
things that we can do with it I guess so
thanks for watching this one and I look
forward to seeing you guys in the next
tutorial make sure you give a thumbs up
if you liked it have a good one
