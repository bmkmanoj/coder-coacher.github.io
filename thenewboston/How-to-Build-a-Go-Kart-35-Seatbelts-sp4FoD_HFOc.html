last thing that we need to do before you
can actually start this baby up and ride
around is we need to install the seat
belts now the types of seat belts you
buy are dependent on what type of seats
you have now aside from just safety you
want to sell seatbelts either way
because whenever you're going over bumps
it's easy to get shifted around so you
know if you aren't in the safety which a
lot of people aren't for some reason um
you definitely want to have seat belts
anyways now the seat belts that I'm
using are going to be bolted on to the
frame in three different locations one
on the top and two on the bottom now
whenever I'm with filming showing you
guys where it bolted in I'm probably not
going to be able to zoom in and show you
guys exactly how they're going so may go
ahead and show you guys the seat belts
use a special type of Bowl and let me
show you guys how this works alright so
here is the bolt that you use whenever
you are bolting the seat belt brackets
onto the frame now as you can see
there's a little gap right here between
the head of the bowl and that's where
the seat belt goes now we're going to do
is you're going to put the seat belt on
right like that and then you want to hit
this against the frame of your go-kart
now the frame like I said is going to go
in between the bracket on your seat belt
and these washers so I'll get again
remember this order seat belt frame
regular washer lock washer or split
washer depending on what you want to
call it and then your not so why did I
just explain all that because probably
when I'm filming I'm not going to be
able to explain that the frame goes
right here but that's where it goes so
now that you guys know the positioning
of the frame I'm going to show you guys
the easiest way to put these seat belts
on first of all what you want to do is
you want to unbuckle the seatbelt
completely that way your work
is basically one big long stress now
aside from that what you want to do is
you want to kind of fold it figure out
which side goes on which what part says
and now go on what side that's a claim
foam go on and whenever you're holding
it you're going to see that as long as
they aren't backwards like this you'll
know think that they're backwards
because the button is facing towards you
you want to make sure the button is
facing out so in this seatbelt and I'm
pretty sure this is use an industry
standard the I don't know it's just
called like the buckle part goes on the
right hand side whenever you're sitting
down and the metal part goggles facing
the outside so now what we're going to
do is you want to take it and you want
to leave it throw through the holes on
your seat so into this one into the
first one and out on the second one go
ahead little of the seatbelt and you
know the middle is because it has that
plant in the middle which is going to
clamp it into the back weave it through
your seat into a little something like
that now again like I said before this
seatbelt is pretty much going to attach
to your frame in three current locations
one it's right behind the driver side
one is a bolt in the middle of your
frame and the other one behind here that
you can't see this is going to go on to
the crimp tube so if you guys are
thinking that this is the only thing
holding the seat belt on it's not it
actually bolts into the back so let me
go ahead and show you guys that right
now so now we can go ahead and start
bolting the brackets on the seat belt to
the frame under go-cart so again like I
said go ahead and start with your bolt
and feed it through the bracket on your
go-kart
and now you want to go ahead and feed it
through the frame and then put your
washer on your lock washer or split
washer and then you're not
I call these bolts law by accident
whenever I say bolt I'm talking about
this thing it's called enough now I'm
just fighting this bad boy up looks
pretty secure and you actually want to
pretty much tighten these ones as hard
as you can because the last thing you
want to happen is whenever you get into
a crash you seep out the snap or your
bolt to come loose and you go fine so
make sure these are really tight now the
only other thing that you want to do
before you screw in that second bracket
is you want to make sure your seatbelt
isn't twisted or tabled up so go ahead
and start from the first place you
screwed in and make sure it's flat the
whole way if it's twisted it's going to
look something like that but if it's
nice and flat then what you guys are
doing will tell so now that you're sure
that your seatbelt is nice and flat and
not twisted go ahead and bolt on that
second bracket so once you've bolted in
your third bracket your seat belt is
finally installed now even the other
thing you have to do aside from putting
in the seat belt on the passenger side
let's go ahead get in and adjust your
seat belt so the best way to adjust
these seat belts where they go over the
shores is you have four adjustments you
have two on bottom that go over around
your waist and of course you have these
two ones that go over my shoulders they
you can see right here now like I said
the easiest way to adjust it and start
with your waist pull it until it's nice
and snug not too tight but nice and snug
and then once your waist to settle then
you want to address the ones I
shorter and give a little bit of play
because of course you want to be able to
turn around
around the corners hit some jumps so
that's it that is how you go to do money
now what we need to do is a meaning take
this outside and see if it starts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
