tutorial for the new boss in what we're
going to do this tutorials create a
flipper class not like the dolphin
although that would be amazing if we
could do that basically we're going to
use like a view flipper and you'll see
what that is in this tutorial so I'll
create a class called flipper and XML
file called flipper which we set the
content view to now what we're going to
do is we're going to go look for this
thing so what we're going to do is we're
going to go down to this transitions tab
and we're going to call this or dragging
this view flipper thing here so we're
going to drag that in now we're going to
go over to the XML I'm just going to
format it and then we're just going to
throw in some random crap so be prepared
for that like a button textview actually
let's just throw in a textview so we're
going to delete our button actually no
we won't we'll leave it I'm sorry
undecisive so we're going to say flipper
to here for a textview and we're going
to say ctrl copy and paste another
textview we're going to call this
flipper three and flipper four so all we
have to do now with since we have our
flipper setup what we want to do is we
just want to put this ending statement
outside of whatever we want to flip our
views to do so we can also set up linear
layouts and set up buttons within a
linear layout to make the view look a
little bit better but instead we're just
going to have one class B or like you
can think of it as an activity somewhat
be a button the next one's a view text
view next one's at another text view etc
that's how the flipper class works so
now what we're going to do is we're
going to go into the code you're like
what the code and the XML all in one
tutorial thank you finally instead of a
you know wasting our times here so now
let's create that flipper thing that we
just created so we're going to do is
we're going to say view flipper we're
going to call it flippy and what we're
going to do is just add that reference
as always so
and what do we give the ID for your
flipper flipper view flipper 1 so we're
just going to stick with the standard
you know because I don't want to get
into flipper too much here view flippers
but I just want to show you guys again
for what you guys want to use it as and
then what we do is we just set up
basically we can sit like on touch
listener or something to this so that's
what we're going to do on click listener
type this so anytime we touch one of the
views or it's going to you know trigger
the on click so nothing new there and
basically when we hit this click we can
do some methods and this is what I want
to get into so we have this flippy thing
and we're going to use the method on it
and again we have to define our variable
above our on create method and delete
that there so now we can use flippy down
here so we're going to say flippy and
one of the things that we can do is we
can just say show next so that's going
to go into our next maybe that maybe I
will have to break this into two
tutorials because I want to show you few
other things that the flipper class can
do but let's just run it as now and make
sure it works but yeah that's all this
tutorial is basically the XML file when
you set up this view flipper then you
set up things within here it's going to
classify each one of those as a
different kind of view and it's just
going to flip through them anytime we
click on it so here's our first view
click on I click on our view flipper
which is up here and so one thing that
we can do is we can set make this view
flipper fill the whole content fill
parent I don't know if it's not for the
height yeah for the height we want it to
fill parent so that's something we can
change
so we can click anywhere on the screen
for the most part as you can see it just
will flip through all of our flippers
and start over so I mean it's kind of
nice to have for like a flash card or
something a flash card application where
you just flip through flash cards or
something for studying but again you
guys can set up a linear layout here and
then find some stuff within there if you
want a view to be a certain way and then
you can just flip through them by this
you know this command show next so you
can create a button up top above your
view flipper and you can click that to
go to the next one etc so that's
basically it for this tutorial
actually let's just show you one more
and then we will we'll be done with this
flippy thing I know this kind of I know
it's kind of a waste just to you know
have one tutorial where we set up both a
class and XML file just for you know
this but another thing that we can do
let's say we want like a gallery that we
have different pictures in each view and
what we can do is we can say instead of
say in the onclicklistener to flip what
we can do that anyways but we can also
set up a variable a time variable so we
can say flippy dot set flip interval and
it takes milliseconds so let's say let's
just get crazy and say half of a second
so every half of a second it's going to
flip to the next one or that's the
interval and then what we have to do is
we have to say flippy dot start flipping
Phillippe's start flipping dang it
alright so that's another kind of thing
that we can do so when we run our
applications going to set this time
variable to be half a second and it's
just going to start flipping through it
and then every half second it's going to
you know just go to the next one so
that'd be good for like a photo gallery
or something if you guys are creating
that I don't know so as you can see it's
flipping through every half second so
that's another method that you guys can
use and then also when we click we can
make it go even faster because we have
that onclick method so I don't know
thought I'd show you the flipper the
flippin flipper and I'll catch you guys
in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
