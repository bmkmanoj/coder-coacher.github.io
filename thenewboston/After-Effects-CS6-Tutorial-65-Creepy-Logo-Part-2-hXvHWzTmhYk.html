smokey logo tutorial where we just went
over how to make your background in part
one and this is part two so we are going
to learn how to create like your text
and your smoke so we already have the
background and our vignette we can lock
those so they don't get messed with
anymore
let's create our text here so we can
make it called the new Boston and pull
that into the center and I'll pull my
character panel down here so you can see
what we got the text is TW cen mt
condensed extra bold333 marshal
now if I would have scaled when I was
down the anchor point was down here
would have scaled from here and probably
went off the screen so now that we have
our our title here we're going to want
to add some smoke in it so if you can
look here you can see within the letters
there is a smoke trail going in between
you can see how the letters darken and
lighten that's actually because of the
smoke so now we're going to create a new
layer it's gonna be a solid and I'm
gonna name this fractal noise the color
doesn't matter okay actually I'm gonna
make it yeah I'm gonna hit okay I'm
going to add an effect called fractal
noise by typing it in over here drag it
on top of my solid and we get this
the first thing I want to do here is
darken my fractal noise so I'll move
this and I think around negative 40 is
what I liked everything 40 is what I
liked
well that's contrast I don't want that
brightness back at negative 40 so now we
got it nice and dark I do want to change
the contrast and I want to bring it down
a little to about 75 I'm just going to
type in 75 now I already created the
logo obviously so I'm using the property
amounts that I already know that work so
the next thing we want to do is scale
this up so we'll turtle down this
transform and we have this scale and
we'll transform that up to 375 or scale
that up now this is going to be a little
better-looking smoke here we're getting
close
we're gonna set this blending mode to
none here and we're gonna animate this
moving across the screen so come down to
your current timeline make sure it's at
zero we're gonna animate this offset
turbulence here by hitting the stopwatch
we're gonna click on this crosshair
button right here we're gonna start the
crosshair here move down to the end of
your timeline and then move the
crosshair button over here and we'll see
what that looks like as you can see it's
just moving across the screen so the
next thing we want to edit is the
evolution so what I like to do is go to
the beginning and make a stopwatch so we
start keyframing come down to the end
and I'm gonna set the evolution to do
one revolution there now as I can I'll
show you what happens here you can see
that it like kind of like grows and
moves around and stuff like that so
we're pretty close but this doesn't
exactly look like smoke so we need to
add another effect and the effect we're
going to add is is a blur so we'll come
down to blur and sharpen and then we're
going to come to cc-vector blur and this
is a common way to make smoke in After
Effects so we're going to use kind of
specific settings here so the type here
is going to be Direction fading we're
going to change the amount here to 113
and then the angle here to 1
and 32 and you can see how it looks
looks like some smoke and we don't need
to worry about these edges here because
we're not going to be using the edges
you can see that they're a little
weird-looking with like grainy or
whatever but we're not going to be using
those so we don't need to worry about
that
so we have our smoke that we made and
now we need to put it on to our New
Boston letters here so what I'm gonna do
is click on our fractal noise and also
click on our text here and I'm gonna put
those into a new layer by going to layer
pre compose and it's pretty much putting
it into a new composition actually and I
want to name this smoky title or
something like that
move all attributes into the new
composition and hit OK
and that created a new comp in here
where we can animate the properties of
both of the of both the title and the
text so that we can don't have to keep
animating both of them and everything
like that and adding effects to both of
them so I'll conclude this part of the
tutorial we learned how to make our
smoke basically in this part so in the
next part we'll be putting the smoke
into the text and we'll be pretty much
doing that we'll see how far we get and
about 6 to 10 minutes in I'll I want to
switch in between into the next part so
I'll see you guys in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
