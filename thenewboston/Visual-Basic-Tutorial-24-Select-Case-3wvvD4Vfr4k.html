slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
taking a look at the select case
statement now the Select case statement
is very similar to the if statement but
sometimes you need to use the Select
case instead of if because it's a lot
more efficient and I'll explain this to
you as we start programming so let's go
ahead and get started
we're going to create a variable and
we'll call it my int and we're just
going to make it an integer let's now
work what we're going to do is we're
going to get the integer from the user
so let's just ask them for an integer
please enter an integer now we're just
going to get what they type in
and now what we're going to do is we're
going to create our select select case
statement so we're going to start off by
typing select and it says runs one of
several groups of statements depending
on the value of an expression
so after select we're going to type case
it says the same thing and now what
we're going to do is we're going to type
in our variable that we're going to use
for the select case statement so in our
case we're going to use my int and you
can see when you press ENTER it
automatically adds and select for you so
what does the like case statement does
is that it starts off by checking the
first case so let's just do case 0
console dot write line hello and then
we'll do a case 1 now you can see there
that whenever you create a case you're
going to start by using the keyword case
and you're going to add whichever
whatever you want it to be so in our
case we're using an integer so if the
integer is equal to 0 then go ahead and
do this and you can do this for the
string so if a string is equal to this
right here then go ahead and do whatever
is in here now as I'm saying I kind of
interrupted myself there but with a
select case statement the reason it's
more efficient than an if statement is
that it'll go through and let's start
the Select case statement and if case 0
is true
then it's going to go ahead and in the
Select case statement for you it's not
even going to take a look at any other
cases you have so you could have
hundreds and hundreds of cases but as
soon as it reaches the the 1 case is
looking for it'll exit your select case
statement now if you use if and else if
then it's going to even though it won't
execute the code it's going to look at
all of your else ifs and that's one of
the reasons you would want to use select
case over if else if so we'll just do
case 1 we'll add a couple more cases
here
okay so now that we have three cases
we're going to go ahead and run our
program now let's not forget to do
console dot read line so it waits for us
to input something before the program
closes and if we run this it'll say
please enter an integer so if we type
zero it's going to say hello and we'll
run this a couple more times and go
through each case if we type one it'll
say bye and then if we type two it'll
say good morning so a select case
statement is fairly simple it's quite
similar to the if else--if and once you
have that down go ahead and move on to
the next tutorial and we're going to be
learning more about select case and
