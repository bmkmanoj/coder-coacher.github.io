to another PI game tutorial video in
this video what we're doing is allowing
the enemy tank to move so if the enemy
tank is staying stationary the entire
game as soon as we find where to shoot
or how much power to give and what angle
to give we're just gonna keep pressing
fire and that's pretty boring so we want
the enemy tank to be able to move so how
might we move the enemy tank well
there's a couple of ways that we could
go about it one we could make the enemy
tank move once hit or we could just move
the enemy tank like every time and so
and the way that we'll do that is we're
going to come down to where we press the
space key to fire so scroll all the way
down to the game loop and then what
we're looking for is pressing the space
key so here now basically every time we
fire we want him to move but do we want
where to wearing this do we want to move
so if we move him say at the top what's
gonna happen is you're gonna get
everything set up you're gonna press
fire and then the enemy tanks can move
well that's pretty lame we don't want
that happening so after you fire what we
can do is we can allow the enemy tank to
move at that point so what kind of what
code do we need for the enemy tank to
actually actually move well first of all
we're gonna have some possible movements
okay so what we could do is we're gonna
say possible movement and possible
movements just gonna be a short list
we're gonna have F and far forward and
reverse so either goes forward or
reverse and then we're just gonna say
the move index equals random dot R and
range you know zero to two so then we're
gonna say let's do 4x in range and we're
gonna do random dot R and
range 0 to 10 now why are we doing this
so the idea is that if our tank is gonna
move he doesn't we don't necessarily
want to move by the exact same amount
every time right maybe we want him to
just move slightly or a lot or you know
in between those two okay so what this
is gonna do is 4 0 4 you know this
random range from 0 to 10 it's either
gonna it's gonna move you know let's say
the the random range is 3 we're gonna
say 3 times 5 it's gonna move 15 pixels
or let's say it finds a 1 1 times 5 it's
gonna move 5 pixels or if it's a 10 it's
gonna attempt to move 50 pixels okay so
for X in range in that random range what
do we want to do we're then gonna say in
this scenario it's you know conceivable
that he moves off of the screen entirely
so we don't want that to happen so we're
gonna go ahead and restrict his movement
so we're gonna say if display with time
0.3 is greater than the enemy tank X
which is simultaneously greater than
display with times 0.03 then we're
allowed to move the tank so then we're
gonna say if the possible movement of
move index so is it 0 or 1 and does that
correspond to F or R so if possible move
index equals whoops forward F we're
gonna go ahead and say enemy tank X plus
equals 5 and then we're gonna say L if
possible movement move index equals
reverse
our enemy tank x- equals 5 and when
we're since we're doing this we're
actually we're actually moving the tank
so we want to kind of display the tank
is moving so now we're gonna go ahead
and say game and displayed off bill
white and that's all this is within that
for loop right so for each time right
it's gonna do this and what we need to
do really is call all of the same things
that we call down there so all the
things that go on our screen basically
we've got health bars that's gonna equal
or rather health bars is the function
player player player tell enemy help in
fact maybe I think we might have that
all right like we should just be able to
copy and paste this so let's do that
let's just let us scroll down here and
we're just gonna copy and paste this I
think we can get away with that so just
copy that and really
this so let's copy that scroll back up
here game display it up fill white paste
tap this stuff over and then we also
need that clock tick so let's go ahead
and grab clock tick fps copy that and
paste now this might not work out as
intended but I think that's everything
we want so let's go ahead and run that
and see what happens hopefully we won't
get an error nice short barrier okay
yeah uh uh range interesting so I type
owed Rand range to be range range Rand
range didn't anybody tell me I was doing
that period fire so he moves he fires so
now like I can't memorize where he is
let's make sure he doesn't move all the
screen or something but it doesn't look
like he is so that time he just didn't
move and now he's moving again so that
was a zero apparently in the render
range good hit go up a little bit fire
it's actually a pretty close match but
he's he's gonna get me oh man I was it
does it hard to hit movie I'm good there
oh oh no okay this is this is where it
all comes down guys
oh uh man that sucks
almost I almost got him that was a
really intense game um okay so now I've
got the enemy tank moving so that's good
we still have a few more things that we
want to work on here but we're branded
out the game pretty well so anyways hope
you guys are enjoying and that adds a
little bit more fun to the game with him
moving around makes a little harder so
anyway got a few more things coming
though so stay tuned for that as always
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
