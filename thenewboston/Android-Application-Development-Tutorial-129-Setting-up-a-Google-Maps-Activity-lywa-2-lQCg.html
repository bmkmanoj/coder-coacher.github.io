and twenty ninth Android tutorial for
the new boss in what we're going to do
is we're going to get into Google Maps
so I want you guys to go to this website
code.google.com Ford / Android /add -
ons Ford / Google - api's and this
basically what we're going to follow to
set up Google Maps we're going to need
to get a fingerprint for the most part
to develop for Google Maps and we're
going to walk through first the the
debug key that we're going to use and
then when we finalize the project and
put on the market we're going to have to
re-establish that fingerprint mark but
you know you guys won't go this website
and this will get us going here so let's
go into our project or into eclipse here
and to start a Google Maps project we
can't just add the API or the jar into
our project which I tried doing I made a
tutorial doing it that way but it didn't
actually end up working so we're going
to actually create a new project just
for Google Maps and we're going to go to
right-click you know right click in that
free space go to Android project and
then type in whatever you guys want Maps
and we're going to say comm dot the new
Bossin or what if you guys want to label
this again if you don't have to follow
along for our package name but we're
just going to call this Google Maps and
we're going to still work with the 8 API
level and we need to select this Google
Google api's here again for level 8
otherwise we're going to be able to use
the methods for Google Maps and as you
can see here our first activity is
called Maps activity which we're
actually going to change we're just
going to say
main something like that
but yeah you can click that and it'll
get a project set up again if it doesn't
have the Google API option what you're
going to want to do is go again to our
window tab Android SDK AVD manager and
we're going to select actually we're
going to select available packages we're
going to select third-party add-ons
right here and then what we're going to
do is we're going to select Google and
here's the Google API where we can use
Google Maps and all the powerful methods
that comes along with Google Maps so
you're going to select one of those and
install it and then also what we're
going to need is we're going to need an
emulator that's going to be able to run
Google Maps I have on setup there
already but once you install again that
I'll have it running but once you
install that Google API package what
you're going to do is you're going to go
into your emulator or virtual devices
we're going to create a new one called
Google Maps emulator something like that
we're going to select our target again
the target of Google API s and level 8
so you're going to select that and again
just if you want to have a SD card throw
that in there create a BD this is where
we're going to run our Google map
applications off of this emulator
because it won't work on this one let's
get into setting up a project and also
just to let you guys know in the next
tutorial you won't see this maps package
because like I said I already created
some tutorials but the way I created
them didn't actually work so the next
tutorials still going to be the same
concept but so just keep that in mind if
you don't see this maps we're still
going to be working with this maps
project but you might not see it in the
next tutorial and then what we're going
to do is we're going to go into the
Android manifest of our Maps project and
we need to set up a permission to use
the internet so we're going to go down
to our permissions and we're going to
say add uses permission and then select
the choice for the internet which is
Android permission internet and there we
go we're going to save a project the
last thing we have to
we have to go into the manifest and we
have to refer to this new jar for the
most part so we can use the Google Maps
API so again if you guys get lost you
can just go to this website and it will
kind of show you guys how to set up
everything if you like reading how to
learn stuff you can just follow this
they do the install but if you guys like
watching just follow these series this
series here so once you guys go this
website you can click on like the
obtaining maps or whatever one of these
options here and then scroll down to the
bottom and as you can see we need to use
this code in our manifest so we're going
to copy this or if you guys want to type
it out you can as well but what we need
where we need to add this is bright
below or application bracket and our
manifest not within an activity but
right below the application and we're
just going to hit ctrl V to paste it and
this is the code you guys need uses
library Android herbs Android name comm
Google Android maps and now we can start
developing for a Google Maps activity
which we're going to get into and a few
tutorials that again in the next
tutorial you're just going to obtain the
fingerprint that we're going to need and
I'll catch you guys then have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
