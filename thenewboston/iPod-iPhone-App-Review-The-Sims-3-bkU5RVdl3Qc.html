welcome to another wonderful app review
this app is for a little app called The
Sims 3 now the sims 3 is a little app
that costs $6.99 and it is based on well
if you played any of the Sims game
before let me turn it down a little bit
there we go now it the beginning you
have to like build a character and stuff
I already have a character made of Bucky
so I'm just going to start playing the
game and not take you through the
character building process again
it's pretty easy you won't pick up these
you just pick what he looks like and I
mean that's about it so you start out in
your home in the goal is pretty much
should improve your little character's
life and this includes things like
getting more money as you can see money
and keeping their needs met and their
knees are like Hunger energy bladder
here's all your needs and here's a meter
level once they get the red in the lower
then I mean right now all my knees are
pretty much met but you need to eat
sleep pee and take a dump like shower in
yeah just stuff like that so what the
controls are already pretty much slide
your finger around to pan around your
house just like this and you tap
something to let go there but we'll get
into that later now here's the zoom in
and out if you want to zoom in and out
obviously if you want orbit we need to
do is put two fingers and slide it like
this and as you can see we get new
orbital views and lastly if you want to
go somewhere new just go ahead and tap
and now it goes go to town map and then
you just walk there so pretty much just
tap an area to walk there so you also
tap to perform um let's knock out of
town and let's do this you also tap
things to perform actions on so for
example say I wanna take a shower go
ahead and click shower and click half
shower now my sim is going to walk over
to the shower and he's going to have a
shower so that's how pretty much you
take care of your hygiene
you tap the toilet right here if you
want to go pee or something and if you
want to eat go ahead and tap the
frigerator or something like that so
aside from all this you also have this
little thing right here these are are
you all of your goals and wishes and
these include cooking enthroning
grow something cook catch fish and grow
corn these are different from I mean
each game of each game and these pretty
much are your different quests and again
you know just like any other game what a
quest is but right now I'm going to go
ahead and click this and I'll go into
town just to show you guys because town
is pretty much an important part you can
get jobs there you can meet other people
um let's see you can buy things the
hobby shop if you go to the Kwik Mart
you can ship either shop here or get a
job so for example if I had a quest that
was like cooking minestrone um I would
probably go to one of these buy my
ingredients or let's see I would go to
the Bistro right here and buy recipes
and you know there's my little simmer
and err maybe he'd walk over there buy a
recipe and then I could go home and cook
it or something like that so it's a
pretty neat little app and aside from
this another cool thing is whenever you
see another sim walking on the street
you can go ahead and meet them and when
you meet them it's going to give you
options but do you want to be friendly
to them do you want to meet them do you
want to act crazy do you want to act
romantic so you know it really lets you
build your own personal life exactly how
you want it to be so that's pretty much
it um aside from the fact that the map
really isn't all that big I mean in just
a couple swipes I can scroll to the edge
of all the maps aside from this it's a
really fun game and it's one of those
games that you can keep playing on and
on forever and you really can't get sick
of it I mean for just a game for your
iPod or iPhone is really advanced so I'm
not gonna show you guys a lot of
gameplay because I mean I just want to
show you the basics in my review and do
the fact that you can keep playing this
forever and never never really get bored
I'm going to write this game a nine out
of ten and also for only $6.99 that is a
wonderful price so I highly recommend
getting this out and testing it out for
yourself so that's that for this review
I'm sorry I couldn't go into any more
detail but I want to keep this video
short and don't forget to subscribe to
my channel and also if you have any more
apps you want me to review then just
leave me a comment in this video and
I'll try to review for it so thank you
