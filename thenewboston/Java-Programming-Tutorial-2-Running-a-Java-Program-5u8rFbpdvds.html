your second Java tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm gonna be teaching you how
to run a Java program now I'm not gonna
be teaching a lot of the syntax about
what's in a Java program before we do
that we actually need to know how to run
one so pretty much you're just gonna be
copying me write a simple program and
then you're gonna be learning how to run
it so I'm go ahead and open any editor
I'm gonna open notepad plus plus just
because it's my favorite one and uh go
ahead and the first thing you want to do
is go to file save as and we want to
save this and remember whatever location
I already made a file on my right off my
hard drive in there I have a folder
called test and I'm gonna save this as
let's save it as YouTube YouTube
and of course that Java is very
important and don't forget where you're
saving this this is also important so
now we have a file called anything dot
job but mine's called a YouTube Java now
I'm pretty much just going to show you a
simple hello world program again in this
story I'm not gonna showing you like how
to write Java I'm just be showing you
how to run it
and then the next couple tutorials I'll
show you what everything means in it but
for um beginners just follow me the
first thing you need to write is a class
now a class in Java pretty much in Java
everything begins with a class and if
you don't have a class you can't do
anything so you can't do anything until
you create a class so I'm gonna go ahead
and make a class called apples and in
that class we're gonna have something
called a method now again you don't
really need to know any of this stuff
I'm just making a simple program I'm
just talking you along you'll understand
what all this means later but for now
just stick with me now in your class
you're going to have something called a
method
now a method is pretty much a list of
things to do and this method is going to
be inside the class now the first thing
your computer does is whenever it runs a
Java program and looks for a method
called main so let's go ahead and create
that and you do this very clicking
public static void main and all of these
actually mean something but uh again
don't worry about it for now
I promise you're understand then in your
parameter type of string args Arg s and
put empty square brackets and uh I don't
know if I can copy this code in my
description or not but if I can't I'll
put it in my description but I got
feeling YouTube's not gonna let me put
code in for security reasons
next after in your method you're gonna
want to have to put um a statement or
instruction about what you want your
computer to do so go ahead and write
system period out period print Ln and
what this does is pretty much print a
line on your computer now in your
parameters go ahead and write whatever
you want hello YouTube now go ahead and
save this and you can go ahead and find
the hello world program from somewhere
on the internet again I just uh talk to
you guys through that real quick I
promise uh uh I'm not it this isn't even
part of the tutorial the tutorial is
just to show you how to run this so I'll
be teaching you about all this means
later so go ahead and this is where the
tutorial really begins go ahead in the
command prompt and the first thing we
need to do before we run this program is
actually compile it now when we compile
the program it pretty much takes what we
written and changes it into something
called a class file now your computer
can't read any files called dot Java it
can only read dot class so that's a
compiler job to take that Java and
change into something dot class that you
computer can understand so right now
what we need to do is
find this file and go find it you use
something called CD backslash and what
this does is take you to the very
beginning of your hard drive and this is
just a quick tutorial if you never use
command prompt for once you're in your C
Drive press dir and press Enter this is
going to give you a list that's
everything in your C Drive as you can
see one my directories or folders is
called test so let's go ahead and press
CD which means change directory to test
now we are in the test so again from
your C Drive press CD test
now press dir and see what's in this and
let's see
YouTube Java so how do we compile this
YouTube Java well once you're in your
test go ahead and press Java C which
means Java compiler and then press
YouTube dot Java and this means our use
the compiler on YouTube Java and then go
ahead and press enter and what your
computer does is now if you press dir we
now have a apples class so what it does
is take that Java file and change it
into a class file depending on whatever
your name your class remember I named
mine apples so now that we have a class
file a file that the computer can
understand we can actually run this
program so let's go ahead and type Java
and that means run this program and then
type in the name of your class which is
apples and now when you press ENTER it
says hello YouTube so that's a quick
tutorial on how to run a simple Java
programs and again I can't stress this
enough don't worry if you didn't get
that HelloWorld program that's not even
the tutorial I wanted to teach you guys
today the tutorial was learn how to run
these simple Java programs from the
command-line and in the next tutorial
I'm gonna be clearing a bunch of things
up so just practice running a simple
program I suggest you just go ahead and
copy a HelloWorld program from the
internet somewhere and once you do just
practice running it and if you have any
questions you can just send me a message
on YouTube or leave a comment and I'll
try to get back to you but thank you
guys for watching hopefully now you know
how to run a simple program even though
you don't know what it means yet so
again thank you guys for watching make
sure to subscribe to my channel and I'll
see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
