welcome to your let's see this is a
third intermediate drop in program
tutorial and then this is where I'm
going to be going over a concept called
recursion
now recursion is usually a concept that
gives a lot of people trouble because I
mean in concept it's kind of confusing
but it's actually really simple once you
see in action and that's what I'm going
to be teaching you guys today
now all recursion is is it's pretty much
a method that calls itself so here's
what we're going to be figuring out in
this tutorial oh let me go ahead and get
myself space in case you didn't know
what factorials are like five factorial
in math it pretty much means 5 times 4
times 3 times 2 times 1 it pretty much
means whatever number you tell me to
give a factorial times itself by all the
other numbers until 1 and obviously you
don't times it by 0 because then
anything factorial would be 0 so 5
factorial is 120 if you times all those
together equals 124 factorial is 4 times
3 times 2 times 1 which is 24 3
factorial is 3 times 2 times 1 if you
want which is 6 and 2 factorials 2 times
1 wants to on and on you don't need to
hear me do all that but you know I just
said it anyways but anyways let's go
ahead and write a method I'm displaying
what recursion is so as I said and as
you can see I approached should say this
I'm outside my main method right here so
here's my main and I'm making a new
method right here and I'm going to name
it public static long and I'm going to
name effect and it's going to take a
number is its parameter so as you can
see why a method call itself would be
useful in this case because you don't
really know what number they're going to
enter to begin with so say you were
expecting them to enter 5 factorial well
you can just say R I take that number
times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1
I mean this would be good in this case
but they entered any other number by
that we can't really prepare for what
number they enter so it can't give a set
of numbers to multiply itself by so this
is why we need to use something called a
recursion now in case you guys didn't
know
if you you if you do zero factorial or
one factorial the answer is always one
so let's go ahead and prepare ourselves
for that and let's go ahead and make if
statement if they enter a number if
there n is less than or equal to one
which is either 0 or 1
what do you want to do well all you
wanted to do is return one easy enough
take care of the easy things first and
now let's get into recursion finally
else what do we want to do well we know
factorial is pretty much that number
that they gave us times the number below
it so example if they give us an 18 it
would be that number times 17 and on and
on 16 15 14 so else what do you want to
return we want to return that number
times the same function fact in but we
want to change it the number of it so
here's what would happen if they give us
a 0 1 we're just going to return 1 as
our answer they're going to be happy but
if we gave them an 8 then it's going to
return that 8 times 7 and it's going to
call this method itself so check this
out this method is called fact in the
method we call it inside it is the exact
same method so what's going to do this
if you gave it like 5 to begin with it's
going to say all right I'm done with
this this isn't 1 so let's just go to
this return 5 times 4 of this method so
it's going to pass 4 into this method
and now this method is going to have 4
in it so it's going to return all this
not I mean
skip all this go alright for this one
I'm going to return 4 times 3 factorial
all right keep going I'm going to return
3 times 2 factorial call this method
again return 2 times 1 factorial and
finally when we get to 1 it's going to
say all right I finally have a number
return instead of returning your dang
method again and again so I mean I'll
show you guys later visually what does
and let me go ahead and run this one
time so sit system.out.print line
and let me just go ahead and do like the
factorial for five or something just so
you guys can see that this actually
works and I'm not just BSN yeah this is
120 right here so again what it did is
we passed five in here it wasn't any of
this so what it did is it returned five
times four factorial so pretty much took
this when it got here it called itself
with a different parameter so then it
was four times three factorial and then
kept calling itself and itself until it
got to one and then once it got to one
it could fill in all the blanks in it it
pretty much solved the puzzle and let me
show you guys this might be a little
easier so at first we call it five
factorial all right so what our method
did is it called five right here return
n times factorial n minus 1 so 5 times 4
factorial and it doesn't have the result
for this yet this is the result we're
trying to achieve eventually but it
doesn't have the result for this yet it
needs to fill it in later
it says no problem well now I'm just
going to call a new method to try to
solve this called 4 times 3 factorial
which is 4 minus 1 oops
which is 3 factorial well now I need a
result for 3 factorial so I'm going to
do 3 times 2 factorial well now I need a
result for 2 factorial so now what I'm
going to do is 2 times 1 factorial well
now I need a result for 1 factorial oh
well look at what we have here this is
called the base case and whenever I get
to 1 I can just return a 1 eventually so
it says all right 1 factorial equals 1
yeah baby now we have the answer of 1
now we can begin filling in the blocks
that way all this by the way is stored
in memory so now that we finally found a
real answers don't have to call
myself again we can begin finding or
excuse me filling in all the blocks for
all of this so I'm going to go ahead and
change this and it says RA 2 times 1 is
2 problem solved
out of the way 3 times 2 factorial well
since we know this is 2 so this is 3
times 2 which is 6 factorial 4 times 3
factorial is 24 or wait a minute I may
be wrong for it yeah that's 24 BAM
problem solved this one and now that we
know what 4 factorial is it's 5 times 24
which is 120 right there and oh you
asked for 5 factorial
yeah it's 120 so what it's pretty much
doing here is it's trying to solve
itself but it's storing what it doesn't
know in memory and then when it finally
found finds a number that it can work
with it tracks through all of the
numbers again and steps its way back up
and so it can finally solve its answer
or its problem so I know it kind of
sounds confusing but I mean this is the
easiest way I can explain it pretty much
calling a method pretty much calling
itself until it gets to a base case
which is in this case 1 and then when it
finally gets that number it can stop
calling itself and start solving this
problem so again don't forget to add a
base case because again if you don't
have a base case is going to just keep
going and going again infinite loop and
it'll just never in so that is your
quick tutorial on recursion if I made
this confusing then leave me a comment
and know but I want to know if I taught
it right or not because I mean it's a
really simple concept all it is is a
method that calls itself until it gets
to a base case and then when it does it
can solve the problem so thank you guys
for watching I'll let me know what you
thought of this tutorial because I'm
interested in to here so thank you don't
forget to subscribe and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
