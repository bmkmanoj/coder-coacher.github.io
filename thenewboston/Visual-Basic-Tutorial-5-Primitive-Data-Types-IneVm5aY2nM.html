slash on live gamer and in this tutorial
we're going to be taking a look at
primitive data types now what these are
is pretty much the building blocks of
all the programs you're going to make
now I've broken this down into several
different categories starting at the top
we have primitive data types this is
divided into three more sub sections
we've got numbers characters and logical
now under the numbers category we have
integers now this is all numbers that
aren't decimals or don't have decimals
we have byte which is a very small
integer number that can hold a value
starting at negative 128 all the way up
to positive 127 now if you go past that
what it has happened is called overflow
and you will get an error in your
program we've got the short data type
right here which is a 16-bit type and it
has a value that can span from negative
32768 all the way up to 32767 now we
have the int type for the integers now
this is the type that we're going to be
using most of the time most of the time
in our tutorials because we don't need
to use byte or short pretty much because
we don't have to conserve resources
we're not making programs that are so
big that we need to use these to
conserve the product and conserve the
resources and an INT is just big enough
for us to use and we will never go
outside the realms of that and an int
datatype is 32-bit and it can have a
minimum value of negative 2 billion 147
million 480 3684
and a maximum value is 2 billion 147,000
483 I mean 2 billion 147 million 480
3647
and over here we have long now what long
is is it's pretty much self-explanatory
it's a long integer it's a 64 bit type
and it can have a maximum value of
let's see nine this is nine uh what
comes out two trillion hold on here now
the maximum value of a long is 9
quintillion 223 quadrillion 372 trillion
36 billion 854 million 776 with 808 now
there are other data types in visual
basic that I'm not going to cover in
this such as big integer which is
something that has been added in the
dotnet framework 4.0 and from what I
have read about it it does not have a
limit so feel free to play around with
that if you can find some places online
that will show you how to use that and
moving on we have real numbers now what
real numbers are is anything that can
hold a decimal value now we have double
and float now double is a 64-bit data
type and it can hold let's see
it's a 754 floating point which may not
be much to you but what that basically
means is that it can hold a really long
decimal and a float is a variant of the
double it's a quite similar and now
moving on to characters we have what's
called a character which holds one
character such as the letter A or the
letter T or G it just holds one of those
and now one thing I added in the list
that isn't technically a primitive
datatype but I thought that I should
teach you guys this and in this tutorial
is a string now it's pretty much a bunch
of characters put together you saw this
in the helloworld tutorial it's enclosed
in two quotes and it can hold as many
characters as you want and spaces and
other stuff and now last but not least
we have logical now under logical we
have booing and boolean is a data type
that can hold a value of true or false
now you'll find this very useful when
you
making programs so take a look at this
chart
make sure you remember all of this we're
going to be working with these data
types coming up in the next tutorials
