biology tutorial and in this tutorial
now that we understand the basics of
what DNA molecule is made up of and we
understand what nucleic acid is what I
want to do is I want to take a closer
look at this silly little thing called
DNA now like I said in the last video
DNA is probably the most famous nucleic
acid we just go ahead and write this it
feels like it should be written at the
top and it's pretty much made up of two
strands of nucleotides one on the left
one on the right and it's arranged so it
looks like a twisted ladder however
whenever I drew right here I drew it as
an untwisted ladder because it's easier
to show what I'm going to show right now
and that's it that these separate
sections or I know I probably encircle
exactly where I needed to but separate
sections of the DNA molecule are called
genes and that's about G e and is not J
EA and s that's a different type of
genes but anyways the job of a gene is
basically to carry the genetic
information and pass the information on
to if it's a human of course your kids
or you know the next generation whatever
your offspring may be whatever kind of
animal or plant you are now a cool thing
is that genes are also the blueprint for
proteins okay so what do i heck what the
heck do I mean by blueprint because I
know that they don't make up proteins
because we know amino acids are the
so-called building blocks of proteins
that's what proteins are made up of but
I just said genes are the blueprint for
proteins however if we're building a
house we know that a house is built of
bricks and it has a blueprint to tell
you how to build it and that's basically
what DNA does it tells you how the amino
acid should be strung together and will
order they go in whenever they make a
protein so basically let me pick a color
and summarize this stuff oh crap i
shouldn't picked orange let's get yellow
so nucleotides
which remember are those three
ingredients they make something called
nucleic acid and the most famous nucleic
acid is what we're looking at right here
d.n.a
and nucleic acid is pretty much the
blueprint for proteins remember it's not
the ingredient because proteins are made
up of amino acids but this blueprint
tells the meaning of the hook
okay Bucky take a deep breath it pretty
much determines the order that the amino
acids are arranged whenever they do make
proteins okay fair enough
so what else so I got to talk about um
oh yeah I guess um I probably should
mention this you guys like okay so if
every nucleotide is made up of the same
stuff and every nucleotide makes DNA
then wouldn't it mean that it pretty
much made the same blueprint well the
thing is whenever your nucleotides or
nucleic acid is formed they're made in
different ways and actually each of
these genes are paired with another one
and the order that they are paired
together pretty much determines what
kind of protein that they make in which
protein it produces determine what the
job of the protein is going to be so
basically DNA makes different types of
proteins and depending on exactly how
that protein is made determines what it
does in your body and a cool little
information that I guess isn't that cool
because it's kind of sad actually
sometimes uh the wrong type of proteins
are made and whenever they do whenever
your body makes the wrong type of
proteins it can develop some diseases
like cancer and obviously it messed up
because cancer is not a very good thing
but hopefully through all of my writing
you guys understand a little bit about
genes which just think of it as a piece
of DNA and you guys know that DNA is
responsible it's basically the blueprint
for telling the amino acids how to join
together and make a protein so I'm going
to take a deep breath and I'm probably
going to go eat some string
cheese but thank you guys for watching
don't really subscribe and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
