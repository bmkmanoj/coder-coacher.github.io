name is buddy Blackford we're an After
Effects cs6 and I want to go over
different cameras with you and explain a
little bit about cameras in this
tutorial and then I'll explain a little
bit more about cameras and the different
properties and other preceding or
following tutorials I guess you would
say so let's start out by explaining
what I've got going on here I'm gonna go
back into my I'll go back into one view
and I'll just go to like active or to
the to the top view here so we can see
what's going on I've got three of the
same object different colors lined up in
3d space so here's one in the front
here's one in the back and here's one in
the far back and then I've got a bunch
of cameras that I made that I just put
them on their default settings but they
have different millimeter lens on them
and I'm gonna show you the difference
between them I have a one node camera
and I have a two node camera and then I
just have a background of like wooden
whatever just like a wooden background
that I found off the internet so it gave
it gave some pretty good contrast and it
looks kind of cool so I decided to use
that even though there's footprints on
it but maybe someone who's like running
up the wall doing like backflips off it
or something like that
so let's I'm gonna click double click on
my first camera here which is I've
labeled one node camera and over here
where it says type there's one node and
two node cameras and these behave a
little bit differently and to me the one
node camera behaves like it's on a
tripod so if you put a real camera on
top of a tripod it's going to stay at
one place and you're going to be able to
orbit the camera around while it's
staying in one place now if you have a
two node camera
it's going to move around the world and
not really stay in place when you're
orbiting around and I'll I'll
demonstrate that while I'm explaining
these cameras so I want to also say that
it's also the 50 millimeter preset which
is the standard preset here when you
have an active camera and when you don't
have any cameras After Effects defaults
to the 50 millimeter 2-node camera I'm
what's let's go into two views here and
I'm going to go into two leaves vertical
no not that one two views horizontal and
we'll make this one left and this one
will be what's a setter camera to the
one node camera and I've hidden the
other camera so the only camera you can
see right now is this one node camera
and I want you to watch this camera as I
orbit around in the scene I'm gonna
orbit around in in though in the
right-hand panel but watch the camera
and look how it moves so I'm going up
and down right now you can see that the
camera is staying stationary in one spot
I'll zoom out so maybe you can see there
just like it's on top of a tripod so if
if there's a tripod coming legs coming
out of here it's gonna stay right on
there you're not gonna be able to move
the camera head in put the camera head
position around I'm just gonna move left
and right and you can see what that does
so it basically swivels around pretty
much a fixed point
now if I turn on the two node camera and
then switch my camera view over here to
to the 50 millimeter 2 node I'm gonna
click on the camera for you now watch
how this camera moves around it stays on
a fixed point in it stays on a point of
interest which is this fixed point right
here I'll zoom into it and you can kind
of see like the crosshairs as i zoom in
the crosshairs don't get bigger it's
kind of it's like the anchor point of
the camera so the anchor point of this
camera is out here the anchor point of
the OneNote camera is on the camera so
I'll just move left and right and you
can see that the camera moves around
that anchor point so let's get it back
to somewhere we're in the middle I guess
I'm back to where it was almost so
that's the difference between the one
node and the two node cameras they're
doing a lot more advanced camera moves
use the two node camera if you're using
regular camera moves like pan and tilt
and things like that then just use the
one node camera it's up its whatever
floats your boat basically and whatever
is better for your project so let's uh
check out the difference between the
lengths of the 200 I created a 50
millimeter a 20 millimeter and a 200
millimeter camera so as you can see the
preset here is 15 millimeter for the one
that we're viewing I'm just going to go
into one view now and we're just gonna
switch between the different cameras now
I turned them I turned them all on and
let's go next to the 20 Mille 20
millimeter camera and you can see how
the spacing and between these vectors
here differs with each type of camera so
I'm going to go from 50 to 20 now you
can see that the decay
the spacing is way farther apart and
whatever was in front is a lot closer to
the camera now now let me switch to the
200 and now it looks like the spacing is
like barely even there and let me track
this it looks like there's not very much
spacing there so that's how the
different lengths here with your presets
that's how the different lengths there
are affecting how your camera is used so
it's changing the focal length is what
it's called of your camera and it's it's
always it's a probably a good idea to
read up on camera lingo basically camera
keywords things like that so you know
what what I'm talking about when I say
focal lengths and what I'm talking about
if I turn on the depth of field and I'm
talking about the aperture and f-stop
and blur level and I'll try to explain
these but you may want to read up on
them a little better and get a good
understanding of what's going on and
want to check out and see what the film
size does and an angle of view and all
that stuff so I'm gonna hit okay and
I'll stop here and then in the next
tutorial coming up I'll explain what
focal length is and why it's important
and why does it matter so you can learn
how to pick what cameras you need to use
correctly for the correct project so
thanks for watching this one be sure to
watch the next tutorial and learn keep
on learning about these cameras so you
can become a pro at using the correct
cameras for your project</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
