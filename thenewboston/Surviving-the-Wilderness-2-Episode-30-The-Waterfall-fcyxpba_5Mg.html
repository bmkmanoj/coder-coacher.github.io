get any sleep at all last night it was
raining and it was windy and it's still
windy and it looks like it's about to
rain again but uh I got up early and I
started walking along the river and I
came to this waterfall as you guys can
see at least I think it's usually a
waterfall but I don't know there it's
just the wrong time of year or I don't
know if it didn't rain enough but uh
it's trickling a little bull fault
anyways I thought it would be a cool
place to stop and make a video so I
actually need to go up that to continue
along where I'm walking so I'll take you
guys up there and show you guys what's
on top what's the plan for today
there's just the key moving I need to
get out of here soon another than that I
just need to keep eating and keep
drinking
all right want to get too close it's
probably at least 50 feet in the air
this is actually really high it's not
showing up on my camp can put up yeah
I'm really freaking out right now
scream and that's where I got a lock so
I guess that's my plan for now just keep
walking and
well I've been walk-in for about a
couple hours down that stream up the
waterfall I finally found this Big Lake
huge frickin like the biggest lake I've
found yet and it actually be nice to
stay here for a while but uh I know I
need to keep moving so I don't know what
I'm gonna do there's on my crab my bag
my boots tripod my sandals and then
actually is really open right here this
is the one sand part if you see there
are no more sand parts so that's pretty
cool that I found like the one sandy
spot but anyways
first of all it'd be nice to stay here
but I know that I can't I gotta keep
moving and other than that if you guys
can't tell by all the wind and it's not
getting night time this is actually in
the middle of the day
so I got a feeling a huge storm is
coming so it's getting windier so I'm
gonna stop filming now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
