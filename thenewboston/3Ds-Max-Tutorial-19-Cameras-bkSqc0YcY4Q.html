studio max tutorial and in this tutorial
I'm going to be teaching you guys what a
camera is how to use it in you know what
just watch it quit asking questions so
let's go ahead and create one first so
let's go ahead and in our create panel
right here go ahead and click a Bissel
button that says cameras so go ahead and
click that and the first thing that we
need to do is pick what type of camera
we're going to make actually before this
what we need to do is probably should
click some stuff to look at so how about
this nice little box right here and how
about a pyramid we didn't create a
pyramid yet so BAM look at that we have
a boxing pyramid some in the scene you
know we got a look at something just
don't want to be roaming all around
space so now we can go ahead and create
a camera and now we have two options
choose target or free here's your quick
guide to choosing cameras anytime you
want to work with an animation which we
didn't even go over yet use free anytime
you want to work with objects that
aren't moving around or being animated
click target so we don't know anything
about animations yet so we're going to
click target right here and now
once we do that we create a camera so in
order to create a camera what you need
to do is once you have these little
crosshairs after your pick target just
click anywhere in the top viewport and
drag the camera clicking it's going to
create a camera and dragging it's going
to give you it's called the target point
other or the target or it's pretty much
the direction where it's looking so now
you can see we curated a camera that's
looking at our objects right here so
what we want to do is probably change
this from wireframe to smooth and
highlights just because it looks better
and aside from that what else we can do
is change using our basic tools up here
select object select and move select and
rotate we can move around the camera
with these tools but right now I want to
change this old target point right here
so I'm going to click select and move
and you
know what click this out away click my
target point and now look at that I can
move my target point around just like
that BAM look at that how awesome is
that so now what's the point of creating
camera and that's to get our own
different view that we want so how do we
see that view well in order to see what
the camera is seeing what you need to do
is click on a viewport doesn't matter
what one I'm going to click on this one
and press C and what C means is the
cameras view and another thing that you
can do is these are the views right here
the plus the front and the wireframe the
middle is the view so anytime you click
that you can go to cameras and all your
cameras are going to be listed right
there so let's select the one you want
but right now we're in camera view right
now so this viewport right here is what
the camera sees so now once you click
see in your one your viewports you get
all of these different options in the
bottom right and that's on the camera
tools and I'm going to be going over how
to move the camera how to move the
camera using the camera tools the first
one if you click on dolly camera is the
dolly and what this does is move it
towards and away from its target point
so it's probably I'll show you this this
viewer right here and if you look in
this top view right here you can see
that it's getting closer and farther
away from its target points so if you
like our animating later on and you want
to stroll into something like that
slowly that's how you do it but for now
let's move on the next probably common
one you're going to need is a roll
camera and what this does is it rolls it
along its z-axis or pretty much the way
that's unnatural for the common for a
camera to move but this can give you
some pretty cool artistic effects so
just remember that
so aside from that I guess the field of
view will probably be the most common
if this if you click that pretty much
just gives you a better view of objects
and cameras in one scene and that's
called zoom extends all but anyways back
to three
to view what field-of-view does is it
looks like if you're just looking at in
this view that it does the exact same
thing is the dahle just move in and out
from your subject but what it does in
reality is it's pretty much just zooming
in and out the camera isn't moving
itself so while I'm doing this if you
look in this top viewport right here
nothing's moving and that's because when
you change the field of view the camera
doesn't move it's just the view like
you're pressing zoom in and out on your
camera so now aside from that we can go
through these this is called the truck I
think let me make sure yep the hand is
the truck and what this does as you can
see it moves the camera and target point
all in one so that's pretty much what
truck does I don't know why they called
it truck can't even think of anything
creative for it but you know they call
it the truck moves the camera and
viewpoint all in one what this button
does though the walkthrough is only
moves to the target so anytime you have
these two little feet they're called the
walkthrough and that keeps your camera
in the same place it moves the target or
where it's looking at and the last thing
that I want to go around is this orbit
camera right here whenever you click
this the target does not move but only
the camera move
so why the walkthrough changes the
target point the orbit changes the
camera but keeps the target point so
that's what this is pretty cool and one
of the most useful ones you can put your
target right in the middle of a scene
and you can pan around and you won't
have to worry about your target moving
or anything like that so that is pretty
much your basic stuff creating a camera
again um anytime you want to create a
camera just go to create press camera
and then go ahead and press target for
now and then any time you want to edit
the camera just go ahead and select your
camera and go to modify and here all the
settings right here but for now they're
just default and we can leave them at
that because it's doing a 1
so job is default so for now that's it
that's all you get I saw her I'm sorry
but thank you guys for watching don't
forget to subscribe
in the next tutorial maybe I'm going to
be talking about camera some more maybe
I'm not I guess you're going to have to
wait and find out so thank you don't
forget subscribe and I'll see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
