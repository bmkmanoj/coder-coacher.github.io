game development tutorial and in this
tutorial is going to be continuation of
the last tutorial where we set our
window to full screen to take over the
whole monitor so we already changed a
window to undecorated and made it so you
can't resize it and we already set it to
full screen window but now we need to do
a little check to make sure that we have
a couple of things done first go ahead
and add space right there and go ahead
and make a if statement going to be
checking two things
remember we passed in that diem which is
pretty much your monitor or pretty much
display mode settings and this is things
like raise resolution dip it bit depth
and refresh rate so make sure that if
your settings are not equal to null that
means as long as there's something in
them as long as you have settings I mean
if you pass the end nothing then one
know what to do so this means as long as
you gave it something to work with
and what's my and sign I cover it up on
my keyboard with sticker so it takes me
long to find weird things and video card
remembering made that variable up here
is display change supported now what
this little thing means is if your video
card is able to change display pretty
much equal to change the display so you
want to check that first because if you
try calling this and it's not even able
to change it then you're going to get
some stuff messed up what do we wanted
to do well first of all we want to try
something and let's just go ahead and
catch my exception catch exception e
action in X I don't want to have another
e what do you want to try we want to try
video card dot set splay mode and set
this equal to DM right there so here's
what we're pretty much doing whenever we
call
I'm tighten this up a little bit that's
what she said whenever we call set full
screen method is going to take that
window it's going to strip it of
everything that we don't need make it so
you can't resize it and then it's going
to put that one
into the full-screen mode and what this
does right here is it check if you have
monitor settings and it checks if it's
able to display those settings and stuff
like um resolution refresh rate that's
what we were changing right here and
ever saying all right what are the
settings well we didn't pass them in yet
so if you don't know well then you
should it so now we're going to build um
two more methods ones are really easy
ones a method that we're going to use
later on to return the window public
window since it's returning window get
full screen window very descriptive
method name and for this I should go
ahead and put return VC video card get
fullscreen window right there this
pretty much just returns your window we
might need that later on um we might not
but you know might as well have it if we
need it and the last thing that we need
to do is we need to make a method to
restore the screen to normal because if
we call this method make it fullscreen
then we have no way of getting back to
regular and I don't want to be stuck at
looking at some stupid fullscreen for
the rest of my life as long as I have
this computer so we better build a
method to bring it back to regular and
we will name this public void restore
screen just like that it's not going to
take any parameters all just going to do
is change screen back to normal so let's
go ahead and put window w and set this
equal to VC dot get full screen window
and what this pretty much does is get
the window and what do you want to do to
it let's go ahead and make if statement
if that window is not equal to anything
which pretty much as long as the window
contains something what do we want to do
w dot which is the window disposed right
there and what dispose means is anytime
well usually when you close a window you
usually want to dispose it and this
pretty much just frees the resources for
a better garbage collecting stuff like
that but it's just good programming
practice to dispose your window whenever
you're closing it
and now let's go ahead and add one more
thing video card set full screen window
and again this pretty much sets the full
screen of whatever parameter you pass
into it and put null right there and
when you pass a null in the set
fullscreen window it makes sure that
whatever you have it's not in
full-screen anymore so instead of making
something fullscreen it takes it away
from from fullscreen so that is well
that's all we're going to do for this
tutorial this screen class is already
built so as long as you follow this
tutorial in the last oriole that's all
we need to do for the screen class right
now
in the next tutorial we're going to be
do things like passing it in display
modes and actually running it and see
what happens
so the next tutorial is going to be
awesome but for now this is all you hit
so thank you guys for watching don't
forget to check out my next tutorial
where we'll be actually making something
appear on the screen finally so again
thank you don't forget to subscribe this
game making is going to be awesome I can
oh wait
but anyways I'm rambling don't forget to
subscribe I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
