multiplying binomials well a binomial is
a two-term expression and when we
multiply binomials we're going to use
this method called foiling where we
multiply the first two terms of each
binomial so x times X plus the outside
terms which of each binomial x times
negative 3 plus the inner terms 5 times
X and the last two terms so plus 5 times
negative 3 and then we multiply each one
in the parentheses and then we'll
combine our like terms so x squared plus
x times negative 3 negative 3x plus 5x
minus 15 we can combine these middle
terms x squared plus 2x minus 15 and
your binomial or excuse me your
trinomial answer that you get for
multiplying two binomials are is always
going to come in this form where you
have the two middle terms combined so
you only have one term so now we're just
going to do some examples
so remember we foil we multiply first
outside inside last so the first is 2x
times 4x plus outside 2 x times 3 plus
the inside which is five times 4x plus
the two last term's 3 times 5 so 2x
times 4x gives me 8 x squared plus 2 x
36 X plus 5 times 4 20 x plus 15 we're
going to combine these like terms we're
going to get 8x squared plus 26 x plus
15 we're going to do the same thing for
this one this time I'm we're not going
to draw the arrows because I don't have
room but just talk through it when while
you multiply first which is x times 2x
plus outside x + 3 y plus inside
x la plus the last so x x two x is 2x
squared plus 3x x y is just three XY
plus 2y times 2x is just for y x plus 2y
times 3y 6y squared now remember I said
you'll always be able to combine these
terms well if you look this is X Y is
your variable and Y X is your variable
now what's the one thing that we always
need to remember about multiplication
well multiplication is commutative so
that means writing three XY is the same
as writing three Y X so those still
those are still like terms in the middle
so we get 2x squared plus 3 plus 4 is 7
Y X plus 6y squared and I could have
written this middle term as 7xy it
really doesn't matter it's whatever you
personally prefer so that's all we're
going to do with binomials today but
make sure you come back and check out
our next lesson which is gonna be on
multiplying polynomials together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
