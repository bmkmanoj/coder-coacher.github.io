video I want to talk to you about
processes in Linux so first of all Doug
TF is a process a process is essentially
just any program that's running on your
computer now the easiest way to just
view these is if you type PS this is
going to give you a list of processes
so these are the ones that are
associated with your terminal session so
bash of course we know what that is and
PS this is the this is actually the
process that we just typed in the
process to list processes kind of like
process ception ooh too spooky for me
all right now of course there are a
bunch of other processes that are
running in the background system
processes if you really want to see them
then if you type PS a X then this is
going to give you a huge list of
processes not only the ones that you own
but all the stuff that's going on in the
background again 99% of these we really
don't care about the system processes
are just to make sure that Linux is
running smoothly and you know all the
crap that goes on in the background of
your computer well we really care about
are the processes that we own pretty
much the programs that we started in
control manually so before we go any
further let's just go ahead and figure
out what the heck all the stuff is so
each process as you can figure out is
just listed on a new line now the first
column right here this PID this is just
the process ID so anytime you start a
new process it essentially just assigns
it a unique ID number and this is just
so you can reference the process it's
just easier than you know referring to
it by name or any other you know method
this tty this is the terminal where the
process is running from so most
processes that you start there
associated with the terminal the system
processes that run in the background
they aren't but just remember we're
going to see more about this later on
but this is the terminal that it's
associated with this time right here
this isn't like a regular you know like
what time did it start like 9:00
now this is the amount of CPU time that
this process took up so if you have a
really you know time consuming process
or heavy process that you know takes a
lot of resources this is going to be
higher the reason that these are zero is
because little programs like this like
just printing text out on the screen
they pretty much are really easy for
your computer to do so those are just
zero and that means that oh this was
really easy to run and CMD this is just
the command in other words the basic
name of the program so PS bash whatever
human readable name so there you go
that's a real quick overview of
processes so why do we care about this I
mean okay processes are programs that
run on your computer they have an ID
number Wow so fascinating who really
cares waste of a tutorial well not quite
the reason that I am teaching this is
because not every program on your
computer runs the same way sometimes you
want to have processes that run in the
background sometimes you want to have
processes that you control manually from
the terminal so on and so forth
so you know how I say you know command
like PS and LS and all these little
tools I've been teaching these are
actually programs so even though you
know we have a real simple command like
LS this is actually a program or a
process so even though all it does is
list the contents of a directory
remember this is just like a mini
program just like anything else so just
remember that so most of the time
whenever you run these little commands
you do not get shell back or you do not
have control of your terminal until that
program is done running now a lot of
these simple commands they're running
like half a second or like a millisecond
so we really can't tell it looks instant
but let's say that we are running a
program like this X logo now this
program all it does let's see if I can
move this it just pops up a little image
on the screen but
take a note of this so if we look back
in our terminal we actually can't type
any new commands so we usually have this
thing and we can type stuff right after
it but since this X logo is still
running we don't have control of our
terminal yet so watch what happens
whenever I close this whenever I close
this this X logo program is going to end
and then we get control of our terminal
back so just remember whenever you run a
process from your command line you don't
get control of the terminal or you can't
run any other ones until that program
closes now what you usually want to do
whenever you have a process that's going
to take a real long time you just don't
want to run it have it like you know go
through some database and just be
sitting there the whole time you got
other stuff to do you want to work on
your computer you pretty once you want
access to the terminal while that
process is running in the background so
I'll show you guys this real quick so
let's pop up X logo again and my mouse
tipped over embarrassing now here I'll
move this so you guys can see so anytime
you want to end this you can either just
close it this way or from the command
line we can do is you can hold down
control and hit C on your keyboard now
what this is going to do is it's going
to send it something called an interrupt
signal it's pretty much a nice way of
saying hey program can you stop running
so again that's ctrl + C and that is
going to go ahead and enter up or stop
your program from the command line so
let's say that we wanted to do something
like this we actually wanted to run this
program and we wanted to keep it running
but we also wanted to have control of
this terminal because you know maybe we
were working on something else so
anytime you want to have a program run
in the background and get control back
just type the name of the program and
after write ampersand
so this means hey run this process but
run it in the background so go ahead and
hit enter and check this out
this program is still running but now we
can do whatever we want in the terminal
we pretty much have full control still
now take note of this whenever we ran it
in the background instead of just you
know popping us to you know terminal
control it gave us some information now
this information this part right here is
the process ID so we can actually see
that right here X logo the process ID is
two seven one zero two seven one zero
now it also gave us this number right
here wTF is this number this is actually
called the job number now a job is
essentially just a special type of
program that we can actually do some
kind of cool things with it and I'll
show you guys right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
