tutorial and before all of you guys
start flipping out saying Bucky you are
awesome
I'm a longtime subscriber however I've
been watching your videos for a while
and you have already made C++ tutorials
I will say this I know I have made a
little series a couple years ago
probably in C++ but I actually went back
in rewatched all my videos and I noticed
that they're kind of old outdated the
quality wasn't really that great and I
really wasn't going over everything I
needed to be going over and in addition
to all that whenever I made a tutorial I
pretty much just made it and uploaded it
to YouTube and with this series what I'm
going to be doing is I'm going to be
saving all the code for you guys and I'm
going to be posting it on my forum so if
you guys want to follow along with me
and you know just go ahead and copy the
code it's going to make your life a
whole lot easier
so again if you guys want any of the
code for any of my tutorials just hop
over my forum and I'll have it you can
just copy and paste it in your program
and yeah like I said make your life a
whole lot easier so that was my message
to my old subscribers but to you guys
who are viewing this video for the first
time welcome to your very first C++
tutorial
so what C++ is it's pretty much a way
that we can program computers make cool
computer programs it's pretty much a
computer programming language alright so
you guys might be wondering why the heck
do I have Google open then what are we
doing going to you know get on Facebook
and meet some chicks no I mean we will
but we'll do that later what we're going
to be doing now is in order to write C++
code we need a special program and what
this program does is it takes code that
we can understand and changes it in the
code the computer can understand simple
enough and this is actually called a
compiler there
go now there are a bunch of different
C++ compilers you can get my favorite is
called dev C why is this not typing
that's embarrassing dev C + + go ahead
and hit enter in probably the first
thing that's going to pop up is this
bloodshed software dev C++ so go ahead
and click that in by the way this is a
free compiler you don't have to pay for
it or anything let's just go ahead and
go to downloads page and let's just go
ahead and pick one we want it's probably
going to be the top one it says dev -
C++ your version might be a little
different depending on when you're
watching this tutorial but anyways it's
most likely going to be the very top one
and all you have to do to download it is
go ahead and click this and I'm not
going to click it because I already have
this program downloaded and I don't want
to home on my computer because you know
why would I bet go ahead click that
download it um you know I don't think I
have to teach you guys how to download a
program it's just like any other program
click it and then hit next about 800
times and then you know once you're done
you have the program downloaded so now
that you have it downloaded and again
like I said I use dev C++ but you guys
can use any compiler you want as long as
it's for C++ so go ahead and open it and
if you have Def C++ and you're following
along with me then you get this nice tip
of the day let's go ahead and X out of
that but the very first thing we want to
do is go ahead and open up a blank file
that we can work with so go ahead and go
to file new source file or if you're
really lazy you can hit ctrl + n I'm
going to have to remember that because I
myself am very lazy so now you have this
blank source file and this is the file
where we can write all the C++ code we
can ever dream of however before we do
that you should always do this file save
as and save your source file something
I'm just going
my youtube and you can either push dot
cpp or just go ahead and save it as type
c++ source file and this is a special
type of file that your computer
understands is a c++ file that's all so
go ahead and save it and now we have a
blank c++ file now we can go ahead and
start writing some code however i'm
going to be saving that for the next
tutorial so now that you have everything
set up and good go you're ready to move
on to next tutorial if you watch this
video and you weren't following along
then go ahead to google and you know
find whatever c++ compiler you want to
work with go ahead and get it downloaded
and once it downloads and you got it all
loaded up then you're ready to move on
to next tutorial so yeah that's really
all I got to say and yeah that's it why
I still watching this tutorial leave
stop anyways thank you guys for watching
don't forget to check out my next
tutorial and also if you have some spare
time don't forget to check out my forum
and it's pretty awesome forum that's all
I'm gonna say so anyways thank you guys
for watching and see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
