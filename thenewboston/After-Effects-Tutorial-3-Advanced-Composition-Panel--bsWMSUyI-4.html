After Effects tutorial and in this
tutorial i'm going to be showing guys
how to find your way around the more
advanced features of the composition
panel now one thing i wanted to talk to
you guys about was something called safe
zones
now what safe zones are well let me
explain to you how editing video works
whenever someone makes a video using
After effect not a hundred percent of
the video gets produced when you export
the video there's a little bit of video
around the corner that gets kind of cut
out and this is due to the fact that not
all the video is the same and not
devices use recorded video is the same
so just be safe and to make sure that
all the video is going to record on your
TV or computer or wherever you're
watching it out the computer or After
Effects cuts out a little space around
the edge of the movie so if you have
something like a word or something on
the little edge that's getting cut out
that's why it's gonna happen now if
you're wondering alright how much of the
space it gets cut out and you can either
guess which way how much of the screen
you think is going to get cut out or you
can press the apostrophe key on your
keyboard
not the comma the apostrophe key and as
you see when I press it this a little
thing toggles up now you can see that
you have two safe zones the action safe
in the title safe the action safe
anything in this you're guaranteed that
it isn't gonna get cropped out so
whenever you want to make an effect you
want to make it on the whole screen but
just remember it's in some of the times
it's gonna get cut out right here and
the title safe is the area where you're
guaranteed that your title is going to
show so just to be safe make sure all
the effects you add are in the action
safe make sure all your title titles
sorry are in the title safe and this
will guarantee that you will have
a standard produced video no matter what
platform you're looking at it on now
another thing that I want to show you is
control is a control apostrophe brings
up the grid so hold down ctrl or command
if you're working on a Mac and press
apostrophe and as you can see this makes
a nice green grid on your thing and this
is very useful whenever you're working
with compositions or making effects when
you're like when you're working frame by
frame and you it's hard to remember what
your last one was and this grid just
comes in handy a lot so again that's
hold down control and press apostrophe
on your thing and that'll take care of
it for you and another thing that's
gonna come in handy if is if you hold
down control and press R and what this
is gonna do is bring up the ruler again
our for ruler that's an easy way you can
remember it and this is another way of
measuring exactly where your graphics
are and each of these numbers stand for
pixels just in case you want to know now
let me go ahead and move my video little
and I want to get rid of my ruler
actually and as you can see we have a
black background right now now the
trouble with this is anytime we're going
to be working with black letters or
making an effect that has black in it
this can be kind of hard to see
sometimes so anytime you're working with
black letters or a black effect you want
your color of your background to be
something else than black so if you ever
want to change your background go up to
composition go down guess what one it is
background color obviously and double
click this and you can pick the color of
your background just select the color
press ok as you can see we now have a
red background or whatever one you
didn't pick now if you're a native
Photoshop or anything like that
then you're probably used to the
background that's like a gray and white
checkerboard like whenever you delete
your background there so if you like
that and you're not used to working with
a solid color background
well Adobe did is incorporate that in
right here this is toggle transparency
grid and go ahead and press that and as
you can see you now have a transparent
and background that's what this white
and gray checkered board means it
doesn't show up on your thing
it just shows up as completely white so
again if you want to toggle that press
it again and you got your red background
just how you wanted it so now that we
have learned the very advanced parts of
the composition panel you're ready to
move on in the next tutorial so I hope
you enjoyed learning the more advanced
parts of this panel and make sure to
check out my next tutorial thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
