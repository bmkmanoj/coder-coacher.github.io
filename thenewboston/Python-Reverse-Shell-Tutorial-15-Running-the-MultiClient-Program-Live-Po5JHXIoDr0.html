this video we're gonna be testing out
the multi-threaded multi-client river
shell on a live server so I went ahead
and I already bought this server right
here and actually already uploaded
server Qi so let me go ahead and cut
that so you see I already uploaded it
looking beautiful so remember in order
to kick this off what we need to do is
we need around Python 3 server 2 I if
you just run Python then you're gonna
get errors because that's Python 2.7 so
python 3 server dot py and hit enter so
now right now we're in the interactive
show and it's also listening waiting for
clients to connect so I can just write
lists right here and we don't have any
clients connected yet so let's just go
ahead and start connecting them so make
sure that you change your IP address
right here and I'm just gonna go ahead
and run this right there so right now my
local computer the one I'm sitting at
right now has been connected one on a
255 so now if I run list again you can
see that that computer pops up right
there now I actually already put this on
a USB Drive
executable and I stuck it in my own
laptop in my living room so I'm gonna go
walk over to that I'm gonna start that
program on the laptop as well so one
second
alright alright even mates
looking good alright so you probably saw
this pop up when I was in the living
room connection established with 192 at
4289 not 12 and the reason this IP is
different is because I have my VPN
running on that laptop because well
because I don't trust anyone so now what
I can do is I can just type list again
and check it out so we now have two
targets or two clients me or the
computer
I'm sitting at right now and also this
one which is the laptop in my living
room so if I just go ahead and right
select 0 then that says we are now
connected to my computer and I can just
write like umm echo hey and echo tuna
and I can just move directory CV dot dot
and look at what happens so we can
verify that it works hey tuna any
command that we type runs on this
computer now I also want to show you
guys that if you ever want to just go
back and connect to another one just
right quit you know what that does is it
breaks the loop and if you're right list
and let me go ahead and write list
refresh that and what you should do is
you should actually um run it or just
wait a couple seconds and then run it
again
because once you quit out of a current
connection then it's going to try to
reconnect just the way that the program
is set up it does it all automatically
but now I can go ahead and select 0
because whenever we quit it disconnected
and connected again
so the laptop from my living room got
popped up to zero and this one's at one
now but anyways let's just select zero
and we are now connected to the laptop
in my living room so if I just really
like CD dot dot we see that all right so
what I did is I actually stuck this on a
USB Drive so if you guys are like oh
crap I wanted to be able to like to
access my
France computer but now I'm stuck in the
USB Drive that I gave them so of course
you can just run commands from here but
I mean how do we access their hard drive
well we were trying to do well all you
have to do is if you go to CD C : this
is going to change your drive so not
your directory but your drive so it's
gonna move us into the hard drive and
check it out so now if we do dir we are
now in my laptop their hard drive so I
can go to I don't know
CD users and now I can go dir and check
it out so the laptop has two users Kayla
don't ask me why the name of the
computers Kayla don't want to talk about
it and and yeah there you go so now you
can run whatever commands you want to
run and that is how you make a
multi-threaded multi-client reverse
shell in python
boom roasted lightly toasted
congratulations we are done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
