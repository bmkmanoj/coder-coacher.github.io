Illustrator cs6 tutorial and this one's
gonna be pretty cool I'm gonna show you
how to create outlines in your type so
that you're able to a belay your text
quickly and you can manipulate the
different letters easily so I'm going to
show you how to do that you can create
like these cool little fun with type
sets whatever they're called here all I
did was move each of these letters up
and down and this type of lettering or
the way it's set up is good for like kid
videos and you definitely get asked to
make those sometimes when you're out
doing professional work everything like
that so let me show you how to get to
that ready so let's delete this and then
I'm gonna go ahead and start typing
something out so go ahead and type
anything out I'm just gonna have what I
did last time
outlining the letters and I'm just gonna
make it bigger whoa easy Hoss okay and
that's big enough and let's get this
back where we want it to be okay and now
we're all set now this is actually
really easy and allows you then some
people expect it to be so just have you
select your font or select your text and
then go to type and then go to create
outlines oh that was easy as it can be
if you try to move it with the regular
selection tool you're just going to be
able to move let me grab part of this
letter you're gonna be able to move the
whole entire thing if you take your
direct selection tool though you can
grab individual letters
so I deselected and now I went in I can
grab these individual letters here and
move them around
I can also manipulate the the shapes of
the letters so if you want to try to
make your own font based off someone
else's that could be something cool so I
can manipulate these letters to all have
like little fangs coming off of them if
I wanted to make like creepy lettering
or something and that's pretty much how
you do that so you would just select
these and then when you have something
like the NI that has the two different
parts to it you're gonna have to select
both of them to move them at the same
time if you select just one part these
guys are hard to get right into the
middle one let me select just one part
if you just select one part if I can
ever select it geez well it'll just move
it around and then also when you create
outlines it makes compound paths and if
you ever need to release a compound path
just go ahead and click on your object
and then you go to object compound path
and then you you would go to release so
let me select it object compound path
and then you go to release and that'll
fill in the circles but if you ever
needed to do that you can you can select
these separate paths and delete them out
if you needed to a compound path is
pretty much two paths that make that
interact with each other
so what's happening here is there was a
regular black circle and then another
circular path here that cut out of that
regular black circle so that's pretty
much all I need to show you about
outlining letters you can use your paint
bucket and the on the letters you can
direct select you can edit them with
like an eraser tool or whatever so
that's what makes it good about creating
the outlines that you need so I think
that's all that you guys really need to
know about
so I'm gonna be moving on - I think it's
graphics yeah I'm gonna be working
moving on to graphics at the next set of
tutorials so be sure to stay with that
and it'll probably be about like
actually I don't really know how many
tutorials it's going to end up being but
I'll try to make it make them pretty
in-depth so that we can get a good grasp
on how to work with graphics because you
know everybody knows that's the main
part then you want to work with while
you're in Illustrator so thanks a lot
for watching the tutorials this far hope
you hopefully you enjoyed the type
section and now you've got a good base
for everything that you need to know
thanks a lot everybody in have a good
day thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
