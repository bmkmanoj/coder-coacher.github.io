tutorial just wanna fix a little noob
air instead of importing rectangle H
with a less than greater than signs if
the import it with a double quotes in
square H or else you're going to get a
error later on so now that you have that
fixed go ahead and in your main method
or whatever class you put your main
method and we can begin creating this
square object so make sure you import
square H not rectangle Asia anymore and
square go ahead and pointer to you can
nave your name your object anything you
want I'm going to name mine Steve
because I always like to name my object
people names again you Pro shine through
that because it's bad practice but you
know I like to do it so so I'm gonna do
so
square square give me some space so I
can use it so now what we can begin to
you they start using those methods from
square now here are two things you can
do remember you already import it set
width and height so set width and height
then you can do six and six or remember
we also created a method called set side
specifically to use in our square class
so what we're going to do is use that
side method remember this one right here
we pass it one value and it takes it and
it sets both the width and height that's
where we're going to do so set side
equal to six and you can only do that
with squares and now what we can do is
just give ourselves to prove that it
worked
we just log something on the screen as
an NS log and what are we gonna log just
write anything like one side is percent
I and of course this is going to be
equal to Steve
side and don't forget that the side
property we gave it whenever we created
our interface right here and all is
is it returns the width or height if you
put it it doesn't really matter so now
what we did for this object is we set
the side equal to six which in turn set
the width and height of a rectangle
equal to six which pretty much made a
square and we also just outputted one of
the sides width or how it didn't matter
they're both the same for a square so
now what we're going to do is we're
going to log NS log check this out it's
going to be pretty sweet area is percent
i perimeter is percent I understand all
right Bucky hold on I'm looking at a
square interface right here and we don't
have any methods for a perimeter and
area but wait my friend we inherited
from rectangle right here and remember
rectangle had these cool little formulas
or methods for area and perimeter so
since we inherited for those we
automatically can use them in our square
class so let's go ahead and take
advantage of that right now let's go
ahead and call Steve DUP calculate the
area for Steve and Steve also calculate
the let me make sure I suppose sorry PE
RI m et are close enough and calculate
the perimeter for Steve as well so let
me add a little comment right here
methods from inherited rectangle class
so after we're done calling all our
methods what we need to do is take our
object name Steve and release it we need
to give the memory back to our computer
because it was so kind to let us borrow
that I think it deserves it back so all
this looks good for now I probably
forgot a semicolon or something but just
go ahead and save everything and let's
see square undeclared so let me have
pause this and figure out why I'm
getting this mayor well well well this
is a quite embarrassing actually I
misspelled square let's see
oh yeah that's better than those felt
like squashy idiot bulky so let's go
ahead and save in a better run this time
there we go game time so what it did is
it said one side is six area is 36 in
areas length times width six times six
36 correct perimeter is 24 6 times 4 is
24
too easy so one last time what we did in
this tutorial we made an object named
Steve Steve the square we set one side
equal to 6 and what this did is pretty
much take the width and set it equal to
6 and take the height and set equal to 6
and then we just printed it out one of
the sides and then we said the area is
percent i perimeter is percent I then we
calculated the area and how did we do
this just with 6 times 6 and that's why
we got 36 then we calculated the
perimeter which pretty much 6 plus 6
which is 12 times 2 which is 24 and
that's why it gave us 36 and 24 right
there so what we learned to do is when
our boss tells us to create a new class
we first think all right can we inherit
anything from an old class who already
created to make our life easier
fortunately for this since I set it up
exactly that way we were in able to
inherit from the rectangle class and
then most of our methods were written
for us all we did is are a couple new
methods or wrote a couple new methods to
make our life a little bit easier since
squares are tidbit different so this is
the beauty of inheritance using someone
else's code and just adding stuff to it
to make it better and better so when
you're working with huge programs that's
pretty much what you do you take someone
else's code and add a little bit to it
and then sell it is your own oh yeah I
see where we're going with this
copyright infringement yes that's the
ultimate goal right here so that's it
for this tutorial again as always if you
want any of the source code I'm going to
post it all on my forum for free so go
