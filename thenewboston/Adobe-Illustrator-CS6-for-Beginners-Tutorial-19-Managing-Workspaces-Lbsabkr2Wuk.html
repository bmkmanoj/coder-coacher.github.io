buddy Blackford here another Illustrator
cs6 tutorial and this one's gonna be
pretty cool we're gonna learn how to
create and select new workspaces now
what a workspace is it's basically your
whole entire screen where things are
placed in this particular workspace
we've got the tools on the left we've
got our menu bar up here we've got our
control panel up here on the top and
we've got our different windows we got
our window bar over here on the right
but say you absolutely don't like this
setup at all well you're not stuck with
it you can always select a new ones and
that's what I'm going to show you how to
do in this tutorial so let's go ahead
and check out the different things we've
got so up here in this button up here we
it says essentials and this is what you
usually start on if you click on that
this these are all your different
workspaces now these workspaces here
that are already preset are ones that
are provided to you by Illustrator or
Adobe and they're did designed for these
types of working or this type of work
and it makes for some nice efficient
workflow so say I wanted to do some nice
color are some nice typing or make a
cool-looking typography or something
like that I'll click on that and now my
workspace is a little different we've
got over here on the right we've got
color swatches and they're all opened
already and I don't have to keep
clicking on everything we've got they
we've got just the things that work with
typography here and nothing else that we
really don't need so let's go to a
different one and check that out
this one's called layout now we've got
different types of things going on here
this one's for like Lang stuff out in
figuring out where things might want to
go and all that stuff so you could just
mess with all that stuff let's check out
one more let's check out painting all
right and now we've got paint
here and you can see some of these
they're basically kind of looking the
same but they've just got little minor
tweaks that help you work efficiently in
the in your workflow so let's go ahead
and go back to essentials and we want to
work and create our own little workspace
and it's gonna be a custom workspace
that we're gonna make for ourselves so
let's go ahead go to window and you can
pick anything that you want I'm going to
pick up graphic styles I'll move that
around move appearance over here let's
see if I can move my toolbar I want to
over here instead for some reason all
right now I've got these things sitting
around if I go to to this workspace up
thing up here where says essentials
we're gonna click on new workspace we
can now name this workspace only I'm at
crappy workspace you're not gonna want
to have something like this because then
when you when you click on the windows
here they're gonna pop up over top of
the year of your toolbar so this is just
showing you that you can do this I'm
gonna hit okay so okay crappy workspace
selected there let me go back this is
that's on essentials let's go to layout
layout brings it back if I go to crappy
workspace that's gonna bring it back to
there now it looks like I've messed with
the essentials by accident I didn't mean
to do that if I go to reset essentials
it's going to bring it back to what it
actually was before and I can still have
my crappy workspace and then if I go
back to essentials it's going to be
fixed so after you if you saw that all I
hit was reset essentials and has set it
back to what the default was for that
preset one
if you've been working with illustrator
before in cs5 or earlier you'll notice
that there's a couple that have been
here before but there's also a couple
new ones layout here is new and tracing
is a new one so I'll click on tracing
because we already saw it layout and you
can see the different things that we can
use there's something called image trace
here when you have an image up you can
use this to trace out some things that
are in within the image and create them
into a vector which is pretty cool and
it's been advancing lately in the
different illustrators now that we've
got our workspace I've got a workspace
up here called crappy workspace now what
if what happens if a client comes over
and you're working and that's your usual
workspace a your have any sees that it
says crappy workspace up there at the
top now that's not going to make you
look very professional so you might want
to change the name or delete it so let's
go ahead and fix that let's go to manage
workspaces click on crappy workspace you
can rename it here we'll name it awesome
workspace instead I can spell okay we
got that and if I hit OK
you can see it's now changed to awesome
workspace I can click on it again I can
delete it to get rid of it completely
and then it'll go back to my essentials
one here so that's all about using
workspaces and we know how to create
workspaces we know how to select new
ones and we know how to manage our
workspaces now so go ahead and use that
customize your AI interface Adobe
Illustrator and have some fun mess
around with it get used to it and make
something that works with your workflow
and what you're doing so you can work
quickly or quicker so have a good one
