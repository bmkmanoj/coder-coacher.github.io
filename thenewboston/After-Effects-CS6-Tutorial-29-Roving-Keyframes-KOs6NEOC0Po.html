awesome After Effects cs6 tutorial my
name is buddy Blackford and we're on the
new Boston's YouTube channel so this
time around we are going to learn about
roving keyframes and once I show you
this you're gonna probably crap your
pants actually not but you'll probably
be a little bit happy so let's start at
the tutorial and I'll explain what
roving keyframes do when sometimes I
created actually I created this this
animation and I added a decent amount of
keyframes all over the place
on purpose at different speeds and
everything you notice that it's going to
go slow down this motion path right here
and a little bit faster on this motion
path right there between keyframes I'll
show you what it looks like in a preview
real quick
so say you thought this was perfect and
your client decides to change his mind
and goes I think I want all these
keyframes to be the same speed I don't
want them to move at different speeds
anymore and you're like I'm and not
gonna go through and edit all these
keyframes again well you don't have to
so I'm going to show you by using roving
keyframes how you can smooth it out
so click on your graph editor here and
click on position and we'll hide the
these reference there so make sure
you're in the Edit speed graph now all
you got to do is select all of the
keyframes and right click on a keyframe
and click on a row of across time now
you can see that all the motion path is
all the same speed now and it changed in
the in the graph editor too to be all
one speed so I'll do a quick preview and
you can see it's all one speed there
now only properties that create motion
paths can be robed so things like Anchor
Point position and I think there's
something called effect point that I
haven't gone over yet
but just things like that that create
motion paths are the only things that
can be robed so just keep that in mind
now the way to make the keyframes so
they're not roving anymore and - so you
can like edit it edit them differently
you can right click I will select all
your frames or whatever whatever
keyframe that you want and right-click
on it and just uncheck the row of
crosstime now you can get your Bezier
handles and maybe move things around hit
control Z to get back on to roving
keyframes so let's make sure all these
are robed real quick
yep and I wanted to show you what
happens a few easy ease your keyframes
so let's use an easy ease at the end one
remember it's this button down here and
then the beginning one you can see how
it creates like a nice arc there and
I'll play it for you it's gonna
accelerate and then decelerate it makes
it a pretty pretty nice smooth motion
and a lot of times a client will be
happy with a motion like this I mean I'm
not like all jaggedy and stuff like that
but how it is nice and smooth so so
that's it for roving keyframes hopefully
it's a huge time-saver for you guys a
lot of times clients change their minds
and it does get really annoying when
that happens because sometimes they
don't realize how long it takes to do
something and I mean frankly they don't
care so you just gotta do your job and
be prepared for change like that and by
knowing these kind of tips you can save
yourself a lot of time so see you guys
later on the next tutorial have a good
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
