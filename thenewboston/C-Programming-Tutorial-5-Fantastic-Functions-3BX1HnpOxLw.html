and welcome back to your fifth C++
tutorial in this tutorial we're going to
be going over something called functions
now there are two really main types of
functions the first type is functions
that we write we create ourselves and
we're going to be talking about those
you know in a couple tutorials from now
but in this is oral what I want to talk
about is functions that are already
built in to C++ that we can use so with
that being said let's go ahead and you
know start writing some code go ahead
and make a variable double a and I know
that you guys are used to int but I'm
going to switch to double double is
pretty much real numbers they allow you
unlike integers we are now allowed to
use decimal points like eighty seven
point two and you know it doesn't have
to be just whole integers like int we
can now use you know decimal points as
the main thing you have to worry about
so anyways start using double instead of
int because you'll see later on so now
that we have a blank variable called a
let's go ahead and take that and set it
equal to this sq RT and write two
parentheses and in those parentheses
right any number you want like 154
pretty cool huh
so we're saying all right what the heck
is that squirt 154 WTF mofo know what
this is is the square root function this
is already built into C++ and what it
does is it takes the number 154 gets the
square root of it and stores it in the
value of a or excuse me in the variable
a so now we can just go ahead and output
that on the screen and it should print
out whatever that value is the square
root of 154 which should be like 12
point something so let's go ahead and do
this and we're going to get an error and
I'll tell you why we get an error right
here and I know you guys can't see the
error mess
then or excuse me the error message but
it says square root undeclared first
using this function this is because
whenever our program came across this sq
RT it didn't know what the heck we were
trying to do it what's it like are you
trying to set a equal to the letters s Q
R T and then a parenthesis and what the
heck are you trying to do here that's
because we need to include something
called a function header now the header
file lets C++ know what s QR t is and
lets it know that it's actual an actual
function and we're not trying to set
equal to T you know just some random
letters and in order to do that we need
to do this include C math and once we
include C math this gives us access to
all the mathematical functions we can
use so now that this is included in our
program whenever we come across this
line of code right here it knows that
it's not just for random letters and
some parentheses it knows that this is a
mathematical function and it's to be
treated as such so now if we go ahead
and run this we're going to get an
actual program twelve point four oh nine
seven hmm have to remember that so what
it did is that this it took 154 found
the square root of it and stored it in
the variable a and then we just printed
out a now for your terminology whenever
you use a function
it's called calling a function so
whenever I'm talking I say alright let's
go ahead and call this you know I don't
mean I got my cell phone or anything I
mean let's go ahead and use this I'll
probably use them interchangeably so you
know just bear with me here but that's
the technical term so if you ever you
know interviewing for a job say call a
function whenever you take that value
whatever value you get back in this case
twelve point four oh nine seven I
remembered it I think it's called its
return value so 154 is the number you
want to figure out what the square root
of but twelve point four that's the
return value that's the value we store
it in a so again
calling function return value the less a
couple things we need to go over is this
number you put inside the parentheses
this is called the parameter now a
parameter is any information that the
function needs in order to work so you
know it needs a number to be Square
rooted so we passed it in 154 and
throwing a number in there it's called
passing in a number and again that it's
called the parameter or passing in a
value you know once I use it in context
you guys we'll see you later on they're
kind of like the same thing so now that
we got all the terminology down let's go
ahead and let's go ahead and make
another program actually so you need to
include this anytime you use the square
root function and that's not only square
root function you get another set of
functions you know built-in with this by
the way I don't know if I said this
already but this include iostream this
allows us to use the you know CNC out
functions method I mean not methods
that's from another computer language
that I've been use them by anyways
enough for Miriam rambling let's go
ahead and create another program so
let's go ahead and make another double
number and also double answer and let's
go ahead and allow the user to enter a
number and then we will calculate the
square root of that and then print it
out for them so how do we make the user
enter information CN and then whatever
number they enter is going to be stored
in the variable number and now let's go
ahead and take that number find the
square root of it and store it in the
variable answer so answer equals s qrt
of number so whatever number they
entered we're going to get the square
root of it and that's the return value
the answer and we're going to store that
return value in our variable answer so
now all I have to do is print out answer
C out answer and
go ahead and that line so now this
should work as long as I didn't spill
anything around so let's go ahead and
enter you know 54 press enter the square
root that is seven point three four
eight four seven handy bit of
information you might want to hold on
the bed so that was a breathtaking
tutorial I hope you guys enjoyed that so
that's pretty much the basics of
everything we learned so far variable C
and C ow
and also pre-built functions so again
what function is pretty much a built in
I don't know you guys can see for
yourself it performs an equation or it
does something else for you
automatically saves you a lot of trouble
so these are ways you can use built-in
functions in C++ and in the upcoming
tutorials like I said there are also
ways we can create our very own
functions which is a lot more fun
actually so that's what you guys had to
look forward to in the next couple
tutorials and also hearing my beautiful
voice so don't forget you have to have
that to look forward to and you know
what else you have to look forward to
all this source code for you guys for

sign up leave me a couple messages tell
me how awesome I am and go ahead and get
it for free so anyways thank you guys
for watching don't forget subscribe and
I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
