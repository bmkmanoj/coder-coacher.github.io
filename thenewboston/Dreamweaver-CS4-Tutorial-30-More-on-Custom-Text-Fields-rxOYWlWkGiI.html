from the custom validation tutorial
there was one thing that I forgot to let
you guys know and that is about hints
for example if if you want to let your
user know what format you have set then
you can create a hint and let's go back
to custom and let's say we create a
pattern that is actually let's do this
let's say email inside the hint we can
say username at your dough mein kaam and
we save that and we run it and this will
pop up inside of the text field as soon
as the page loads and then when you
click inside a el disappear so hints or
good way to let your users know what
they're going to be entering and what s
exactly the the format that they're
going to be entering that in sorry I
forgot to include that in the last
tutorial but hopefully hopefully you
guys understand everything that's going
on inside of the spry text field
validation definitely the the one with
the most content in it and as we
continue to check out all of the other
spry validations you will definitely
find it super easy compared to compared
to the sprite text field because this
prior text field is definitely a
definitely the most involved validation
so I look forward to teaching the rest
of this for you to you guys after we get
done with checking out all this fri
validation we are going to be looking at
some more even cooler stuff that we can
do with these spry elements so i
continue to watch and i will
you teach you about spry validation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
