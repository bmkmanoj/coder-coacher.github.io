tutorial and in this tutorial I'm gonna
be building some windows and doors so
let's go ahead and make a door first and
foremost and in order to do that we're
just gonna have to grab a red voter
brush and adjust the sizes of it so
these sizes will not do so let's go
ahead and fit the length of the door we
can see in our bottom left the length is
gonna be the x-axis so let's go ahead
and make that let me say 256 that looks
good right there and for the Y the Y as
we can see in the bottom left is gonna
be the width of the wall so if you
forgot the width of the wall is 32 and
we can verify that by going down here
and measuring the width of one of these
walls which is indeed 32 we can also see
that each grid space is 8 in the bottom
right so 8 times 4 grid spaces is 32 but
nonetheless the brush size of Y needs to
be 32 now for Z the Z is actually the
height so let's go ahead and give this
something like 320 because we want it to
be taller than it is wide because doors
are usually taller than they are wide so
256 32 320 let's go ahead and build this
and now our red boat a brush we just
need to move that into place so our best
bet is probably our top view if we move
out here we'll go ahead and grab our red
builder brush and move that into place
right here and probably the best way we
could get it even up is in our side view
in the top right here so we already know
that these two lines in our front porch
we can use to align it so let's first
and foremost bring this down so sits
right on top of that floor and also if
we can see it isn't lined up exactly in
the center if we move over one space we
can see we got one full block to the
left one full block to the right and is
perfectly Center we can also do this
measure to the first inside of the wall
which is 352 and then also on this side
should be 352 as well which it is
know that this door is centered it also
is sitting on top and also as we can see
in our top view it cuts out exactly in
the middle of the wall so now that it's
positioned correctly let's go ahead and
hit CSG subtract and if we go ahead and
look in our perspective view it took a
nice chunk out of the wall exactly where
we would want a door to go pretty cool
huh
so now what we need to do now that we
have the door cut out we need to do the
exact same thing what we need to do it
for windows instead so in order to do
that let's go ahead and change this to
what change this leave that at 256 we'll
change the Z to 256 as well and remember
the width of the walls are 32 all the
way around so we'll go ahead and leave
that just like that
now as you can see first and foremost
we're probably going to notice one thing
I'm gonna be adding a window to this
wall right here
and this wall right here so in order to
do that the first thing I need to do is
grab my red boat or brush and rotate it
now in order to rotate this 90 degrees
let's go ahead up here to your rotation
mode and we're gonna want to rotate it
along the z-axis so go along and you can
either do that in your perspective view
or in the top view the top view is
probably a little bit easier just go and
drag this until it says 90 degrees and
let go now let's go ahead back in our
translation mode that means pretty much
move it around and working in our top
views though go ahead and position this
wherever you want it it really doesn't
matter where exactly your honor you
don't I could Center it if I want to but
if we Center everything is just gonna
look stupid I mean let's give us some
flavor
let's not Center exactly perfect
that looks like a pretty good so let's
see
it's about 224 away from that
and 400 something away from there so I
just wanted to verify that it was not
centered however what we do need to do
is as we can see in this front view it's
kind of sitting a little low so I'm
gonna go ahead and pull this up a little
bit and I would say a window probably is
right around there so that looks like
this window is positioned pretty good I
mean and I want to mention this too
before I go on since this is set to my
side view and this is set to my front
view it's kind of backwards because this
is the front of my house right here
but it's the side view according to UDK
in this front view according the UDK is
kind of the side view of my house now
what you can do is you can go ahead and
change the viewport type but I kind of
like to leave them a defaults you can
obviously obviously see that this is the
front of my house even though the
viewport type is the side view I mean it
doesn't really matter so go ahead and
make sure your window is positioned
exactly where you want it and in the
perspective view you can go ahead and
zoom inside your house and now when you
go ahead and hit CSG subtract you get a
nice little window cut out so we need to
do that exact same thing on the other
side of the house so go ahead and your
top view grab that red builder brush and
just go ahead and push that all the way
to the other wall and zoom in to make
sure you are cutting out the exact wall
and go ahead and hit history subtract on
that and it should have cut that out too
so if we were to go ahead inside this
house we can indeed see that we have two
windows cut out now let me go ahead and
zoom out a little bit a door a window
and another window
pretty cool huh so what we can do now is
actually go ahead and play this level by
right-clicking and hit play from here
but as you notice it says the lighting
needs to be rebuilt and paths need to be
rebuilt so go ahead and hit escape
that'll take you out of your game and in
order to rebuild just go ahead and
rebuild all which is right here again
this is build geometry only but the
build all key is the little geometry
with the light let's go
and hit that and it's probably going to
take like 10 seconds or something so
while this is waiting what do you guys
want to talk about nothing
okay I'll just sit here in silence then
okay there you go
so go ahead and hit close and now that
everything's built nicely we can go
ahead and right-click it and hit play
from here and now check it out first
thing you wanted to do is make sure that
your door is big enough where your
character can walk through so go ahead
and walk through this a couple times and
now I guess you can just check
everything out maybe shoot through your
window shoot through your door and if
you want to you can just go ahead and
fall off the edge of your house oh so
that is our basics of how to make a
simple house again don't forget to save
this and save selected and that's the
basics of how you make doors and windows
for your house so thank you guys for
watching and I'll see you guys in the
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
