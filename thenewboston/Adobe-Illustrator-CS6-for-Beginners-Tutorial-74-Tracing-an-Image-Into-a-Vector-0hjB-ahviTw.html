Ella straighter ca6 tutorial and in this
tutorial is gonna be pretty sweet and I
think you guys are gonna like it a lot
we're gonna learn how to use the image
tracer to trace raster graphics and what
it does is it takes our raster image
something like a JPEG a tiff or a PSD
file and it'll take a look at it analyze
it and then create a vector out of it
for you so you can take an image like
this like these ducks flying around and
change it into a vector that looks like
this
and I'll show you how to do that and all
this right here is a vector created by
image tracing from this image right here
so let's go ahead and start out and
figure out what we can do so I'm gonna
back up a few times and see if I can get
back to where I was where I didn't have
anything okay so I I've got this image
open so I went to file open and I just
picked the image here and I picked ducks
in a in a sky in the sky and I picked
this because it'd be easiest to show you
and one of the faster analyzing at this
because when you do the image trace it
takes a little bit so the background is
basically all the same color a blue sky
it definitely has different variations
but it's no not a whole lot of hard
color changes so I did that for that and
then you also picked these ducks because
they have different shades of colors
within them and also have very
contrasting colors on them as well such
as the oranges and greens and I wanted
to show you how well that the image
trace could work on this so we're gonna
do is make sure you have your restaurant
selected and then right here where says
image trace we're gonna start out with
the presets go over here to the right
and click on here on the tracing presets
and then we've got a bunch of a bunch of
them here that we can check out I'm
gonna do low fit
a photo right now and then this will pop
up
tracing may proceed slowly with this
large image would you like to continue
and and then it says annul here to
reduce the image size restaurant a lower
resolution using object rasterize so I'm
going to show you that real quick and
cancel and then we're gonna go to object
and we're gonna go to rasterize which is
up here in the middle and then what they
want me to do is change the resolution
so they wanted me to do something like
put it down to 72 PPI you could do that
if you wanted to but it doesn't really
take a whole lot of time to image trace
this so I'm just gonna cancel and leave
it at what it is by the way PPI is
pixels per inch
alright let's go - oh yeah what's image
trace this again I'm just gonna click
that low fidelity photo for now and I'm
gonna okay and then a status progress
bar is going to start coming up and it's
gonna look at what's going on and
analyze it and then start applying
different effects to the image and use
those effects to make it easier to image
trace and then it's going to create the
paths and add the coloring in there for
you so we're gonna let this progress bar
go up across the last time I did this it
actually went a little bit faster I'm
getting the spinning wheel of death here
and then the taps is not responding so
I'm gonna end up I'm just gonna pause
this and then when it's all getting
close to done I'll unpause it so it
pretty much picked up immediately after
and then um now it's doing its smoothing
and it was creating paths and now it's
smoothing out the paths so we don't have
a lot of points and this is one of the
most sought after methods in this
in Illustrator so here we go we've got
our different our different paths if I
go up here to view we're able to see our
different views so we've got tracing
with outlines so it traced all the birds
and even this time it tried to outline
the sky and add variation color to the
sky we've got our outline so we can see
where all the paths are there's a whole
lot of them it made that's why it took a
little bit of a long time outlines with
our source image so this is what we
started out with and this is really used
and then we've got a source image and so
we went from this to this just using the
low fidelity photo now I'm going to go
back and I'm gonna do another in a
different image trace this time using
something else so you can see a little
bit different I'm gonna go to this one
this is sketched art and I'm just gonna
go ahead and hit OK
and then I'm gonna while this is doing
its thing I'm just gonna hit pause and
I'm gonna show you the end result so
this is the end result for this one and
you can see you've got kind of an
artistic look going on here and let's
check out the outlines here's what we've
got for the outlines it's missing some
of the pieces of the duck so unless I
was going for some kind of look like
this where where I wanted a black and
white then I would use this but
obviously not for trying to like portray
the colors and everything like that that
I was talking about earlier obviously
this wasn't the type that I wanted and
if I wanted to really preserve the
colors and stuff like that I would go
with let me back up I would go with
something like high fidelity photo but I
wanted to take forever when I'm showing
you guys so that's a yeah now I know
that I think about that's pretty much it
for this part of the tutorial we'll end
here and then we'll keep on going and
learning more about the about the
image trace and how we can refine it in
everything like that to our likings that
way we aren't just stuck with the
presets but we can use other things as
well to help finely tune and make our
illustrator product a lot better so
thanks for watching and stay tuned for
the next tutorial
about image tracing see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
