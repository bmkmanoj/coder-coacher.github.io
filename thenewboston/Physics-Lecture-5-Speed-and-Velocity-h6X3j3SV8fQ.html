fifth physics tutorial in in this lesson
I want to clear up some terminology that
I've been meaning to do so for some time
but I just haven't gotten to it and in
this tutorial we're not going to be
crunching a whole lot of numbers but
we're going to be learning some new
vocab now the first thing I want to talk
about is the difference between velocity
and speed so velocity well before I talk
about velocity I think it's better that
we understand speed first the speed of
anything as we already know is basically
how fast is that object moving is a car
moving five miles per hour or can you
throw a baseball 90 meters per second so
basically speed is how fast something's
moving but didn't you hear people
talking about velocity before and it
sounded a lot like speed well it's true
velocity and speed are related in some
sense but the technical definition for
velocity and whenever we write velocity
in formulas we use a lowercase V the
definition for velocity is speed plus a
direction so let's go ahead and take a
look at what would be a speed and what
would be a velocity whenever we would
want to give someone the velocity of
something we would first need a speed so
let's go ahead and steal this one five
miles per hour and if someone was giving
us the term five miles per hour that
would be a speed but if someone said
okay a car was traveling at five miles
per hour and it was heading south then
since you have these two components of
velocity speed which is five miles per
hour and direction which is south this
would be equal to velocity so remember
that whenever you have velocity you need
two key components not only speed but
you also need what point it to their own
thing speed and direction so that is
basically velocity again just remember
that velocity is like speed plus a
little bit so now that we understand the
difference between velocity and speed I
want to talk to you guys about another
term that people get confused a lot and
that's displacement and direction so
displacement let me go ahead and write
you guys the definition first and
writing on rung layer great displacement
this is technically defined as distance
plus direction so remember that that's
the key to this lesson right here so
what do I mean by distance in direction
what the heck does that mean well say we
have a distance say where I don't know
pushing some Tory cars around on the
floor and we move the toy car a distance
of 8 inches well that would be the
distance 8 inches but now in order to
get the displacement we need to know
what direction we moved it in and say we
moved it not only 8 inches but we also
moved it west so this was the original
starting point for the toy car and we
moved the 8 inches to the west so there
you go this would be displacement so
again distance and displacement are
related but displacement is basically
distance with the direction similar to
the idea that whenever we're talking
about velocity and speed velocity is
speed with a direction so basically
these terms are just I don't know the
old terms plus a direction now that's
easy enough to understand but physicists
had to make things a little more
complicated so what they decided to do
is they decided to break up these terms
into something called scalar SCAL R and
vector V ec t o are quantities now the
easiest way that you can remember this
is is basically this whenever you have a
scalar quantity you're talking about one
thing and whenever you have a vector
quantity you're talking about two things
typically the size of something and the
direction where it's moving so for
example we already know that speed is
scalar
and the vector quantity would be
velocity so speed only has a magnitude
but velocity has a magnitude such as
five miles per hour and a direction such
as South now for displacement in
distance we can say things like distance
is scalar because we can have a distance
of I don't know 48 inches but the vector
quantity of that would be displacement
and the reason behind this is because
displacement not only has a distance
such as 48 inches but you need to give a
direction such as north east south and
west so some other things that are
scalar and vector time for example would
be scalar because you can't say on two
hours east that doesn't make sense and
again even think of some vector ones
right now but later on we're going to be
talking about vector and scalar
quantities and that's what I'm going to
refer to whenever I say that speed is a
scalar quantity or displacement is a
vector quantity just remember that
whenever you're working with
displacement or if you're taking a test
and your teachers going to ask for
velocity or displacement make sure not
only you give them a quantity such as
five miles per hour but you also include
the direction which is north east or
whatever they're asking for in the
problem so there you go there you have
it that is the difference between
velocity and speed and also distance in
displacement so thank you guys for
watching I'm going to subscribe and I'll
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
