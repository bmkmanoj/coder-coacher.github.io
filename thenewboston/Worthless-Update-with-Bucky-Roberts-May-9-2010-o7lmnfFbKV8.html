another video um I'd say didn't make
another video because I hadn't done it
in a while and I thought you guys might
want to update on my channel or blog or
stuff like that actually the real reason
I'm making this video is because I have
to go grocery shopping right now because
I only have one box of macaroni and
cheese in my kitchen and I'm thinking of
excuses to distract me from going
grocery shopping so I told myself in my
head they need a video so you know after
this I'm going to find another excuse
proudly and just go hungry for about a
week but anyways for my channel not a
lot of updates except a huge one
starting next month I'm gonna go
starting to look for bands around the
North Carolina specifically Raleigh area
and since i got like sweet camera gear
now i'm gonna start making music videos
for them and I'm gonna start promoting
them and pretty much just giving me
something film I think it would be cool
to make music video so I'm gonna you
know make direct a couple of music
videos for Baines around here and put
them on my channel and you know we'll
see how that goes get their music online
get them noticed so that'll give me
something to do with my camcorder so you
know if you guys are into a looking for
some bands or looking for some new music
I'm gonna have some here for it shortly
aside from that on my pole totally
different I just put new or excuse me on
my blog I just put a new poll up and
this is to you know all the debates
going on I put every browser listed and
what I want you guys to do is go to my
blog and vote what browser is the best
right now it's pretty much between
chrome and firefox so you know there's
high debate among which one of those is
the best so if you go to my blog on my
pole you can vote which browser is best
and we will settle this once and for all
um let's see other than that I sold all
my xbox games not that you guys care
about that at all um if anyone has NHL
10
or dragon age origins for the 360 I will
buy them from you because I want those
games I don't want by noon but um if you
have NHL 10 or dragon age origins let me
know how much you want for him and I
just sent me a message or something and
maybe I can buy them for me because I
really want those games um Oh speak in
the games I found this sweet game on my
ipod is called on if we could come on
focus focus it's called haipai kingdom
look at that depth of field right there
in my face nice haipai kingdom it is a
sweet game it's kind of like treyvion
arm I would definitely recommend getting
this i'm addicted to this now so this is
what I'm doing in all my free time so
you know in case you guys are looking
for a cool ipod or iphone game get this
and while i'm asking you guys stuff if
you guys saw UFC last night you saw that
shogun finally beat Machida uh should I
take this right now I'm in the middle of
a video and she's calling me really but
hey ah you get my text
what like around ten gravity or
something like that all right well you
just want to let me know why not because
he said he needs it for tomorrow or
something so one just let me know when
you get off and i'll come over and come
pick it up all right I'll talk to you
later right so if you saw the you have
seat by you last night you probably saw
that Shogun be Machida um I mean I guess
because it was the main event so here's
what I'm asking who do you think that
Shogun should fight next um pretty much
it's between Rashad or rampage just
pretty much too he's gonna fight but I
think that he should fight anderson
silva because I mean why not so if you
agree with me let me know if not let me
know who you think that a show going to
fight next and last but not least um
I've gotten a lot of requests to make
another question to answer video so if
you have any questions or answers for me
maybe you have some answers for me by
anyways if you have any questions for me
leave them for a question on this video
and i will look at this video and i will
answer and probably maybe i'll do the
weekly thing like weekly question and
answers with Bucky Roberts um I guess
mostly it would be answers for me though
I wouldn't be asking you guys a lot of
questions although i did in this video
but anyways um if you have any questions
for me about computer stuff or you know
anything like that let me know and i'll
try to answer them for you so that's all
i have for you guys for this video sorry
i didn't talk about anything important
but you know I don't usually do anyway
so you know why would you be expecting
that but anyways think gosh Washington
don't forget to leave your questions um
don't forget to a vote on my blog what's
your favorite browser is if you have NHL
10 or dragon age for 360 let me know um
tell me who you think Shogun trip by
next and leave me a question and that's
all I ask for you guys so thank you and
I will see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
