pugging tutorial in this video what I'm
talking about is now we want to put text
on the screen so right now this is a
pretty silly game because the user is
playing it their planet they're having a
really good time
no massage I just happened you know they
don't even really know what even
happened to them before they know what
the game is shut down so that's not
really the best way to go about it we
want to have some sort of communication
with our user now a lot of times you
grab like many screens to it before they
start the game you'll have a menu screen
and maybe when they level up there's a
menu screen maybe there's a pause screen
well guys it's up sometimes you really
need to use language to communicate with
your user or gamer in this case so what
we want to do is we want to be able to
put some text on the screen so how do we
do that
well first of all I always think it's a
good idea to just go ahead and make a
function that communicates with the user
in whatever ways so if you're it doesn't
matter if you're making windows and tea
cancer or you're making games in PI game
if you want to send a message to the
user a lot of times I think is best to
have like a function that just you pass
some text through and it displays that
text to the user so that's what we're
going to do here so come down here and
I'm going to say define we're gonna call
this function message underscore to
underscore screen and I'll just leave it
that way for now and then the parameters
that we're going to pass through here
are message so I'm as chief short for
message and then the color of that
message what color is that message so if
it's like you died or a very bad message
maybe want to display that in red it's a
positive message maybe in green or blue
or something like that and then if it's
just like some info basic information
maybe black or something like that so
that's why we want to have both the
message and the color and we have
message there just so every time we
don't have to specify a new message or a
new function per message or something so
message to screen message color and what
do we want this function to actually do
so first this function is going to
define screen underscore text and that's
going to be just the text that
we want to eventually put on the screen
and this is going to be font dot render
and we're going to render message true
for anti-aliasing and then color so what
do we want to do we want to render that
whatever the message happens to be just
no true for now and then what color do
we want that to be now font does not
exist we don't have a font object and we
have not initialized upon object or
anything like that so we need a font
object so to get our font object we're
just going to say font equals PI game
dot font dot and then we're just going
to use this font for now well we'll talk
about aesthetics like way down the road
but for now we'll just use this font and
we'll say none and then 25 and for now
just focus on the 25 that is going to be
the size so this is font size 25 now
later on as well we'll define multiple
fonts this would be a small font as
you'll see very soon 25 maybe sounds
large but for a game that's kind of
small font so message the screen now
we've got that done so this will return
a font object basically to the variable
name font so we've done that we've
rendered the font now just like
everything else though we have not
actually like put that font anywhere
we've only rendered the idea of the font
right so now we actually have to put
that font somewhere and we're gonna say
game display dot blitt and this is
basically putting the font on top of our
game display screen underscore text and
then we have to say where do we want
that like where we want the x and y of
this text to be and in my opinion the
best way to do this is you do the same
thing we did for like this x and y right
gain width divided by 2 and game height
divided by 2 so or what it was a display
width so display width divided by 2
comma display
height divided by two and these are in
brackets okay so this is like a Python
list here so so that's how we blip that
to the screen as basically all we have
to do um there then all this is done so
far is this just defined the function
and defined and created this font object
now we want to use it so we have game
exit equals true again we'll have a
better game exit sequence soon enough
but for now we're kind of just using
game exit and exiting this while loop
and then exiting the game so probably
the best place to put this this message
here would be right here before the quit
because we've quit right so game exit
equals true sends them here so now we
should at least notify the user as to
like hey by the way you lose you suck
and you were just going to shut down the
game on you because you just are not
good so we're going to do that here so
we're going to say message underscore to
underscore screen so we're referencing
this function we made right up here and
so message to screen and the message of
the screen we want to send so the actual
message is just you lose and we're going
to do this in red I believe we did to
find red a long time ago but let me make
sure yes so we do have red back to the
bomb you lose red done now what do we
need to do besides just this first of
all this message will only display for
like a millisecond before the quit is
called so we'll never actually see that
message if there wasn't some sort of
sleeping function or call to action from
the user so eventually we'll have a call
to action from the user like you lose
and then quit or play again right that's
the way it usually is
so we'll eventually get there but for
now we just have you lose and we're
shutting down the game so what we want
to do for now we'll just make a sort of
pseudo forced wait here so we're an
import time and then we'll come down to
the very bottom again and we'll just put
time dot sleep two seconds again
this isn't really inherent to pygame
generally you will never use time got
sleep and pygame if you're using time
about sleeping pygame you're either
trying to force the user to wait for X
amount of time it's a very happy thing
to add into by PI game I do it all the
time I Adam sleeps here and there but in
general it's probably a bad idea any
time you're using sleep but for now I
just want to show you guys the text
coming on the screen and not waste too
much time making like some sort of menu
that I'd we're not going to use so we'll
just use sleep for now so the question
I'm going to ask you guys is is this
going to show up on screen so we do this
and we run over and we see we wait a
couple of seconds and that exits why
didn't it show up on the screen same
answer as always we don't have a PI game
dot display update so we do have to add
that and the reason why I wanted to wait
before we added that is so people don't
get too confused with blitz so first we
rendered the font then we have to blitt
the font then we have to display update
and that will show us the font so now
we'll run this move this over here
and get off the screen and now we see
our nice little up you lose statement so
that's that
so um go outside that's a better one I
like that one
yeah I should go outside anyway that's
it with this tutorial I hope you guys
enjoyed as always thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
