seventh video and in this video we are
finally going to be testing out probably
the best browser ever created in the
history of history Buckey browser how
awesome is that so go ahead and run your
program and hopefully if we don't get
any errors all right it's looking good
so far it actually ran so it says enter
a URL ha so make sure that you just
don't enter you know like again like in
Google Chrome you can just go ahead and
type google.com but this one you know
sense is a little more sophisticated you
need to enter the full URL so HTTP
Google com hit enter and oh my god I'm
going to go ahead and expand this window
because you know this is just too good
so once we go to google.com type that in
the address bar check it out Google now
displays now since this is you know I
was kind of exaggerating when I said
best browser ever this is actually a
very simple browser is the main
programming only took like 50 lines of
code so of course we aren't going to get
all the cool features a lot of images
aren't going to display and a lot of you
know links might not be underlined or
properly formatted but the point is it
does indeed work and you know it is
doing this job even though it might not
be html5 compatible the browser is
indeed working so now let's just go
ahead and test that one more page to
prove you guys that actually works HTTP
the new Boston or probably the best web
page ever and now check it out oh yeah
this web page of course like I said
since this web page is built in you know
html5 and css3 a lot of the cool
features aren't going to be you know all
there but the cool thing is that this
web browser is a working web browser
even though it's probably the crappiest
one ever built bucky browser is now you
know ready for the market so the last
thing i want to show you guys before i
let you guys go is remember in this
try-catch statement i said you know if
you don't enter a valid URL then what
it's going to do is just going to print
out crap in your little console here let
me go ahead and show you guys right
right now
so if you go to like H um well actually
if you don't even include the full URL
and you just try to go to something like
youtube.com and press ENTER you see how
it didn't go to youtube.com and instead
it outputted crap right there that's
what I was talking about when I said if
you don't enter the full URL which is
the URL with the HTTP and all that crap
that's what's going to happen so again
guys check it out
sit back pat yourself on the back you
now made a web browser in Java even
though is really simple and well even
though it was really simple we did learn
about a lot about networking learn a lot
about you know hyperlink listeners in a
bunch of good stuff so just to give you
guys a preview of what's coming up if
you are like a super pro in java
networking you probably look at these
last two applications where the first
one was like a very simple demonstration
of beginning networking and the second
one is like a really crappy web browser
you guys are going to look at this and
be like you know what these weren't even
really networking apps because
networking in Java has to do with like
sockets and streams and all that good
stuff well for you guys you are in luck
because in the next couple of videos and
it's probably going to take like 20
videos I'm going to be showing you guys
how to build a full-fledged chatroom
where you have a client it's connected
to a real server and it's going to be
true Java networking so that's what you
have to look forward to but for now guys
I guess you're just going to have to
deal with this browser Buckey browser
you can make it 2.0 if you want but here
you go so anyways thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and guys
in the next videos I'll be seeing you
making the chatroom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
