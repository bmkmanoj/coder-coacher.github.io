tutorial and CSS last time we went over
some special types of selectors and this
time I just want to tell you a little
bit on how descendant selectors actually
work so what this means right here is
that it's going to apply the color red
to any h3 element which is a third
heading that is inside a div tag and
this applies it no matter how it's
related to div tag for example it can be
the child or the great grandchild or the
great-great grandchild as long as it
appears somewhere in the div tag for
example you saw that once it was applied
directly in the div tag it worked but
what if it was applied a few layers down
so let's say we have our div tag opening
div tag right here and our closing on
right here now as you already know if
you put the heading three right here
then it'll appear red but what if we had
a paragraph and the closing paragraph
right here and we had the heading three
right here this is text
and we close it off now what we have is
called an ancestral or relationship so
let's just see if this works right now
go ahead and save your document and pop
up a web browser and as you can see it
still appeared red this is because as
long as it appears somewhere in the div
tag then it'll appear that color now let
me talk to you guys a little bit about
ancestors and what I'm actually talking
about as you see you have a div tag a
paragraph tag and a heading 3 tag the
div tag in this case is the parent of
the paragraph tags and is the
grandparent of the heading 3 tags and
the heading 3 tags is the child of the
paragraph tags and the paragraph tags is
a child of the div tags this is when
webmasters talk about their relationship
to their tags and this is what they're
talking about
any tag that appears directly inside
another is called the child and any tag
that appears two layers down from
another is called the grandchild and
when you're working with descendant
selectors it doesn't matter how many
let's see
age is down I guess it is as long as it
appears somewhere inside the main parent
tag then you'll have a working
descendant selector
so next time we're gonna go over some
more specific selectors and if you
missed anything I went over today or I
want more clarification on how ancestors
are related according tags you can go to
my website the new Boston comm I know
how I'll have a better description of
everything we went over today thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
