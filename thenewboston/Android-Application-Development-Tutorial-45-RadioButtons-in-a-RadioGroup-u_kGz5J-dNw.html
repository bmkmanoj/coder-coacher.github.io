tutorial for the new Boston what we're
going to be doing in this tutorial is
basically setting up our other XML
layout called send and if you guys
didn't like that last tutorial where we
did relative layout I'm totally with you
guys because I hate relative layout I
learned on linear layouts and it's
pretty simple you can get pretty much
the same result so we're going to work
with a linear layout within this one so
what we need to do or what we're gonna
do for the most part is set of text
again we are going to get into too much
detail I just wanted to introduce you
guys something called radio buttons and
radio group but so we're going to say
inner text and then we're going to
scroll through our form widgets and
there should be a there's radio button
Pat towards the bottom of the list there
should be something called radio group
and basically we're going to drag and
drop that in there as you can see this
is radio groups a radio group for the
most part then we're going to go up go
into the XML and copy well actually
we're just going to work with three
buttons because that's going to be
easier to work with in Java we won't
have to reference as much and it won't
be as boring but basically what a radio
group is is it's a group of these
buttons radio buttons when one of these
buttons is pressed whatever other button
like for example if I press this here
this one would become highlighted and
this one would not become highlighted
kind of got its name because like those
old-school radio you know players if you
press like the play button and it was on
the pause button the pause button would
come up or like you know the stop button
would pop up as you hit the play button
I don't that made sense but basically
that's all we're going to do with the
radio group and then we're going to add
also another textview called test now
we're just going to go into the XML and
I'm going to ctrl shift F or format all
of it there we go and as you can see
three radio buttons are within this
thing called a radio group now what we
can do is we can set up a radio group
like set a non check change listener and
any time one of the buttons within the
radio group is pressed it's going to
change and as you can see
basically it's pretty much the same
setup as every other thing that we've
done in XML except for this check true
that's a basically saying that when we
start our application this button is
going to be checked true to start with
we're just going to delete that out of
that first radio button and now none of
them are checked so that's what we kind
of want and we're going to change this
text the first textview to say something
like Travis is dot dot dot and then we
have some radio radio group or I'm sorry
we're going to change the ID of this top
textview we're going to say textview
question something like that then let's
say this radio group we're going to say
radio group our G answers and then we're
basically going to change all these
radio or we're going to change all these
radio buttons as well we're going to
change this one to something like crazy
because you know when I start these
tutorials I was going to try and make
you guys think I was completely crazy
that's why I was like talking about my
grandma he's going to talk about like
having cats everywhere but I decided
against that so if you guys think I live
with my grandma just kind of kidding
with that but basically that's one of
the choices we can also say super sexy
which is true by the way and we're also
going to change this last one to both
which is probably true as well I'm a
little bit crazy
now we're just going to say our crazy
poor the ID are sexy poor that ID and
then lastly uh both just getting
everything set up and then we're also
going to say textview test so that's
going to be a kind of a test textview
for the most part and we basically have
that application set up or or basically
our layout we are going to worry too
much about everything
for the most part and then what I want
you guys to do is set up two new classes
and I'll probably have you guys do this
by yourself but we're going to say data
we're going to call the main one data
and then we're also going to call the
second one let's say opened class so
there we go we have our two classes set
up for the most part again we're just
going to go into our menu class and
we're going to just define one of them
within here called data again it has to
be the exact same as class again define
it in the manifest and I mean I'll start
because this tutorial is kind of short I
start again just showing you guys how to
set this up you guys should know how to
do this by now but um both of them are
going to extend activity pretty much
standard activities for both of these
and import it actually I probably won't
even show you guys just again on do on
create real quick and then if you guys
basically you can set them up however
you want but you want you're going to
want to set up all of your reference
variables again I like to do the
initialize method and then just set them
all up within there but you don't have
to you can do you know all of your
buttons within here as well but yeah get
all those reference references set up
over to the XML don't worry about
are Oh actually I'm going to say set
content view sorry I'm kind of going
spazzing out here with deciding if I
want to show you guys everything or not
we're just going to set the content view
layout dot but I want you guys get this
set up properly for data class we're
going to set that up to what we call
that one send yeah except I want to send
no set that one to get I'm sorry and
then set up our other class called open
class to send just want to make sure you
guys got those references set up and
then again initialize all of your
variables get them set up in XML or the
reference bridges that we've done in the
past plenty of times get those set up
but don't worry about the radio group
for open class activity I'll show you
guys how to set that up in the next
tutorial so basically just set up
everything and then I'll see you guys in
the next tutorial have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
