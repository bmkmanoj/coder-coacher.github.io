tutorial what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
show you guys how to add a box and later
on we're gonna be talking about layouts
and the different kinds of ways that you
can lay objects out in your window but
for right now I want to cover the
concept of a box which is essentially an
invisible container that you can stick
which it's inside of so you can actually
use a box inside your different types of
layouts but for right now it's important
to cover so let's go ahead and get
started so it's for a box right there so
in order to make a box just very self
box or whatever you want to name it and
it's gtk not the border box alright so
one of the properties that you can add
right now is spacing so again like I
said a box is just an invisible
container that you can put other widgets
inside now whenever you start sticking
widgets inside there if you don't want
them but it up right up against each
other you can add some spacing so if I
said the space in with ten this says
let's say you that we're gonna add two
buttons inside it they're not gonna be
butted up they're gonna be separated by
10 pixels simple enough
now self add what we're gonna do is in
order to add this box to the window so
box there you go so now we have a window
and we have an invisible box inside that
we're gonna stick things in that sounds
kind of weird sticking things in a box
you know what I'm just gonna keep Conner
right now and in this little demo I'm
just gonna add two buttons in there and
I'll just write bacon on one of them and
tuna on another one
so bacon button just because I don't
know you can write like yes and no bacon
in tuna why the heck not so self dot
I'll just name this bacon button
and this is equal to the gtk button
alright so let me just make these really
simple I'll just write some simple text
on every one I'd I won't have any weird
properties or anything like that but
what I'm gonna do is on Bacon button I
am gonna say whenever the user clicks
the button then we're gonna call method
and I didn't program this yet but it's
gonna be called like baking clicked and
I'll do this for tuna as well and the
last thing I'm gonna do for each button
is I actually want to make sure that
it's going inside that box that's kind
of the point of this tutorial and I'm
also gonna call pac---- start now see
whenever I type pack that two things
pop-up pack start and pack in now if we
right pack starts just like this what
pack start essentially is is a way that
you can position your items inside your
box
now pack start means as we add items to
the box just add them from left to right
so kind of the way that you would expect
but if for some reason you want to add
them in reverse in the first item you
add goes all the way on the right then
you can use pack end now of course the
property for this is self bacon button
and the parameters are first of all what
ad will item do on add to box well
that's our bacon button the only one we
have right now and there are some other
ones too and I'm gonna be talking to you
guys more about these these are just
some kind of different ways that like
padding and fill and some other settings
too but whenever we talk about layouts
I'll talk to you guys about exactly what
these are this can be confusing if um I
try to explain it right now and 0 so
again these are just different ways that
you can space and pad your item but it's
gonna make more sense later on so now
let me just add a tuna button and let me
just copy this and change everything to
tuna
so just for a tuna and start replacing
everything so tuna tuna tuna tuna tuna
tuna tuna tuna chameleon
all right did I get it all fair enough
see beacon anywhere good good good good
good
it looks beautiful all right so we
created a window invisible box and we
now have two buttons inside of our box
now of course we hooked up their clip
functionality to methods that we didn't
create yet so let's just go ahead and
sure got everything nice and order
create those right now so theft baking
clicked self widget art so whenever you
click the bacon button I'll just write
prints you clicked bacon Wow how
creative and do the same thing for tuna
so deaf tuna clicked self
widget are you clicked tuna so there you
go let me go ahead and run this bad boy
and see if it works all right so there
we go and remember up here that we said
we're creating a box and we're also
adding a spacing of ten pixels and
that's why you see that whenever I
started to add on items to it
it didn't just but them right up against
each other they're actually separated by
10 pixels I probably should have made
that more so you guys could have a seen
a little bit more clearly what's going
on but whatevs and another thing I want
to point out is you see that bacon is
first and then tuna is second now again
if you want to change this around for
whatever reason then you want to change
the specs start to pack end so now one
of every click bacon says you click
bacon you click tuna bacon and there you
go and what you can also do is instead
of having two separate methods right
here since they're so similar you can
actually make just one generic clicked
method and comment on both of these and
then instead of saying you click bacon
you can Jase just say you clicked and
then get the label actually that's your
homework assignment so as your homework
assignment what I want you guys to do
instead of having a separate baking
clicked and tuna clicked right here I
want you just have one function that
says clicked and they're both going to
call it and then whenever you click it
it's gonna say you clicked and remember
in the last tutorial I showed you guys
how you can get the property of a widget
so you're gonna get the label and print
that out so if you guys can do it then
congratulations you you don't win
anything but I'll uh you know it'll be
cool because I'm in your mind in your
mind you will win all right so there you
go that is the basics of boxes and you
guys are gonna see later on like I said
when we learn about layouts just how
useful these boxes
can be so see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
