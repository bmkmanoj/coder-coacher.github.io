tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
to be going over groups and also what
these two little buttons right here main
link and unlink so let's go ahead and
first thing that I'm going to create is
a group of just basic objects let's go
ahead and create a group of boxes so
I'll make one big one and a couple small
ones four is enough looks pretty good so
what a group is it pretty much allows
you to group objects together so you can
select and transform them all in the
same way so in order to select all the
objects go ahead and click select
objects and highlight them all and now
you can go up to group and press group
so group group and now you can give it a
name like boxes even though the name
doesn't really matter and now you can
see instead of individual white spaces
around them you get this huge white
bracket around the whole group so this
way if you go and your transformation
tools you can move the entire objects as
a group in any direction or any
transformation so another thing that you
usually want to do is let's go ahead and
ungroup this so with the entire group
selected click group actually before I
ungroup it and do that you need to do
ungroup sometimes you want to just you
say alright this entire group is good
but I wish this box right here was
turned a little bit and then the group
would be grid well if you want to edit
one of the items in group you can't just
click one of the items and edit it or
else it sucks the whole group what you
need to do is click group open and this
gives you access with the pink brackets
that change from white to pink this
gives you access to the individual
elements so now you can go ahead like
that and see do whatever you want to it
turn a little bit and then what you need
to do is do group closed so it pretty
much opens it for arm adjusting or
closes it closes the group for
transformations so now with that when
you click group close you can go ahead
and edit your entire group again and
with your new transformations so anytime
you want to edit one element remember
group open then when you're done editing
it group closed and then you still got
your group again so with that let's go
ahead and ungroup our group and with a
group selected go ahead and press group
on group and now each of them are
individual elements again just like that
but sometimes you have group like this
and let's go ahead and group these two
items using group group and we'll just
name it group 1 by default these two
items are grouped together let's say you
have another item like this one that you
want to add to the group so what you
would do is press the item you want to
add pick group attached and then click
the group you want to add it to and now
those three items are in a group just
like that so again any time you want to
add an item to the group click the item
group attached so let's go ahead and
ungroup all of these group ungroup and
now we got four individual elements just
like we had before now I can go onto my
next section which is linking and
unlinking now what linking does is it
makes child and parents and on if you
worked with like editing before you
probably know what this is but child
objects are pretty much linked to the
parent objects and whenever you move a
parent the child moves with it but
whenever you move a child and moves on
its own separate from the parent so if
you move a child the child impaired in
both move or excuse me if you move a
parent the parent and child both move
but if we move only a child then child
moves independently so once I show you
guys you understand so in order to make
child and parents what you need to do is
link objects together so let's go ahead
and select in the link click that button
right up there and go ahead and click an
object you want to be the child and I'll
have the parent be the big one and the
child will be the three small ones so
now you can go ahead click an object and
while it's held down stare while your
button is held down drag it to the
parent
and then once you're at your parent let
go and as you can see it will flash once
and then it will unflushed and that's
how you know that it's a parent so now
what can you do with your parent well
whenever you do something like move and
rotate your parent the child will move
with it
but cool thing about this is whenever
you move the child it will move
independently on its own so you can move
this over here and then when you move
the parent again the parent will move
with the child so again you can move the
child independently of its parent it can
do whatever once it's a kid it's like a
teenage adolescent rebellious but this
parent is strict it makes this child
follow its rules
nice nice conflicting analogy there so
again anytime now again this is the
first time that I said this but anytime
you want to get rid of this just go
ahead and double click any of the parent
or you can click double click any of the
children or I guess it's only a parent
and you can go ahead and click this
unlink selection and that will unlink
the selection so now you see once you
click unlink it unlinks the hierarchy so
again to create a parent with a child
click the link click the child and then
link it to the parent by dragging and
then it has a parent and you can do this
for all of these if you want and link so
now if we want to visually view our
hierarchy let's go ahead and do this
click away from your hierarchy and press
H to get the Select by name button now
if you expand this you can see that box
1 which is the mom or excuse me the
parent is the parent of all these other
boxes so again if you want to get to
that press H and then you can see and if
you can't see it press the display
display children and that will get you
to it so it's probably this by default
and if you want to view the hierarchy
click a display display children and
then that way you can see the parent and
all of its children so this is another
way you can visually edit them instead
of with a low pick
thing so that's that for this tutorial
I'm done talking about parents in
children for now until the next tutorial
that is or maybe I'll be talking about
something else who knows I guess you're
going to have to wait and see but
anyways thank you guys for watching I
hope you subscribe to my channel come on

guess I will see you next tutorial so
thank you for watching I'll see you next
