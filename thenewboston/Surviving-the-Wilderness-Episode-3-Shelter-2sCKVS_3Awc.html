gonna lay a bunch of pine boughs on
there ooh it's hot out here though and
you can't stop sweating so honey it's
done as fast as possible
then just relax
it's friggin hot whoo all right well I
got a lot of pine boughs cut up now too
when you lay them down for bedding and
then um probably just gonna lay around
for a little bit I'll try to start a
fire oh you know a little thirsty though
it's been a while since I had a drink
and this kinda what it's looking like
now I'll try maybe do a little
improvement on it
we'll see how feels when I get in there
there's something pine bough bedding a
little bit on top I don't need much
though with all the trees I get up here
not too worried about getting that wet
all right I'm chopping nice little
surface here so I can keep track I'm
gonna edge in each day on here keep
track of how long I've been out here and
right here is where I carved it up the
first day or at least tried that close
enough looks good to me
that's all that counts all righty and
this is where I'm going to tread stir
the fire and I'm right in front of my
shelter so I'll probably be roasting
some sort of animal by nightfall most
likely
and I kind of looked up how to do this
online Flint magnesium so I'm supposed
to scrape this stuff and then try and
spark it onto the magnesium to start a
fire I guess but Oh we'll see this works
out Oh baby
every time I put this magnesium on here
it just seems to want to blow away the
winter then when I try to light it with
a flint it blows away I'm all my
movement getting very frustrating and I
can't start this fire without it and
I've been doing this for it's got to be
like half an hour or at least I just
been sitting here scraping and striking
it scraping of stretching so I'm gonna
try it right now oh there goes all my
Magnum once again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
