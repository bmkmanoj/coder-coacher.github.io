with another video for the new boss turn
in this tutorial we're going to be
looking at jquery ajax requests but
we're also then going to look at how to
handle different status codes for
example a 404 page not found error so
just to start with we have a simple
button in our page with the idea button
and we have a div area with the ID of
content so when our page it looks like
this this load button is then going to
load a page onto our into our div and
that is page to HTML and there's just
some content written in here Ajax Doge
is is going to handle this request for
us I've already set up a selector for
the button and an on click event or a
click event and that will handle the
clicking of the button will now go ahead
and create the Ajax request but then
just put these status code in there as
well so it's dollar sign Ajax and then
in brackets we create our our curly
brackets in rounded parentheses we
create curly brackets now I'm going to
specify a URL and this is going to be
page dot HTML and I'm going to come and
separate that with success and this is
going to be a function and the function
contents is going to make use of the
data that's returned from this from this
page ie the content which will be some
content and then what we're going to do
is we're going to apply this to the div
just here so the Content ID div so I'm
going to I'm going to select that div
which is called content and then I'm
going to apply the HTML code to there or
in this case it's just plain text ok so
let's go ahead and run this and see what
result we get we taking the data from
page to HTML and applying it to the
content div so everything should work ok
so you can see some content ok so now
what happens if we were to change this
so it didn't exist so page wonder HTM
let's refresh click load you'll see that
nothing happens so what we can actually
do is we can use the status code
property I guess of age of this Ajax
request and actually return errors based
on the status code that's returned so
all we need to do is write status code
so with a capital C and then after this
we need more square brackets and I'll
bring this down and go ahead and indent
that in a bit now we're going to say 404
so this is the error that we that we are
looking out for and if we do have a 404
error we create a new function here with
the block and then we can do something
depending on whether the pages and found
or not for example so in that case I'm
going to place some data into the
content con let's just spell that
quickly content dot HTML I'm going to
say just a page not found so what's
happening now is we're attempting to
open page to HTML we're checking for a
status code if we have a status code 404
we're creating a function and the
contents of that function is to apply
the text page not found in fact we can
go ahead and change this to text the
text page not found in to the content
div here otherwise if we have a success
we can we're returning this data which
is the contents of page to HTML and
applying that to the contents div so
let's go ahead and save that out we've
automatically now got page to HTML back
up remove the 1 so that successfully
loads or should successfully load our
page let's go ahead and
refresh this page okay so for some
reason it doesn't seem to be loading in
okay so yeah if we just place a comma
after this two comma separate that from
the success then that should now work so
a slight error there on my part so click
load and some content is loaded now we
can go ahead and change page to page one
now this page is not going to be found
so we're going to return a 404 status
code error and then therefore we're
going to play some text page not found
inside of our content div let's go ahead
and refresh and try that
so click load page not found so you can
add more status codes down here if you'd
like so what you can do is go ahead and
comment separate these as well so where
any other status code that you'd like to
display for example I'll just put zero
zero zero to demonstrate it you then go
ahead and create a new function and then
you would use exactly the same code that
we've just used there so you can handle
different status codes in different ways
so this is extremely useful if you want
to relay back to your user that a
particular page that is trying to be
accessed can't be found as well as other
error codes that might relate to more
server related errors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
