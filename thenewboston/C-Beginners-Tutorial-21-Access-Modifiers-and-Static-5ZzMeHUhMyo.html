total and I'm creating for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
show you how to use access modifiers
which is like public and private stuff
like that and I'm going to show you how
to create methods inside of your class
so all you're going to need for this
tutorial is the class that we created in
like two tutorials ago and we edited
last tutorial and you're also just going
to need this button one click event and
you're just going to create a new
instance of your class so basically what
an access modifier does is it allows you
to limit the access that a user has to a
method or a class so for example we're
just going to look at public first and
we're just going to create a public
method right here and we'll just have it
return the name they pass in as an
argument to this class so we'll just
have it return this name variable right
here all right so what public does is it
allows you to access this method
anywhere you would like you can access
it inside of this class right here and
you can access it outside of this class
so we can do MC dot name now since it is
public but if we were to make this
private we can no longer access it will
give us an error we're getting show it
yet it says it is inaccessible due to
its protection level which means yeah
you have to make it public in order to
access that right now and I'm only going
to show you those two access modifiers
right now there are other access
modifiers but we're not going to get
into those because we haven't learned
what they do yet really so oh and also
you don't have to put private here
inside of a class the default access
modifier is private so we cannot access
a string name right now unless we
Republican from then yeah I was still in
that area it's inaccessible do this
perfection level because it's default
leap private something else you can do
is you can create a static method and
what that will do is it will allow you
to access it without creating an
instance of this class so we can just do
my class dot and then um whatever static
method you have inside of there so if we
were to create all you to have make it
public as well so if we to make this a
public void or an all public static void
that I don't know we'll just have a show
a message box I guess so we'll just do
like show message
I'll pass a string parameter in there so
we can choose what the message is and
yeah all right so we'll just have it
show a message system that windows forms
message box show message all right so
basically this public static void now we
can access it just by going we can just
actually just delete this right here we
only need to create this we just do my
class dot and then it says show message
right there but if we were to delete
static static that um we do dot yeah
doesn't show up in Palestine so we can't
use it but we'll just put static there
and now we'll be able to access it will
do my class show message then we'll just
end of show oops
static Sherman
so now let me give love and click button
1 you should get a message box say that
yep all right so now you know how to
create methods and like what to use what
and this is an access modifier this is
just called the modifier but this public
and like private those are those are
access modifiers so now you know how to
create methods inside of your class you
know what type of modifier is your
access modifiers you want to use on them
so like yeah so that's pretty much it
for this tutorial so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
