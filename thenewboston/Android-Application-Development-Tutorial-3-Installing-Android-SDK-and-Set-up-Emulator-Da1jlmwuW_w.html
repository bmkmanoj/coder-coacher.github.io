Android tutorial for the new Boston
again with me Travis and what we're
going to do in this tutorial something
super exciting we're going to install
some more software that we're going to
need for developing an Android so I was
hoping you guys were looking forward to
that and what we're going to actually
install today is the SDK so we're going
to go into Google again and type Android
SDK basically the SDK has all these
methods that we can use for Android
programming and it'll allow us to
basically develop for emulator for
emulator and for our phone so we're
going to download that so we can
actually do some Android programming and
you click the first link it's the
download section from the Android
developer page that we've been to before
this time it's under the Android SDK
starter package download we have some
choices here if you guys want if you're
on Windows you can do the the
recommended one if not you can also
download this it's pretty simple either
way so pick one of your options again
for Mac just click here and I've already
downloaded downloaded it I think it's
like 23 megabytes so it won't take too
long
unless if you guys are on dial-up if you
are I'm sorry but we're going to do now
is basically I'm going to go to the
place where I downloaded this it was
with and still good okay
it sits right here within the Downloads
tab and it's a zip file so you're going
to have to extract it hopefully you guys
have an extractor already if not I
believe there's when zip that's free
when yeah I don't know all the free ones
but there's definitely some freeware out
there to unzip stuff so I click that and
it basically it's made a folder right
here
within the same project or within the
same folder or download folder and you
want to drag this over to your main hard
drive for example your Macintosh hard
drive or your C Drive if you guys are on
Windows and as you can see it's right
here we're going to do now is open this
up
and if you guys are on Windows there
will be something called Android what is
it called the SDK manager I believe it's
called the SDK manager there's a little
green logo of the Android mascot for the
most part that little ailing and looking
dude you want to click on that as for
Macintosh what you guys want to do is go
into your tools and click Android right
here now the first time you click it it
might not do anything so if it doesn't
just exit out of there and click it one
more time and load up some stuff and it
loads up this Android SDK AVD manager
we're going to do now is set up kind of
the platforms that we want to develop
for so we're going to go into available
packages and here's our Android
repository I'm going to click that
triangle triangle to open it up because
if we don't download all of them it's
going to take a long time even
downloading one takes a while so what
we're going to do is download for the
Android 2.2 platform which has an API
level of 8 now basically you guys are
probably wondering what these platforms
are every Android phone is running on
some sort of Android operating system
and this is the version of that
operating system kind of older phones
maybe like the first Sam or like the
Samsung's they haven't got updated
they're going to be running on like the
1.5 actually I'm not even sure if
anything's running on 1.5 anymore but
basically you can think of it like that
the older phones have these older
platforms less if they got the updated
software so if you guys have a certain
phone just check what version is and you
guys can develop for that now the API
level again I'm sorry just briefly since
we're on the platform the 3 and the 3
point 1 is honeycomb which is I believe
that's what's on their tablets so if you
guys have the tablet you can develop for
that now the API levels also are
important because when we're developing
an Android application you can use
certain methods like I said from the SDK
but some of those methods require a sir
API level so if you have if you're
developing for the API level 8 you can
use all api's up to level 8 but if a
method requires API level of 10 we can't
use it
so most phones I'd say for the most part
have the 2.2 or the 2.1 we're going to
develop for the 2.2 platform and we're
going to use some API levels of 8 so you
guys want to probably select this one
because if you select one of these lower
ones and we use an API level 8 method it
won't work so just stick with me here
click that and then also down here we
have the third-party add-ons where we
can basically download some AP is we're
going to get the one from Google so when
we get into Google Maps we can use the
API from Google and again we're going to
select API level of 8 which will be for
the 2.2 platform and then we're just
going to hit install selected again
api's are basically like some resources
that we can use when developing our
applications all we have to do is say
accept all install it's my favorite rap
basically instead of reading mother
Goose to me I would my parents won't
read me mother Goose when they're
putting me to bed as a child they just
say accept all install
what's up gangster that's that's the
kind of lullabies they'd see me so that
just is ingrained in my head that's what
you guys want to do when you're
installing software and now this is
going to take a while sorry I'm kind of
weird but this is going to take a while
to install those those platforms and
those packages that we can use so I'm
just going to talk briefly of how I'm
going to teach and basically some stuff
about Android and what we're going to
get into for the most part now the way I
like to teach or the way I like to learn
for the most part is I like seeing kind
of an overview of how things work I
don't really care for the most part of
every detail but at the beginning at
least so basically what I'm going to do
sorry I'm trying to gather my thoughts
here what I'm going to do is kind of
show you guys
some of the basics of Android but we're
going to move kind of fast
for the first 20 tutorials so you guys
kind of see how everything works
you might not realize everything that's
going on but trust me you'll learn a lot
throughout those tutorials not like
every detail but after the twins
tutorial we'll kind of go back and redo
some of those things that we've done
just a little bit differently and
introduce some new stuff so that older
stuff makes sense and you guys realize
what's going on I don't know if that
description made sense but that's what
we're going to do we're going to kind of
go quickly and then we're going to
backtrack a little bit and cover some of
the stuff that we did and then move
forward as well I won't get into every
detail right at the beginning so if you
guys don't like that I'm sorry but I
will cover every detail just within time
so stick with the series and it will pay
off I promise you guys you'll understand
Android for the most part after this
whole series is done so just to give you
guys an introduction of how I'm going to
teach there it is and also Android is so
big there's so many different
programming languages you can use with
it but it's mainly the main programming
languages Java that's basically how
we're going to set up our interface our
navigation all that stuff but you can
also use C++ you can also use OpenGL ES
you can use MySQL Lite you can or what
else
XML we're going to get into XML that's
easy for the most part but there's so
many programming languages you can use
html5 as well when you're developing
your application so it's going to be
hard covering all those topics and
pretty much everything so I'm just going
to stick with okay so this got done
installing so we're just going to hit
okay I'm just going to you know cover as
much as I can within 200 tutorials and
hopefully you guys will be happy with
that if not you guys can check out my
bring back and I'll do some additional
tutorials on got things that you guys
request so there we go we have our stuff
installed and now when we say or when we
say installed packages we can see some
of the options that we download
the other thing we're going to do real
quickly is set up the emulator so we're
going to say two virtual devices up here
and hit new and we're going to call this
one Droid X again this will have to be
one word it can't be two words just one
word so we're going to have no spaces
and what's our target and be developing
forward we're going to have it develop
for the two point two platform and this
size is basically a virtual SD card
we're going to say something like 100
megabytes which is kind of overkill but
we're going to go with it and then just
hit create a BD Manager whoops and hit
OK and we're done for this tutorial
anyways okay see you guys the next one
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
