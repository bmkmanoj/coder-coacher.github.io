video I want to talk to you guys about
operations now an operation is how you
can apply a mathematical formula and
these are just going to be really easy
mathematical formulas like um adding two
values together but what you can do is
you can instead of just like setting
padding to 30 pixels you can actually
have like 30 pixels and add another
value so why would you ever want to do
that when you can just type the final
value well I'll show you guys wow this
is actually really powerful and also why
it's very useful so at first I'm just
gonna make a generic button so I'm gonna
have a variable called like button
background and this is gonna have a
value of like 1 6 a o85 and this is a
cool little I don't know like turquoise
color and also for the text color let me
add another variable might make things
easier so button color I'll just make
white and I'll set a default padding for
the button so button padding I'll just
add it 5 pixels right now why not so
I've got 3 variables so now let's
actually start making our button class
so for the button the background of
course is gonna be button background and
the border radius I'll give it a curve
enos of 8 pixels and for the color this
is the text color we are going to use
button color and let me just saw
just play this as an inline block and
add a couple other properties two more
so for padding gotta take care of that
this is bond padding and text decoration
I'm just gonna set to none so just to
make sure they don't have any weird
underlines or anything like that now
actually let me go ahead over my HTML
file and show you guys a generic bunnery
here so let me just make it a dead link
and won't link to anything hey when it
does that it tries the auto fill it in
for me give me a whole bunch of other
stupid freakin or whatever
all right normal and for the class I'll
just set this to button so right now
this is a generic button this is what it
looks like pretty boring but for this
tutorial good enough now I also want to
create different variations of this
button so for example I might have a
jumbo button I might have a light button
so it's the same thing but a little bit
lighter so what I'm gonna do is
something really cool through the use of
operations so we already know that since
we're going to be using just variations
of this then whenever we make another
class it's probably a good idea to
extend it so I don't have to type all
those properties again so for jumbo
button what I'm gonna do is myself two
bit of more space is I'm first gonna
extend button so II extend button now
UNIX in the button class so whenever I
do this all I'm doing is I'm taking all
these properties and bringing them into
here so now jumbo bun is identical to
bun but since this is a jumbo bun it's
probably a better idea to make it a
little bit bigger so what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna take the padding and I'm
gonna
a value to the default padding so right
now the default padding is button
padding but for my jumbo button I always
want to add an extra 30 pixels of
padding now take note that whenever use
operations you don't actually need to
type 30 pixels I mean you can if you
want to but SAS is smart enough to
figure out um padding for the button
it's a value in pixels so when you add
30 you're obviously not trying to add
you know 32 like the color or anything
like that so another cool thing that I
can do is this actually I won't type
that again not that lazy so I'm gonna
make light binding and this is also
going to extend button so we get all
those properties from the generic button
however whenever I make a light button
the one thing I want to do to this is I
want to bump it down a shade so it's a
tid bit lighter so for the background
I'm just gonna take the button
background which is that regular
turquoise background and we're going to
multiply it by 1.5 now whenever you take
the color and multiply it by something
greater than one it brightens it up a
little bit whenever you multiply it by
something less than one it darkens it so
what this is gonna do is give me a layer
button and now let's just go ahead and
see those right now so this is normal
this is jumbo and this last one will be
the light button no need to change the
class to jumbo button and light button
and check this out so I'm gonna refresh
this and here is our normal button here
was our jumbo button and this is our
light button now another reason that
people use these a lot is whenever you
make a button that you hover over and
it's a lighter shade then what you can
do is it's better instead of just you
know going to some tool online and
finding a
lighter shade of that color is just to
use a formula and I will show you guys
why this is right now so say that I want
to change the color of this to zero zero
six six and nine nine
well then whenever i refresh this I
automatically have my hover colors so I
know that I didn't have the
functionality to when we actually hover
over this one to change it to a lighter
shade but that way all of the buttons on
your entire website they can change by
the same shade
whenever you hover over them so whether
you wanted to change the darker or
lighter you don't have to worry about
going and finding the exact value that
you want to change you to you just
multiply the background color by some
certain amount depending on how much the
lighter you want it to be and it's very
very handy in that way so with the use
of you know extend mix-ins
you know operations we got a whole bunch
of cool tools that we can use and well
there you go thing guys for watching
that's is operations and says</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
