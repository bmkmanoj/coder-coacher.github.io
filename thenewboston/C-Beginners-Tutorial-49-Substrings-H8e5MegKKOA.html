tutorial and I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to use a substring
method so all you're going to need for
this tutorial is a button and once you
have that on your form just double click
on it
so before we looked a little bit at
strings and the substring method is in
the strings class and we're going to be
looking at that a little bit today so
previously we looked at working with
strings like creating a string and
displaying in a message box and stuff
like that but so we're just going to go
ahead right here and create a new string
string let's call it name and we'll just
study equal the sum of name I'm just
going to keep it simple and make it John
so say we want to isolate only the John
right here you don't want the last name
snare so I'm just going to go ahead and
create a new string all the last name
and we only want to get this John right
here but we don't want to like just set
it equal to John we want to have it do
something with this string up here so
what we're going to do is we're going to
use a substring method so in order to
access the substring method we're just
going to have to type on string that
we're going to make a substring out of
we're going to do name dot substring and
what substring does is we'll create a
smaller string out of a larger string it
treats like a child string so it'll
create a string out of part of this
string so we're only want John well it
will just take this John right out right
here and make it into a new string but
first we have to tell it where we want
to begin reading and stop reading so
where we want it to start we want to and
we want it to start at this J and end
this space right here so the two
parameters that we have to pass through
is the start index which is where we'll
start reading says the zero-based
starting character position of a struct
substring in this instance and basically
just where it's going to start reading
we want it to start at 0 so the first
one is 0 then it goes 1 2 and so on so
we want it to be 0 right here
want to start at the very beginning and
then the next parameter is the length or
the number of characters in the
substring or basically just how much you
want to read then we want it to read
four because we want it to read John
which is four characters so you want it
three the J is youth the O the H in the
end so it's going to go ahead and get
for it here so now this last name roots
you have to get the first name so we
wanted to get John
so this first name right here should be
equal to John so now we just do mbox
and display this substring this first
name string and a message box you should
get John yep got Colin so say you want
to get Smith now well in order to do
that we're just going to create another
strings call it last names time and
we'll also split it in this box but
anyway now to access this the starting
position won't be 0 anymore it's going
to be 5 because we're going to start
here it's going to 0 then 1 and 2 then 3
4 &amp;amp; 5 so this s is the fifth so we're
just going to do five for the starting
position and since Smith is 5 characters
long we're going to put 5 right here so
now let me debug should get Smith in a
message box yep and you don't
necessarily need this right here you can
just um just have the 5 and you can only
do this if you're reading to the end of
the string so since it knows we want to
start a 5 we just want it to read to the
end of the string it'll just do that it
will start a 5 and this would lead to
the end of the string but this wouldn't
work if you had like an open to crap
after this because like now if we did
that we'll get like Smith and then a
whole bunch of that stuff yeah but we're
to go ahead back here and put 5
so it'll read five characters which is
just that then we'll get just myth
yeah so that's pretty much it for this
tutorial on substrings in the next
tutorial we're going to continue on
looking at some more than methods inside
of the strings class so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
