welcome to your let's see 30 and I was
30-something Stora who really cares and
before I get started let me ask you guys
this I I was messing around and I built
a couple apps to submit to the App Store
and now I have this build in the bug
thing instead of builder and run so if
anyone knows how to switch it back to
build and run I mean I can do this
customize toolbar and drag this up but
then just switches back so I know wTF is
going on so if anyone knows how to fix
that I mean it still works it's kind of
annoying then I'll leave me a message
and let me know and I will thank you so
much so now to the last part of this
tutorial and that's actually building
our picker so we have a couple methods
right here our delegate methods in our
interface file and you're saying alright
what the heck were these when are these
coming into play well right now what
iPhone development as allows us to do is
have pre-existing methods that we just
need to go and grab from you know
whatever it's called the iPhone library
or whatever and these are methods that
you pass it the values of how you want
your picker to be built so like how many
wheels do you want how many rows in each
wheel what do you want the rows to say
here's what you need to do so the three
methods we use now are this one right
here and again I have the Safari open
right next to me so I'm just grabbing
these methods from here but they're all
going to look the same this first one is
number of components in picker view and
just go ahead and grab this from the
library or whatever oh I won't post the
link but someone post the link down
below so everyone can find it and this
is a built-in method that you need to
kind of use and this is in your delegate
method and this is it needs you to
return how many wheels are gonna make up
your picker so we only want that one
wheel so return one if you return to
they're going to be two wheels but we
don't have any need for that so that's
really simple alright so now that we got
the number of wheels that we want our
picker to create what else do we need
well there's another method over
go ahead and grab this copy and paste
and the reason I'm not typing these out
is because I don't need to type them out
they're built in methods from our
delegate and data source that says all
right this is how you should make your
Pickers so what this one is is this one
is called picker view number of rows and
component and the same for each wheel we
want you to tell me how many rows you
want me to make so we said all right we
have one component right here now how
many rows do you want in that wheel well
we want the same number is whatever is
in our array right here so we can either
do this 1 2 3 4 5 and return 5 or what
if we go back later and add some more
strings to here then it's going to be
messed up so what we wanted to do is
this return again we could do 5 that's
perfectly acceptable it'll build fine in
this case but we want to do is say all
right
get our picker array which is pretty
much our array and get count how many
however many elements are in there and
automatically return that and why is
this better than just putting 5 you ask
well if we ever decide to go back and
change our array then this value is
automatically gonna change as well we
don't have to remember it changes to 6
or 7 or 8 or anything like that
circe in art our picker is now built it
says how many wheels we only want one
wheel and then how many rows in that
wheel will say number in our array good
we're good to go building on whoa not so
fast your picker needs one more piece of
information and that's alright it's
automatically going to call this method
right here let me go ahead and copy it
from Apple and paste it and this method
is gonna be called for each of your
components in each row so in this case
it's going to be called five times four
it's pretty much gonna say this I'm
gonna loop through each of your
components in each of the rows and I'm
want you to tell me what you want to put
in each of those rows well let's go
ahead
and do something like this return at
apples and see what we get well let's go
ahead and build it and debug this since
I can't build and run it for whatever
reason and now it's changed a B at the
bottom and now it's going to go through
each of those rows and put apples in
each one well I mean that's great now if
you want this and you see that works but
let's go ahead and quit the iPhone
simulator and say all right we don't
want to give the apples for every single
row what we want to give you is the
object at the array object at index row
so what this is going to do is say all
right for your first component in row 0
give me whatever array 0 which is tuna
good enough and now I say all right what
about if I want to put a title in for
the third element then they get to
picker object at array 2 and that would
be apples so this is pretty much what's
happening when you create your a you
first have to give how many wheels they
want to draw we want to draw one then
you say all right how many rows do you
want in that wheel well we want however
many is in our array obviously then for
each of the elements when it loops
through one is creating your picker it's
going to say all right for a component 0
row 0
put tuna for component 0 row 1 put fish
for component 0 row 2 pi apples and it's
going to go through and automatically
create everything for you easy
wheezy so this is what you get for a
finished product tuna fish apples more
tuna press me horror I mean hoe more
tuna and pumpkin not blumpkin pumpkin
just like that so that works all fine
and dandy and whenever I first was
working with this I was like alright so
if you're doing this all right this
method gets called once
so you're passing a 1
in one row so how does it know to return
the stuff for every single I mean like
five times or twenty times or however
many times does this well the cool thing
about delegate methods is they get
called automatically as needed so this
method is actually going to be called
five times and how do we know that we
don't even need to know it it's built in
to iPhone development so these pretty
much take all the confusing aspects out
for you and this is pretty much how you
build simply really simple methods to
build your picker so pretty much saying
all right in this give me the number of
wheels give me the number of rows and
let me know what you want for each row
and as far as if this stuff goes right
here don't even worry about this stuff
I'll take care of it Bucky alright and
that's the cool thing about iPhone
development they made everything so easy
but you know I got feeling I'm running
out of time so I think guys for watching
if you have any questions make sure to
leave me a comment and someone put pup
up please tell me how to get rid of the
stupid bug thing because it is really
scaring me so anyways thanks for
watching don't forget subscribe and I
will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
