tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
to show you guys how to build a real
small program with all the tools that we
learned so far
now I already taught you guys how to
build a basic program to get like data
from a user like their name or something
and I told you guys how to output text
on the screen so how do we combine those
two to get input from the user and then
come or output it on-screen
well what we would do is this the first
thing we need build is our way to get
input from the user so you already know
how to do this so let me just refresh
your memory
set something equal to the text entry
dialog I'm gonna set it equal to test
you can write anything you want WX dot
text entry dia LG spill everything right
close enough the parent equals none and
then you write a question like what's
your name and then after this you write
the title I'm just gonna write title and
then write the default text you want to
appear say that's right enter your name
then they have a little space to know
there enter their name next you go ahead
and write just like we did before
if test doc show modal is exactly equal
to the WX ID underscore okay and
remember whenever we get this box is
gonna say ok and cancel if they click OK
that's pretty much what this line means
then let's get a variable called apples
and we want to set equal to test or
whatever you have up here get value so
pretty much we made a box up here that
says enter your name then we say if they
enter something then click OK we're
going to store that value in apples so
now we have that value in apples let me
show you guys what we have so far we
have what's your name enter name Bucky
okay
but then nothing happens in our frame
window so now we got to tell Python to
get that data that's an apples and
output it to our frame so let's go ahead
and do that and how we do this is write
WX static text and then I write the
parent which is panel of course the ID
is negative one and instead of just
writing text like text here what we
would do is just go ahead and write that
variable called apples right there and
then just go ahead and position it
somewhere 1010 and now instead of having
nothing on our frame we say all right
take that variable whatever values in
that variable apples and output it to
our frame so let's go ahead and run this
save it of course what is your name
Bucky okay Bucky right there in our
frame bam bam wham thank you ma'am
it's working perfect so let me explain
you guys one last time what we just did
this is a pretty much just a text entry
dialogue like we did before just a box
that is pretty much like a user prompt
that lets a user enter some information
the question was what's your name titles
title the default was enter name if they
clicked okay then we want to store that
value in the variable apples and then
what we did is pretty much just make a
plain frame and with just whatever value
it was in there and again this is just a
parent ID variable and position so
that's it for this tutorial I hope you
enjoyed and don't forget to check out my
other tutorials after this so thank you
don't forget to subscribe and hopefully
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
