video what I want to do is I want to
talk to you about one of my favorite
features of github and that is the
issues tab so whenever you're working on
project whether it's a website or a
piece of software and you have a bunch
of team members on it you're basically
going to have a lot of things that you
need to do to that project
so maybe for this website my company
decided that we wanted to add some more
files and there are also some bugs that
we wanted fix and maybe for this home
page there were some improvements that
we wanted to make we basically had a big
to-do list now it's going to get really
confusing really quickly if you're
alright you over there you fix these
bugs and you in the back you gotta add
these files and yeah you in the middle
you have to I don't like to add an image
to the home page and just keeping track
of who does what is going to turn into
like a big spaghetti mess so luckily
we're never using github it pretty much
solves all of those problems so go ahead
and click the issues tab and what this
allows you to do is basically this
anytime you have any change that you
want to make any bug that you want to
fix anything that you want to do you
just make a new issue so this is
basically going to be like a to-do list
now for each item in this list what
you're going to do is you're going to
assign a person to it so that way
everyone knows exactly what they're
supposed to do and every one has a clear
set of tasks tasks there you go it's
weird to say there's like a s is in it
alright so let's go ahead and make just
one item now so I'm going to go ahead
and click new issue and any time you
make an issue you have a title and I'll
say add image to homepage and a
description that is pretty much a more
detailed arm description I guess of
whatever you're trying to accomplish so
I'll say we need a picture of the Frog
in the middle of the homepage
all right looking good now the cool
thing about these is whenever you're
writing the details for a task you're
not only limited to plain text you can
you know go ahead and bold things one
thing you're going to be using a lot are
these code snippets and if you want to
write like I know maybe a sample of the
code like image source equals frog dot
gif you know something like that and you
can go ahead and preview it and these
code snippets just you know they're kind
of different than the normal text it has
all mono spaced font and it just stands
out a little bit better and another cool
thing is you can actually upload files
or if you have a file online you can
link it but I'll show you guys a really
cool feature so a lot of times let me
just take a step back I add images here
because I take a screenshot of something
um or maybe I'm taking a screenshot of
my IDE whenever I got an error trying to
run the program and what I can do is
once I have that screenshot as you see
it's just the image on my computer you
can actually just go ahead and drag it
and plop it in here now what that does
is it actually uploads it for you and
converts it to markup which is github
special text and if you preview it you
got your image right here so again you
wouldn't be including these pictures of
frogs a lot they're usually screenshots
or you know just error messages or
pictures of I don't know random things
about your website that are goofy but
there you go
so after this you can go ahead and hit
submit new issue or what I always do is
I add a label to it so a label if you
click this little gear icon it tells you
what kind of issue this is so I usually
use two different ones the most the
first one is a bug so a bug of course is
something very wrong with your program
whenever you encounter this it pretty
much crashes your program another one
that I use is enhancement so bugs are
the most important one if you label
something is a bug then this is the
thing you want to do first
however if I just am laying in bed
thinking of a cool idea maybe some cool
feature to add in my website I can go
ahead and label is an enhancement so
this is just me personally you can label
them however you want but basically I
like doing this because hey we got to
take care of the bugs first and then any
issue that's an enhancement whenever we
have time we can you know add those
features later so that's what labels are
our milestones we're talked about in a
little bit and this is another useful
thing right here so an assignee
is basically you can assign someone or
say hey this is the person who's going
to take care of this issue so right now
you can see that I only have one option
and that is me right here and that's
because I'm the only person working on
this repository right now but I'll show
you guys the one that we are working on
for my website so this is a source code
for the actual website if you go to the
New Boston comm this is all this now you
can see that we have some issues right
here so we have different signings me
Eric this is my lead developer you can
see that I am assigned this issue and
also this one and Eric is working on
these things right now so if I ever want
to change one of these and said you know
what I actually don't have time to do
this I can click this gear icon and
change it to someone else so I can just
give them all to Wheatley or Eric or
anyone else so again you're usually
going to have more than one people that
you can assign it to whenever you're
working on a big project right now we'll
just assign it to myself and hit submit
new issue so there you go and now
whenever you click the issues tab you
can see a list of these issues so
whenever you have an item that is needed
to be worked on it's called open so this
means that it's active item it's on the
to-do list whenever you are done with it
it's called closed and I'll show you
guys this so right now on my website and
this is actually a real one not just a
sample for YouTube we have five little
issues that we were working on so here
are all of these
and the ones that we already finished we
can see that we have 21 closed issues so
all of these things all of these bugs
and features we already fixed so that's
another cool way to separate them and
the last thing I want to mention is this
you see that we have a couple of these
labels like enhancement and I already
showed you guys we have this bug label
this red one well there are going to be
times where you actually need your own
custom labels and one example of this is
we have this to-do list right here now a
lot of these things I work on and a lot
of stuff Eric works on and we're pretty
much both web developers we can write
code however sometimes we have an issue
that is more server related and we
aren't the best with you know server
administration and getting deep into the
backend of things so we actually assign
those to Vlad so what we need to do is
we don't write it as a bug we don't
write it as an enhancement we need a
special label for Vlad and Vlad is my
server administrator for the website of
course by default you just don't have a
Vlad label so you have to kind of make
your own custom labels so any time you
want to do that just go ahead and click
labels at the top right here now usually
you're only going to have these question
invalid help on an enhancement duplicate
and bug but I needed to make this so
what I did is I went to new label and
then I typed server Vlad and I'll just
be like what can I put like here like
sample for YouTube and then what you can
do is you can make your own custom color
so there you go hit create label and you
can now add it as label just like before
I'm going to delete that because I
really don't need it yes I wanted to
lead it but there you go so that's the
basic concept behind issues it's
basically a to-do list and you can add
custom labels to them to help clarify
exactly what they are and how important
they are and you can also assign people
to them so everyone knows
exactly what they're supposed to be
working on and no one bumps heads pretty
cool thing guys for watching I will see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
