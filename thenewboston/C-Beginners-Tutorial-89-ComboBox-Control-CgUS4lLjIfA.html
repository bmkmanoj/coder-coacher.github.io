tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm gonna be
showing you how to use the combo box
control so all you're going to need for
this tutorial is a button and a combo
box so just go over to your toolbox and
drag your combo box over to your main
forum and I'm sure you've never really
heard of a combo box before but
basically what it does is it allows you
to select an item from a huge list of
items and once we debug you'll see that
I'm sure you've seen this before in
order to add items to a combo box just
select your common box and click this
little black triangle right here and
then go down to edit items now inside of
here we can choose items that we want to
be in our combo box each item is
separated by a different line so if we
were to type out atom on this line and
then like Bob on this line then there'd
be two different items one for atom and
one for Bob but we cannot just separate
them by like a comma or anything we have
to put them on a different line and all
this add 1 1 I'll call it Joe
now click OK now we should have three
items inside of our combo box atom Bob
and Joe so not only debug and crucible
down arrow on our combo box you should
see those items yep atom Bob and Joe we
can select those items and we can also
type any text that we want in this combo
box and talk about all that however if
you want to make it so that you cannot
type out anything like combo box just go
down to properties and change the
drop-down style to drop down the list
and as you can see now becomes read-only
and you cannot write in that text box so
that combo box if we can still select
items up and the last drop down style is
simple and this basically just displays
all the items in your combo box right
there and you can still select them just
like normal but we can type in this box
up here now I'm just going to change it
back to
drop down the list like that smile all
right in order to check to see what
items view or what item the user has
selected in the combo box you can use
the text property so it's going to
double click on this button right here
and right here we're going to check to
see if the user selected the atom item
so we're just going to do if combo box 1
text because we're going to using a text
property we're going to see if that
property is equal to atom
so if whatever the user selected in the
combo box is equal to atom then limits
become a message box to display saying I
guess test so now I need you bug here
since nothing is selected in the combo
box you shouldn't get a message box
if we select atom we should get test yep
but if we select something different we
shouldn't if we don't get a message box
you can also on edit the items inside of
the combo box you can code so you can
use the items properties at combo box
class and this will just return a
collection of combo box items and
basically it's just an array so we can
do like you can put the index of the
item we want to edit right here so if we
want to do edit the first item just with
0 in there and then we can change the
text of that to something else like you
want to make it to say instead of atom
we wanted to make it say schemes and you
could do that so now we will change the
atom property since it's the first one
we'll change that to Steve so now maybe
bug here and click down on our combo box
you see we have the three items atom Bob
and Joe but now we will change this item
right here to Steve when I click this
button yep now we have Steve Bob and Joe
instead
you can also add items to the combo box
so if you wanted to do items then you
can use the add method to get um where
to add an item to the combo box so if we
wanted to add another item called Steve
I guess as well do that so now we just
have this three items but now I need to
go up or click this button we should get
or have four yep we now have Steve as
well and the last thing I'll show you is
the count property and this will
basically return the number of items in
the combo box and all of us have a
message box display since this returns
an integer which they have to be to
string method people are dangerous
string so now we should get 3 because
there are three items in our combo box
or here yep three and if you want to and
there's an event also in the combo box
class and that will basically tell you
when someone changed the nth item in the
combo box so selected index changed so
whenever someone selects a different
item I can do some code right here and
I'm just going to have a message box
displayed saying tasks so now whenever
we select a different item we should get
a message box and test yep
selected an item yeah all right so
that's pretty much it for the tutorial
on combo box control so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
