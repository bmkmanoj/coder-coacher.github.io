your 87th in the last tutorial in Java
programming whatever I named it and this
is the last tutorial in Java programming
because after this I'm going to start a
new series and it's going to be like
intermediate Java programming because I
mean we can only continue this beginner
series for so long there's so much a job
to go over so this 87th video is the
last in this series but after this
there's going to be like 50 more
intermediate videos hopefully if I ever
find the time and also there after that
it's going to be more expert I just
can't have like 200 videos in a playlist
or else it'll seem kind of weird so
that's why this is going to be a last
video in this series but trust me we're
not done Java yet and aside from this my
hard core Java followers are probably
like alright what happened to Java game
development I thought we were really
like halfway through that well we're
going to be continuing Java game
development but in the meantime we need
to go over some basics because we're
going to be using that in our game
programming so if you're wondering and
worried about all right I want to get
back to game development trust me guys
we will build games in Java but first we
need some more basics so what we're
going to be going over in this tutorial
is a couple things about strings and I
know we talked about strings before but
we never really talked about all the
things that we can do with strings so
let's go ahead and make a couple more
strings right now I'm going to name mine
a B and C and I'll set a equal to apples
I said a lot of things people equal to
apples I just notice that string B set
this equal to Bucky and string C set
this equal to Bucky but making sure it's
all in caps and spell it right it's
crucial so now we have string a B and C
all right nothing we've never seen
before now we already know a couple cool
things that we can do like system out
print line and we can get like the
length of string using a dot length and
let me just test this to make sure it
works good and now there we go
and now we can see six right here so I
mean we already learned a few things
like how we can get the length using
calling the length from a string class
but we can also do a couple more things
and the first thing I want to teach you
guys how to do is compare strings now
it's a little different than you guys
might think so let's go ahead and make
it if statement and what you would
usually do is if a is equal to this in
whatever you know whatever comparison
you want using two equal signs and this
is how we learn to compare things before
whenever we compare strings what we need
to do is we need to use the equals
method so here's what you do put a which
is apples if this equals and then in
your equals you go ahead and write what
you want it to equal to if a equals
apples what you does what do you want to
do just go ahead and put system like
let's go ahead and just copy this smell
print line it equals apples put that in
a string so let's run this and see what
we get after we get rid of that there we
go run it and see what we get in it says
an error because I didn't use these two
things yet B or C so that's why we're
getting that it equals apples BAM so
this worked and if you're wondering all
right you just told me to do that but
why can't I use the two equal sign well
here's the background for you guys who
are just so curious when you use the two
equal signs it how do I say this if two
objects are identical which means they
have the same contents but there are two
separate objects themselves then it's
going to be false and this happens a lot
in strings and what happened in this
case but it's just
it just can cause a lot of confusion so
with the two equal sign just remember if
you try to compare with two equal signs
you kept getting an error that means
that you have I mean they could be the
same object they go could be both set to
apples but if they aren't the same
object then it's going to be false so
that's why you always need to use the
equals method and that's why they built
this method for only strings if you're
wondering all right why isn't this in
any other class because no other class
causes problems what the equals method
does is it compares the contents of it
and that's what you always want to do
when you're comparing strings so I mean
BAM that's that and why did I have these
two little things right here well we can
go ahead and compare these by just doing
a little quick copy-paste and we'll put
like if B equals C this is just a
demonstrate that you can't that two
strings without the same casing is
different so what do we want to write
the keys match right there so if string
B equals string C which are both Buckey
let's see what we get run
and it says Lucky's match nope we didn't
get a Bucky's match so let's go ahead
and now we can see that all right this
Bucky does not equal this Bucky but what
if we're writing the computer program
and we want them to like type their name
or something and we don't care about
casing and how can we compare two
strings with kind of forgetting about
casing what we need to do is this put
equals ignore case and now let's see
what we get and now look at this it says
Bucky's match so again what I'm trying
to demonstrate is anytime you want to
compare two strings and you don't want
to have to worry about case then what
you do is put B equals ignore case and
it's going to compare your two strings
just like before but it's going to take
the case of it and pretty much forget
about it say just the contents of Bucky
equals Bucky and matter what casing
as you can clearly see so that's that
for this tutorial and again like I said
when you're moving on from this tutorial
don't look 488 the video there's not
going to be one you are now ready to go
to intermediate Java programming and I'm
going to be building the first tutorial
of that next is going to be a
continuation of strings so with that
being said I just want to thank you guys
you've finally made it through you've
learned so much Java in this series and
I cannot wait to see you next time so
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
