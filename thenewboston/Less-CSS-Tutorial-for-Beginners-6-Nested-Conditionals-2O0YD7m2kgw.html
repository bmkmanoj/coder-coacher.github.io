show you how to nest conditionals in
less now the syntax of this is actually
really similar to nested rules basically
what we can have is something like this
say that we're making a website and we
wanted to put a banner on the homepage
that's what everyone does now that's
what we're doing why not follow the
trend now whenever you're looking at it
on a desktop we wanted it to be styled
one way but whenever you're looking at
on a mobile phone we want it to be
styled a different way and this is
actually on one of the main techniques
that people use whenever they're making
a responsive websites essentially gonna
have two different sets of styles and
you're gonna add a condition that says
on mobile phones or small screen devices
use this style instead of the default
one so the first thing we need to do is
actually just make our basic styling
like a Welcome banner and we'll just
give it like a font size of 32 pixels
and a background of light green why not
now
what we can do thanks to less is inside
here we can add a condition and we'll
just say a condition for small screen
devices so that's media screen we're not
printing or actually want to add this
for screens and media and I'll just say
I'm max width of 7 that's you 768 pixels
so any device that is less than 768
pixels which are typically like phones
or tablets or anything like that
then we want to add this styling instead
so font size of I don't know maybe
smaller and maybe a new background color
for whatever reason but that's how you
can add conditionals let me add a little
comment so it's easier to see
only on small screen devices so this is
your generic and this is when you're
looking at it on a small screen and
that's what it gets compiled to pretty
sweet eh so now let's actually go ahead
and make this a div ID equals welcome
banner and inside here are destroyed
welcome to the new Boston and check it
out so this is what we have this is our
default styling a font size of 32 in the
background of light green or lime green
whatever it is called now let me shrink
this to simulate a smaller screen device
and look what happens our style changes
to a smaller font even though now - now
that I think about it you may want to
bump up the font whenever you're looking
at it on a small screen device but uh
you know I really think that through but
that's not what I'm trying to teach in
this video and you know usually whenever
people are working on making a website's
responsive it isn't like changing the
background color it's actually maybe
changing the margin or you know a bunch
of other stuff not related to look but
the actual behavior of it but now you
guys know that with the nested
conditionals we can do is you can have a
default styling and then you can add a
conditional to say whenever this is true
apply this styling instead so that's
what nesting conditionals does and yeah
les makes it really easy so there you go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
