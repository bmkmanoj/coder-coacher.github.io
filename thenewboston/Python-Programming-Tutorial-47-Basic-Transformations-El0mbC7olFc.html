video and in this tutorial I want to
show you guys how to do some basic
transformations on your image and by
transformation I mean things like resize
flip rotate um like stretch so let's go
ahead and get started and I think I'm
going to use this picture me as a baby
for this tutorial so I'll name it baby
baby bulky image open baby JPEG and
let's just go ahead and show this first
so baby show alright so let's see what
we're starting with so this is the basic
image that we're going to be
manipulating and the first
transformation I want to show you guys
is just how to resize it so let me
actually see so the image size of this
is 450 by 341 let's say we were making
like a website or something or just a
piece of software and we want it to take
an image and make it square so fit
perfectly in our profile now what we can
do is actually cut out a square from
somewhere in the middle in order to show
you guys how to cut it but if you just
want to pretty much take the image and
resize it into a square this is what you
do just name this square baby and I'll
set this equal to baby which is your
original file your original photo and
the function is called
resize and what it does is it takes a
tupple so make sure you add these double
parentheses right here this these
outside ones are for the function
parameters in these inside ones is
pretty much the tupple itself and the
tupple is of course just the size that
you want to resize it to so i want to
take that original image and resize 250
by 250 so now the square baby if we show
it check it out so that was our original
one and this is our resize the baby
Bucky square baby so that is how you
accomplish that now another thing I want
to show you guys is what if you want to
flip it upside down or flip it you
horizontally or vertically well let's
name this one flip baby and in order to
do this of course take your original
baby object in the function is actually
called transpose and this is actually
the you use the same function whether
you want to flip it or rotate it so what
you can do is you can um call this
property of actually I wonder if it pops
up yep so flip left right and flip top
bottom are two different ways that you
can flip it of course left to right
along the axis in top bottom this is
pretty much vertical and horizontal
probably would be easier if it said that
actually I think I like left to right
top bottom better so pretty much take
the left and put it where the right is
pretty simple so now if we show flip
baby we can see I have three different
transformations that was our original
one that was a square one and this is
the flip baby now remember I flipped it
left and right so that's why it didn't
flip upside down that would be top
bottom left to right means pretty much
just flip it along that axis we just
close all these is getting kind of messy
in the last one I want to show you guys
is this might as well type it out so you
can do spin baby and what this does is
if you call baby transpose you can call
image dot rotate now as you can see as
soon as I type R we have a couple of
properties that pop up rotate 180 270
and 90 so let me just go ahead and
rotate it 90 degrees actually if we
rotated this image 180 degrees think
about what it does it pretty much just
takes in flips it upside down so it
cheeves the same effect is flip top
bottom but if we just rotate it in 90
degrees then show you guys what it does
right here
it'll look like it's on its side pretty
much so let's run all those again check
it out original one square flipped and
rotated pretty sweet so those are just
some real quick simple transformations
and I suppose square run Oh interesting
but anyways there you go again to square
it up it's resize and for your other
transformations you use the transpose
class or excuse me the function so well
there you go in the next tutorial I'm
going to be showing you guys how to
convert one image mode to another image
bone it's going to be sweet so I'll see
you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
