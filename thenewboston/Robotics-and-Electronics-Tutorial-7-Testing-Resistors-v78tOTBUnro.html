seventh tutorial and how to build a
robot and in this tutorial I'm going to
be teaching you how to test the values
of a resistor right here using a
multimeter right here so I got my
multimeter here and make sure that your
black probe is put into the one that
says comm and your red one is put into
the plug that says ohms and that's that
little horseshoe thing and I'm not going
to show you guys how to do that since I
already showed you less tutorial but
once you've got that done go ahead and
turn on your multimeter to the
resistance setting now this might be
different for you but for me it's a
little one that looks like a horseshoe I
don't know where it is on yours if you
have if you don't have auto-ranging then
the first thing that we're going to be
testing is a hundred ohm resistor so go
ahead and change yours you like to hunt
anything over 100 but once you have your
multimeter turn on in your settings to
measure resistance then we don't have a
connection in see here our probes here's
red and here's black this isn't
connecting so it should show an open
connection so in order to grab the
resistors I'm going to use something
called alligator clips and if you watch
my lesson tomorrow you knows what you
know what those are you know see why
these are useful in a bit go ahead and
clip one of the alligator clips under
the black probe I used a black alligator
clip and then I don't know if you guys
can guess what I'm going to do next take
a red alligator clip remember and grab
it onto the red probe right there this
is just going to make sure it's easier
to hold on
since instead of taking a needle and
touching it to your resistor it will
probably roll around so we aren't
something that's going to clip on like
that it's still the same thing once you
have your two alligator clips hooked
under your probes like this take the
other end of the alligator clip and it
doesn't really matter what and you
choose clip one end onto the resistor on
one of their ends
and take the other end of the alligator
clip or the other alligator clip I
should say and clip it on to the other
end of the resistor and you should get a
reading now since this is a hundred ohm
resistor with five percent tolerance it
should be anywhere in the range of 95
ohms to 105 ohms and as you can see once
a test for resistance and I just unclip
my alligator plug because I bumped it
it should read anywhere from 95 to 105
ohms and this one is reading right
around 98.5 or 4 depending on you look
at it so that is how you test a resistor
for resistance let me show you guys one
more umm let's see I'll go with a let's
go with the big one I'll go with a
75,000 resistance now again take your
alligator clip or one of your test
probes if it has a clip on it clip it to
one end of the resistor just like that
come on baby focus just like that and
take your other alligator clip and clip
it to the other end of the resistor and
as you can see this one it says seven
point five two but if you notice it has
a little K at the end of it let me see
if I can point this out it has a little
K right here so this doesn't mean seven
point five 2 ohms you got to look at
that K right there and it means times by
a thousand so if you move decimal point
over three spaces it's only five so one
hundred fifty to seventy-five hundred
and twenty so since this is a 7500
resistor that's the reading we were
looking for that's a pretty precise
resistor I'm going to keep that baby
right there so that is how you test our
resistance for a resistor for resistance
let me unclip this and in the next
tutorial I'm going to be showing you how
to look at a resistor and find the
resistance of it so don't forget to
check out the next tutorial thank you
guys for watching make sure it's
subscribe and I'll see you guys next
