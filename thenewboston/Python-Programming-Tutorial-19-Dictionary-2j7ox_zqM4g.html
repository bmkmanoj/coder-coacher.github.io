your 19th python tutorial and today in
Python I'm going to be teaching you guys
about something called a dictionary now
what a dictionary was is it uses
something called keys and values to look
up items instead of when we were making
lists and sequences we look them up by
number what number their element was so
in this one a dictionary works just like
a regular dictionary you can use a word
to look up another value so let me show
you guys the syntax for a dictionary
it's a little different than the list
our typical cyclic sequence so let me
make um you can name your dictionary
anything you want I'm going to name my
book just a represent dictionary for now
and then inside you have a syntax you
need curly braces so write the name of
your dictionary and then put it equal to
and have empty curly braces now inside
your curly braces you're going to need a
set of keys and values the keys is what
you look up and the value is what you
receive once you look it up so say we
want to look up let's have dad for the
key and the value would be the name of
him and it would be something like Bob
and let's populate this with a some more
stuff let's have mom as key and then
maybe the value for her would be Lisa
and then let's add one more we have a
broke and of course his name Joe
jonesboro so now we have a dictionary
where we look up our family members and
it should output us as long as I don't
mess up on syntax the name of them so go
ahead and press Enter and check it make
sure we did everything right and there
we go it even sorted it for us so now we
can use this dictionary to look up
values and I'll show you how what you do
first is type in the name of the
dictionary such as book and then after
that you type
and the key that you want to look up and
you type it in in square brackets so
instead of a number what you do is type
in something like that and it would give
you the name or you could type in
something like let's go ahead and just
show you guys another example mom and as
you can see you type in the key and it
gives you the value now this doesn't
have to be a letters or strings it can
also be numbers so say have a dictionary
called ages and you wanted to show the
ages of them you can have something
called dad and he is 42 and then have
another one called mom and let's see how
well can she be to me a 7 she's a MILF
and go ahead and press Enter
and now we have an ages and now once we
look it up ages then we get a number so
again the values don't always have to be
a string of text it can also be a number
as well so now that I showed you guys
how to make basic dictionaries let me
show you guys a couple on dictionary
methods real quick so on our book let's
go ahead and let me show you guys the
clear method and what the clear method
does is take this dictionary right here
and it clears all items in it or removes
all items so let me go ahead and do this
and now once you look at book we have an
empty armed dictionary
so what clearer does again is pretty
much take all these items and just
remove them
another thing or another method is
something called copy and what copy does
what is pretty much copy an entire
dictionary to another new dictionary so
say we want a new dictionary called tuna
and what we would do is write tuna
equals and we want the copy of well
let's see ages
we didn't delete that one yet so what we
would do is we want this new dictionary
called tuna
what were you do is put ages dot copy
because copy is the method then just
press Enter now once we get this we get
tuna and we have a whole new dictionary
and we didn't have to type it on
character for character and the last
thing I want to show you guys is
something called has key now this is
going to be really useful when checking
um for programming and dictionaries and
stuff in the very near future so this is
how you can check if a dictionary has a
key and if it does it returns the value
true but if it doesn't have that key
evertune it returns the value false not
return is it all right so here's what
you do I guess you have the dictionary
tuna right now and if we want to check
for a key in it what we have to do is
put has underscores key and then your
parameter of course is what key one
check for so let's check if it has mom
true all right let's check if I have
something else that isn't in it just to
show you guys has key um
apples false so your dictionary has the
key mom but it doesn't have the key
apples and this is useful for like
verification and stuff especially on a
lot of the programs we're going to be
making this is the method we're going to
be using so that is your quick tutorial
on how to make a dictionary and some
really common methods on a dictionary so
I hope you guys enjoyed hope you guys
learn a little bit but not too much so
thank you guys for watching and I will
see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
