definition of a rectangle to prove the
triangles are congruent so there's two
ways you can do this particular one and
we're actually gonna go over both of
them because for every proof that we've
done I've only showed you one way to do
it and for almost any proof there's more
than one way to do it it just depends on
what you happen to see first so we're
gonna go do it two different ways but
know that there's more than two ways to
do this one of these ways is gonna be a
little bit longer not much but I just
want to show you your options okay so we
know that M n o P is a rectangle and we
want to get this up this triangle up
here congruent to this triangle up here
the two triangles that kind of form a
hourglass so first we're gonna copy are
given and and opie is a rectangle I
don't know why I just put two right
there and that's given to us okay so
what do we know about rectangles well we
know that they're opposite sides are
congruent which will help us out because
then we can get em and congruent P oh so
that's what we're gonna do next we're
gonna say that M and is congruent to P
oh and our reason for that is if
rectangle then opposite sides are
congruent now in that same step you
could also say that M P is congruent to
n oh but
that doesn't help you prove that
triangle and QN is congruent to triangle
P cube oh so we're not gonna do that so
next what we also know is that opposite
sides are parallel now you might not
think that that helps but remember
parallel lines when cut by a transversal
which could be either P N or M o have
special angles that are formed so for
our next step we're gonna say that MN is
parallel to P oh and MP is parallel to n
oh and that if rectangle then opposite
sides are parallel so if you notice
since these two are parallel and they're
cut by this transversal PN that means
that this angle is congruent to this
angle because remember if two lines are
parallel alternate interior angles are
congruent and since we have two
transversals that cut these two parallel
lines we can also say that this angle is
congruent to this angle so we can do
that in the same step we can get angle m
and Q congruent to angle let me think
MN q congruent to o p q
and we can get angle and m q congruent
to angle
Oh cute and that's if lines parallel
then alternate interior angles are
congruent and then in this last step we
can say that the triangles are congruent
because we have an angle a side and an
angle letter congruent so triangle MQ
ends congruent to triangle P Q oh by
angle angle side angle so now we're
going to take a same problem and do it a
different way so we our first two steps
are still gonna be the same we're gonna
rewrite our given rectangle given and
we're also gonna say that M and is
congruent to P oh and that's if
rectangle opposite sides are congruent
so we have this congruent to this
now if you look angles n which is this
angle right here an angle PQ o right
here are a special kind of angle they're
vertical angles so we can get those two
angles congruent by vertical angles so
angle MQ ends congruent to angle P Q o
if vertical angles then congruent so now
we have a side and angle and we either
need another angle
or another side so now we're gonna use
what we did in the last proof to help us
out a little bit since we only need one
more angle to be congruent we can use
the fact that these two lines are
parallel which we would have to rewrite
so let's do that first
so um and parallel to P oh and like I
said you could do the same thing and get
em P parallel to n oh but that doesn't
really help you for this particular
problem so we're not going to write that
so if rectangle opposite sides parallel
and then we can get one of these
alternate and pairs of alternate
interior angles congruent it doesn't
matter which one so I'm just gonna pick
it I'm gonna make this get find this one
congruent to this one now so angle em
and I was congruent to angle QP and then
if lines are parallel then alternate
interior angles are congruent so finally
we can get our triangles congruent
now our reason for this is going to be
different because instead of having
angle side angle this time we have angle
angle side but that's still a valid way
to prove that triangles are congruent so
mnq I'm gonna write it the same way that
given does so MQ and congratulate you O
by angle angle side so this one only
took one more step than the last one but
I just wanted to show you that there's
more than one correct way to do a proof
so make sure you come back
and watch our next lesson where we're
going to talk about radians</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
