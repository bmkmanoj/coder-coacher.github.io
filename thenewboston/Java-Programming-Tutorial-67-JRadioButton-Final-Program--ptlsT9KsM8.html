Java tutorial and in this tutorial we're
going to be finishing this program
demonstrating je radio buttons so where
we left off on the last tutorial we
pretty much made four different kinds of
fonts and now what we need to do is
pretty much take that text field and we
need to set it equal to a font by
default and we just need to set it equal
to a font by default so when the program
runs for the first time it knows what
font to use so I'm going to set equal to
plain font because I'm just a plain old
guy because had equal to different fun
if you want but I ain't gonna so now
what we need to do is pretty much create
an add item listener for each button so
I'm going to take that plain button
first and add item listener just like
that fun-fun-fun there we go got clear
on my throat and the parameter this add
item listener takes is going to be this
get on my way new handler class and for
the constructor we're going to pass in
the plain font now what happens is this
and add item listener pretty much shows
there and waits for something to happen
to that item which is in this case the
plain button now whenever it does happen
what do we want the object because this
is a object in here and what do we want
it to do whoa
for the handler class is going to be
handling it or it's pretty much a code
that's going to happen if this button is
clicked we need to pass in plain font to
the constructor and let me go ahead and
add a comment so this wait for event to
happen and this what this does on pass
and font object to constructor and we
didn't even create a class or
constructor yet so this might be
confusing but I spelled constructor
wrong see this is a thing of a click
it's not only a a platformer but it also
is a spell checker so since I spelled
constructor wrong it corrected for me
how cool is that compiler and a
spellchecker double banger so now let's
go ahead and add this for roll the rest
of them copy this and put that's for a
bold button italic button and bold in
italic button so bold 1c italic button
is IB and bold and italic button of
course we need to change these to bold
font and under set italic font was ITF
and the bold and italic font was that so
now we pretty much got our constructor
of our main class built now we can go
ahead and we're giving this error
message because handler class is not a
class yet so let's change that right now
let's go ahead and make a handle request
and we're going to put this inside the
other class so let's go ahead and make
private class and your lower a little
alert class right there no my sound
didn't mess up I actually just said that
implements item listener and you guys
know what implements means from the last
tutorials so inside my handler class the
first thing I'm going to want to do is
create a variable since I you know we're
just going to need one it's going to be
a font variable and I set it equal to
the name of font because I mean make
sense right the next thing I'm going to
want to do is create that constructor
that we used up here now as you can see
that constructor takes a font object as
its argument so we got to make sure we
have a foreign objects as argument when
you create it so let's go ahead and make
public and alert class and let's go
ahead and put like font and just name it
f or something
so now plus I'm look at EF so now in our
constructor for this and make sure yep
looks right to me let's go ahead and
just add font and set equal to F and now
let's see what error I'm again oh I must
inherit the abstract method item
listener item state change so since we
use item listener it has a method in it
cut item state change that we need to
use so let me add a come
to here and what this does is the font
object gets variable fun this is pretty
much just changing the object we pass in
to the variable font so now that we
implemented from item listener we need
to use that method called item state
change so let's go ahead and make a new
method called public void doesn't return
anything item state changed and if I
spelled that right we should be good so
now this argument takes the item event
in which name it events and for this in
the body let's just go ahead and have
something like text font and we'll set
it equal to set font for that font so
now if I do this my error should go away
but they're not so I'm going to positive
figure out what's wrong okay guys I
found my error and it was really
embarrassing actually
fourth constructor of handler class up a
handed class and I spelled it wrong so
you definitely need to put handler class
and spoil your constructors right pretty
embarrassing if you ask me so you know
not going to let it happen again I
promise
so now that we got all that change let's
go ahead and well pretty much I'll add a
comment for this for ease of reading I
will put sets the font to the font
object that was passed in looks good so
well I'm go ahead and run this then I'll
talk you guys through it so I'm just
going to use my same object from last
oriole if you didn't watch my less start
up and pause the video right now and
copy that and I'm just going to go ahead
and run this and hopefully it works so
now we got Bucky is awesome as hot
uh-huh thank you and it's plain by
default like we said before and now you
can see these radio buttons since
they're part of a group then whenever we
click one then the rest uncheck and that
is because they are part of a group and
they're able to see each other or know
each other is doing and that's some
built-in
methods that allow you to do that so
that's pretty cool right there so let me
talk you guys one last time through how
we did this well let's see let's just
get to the hard stuff we made variables
we added a we added all the stuff this
screen right here BAM
here's confusing stuff aside from adding
all the stuff to the screen here's what
we did we pretty much need to add add
item listener to each button so that
something can sit on those buttons and
wait for it to be click or unclick now
add item listener this built in method
it takes this handler class object as a
parameter so what this is is pretty much
saying all right we're going to be
waiting for something happen and as soon
as it clicks then I'm going to call this
class right here and that's the code
that's going to happen when this event
happens so now that we told it all right
we want you to wait for something to
happen and when it happens do this we
said all right what do we want to do
well we created a new handler class and
the constructor for that class is called
handler class of course and it takes a
fob object so let's go ahead and look at
that constructor right now the
constructor all it does is it gets that
font which was plain font and sets it
equal to the name font or the variable
font and why do we need to set it equal
to this variable so we can use it later
on to set the font so pretty much we
took that font set it equal to the word
font and then in the item state change
which pretty much is the event that
happens when it's clicked it takes that
font and sets it equal to plain font
bold font italic font or plain and bold
font or simply bold and italic font so
now that we have a constructor in our
item state changed we're good to go
and we were able to run the program so
that's your real quick tutorial of radio
buttons and the last thing that you guys
don't want to forget don't forget to
group your buttons right here set equal
to new button group objects in this
group allows your buttons to be one big
family and allows them to see what each
other is
and this lets them know when each other
is selected or deselected so that's that
for this tutorial hope you guys learned
a little something not too much of
course so thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe don't forget to
check out all my contests and I will see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
