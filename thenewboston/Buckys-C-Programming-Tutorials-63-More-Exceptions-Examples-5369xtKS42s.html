tutorial and in this story I'm going to
be showing you guys another example of
exception handling so let me go ahead
and I want to cover you know one other
little inky dinky thing it isn't a main
concept but if I don't cover this I'm
going to you know it's like OCD I need
to cover or else it's going to bug me
for the rest of my life so let me go
ahead and first what I like to do is
this whenever I'm working with exception
handling I like to set up the framework
first so I like to go ahead and put try
right there and after this put catch
with my parameters right like that and
that way whenever we get you know type
in a bunch of code in here I don't have
to go search and be like alright what's
this curly brace go to with these
parentheses go to it's really easy if
you set up the outside first and work
your way in then that way you don't get
confused
so let's go ahead and in this program I
just want to build a really simple
calculator I'm going to have the user
input two numbers and I'm going to make
sure that the bottom number is not zero
because remember you're not allowed to
divide by zero or else the you know your
computer is going to blow up so what I
like to do first is a well before I even
do that let's go ahead and just start
with the program so let's go ahead and
make two variables in num1 and i'll save
in um two for later so let's go ahead
and give the user prompt like see outs
and we'll just say something like enter
first number and line
and now let's go ahead and give them a
way to enter that number into number one
and by the way I read this a couple days
ago and maybe this will help you guys
understand this arrow on this arrow the
arrow shows the direction that
information is flowing now whenever you
output something it goes to your
computer screen so this text is going to
your computer screen now whenever you
input something it gets inputted and
stored as a variable on your computer so
the text that you enter is going to be
stored in a variable in your computer
you see where the informations phone to
your computer screen to your computer
basically the information is flowing to
the user and back into the computer
pretty cool huh
so I probably should have said that in
Lycia my second tutorial but you know 63
tutorials in I guess is better late than
never
so now the user entered a number and
it's stored in the variable number one
so now let's well I might as well just
copy this right here and copy this and
paste it right over here and we'll
change this to two so enter two it's
going to be sorted two and enter second
number pretty good so now after this
what we want to do is it really doesn't
matter what number they answer for you
know number one as long as it's a number
but number two it does matter because
the second number cannot be equal to
zero because if we remember from you
know fifth grade math class or whatever
you can't divide by zero it's illegal
the math gods will not allow it so let's
go ahead and have an error message pop
up whenever you try to divide by zero
and we can just go ahead and put a
simple if statement if num 2 is equal to
zero let's go ahead and throw an
exception so we'll just throw the number
zero and now what we want to do is
remember if number two is not equal to
zero that means that the numbers that
they entered were valid so we'll just go
ahead and print out the answer on the
screen num 1 divided by num
and in that line so basically if they
enter zero is the second number we're
going to get a error if they enter two
valid numbers is just going to print out
the answer by dividing the top number by
the bottom number so if we do indeed get
a error remember in the last tutorial I
tell you guys that you can pass in a
number two uses like an error reference
number and you can just erase something
see out you can't divide by X and that
way whenever we throw zero it's going to
pass zero and as X and it's going to say
you can't divide by zero so let's go
ahead and run this and see what happens
enter the first I'm going to first run a
program that works perfectly and our 32
buffer my first one enter 16 for my
second one and 32 divided by 16 is
indeed 2 as you can see here so my
program is working beautifully but let's
go sit ahead and say that we have an
idiot that's gonna you know never knows
how to use calculator and is going to
try to divide by 0 okay 32 okay
everything is going good so far but then
I'm going to try and enter 0 is my
second number and whenever I try to hit
this and solve this riddle we can see
you can't divide by 0 so as you notice
as soon as you get a error message it
basically just jumps right down to this
catch block right here and it says hold
on you did something wrong
here's your error message you can't
divide by 0 so now the little itty-bitty
thing I want to cover in this story is
this you can have multiple catch blocks
to catch different types of error
messages right now the only type of
error message I showed you guys is the
integer error where you can catch a
double arm you can actually catch a
character if you want you catch any
different type you want now aside from
covering that I don't need to show you
guys you know the different types of
error messages you can catch but what I
do need to show you guys is this little
thing right here dot dot dot you're
saying what the heck type is this a dot
dot ok I understand that I can catch you
know intz and characters whenever you
just want any error message to be caught
for example you don't know what error
message is going to happen in this try
block at any time any error message
occurs you just want it to be caught
right here then you can use the
da-da-da-da-da is pretty much the all
encompassing the default catch so
basically if you have in so basically
anytime an error message is thrown it's
going to be caught by the dot dot no
matter if it's sent in character yadda
yadda yadda so with that being said this
is the catch that you see most often I
just wanted to throw you guys the piece
of information that you can indeed catch
specific types of error messages but
this is the one you're going to see more
often so let's go ahead and try and run
this and it says alright and once again
I did something wrong oh I see what I
did I actually tried to pass an X and X
is no longer existing so I'm going to go
ahead and try to run this one more time
and you see it says enter first number
32 and then we try to divide by 0 get
error message and we get that default
you can't divide by error message so
typically you would want to write
something like this
it would probably make more sense but
anyways I just want to stress you guys
that aside from catching different types
of error messages you can also catch
general error messages and that's what
we're going to be doing most of the time
so now that you understand that you
understand most of everything there is
that know about exception handling there
are a couple other things that uh I
don't even know if I want to cover or
not there's like passing in objects that
you can catch and also um you know
inheriting from exception classes and
default messages and stuff but I really
don't know if I want to get in that I
mean we understand the basics so in the
next tutorial don't know if I'm going to
be covering more about exception
handling or you know jumping into the
next
but either way it's going to be amazing
so if you have any questions check out
my form the new boston.com slash forum
and yeah I guess I'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
