or actually start communicating what we
can do is actually I'm gonna store this
in variable called result give myself
some space to work with the command for
this is see URL underscore exe C which
means execute a curl communication
session and of course the parameter that
you need to give it is curl now what
this is gonna do is actually gonna start
the communication process but nothing's
gonna happen because even though all
this is stored in the string we didn't
print it out or anything so the first
thing I want to do is after we're done
communicating it's always good practice
to put curl close and this just frees up
in your resources and it closes your
connection it's just a you know proper
coding and so again all of the results
are stored in here but if we print them
out now they're they might look a little
fun because they're encoded right now so
actually what I want to do is I'm gonna
put make another variable and put
results and set this equal to Jason
underscore decode now this takes two
parameters the first one is what did you
bring back from Instagram we brought
back our just resolve law and the second
one is true and after this what I want
to do is again this just decodes your
data basically turning it from weird
data that is good for communication over
the Internet to data or in other words
PHP variables so we can work with them
really easy so now that we actually have
that information stored in the variable
results we can do something with it so
let's go ahead and get the username and
in order to do that this results
variable right here is pretty much
variables that we can work with with PHP
so if you put user
use your name and actually I can just
echo this out right here and it should
work then this is the line where it
actually prints something out on our
screen so hopefully I didn't have any
errors right there and if this works
I'll talk you guys through it one last
time I got to make sure my freaking
microphone is enough all right so let's
start from Oh from brand-new we go to
index up PHP it says login typically
type in your login information but I'm
already logged in so I'm just going to
go ahead and authorize this and it's
going to say wrong parameter for curl
close let me fix that real quick curl
close and we have to say what the heck
we want to close and now let's try this
one more time but if it work so that's
good thing
all right so lalala that first thing
never happened I'm user I logged in and
bam the New Boston so one more time I'll
talk you guys through this process
basically once the user logged in
Instagram gave us a secret code now with
this code we were allowed to access the
users information but Instagram said
alright if you want to start accessing
information in crab you need to
communicate with me in a very specific
way as to not let just anyone
only you know registered developers like
us communicate with it so these were all
the settings that we need actually these
ones up here and basically this was our
curl settings and once it pulled all of
the information from Instagram it's
stored it in this variable called result
now this was kind of weird decrypted or
encrypted information so we needed to
decode it
so we could use it in a nice set of PHP
variables called results and now with
those results we can just do things like
we would do with any PHP variable print
amount storm and database in this
example we just echoed them or
printed them out on the screen so echo
the username and my username is the new
boss then so anyways that's what we did
um I know it was kind of confusing but
um it gets easier from now on we're over
the hump and now we can actually start
doing more PHP stuff instead of like the
curl crap in the API stuff so anyways I
think guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
