to your tenth seat tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm going to be talking to you
guys about something called logical
operators now what a logical operator
lets you do is make a complex condition
or a complex test in our less tutorials
we learn that we can make a test using
like if number is less than 40 and this
was just a simple one test that you
could use but say you want to test
multiple things in the same if statement
well in this tutorial I'm going to be
teaching you guys how to use or how to
do just that by the end of tutorial
you're going to see how useful it really
is so the first thing we need to do is
get to variables I'm going to make mine
in eyes in oh yeah that's all we need
right now and let's put int toes next
let's set them equal to a value in or
actually let's have the user enter a
value so let's put print F um enter a
number of eyes and toes and there we go
right there I guess that's all we need
and then this will pop up prompt and
then on the next line let's give them a
way that they can actually enter that if
we're going to tell them to enter it um
let's put % d % d we're going to have
two variables
the first one is ampersand eyes the
second one is ampersand toes and this is
going to give you whatever values you
entered are going to be stored in eyes
and toes you should know that already
for my last tutorial next let's get to
what we've been waiting for this
tutorial our logical operators you make
a if statement and in the last tutorials
we could test one thing like if eyes is
exactly equal to two or we could test
something like if toes is exactly equal
to ten but let's say we only want to
execute a block of code if below excuse
me if both of these are true
so anytime you want to make sure that to
test conditions are true you add two
ampersands in between them two
ampersands in between two separate tests
means and and this means test this and
test this if they're both true and only
if both of them are true then we want to
want you to execute this block of code
and what block of code you might ask
let's just print let's copy this for
ease of time let's put you are normal
since see if you have two eyes and ten
toes then you're normal else let's
execute what are we going to say copy
paste that's right what are going to
write you are weird and I apologize the
people without two eyes and ten toes but
this is just for ease of programming so
let's go ahead and compile execute and
run this and let's enter our values and
then after I'll show you guys another
neat little trick and our number of your
eyes and toes so two eyes enter ten toes
enter you are normal since it checked
this test right here and it checked this
test right here and since both of them
were true it said you are normal but
what if you enter only in one of them
are true and the other is false what if
we enter to four eyes in nine photos
well let me show you two for eyes 9 for
toes since both of those test conditions
aren't true it went to the default else
statement and said you are weird now
again as I told you to ampersands or ant
signs means that only execute this code
if both of the conditions or all the
conditions are true there is also
another neat little thing called a
logical or and this is two little
straight up and down
lines and as you can see this is the
line if you holding a shift it's that
little key above enter on your keyboard
if you're using a regular keyboard and
too little up and down lines means or
and what or is means if this one or this
one is true
unlike two little ant signs where both
of them it has to be true only one of
these things has to be true for this
code to run or if they are both true it
will run but if they're both false then
it won't run at all so you can either
enter two and ten or you can enter
anything in ten - in anything but if you
enter if you don't enter ten for this
one or you don't enter two for eyes then
it won't execute so let me compile and
run this and I'll show you guys what I'm
actually talking about remember in our
ant statement when we enter two for eyes
in nine for toes it was false but if we
enter two and nine once you press Enter
is long is one of them is true it should
say you are normal in the only way that
your or statement is going to be false
and not going to run this if you enter a
number for eyes that isn't two like four
and you enter a number for toes that
isn't ten like thirteen and it says you
are weird so again to reiterate one last
time to and signs test all the
conditions and if they're all true it
runs a block of code and our sign looks
for only one condition
and as long as one of these tests is
true it's going to run that block of
code and this is really useful when
you're testing multiple conditions and
looking for many things that you want to
find true or looking for just one thing
you want to find true and it helps
condense your code and we're going to be
using this a lot later on so make sure
that you learn it so I'm going to be
copying all this code and putting it to
my website the new boston comm so if you
want it you have to go there and get it
but for now pay attention in this
tutorial make sure you learn what I'm
talking
I'll make sure to subscribe my channel
thank you for watching and I will see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
