36th C++ tutorial and in this story I'm
going to talk to you guys about
something called a multi-dimensional
array now a multi-dimensional array is
basically an array inside another array
so yeah I think about that for a little
bit and get freaked out you might be
thinking whoa this reminds me of
Inception a dream within a dream what's
going on and you guys are thinking oh
man this tutorial is going to be super
confusing I barely even understand
arrays and now you're going to say an
array inside an array all right well
here is an easier way to think about it
if you ever you know use Microsoft Excel
or maybe use MySQL think of it as a
database or a table a multi-dimensional
array is basically made up of rows and
columns so this is the easiest way where
you can think of it in its basically
whenever someone has information and
they want to organize it in rows and
columns they use a multi-dimensional
array so let's go ahead and create one
right now and I'll show you guys the
syntax for it go ahead and pretend
you're creating a basic array I'm going
to name mine Sally and instead of a 1
square bracket actually takes two square
brackets in the first square bracket you
write how many rows do you want to have
in your array let's let's keep it simple
and say we want to have an array with
two rows and for the second one it's
basically columns how many columns do
you want to have in your a so let's go
ahead and add 3 columns so now we have a
row excuse me now we have basically a
table that's two rows by three columns
aka there are six elements in this array
so in order to create um an array inside
an array it's basically exactly like you
would think go ahead and make your array
and just to tell you guys this code
blocks gets freaked out whenever you try
to put square brackets inside other
squirly brackets so that's why it might
be messing up when you try typing it but
anyways go ahead and as the first
element in your array you actually add
an array so let's go ahead and add
two-three-four so check it out we have
an array two three four inside another
array and this smaller array is the
first row so now let's go ahead and make
our second row or second array add a
comma and like I said codeblocks gets
freaked out whenever you try to do it so
it might be weird but let's go ahead and
in this array put eight nine and ten
so we basically made it two different
arrays one array is two three four and
the other array is eight nine ten so we
said our a we're creating a
multi-dimensional array consisting of
two different arrays each array is a row
in each value is going to be a column
and remember to separate your arrays
with a comma so basically this is an
array made up of two smaller arrays so
let me go ahead and draw this for you
guys visually like I said there are two
different rows one is two three and four
and the other one is eight nine and ten
so visually this is what our array looks
like this is all one array that's
basically made up of this array 2 3 &amp;amp; 4
and this array 8 9 &amp;amp; 10 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 is on
top 8 9 10 is on bottom two rows three
columns pretty simple huh so anyways the
basics of this is anytime you want to
create a multi-dimensional array go
ahead and list number of rows number of
columns and for the number of rows
that's how many arrays you create and
for the number of columns that's how
many values you add to each array and
then you end up with something like this
so if you're saying alright now how do I
reference you know how do I get to each
element in that array well let's go
ahead and just print it out on the
screen um of course print out Sally and
whenever you reference it it just takes
the two brackets the first index you
need is what row is it in and remember
the first row starts with 0 so anytime
we want to access element in this first
row we need to go ahead and put 0 now
remember 2 is going to be 0
oh three is going to be one and four is
going to be two so if you're right zero
two it's going to look at the zero with
Rho which is the first run and the
second element which is actually zero
one two so it's going to go zero two and
that's going to give us our four it's
basically just like coordinates I don't
know why I didn't say that before I
didn't cross my mind but basically
multi-dimensional arrays are exactly
like coordinates you're asked the
coordinate here start with zero in the
coordinate here so if you want to
reference nine that would be zero one so
go ahead and type one for that
and zero one right there so that let's
go ahead and print that out and I got my
nine so basically a multi-dimensional
array just like Inception is an array or
more than one array inside a bigger
array it's pretty much an array made up
of arrays instead of values and what it
does is it gives you the idea that you
can create a table basically made up of
rows and columns and anytime you want to
access one of the elements you just go
ahead and type in the coordinates which
would be the row number and then the
column number and you print it out and
there you go so if you guys understand
this then you're ready to move on to my
next topic in next tutorial I'm going to
teach you guys a really simple way to
print out a multi-dimensional array so
instead of you know just having to
comment this right here you have a nice
visual of what it looks like so if you
guys don't understand it then go ahead
and just go to my forum and ask me a
question and I'll explain it better
there but if you do or you know maybe if
you've got any good inception jokes then
leave them in the comments below but for
now thank you guys for watching don't
forget to subscribe and I will see you
in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
