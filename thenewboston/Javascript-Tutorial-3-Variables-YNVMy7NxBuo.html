JavaScript tutorial in this tutorial I'm
going to be going over variables now
while a variable in JavaScript is is
just a placeholder for something else
for instance a variable could hold a
long string of text or it can hold a
bunch of numbers or it can hold in an
equation for something out which is will
be gone over sin so the most basic
variable we have is just a simple text
variable and to do the syntax of a
variable we always start with a word var
this tells JavaScript our JavaScript
we're gonna be working with a variable
next so what ever eat up next is gonna
be our variable so if I want a variable
named name I wouldn't have to type a var
name now whatever you want the name to
be equal to we have to put an equal sign
and then close it and quotation marks so
I'm going to name mine Toni
Hass whoops
and of course of course quotation marks
now anytime you type a name in the rest
of your JavaScript it's gonna output the
value Toni Haas
so let me just show you guys let me make
an alert box and I type name right here
now instead of just outputting the word
name it's gonna output Tony Hoss so let
me save this as you can see that outputs
Tony Hoss and the alert box now besides
from just names you can also output
basic numbers so say we had a variable
named name and it was equal to 14
as you can see if you save it and
remember don't enclose your numbers in
quotation marks as you can see the
variable name is now equal to 14 and
besides just being able to use variables
to store little pieces of information
you can also use it to store equations
for instance if we had the variable name
and
we wanted to make an equation say 14
plus 32 times 55 divided by 4 now the
variable name stores the value for
whatever the heck of this is so let's
save this refresh it and as you can see
JavaScript X is huge calculator and
stores the value of whatever the word
name is in that so why is this useful
it's useful because instead of every
time you wanted to type this whole long
equation in the rest of your code all
you have to type is the word name and
it's equal to this equation so say you
had you're going on and you're typing
some more and you had some code down
here some code down here anytime that
you changed your code say you want to
make that 13 instead of 14 you wouldn't
have to go and change this equation in
this equation in this equation
JavaScript would automatically apply the
changes to each one of these
automatically so it saves you a bunch of
time and a bunch of work so just making
a single equation or a string of text
and applying it as many times as you can
so now that you have a basic
understanding of variables in my next
tutorial I'm going to be going over some
more complex things that you can do with
them and a lot more useful things thanks
