and what I did between the last video in
this video is I actually added another
type of link these are called the list
links because the default links are any
links that you can use maybe in this
layout in this layout and remember they
were like grey and whenever you hover
over them they turn white well I need it
to add an extra margin whenever I was
making the links on the left so I only
changed one property and that is margin
left right here but anyways I added a
new class list links and whenever I make
these links right here they're gonna be
that class but anyways I didn't want to
go through a whole video teaching you
guys basically what I just said because
it would take too long and we already
know how to do everything but anyways
pause the video and add this code right
here from list links below to your text
file and once you do that you're ready
to move on so the only other thing that
I want to do here is I want to add one
more class to the footer menu footer
menu and that is the right class now all
we're gonna do the most important
property is float right now we need this
class because remember right now all of
our crap is floating to the left this
home button account profile whatever
programs you see how all of these
buttons are pretty much aligned with the
left hand side of the footer kind of
like text-align:left well some buttons
we want to align with the right hand
side for example this logout button we
want it on the right hand side of the
footer and also these little icons when
this is fullscreen those are on the
right hand side as well so how do we do
that well we do that with the right
class so most importantly flow right now
for right this is just pretty much
housekeeping stuff zero pixels and
margin right we want this at two pixels
so it isn't exactly butted up against we
have a little bit of space now for
border right
we want none and I'll show you guys what
I'm doing right here you see how each of
these buttons it has a right-hand border
only and that's to separate you have a
really thin line right here that
separates the account from the profile
and the profile from whatever this is
you see how we have that line right
there well that is actually a border
right however on this logout button we
don't want a border right because that
would mean we have a border right here
between pretty much the browser and
nothing we actually want to move that
border to the left hand side so then we
have a border between the log out in the
icons so that's what we're doing pretty
much moving the border from the right to
the left
so border right equals none border left
however equals one pixel solid rgba
black and it's about 30% opaque make
sure that this is the same border that
you set earlier just border left instead
of right so that is basically all of the
styling that we need to do on the
buttons in on the overall footer now I'm
gonna be teaching you the last main part
and this was I've been talking about
forever the different layouts so I said
that we have a 1 column layout a two
column layout and a three column layout
so let's go ahead layouts and style
those layouts right now now just to
recap one last time whenever I talk
about a one column layout a two column
layout in a three column layout I'm
talking about this entire drop up menu
so this entire drop up menu is a layout
a one column layout this entire drop
menu is a three column layout so just
remember whenever I say layout I'm
talking about the entire drop up menu
now whenever I say individual columns
like column 1 column 2 then I'm talking
about this so this is column 1 this is
column 2 and if I say that one column
takes up like has a colspan of two this
one I'm talking about you guys are going
to see right now alright so
first thing we need to do is we need to
style every single layout or the default
styling that all layouts are going to
have so this is how you do that
footer one column layout and you can
actually just copy this and if you guys
didn't know how to style multiple
elements with the same well it's kind of
like a cheating technique how to style
multiple elements at once this is how
you do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
