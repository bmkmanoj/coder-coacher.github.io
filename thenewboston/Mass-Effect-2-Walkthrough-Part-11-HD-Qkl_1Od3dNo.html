to talk to you if I have questions mr.
clean
depends on the questions you run Omega 0
I am Omega
but you need more everyone needs more
something and they all come to me I'm
the boss CEO Queen if you're feeling
dramatic it doesn't matter Omega has no
titled ruler and only one
don't fuck with Aria
I like it easy to remember if you forget
someone will remind you then I toss your
sorry ass out the nearest airlock
so what can I do for you I'm trying to
track down our key you and half of Omega
you want him dead too I'm putting a team
together he's on my list interesting
you're gonna make some enemies teaming
up with our gain Joe that's assuming you
can get to him he's in a bit of trouble
right now what time in trouble the local
merc coupes have joined forces to take
him down they've got him cornered but it
sounds like they're having trouble
finishing mom they've started hiring
anybody with a gun to help sounds like
that might be our ticket in they're
using a private room for recruiting just
over there I'm sure they'll sign you up
what can you tell me about our Cajun not
as much as I'd like he showed up here
several months ago and started causing
all sorts of problems if you make your
own laws which everyone here does he
makes life difficult he's reckless and
idealistic but he seems to know enough
to stay clear of me I appreciate the
help see if you still feel that way when
the Mercs realize you're here to help
him I'm looking for board and solace you
know where I can find him the Silurian
doctor last I heard he was trying to
help plague victims in the quarantine
zone I always liked Morton he's is
likely to heal you as he is to shoot you
what can you tell me about it used to be
part of the Silurian special tasks group
he's brilliant
and dangerous just don't get in talking
it never shuts up if you really need to
find him take a shuttle to the
quarantine zone no guarantee they'll let
you endorse thanks for the information
yes just try not to bring the plague
back with you
here you were true why don't you step
inside you'll get paid in the job's done
just like everyone else there's nice you
three look like you could do some damage
looking for a good fight you can say
that standard fee is 500 credits each we
get paid when the job's done if you die
your friends don't collect your share
you'll need your own weapons and armor
looks like you got that covered and no
this does not make you a member of the
Blue Suns eclipse of the Blood Pact you
are a freelancer period any questions

transport Depot outside the club one of
our boys will take you from there sat in
