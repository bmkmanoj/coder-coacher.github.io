the very first video of a little
miniseries I want to say because I'm
going to be showing you guys how to
build the basic framework of a common
piece of software and that includes I'm
going to be first showing you guys how
to make a drop-down menu of course
pretty much every software you buy
nowadays have these menus at the top
where you click and they drop down I'm
also going to be showing you guys how to
make a toolbar so that is of course
right under your main menu at the top
they're going to have these little
common tools that you can use cut copy
paste arm print all that stuff so those
are the common tools that you see in
pretty much every piece of software and
the last thing I'm going to be showing
you guys how to create is this little
it's actually called a tooltip bar or
status bar at the bottom basically it
gives you the current status of your
project it says you just saved it or you
have like 10 line selected pretty much
this little indicators to let the user
know what's up so those are the common
core pieces of pretty much every
software even the one we're using right
now could just demonstrate on this but
that's what I'm going to be showing you
guys how to do and they're actually all
built in to kinter so we're not just
like going to be creating them from
scratch making anything like located at
the top all of this crap is actually
built-in so pretty freakin cool it makes
it really easy so the first thing I want
to do is this of course a typical piece
of software or whenever you have a drop
down menu and hit save as it's obviously
going to save your project but I don't
have time to show you guys all the
functionality so I'm just one of many I
just want to make like a really simple
function and I'll just name it do
nothing and I'll call this whenever I
like click an item in the drop down menu
just so I can show you guys how to call
functions from those menu items but of
course I'm not going to be building like
an entire text editor this is just an
example to teach you guys so whenever I
click something will just print
something stupid out on the screen it'll
be like oh do nothing okay
okay I won't so this will be the most
complicated piece of software that did
nothing that you have ever built in your
life so get excited because I probably
can't sell it for millions but you will
learn a whole bunch of cool stuff so
after this what I want to do is I
actually want to throw this route right
under there so I'm going to build a
basic function and then I'm going to
create our main route window so right
now we have a blank main window so of
course what I tell you guys I was going
to do first show you how to create a
menu at the top so this is actually
really easy of course whenever you want
to create an item and kinter you have to
give it a variable or an object name and
in order to create a menu the class for
this is menu so set it equal to menu and
then it says okay
you want to create a menu where do you
want to put it well we only have one
window and it's called root so why not
stick it right in there so now we have a
menu object appearing in our main window
the only other thing we need to do now
is configure it to make sure that kinter
recognizes it is a menu and I'll explain
this later on
so root config this pretty much says
okay I'm going to configure a menu
that's the parameter and it says well
what is your menu
well we actually named a menu so this is
actually the parameter name and this is
just the name I gave it actually like I
typically don't like the name objects
the same as a parameter but for some
reason I don't know why maybe I'm just
weird um it's just really easy to make
sure you have everything in the right
place a lot of times when you're working
with Kinser so this pretty much says
we're configuring a menu for this piece
of software that we're building and it's
this this one right here menu and the
cool thing about this is Kinser already
has on the knowledge of how to make
menus you don't need to explicitly say
okay put this at the top it already
knows whenever you configure menu
to put it at the top it already knows
what items to accept it pretty much
takes all the hard work and does it for
you
so right now in this line of code it
already puts it at the top and prepares
it for um for you to build more stuff on
it
how freaking awesome is that so the
first thing we want to do is let's go
ahead and make this file right here we
drop down functionality so actually
let's copy this right here so we'll make
a file and edit drop down and we'll add
some of these items as well so the first
thing I want to do is I want to create
that submenu so of course this submenu
would be the thing that drops down so
I'll name it submenu and set this equal
to of course it's a menu item so menu
and where is this going well it's not
going in your room it's actually going
inside another menu so menu so right now
we're creating a menu item within this
main menu because this right here is
pretty much just a blank menu bar at the
top and now we're pretty much building
the pieces to put inside it so what we
have to say after this is okay we want
to add an item that has drop-down
functionality and drop-down
functionality is called cascading in
kinter so take that menu which is our
main blank menu and we want to add a
cascade in other words we're going to
add a drop-down menu to this well the
first thing it asks for is give me a
label give me some text to put on here
well we'll just copy this one input file
so this is pretty much the button think
of it and the next thing is says is okay
since this is Cascade what do you want
to appear or other words what's your sub
menu well how convenient we just named
it sub menu so what this line of code
does is it creates a file button and it
says okay this has the drop-down
functionality and this is the menu you
want to appear as the drop-down
so right now that's pretty cool but we
have nothing in our drop-down menu it's
just blank it says file and when you
click it just a empty void of the
universe drops down so let's add some
crap to the drop down menu so the first
thing I want to do is actually let's add
like two of these I don't feel like
copying them all so just the two of them
real quick so of course whenever you
want to add something to a menu type
what menu you want to add it to that sub
menu and it's actually add command now
what this allows us to do is not only
give it a label which is the text what's
this first one new project with some
dots so we can not only give a label but
we can also say ok the command basically
adds functionality to it so what
function do you want me to call whenever
you click new project well we'll just
say call this stupid function because we
don't have time to actually you know
write a sub window that allows us to
pick a new project whatever so now we
have one item in our drop-down menu or
sub menu so whenever we click new
project in our program is just going to
say ok ok I want so let's add one more
and what is this new so of course
whenever we want to add something else
just give it a new label and of course
typically you would want to point it to
another function but we only have one
function simple enough so now we have a
drop-down menu with two items in it and
actually I will show you guys how to
create this separator so you see above
settings and above import settings and
save all they're pretty much broken up
into different sections and this is just
to organize your commands so anytime you
want to create this a line it's actually
called a separator in kinter and it's
probably the easiest thing you'll ever
learn in your entire life
say this is my menu and all I want to do
is add a separator
how easy is that doesn't even take any
parameters
that's going to create your line to
separate one group of items from another
group it's just for the users so they I
don't know so they can see what commands
are related and what menu items are
related simple enough so actually since
I have a separator I'll add one more why
she add this one the exit one so we'll
say sub menu and of course we want to
add command and the label for this will
be exit and the command for this I could
just copy this will just put do nothing
so now we have like a mini version of
this says new project new and then I'll
have a separator and say exit simple
enough so now before I actually just run
this and show you guys I'll make one
more menu item edit just so you guys can
see once you have two you guys are going
to understand how to make like 10 a
thousand whatever so of course we want
to make another menu item so instead of
sub menu it's going to look a lot like
this on a man edit menu and set it equal
to menu menu so this is pretty much
saying we're going to create another
item in our main menu and now it says
alright well start doing stuff to it or
else it's going to be a pretty boring
item so the first thing we want to do is
menu and we'll just add a cascade so
this is pretty much saying how do you
want to add this well we want to add it
as a drop down functionality so the
label actually I'm just going to copy
this too lazy to type out like two words
so the label for this one is going to be
edit and of course the menu for it is
going to be edit menu now so we're
pretty much saying this is drop down
menu and this is a drop down menu so now
I'll just add one more line before I run
this program and that's
let's add something to it so on our edit
menu we'll add one other item to it and
what's in here actually this one changes
depending on what you did so let me add
redo instead so label equals redo and
the command can just be do nothing as
well so this program is going to do a
whole lot of nothing pretty sweet so now
actually let me run this and see if I
got any errors all right looking pretty
good so of course our file menu has new
project and it says now instead of new
because I'm an idiot I actually messed
that up toys now project and now all
right that's a little bit better all
right so file new project new and of
course remember this add separator
command on line 16 that's what this does
it adds that line between new and exit
so of course anytime you click any of
these it just prints out okay okay I
won't it calls whatever command and of
course edit we just made this one a
really simple item just had one element
on it or item whatever you want to call
it and they all point to this do-nothing
function but that is basically how you
create a main menu at the top of your
program and this is how you add
different items to it this is adding the
item and this is telling it how you want
it to behave and once you got that basic
functionality down you can go ahead and
add the individual items to each submenu
and of course remember typically you
want to make them call a different
function but right now we're just having
them all call the same one but this is
the basic framework for it so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to copy this
and put it on my forum so if you guys
ever want the basic framework you don't
have to you know go type it out a whole
bunch of times you can just copy it
paste it into your program and you know
just change basically these
Able's to make them however I don't know
however you want them to appear in your
own piece of software so thank you guys
for watching in the next video I'm going
to show you guys how to make the toolbar
at the top and also that status bar at
the bottom so alright I need like a
drink of water or something so anyways
thanks subscribe smell you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
