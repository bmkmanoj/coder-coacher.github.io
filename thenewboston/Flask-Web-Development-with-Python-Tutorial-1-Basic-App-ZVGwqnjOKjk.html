Roberts from the new Boston and in this
video series I am going to teach you
guys how to use flasks but first of all
wTF is flask
well flask is a web framework for Python
so in case you guys in know you can
actually use Python to make websites so
that's what we're going to be learning
in this tutorial so make sure that you
have a firm background knowledge of
Python you don't need to be an expert by
any means but have some background in
Python or else the rest of this probably
isn't going to make sense and I was
actually thinking about just making an
entire video at the beginning going over
all the features and explaining why
flask is awesome but then I was like
might as well just hop right into it
showing you guys a bunch of examples and
then you know it's going to become
apparent why it's so useful in handy so
that's what we're going to be doing and
of course to use flask we need to
install it on our computer so make sure
that you have Python installed on your
computer
of course and if you're using pip then
you can just write pip install flask I
won't write it I just said it so pip
install flask or if you're using a gyp
range IDE probably PyCharm and you go to
file settings from your project
interpreter you can go ahead and click
this button I already have it installed
right here but if you click this button
then you can install flask just search
for it and hit install but I already
have installed basically install it just
like you do any other package um you
know if you're using Python I'm sure
you've done a hundred times before but
there you go and the very first line of
code we actually need to import it so
from flask imports flask alright so give
myself some lines mmm mmm those lines
looking good
alright so the first line of actual code
that we have to write after the import
is F equals flask and this app is pretty
much your flask object but inside here
what we're going to do is we're going to
pass in name so a lot of people get
confused about why we're passing this in
and we actually just pass it in to help
out flasks and again think of this now
is just our main app our main entire
website so in every passing name what we
do is we actually help it determine the
route path because later on remember
we're going to be adding images we're
going to be adding CSS to our web pages
and whenever we help flats determine the
route path it helps to find the other
files a whole lot easier so just throw
it in there and you're going to be good
to go
now what we're going to do after this
and you're going to be seeing this a lot
and I'm just going to give you guys a
real quick overview of what's going on
right now but basically whenever we have
a website we're going to have a bunch of
pages we're going to have the home page
we might have a profile section we might
have an About section all of those
different pages what we're going to do
is we're going to actually connect them
to a Python function now this is called
routing or mapping
it's a weird terminology but let me give
you guys a real quick overview and I'll
show you guys what's going on so for at
app and I'll explain what this means in
the next tutorial what we want to do is
we just want to connect a web page so
inside these little single quotes right
here we're just going to write forward
slash now Ford slash is just the root
directory so this is in other words the
home page of your website what if we
wanted to do something with the profile
page well then it would be like this
what if we wanted to do something with
like the user about page well then it
would be like that
so remember write a / out in the
argument right here is whatever web page
you want to connect so under here just
write define index and the common
convention is to name this function
whatever your web pages and since it's
the root homepage it doesn't really have
you know set name so if it was like
about then this function under it would
be about but since this is just the home
page we can just name it index and
what we're going to do now is we're just
going to return something so I'm just
going to return something like this is
the home page alright so before we go on
any further let's figure out what the
heck happened this process right here is
called routing or mapping it's basically
tying a URL on your website to a Python
function what the heck does that do well
what you need to do whenever you deliver
a webpage is you need a return statement
so this means whenever the user goes to
your homepage it's going to return this
in other words this is what they're
going to see now eventually it's going
to be like cool HTML or if you're making
some API we might send some JSON code
but for this simple example whenever we
launch our web server and they go to the
home page is just going to say this is
the home page right on their screen easy
peasy now we actually need two more
lines with codes just to kick off our
server and make sure that our website
actually runs whenever we run the script
and that is this if underscore name and
we're just going to make sure that this
is equal to dunder main the whole
underscore main the Bhandar score and
we're going to write app run by the way
when I say underscore name I really mean
dunder name if you guys can see they're
actually two underscores right there but
then we're going to go app run and I'm
just going to write debug true since
we're in kind of developer mode and what
we're doing right here well I'll give
you guys an example of this all this
does is it says start this app start
this web server and we need to kick off
this file on our server and right now
we're just developing on our own local
computer but eventually it's going to
kick off on some web server and then
your website's going to start running
start delivering all these pages tomato
tomahto all right so what the heck does
this line of code do why do we need to
check why can't we just run this
straight up well this line of code is a
quick check to make sure that we only
run the app where we only start the web
server whenever this file is called
directly well wouldn't we
always be doing that well sometimes
people have it where they actually can
use this directly by calling it just by
right-clicking and running it or they
import it into another file so maybe we
made another file and we're importing
this into like our bigger program well
this says no no only run your app if
this script is run directly in other
words like it's your main file so that's
we're going to do and now check it out
we are good to go I'm going to go ahead
and right-click and run this and we're
going to get a little indicator pretty
much says that it is running so how do
we look at it well what we need to do is
if you go to 127.0.0.1 or localhost and
you go to port 5000 just go ahead and
refresh that and it's going to say this
is the home page now I'll show you guys
what happens whenever you don't have it
running so I'm going to stop the script
so right now we have this file but it's
not actually running and if I were to go
to it now it says this web page is not
available so that's another cool thing
about flask everything is nice and
built-in so that's how we're going to be
testing our web pages from here on out
we're going to be writing some code and
then we boot it off and then we go to
127.0.0.1 port 5000 and there we go so
alright simple enough looking good I
mean we understand the basics of this
already but there are a few other things
that we need to cover like why do we
have a decorator right here I'm not
really familiar with those and I don't
know how do we get more web pages how do
we um add CSS in images and all that
good stuff well we're going to be
covering that but for now I'm actually
cooking a lasagna and if I don't take it
out right now it might burn so I'm going
to go do that you guys play around with
this and I'll see you guys in the next
