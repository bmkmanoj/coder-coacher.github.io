this miniseries and let's go ahead and
get rid of all this crap right here
because we are only interested in the
view did load method now in the last
sorrow what we did is we saved all that
data that we needed or any data that we
need it into a file over saying all
right it would become a useless if is
just chillin there and file well we need
to do when we start up our program is
extract that data from the file and use
it in one way or another so the cool
thing about this is there's a method
already built in to when your
application starts up every time your
application starts up a method called
view did load gets called and what this
method is going to do is whatever you
want it to do so let's go ahead and
override this and you know make it do
what we want to do so let's go ahead and
first get a path door file so NS string
I'm just going to name a file path and
go ahead and set it equal to self path
of file so I mean we used it right here
right here do you guys see the
usefulness of having an own separate
method I mean check this out instead of
having to write all this code once and
then twice again we just caught it right
here in right here but anyways I'm
rambling I apologize so now we have a
path to a file so now we need to make an
if statement and we need to check if the
file exists and we do this with NS file
manager default manager file exists at
path file path so we're pretty much
checking if my file dot P list is even
existing and here is why we need to
check if it even exists first because
what we're going to be doing is we're
going to be grabbing the data from it
and trying to plug it into our text
field but if there's not even a file
there at all
and ever since all right why would there
not be a file there if this is your very
first time running this app I'm of
course as soon as you load your program
there's not going to be a father yet
because it didn't even run the code to
create it so it's going to try to look
for a file and try to extract data from
it that isn't there so that's why you
need to make sure that the file is there
before it starts getting that from it so
I notice if the file exists and any time
aside from your first opening time
running this app this is going to be
true so what we wanted to do if the file
exists is create an array NS array name
it array like any other one and go ahead
and set this equal to NS array allocate
some space in it with contents of em
just got their Xcode file now what file
file path there we go right there and
now what we want to do is remember this
file is pretty much an array and the
information we want from this array is
in the first object I mean we've covered
this in the less store so we want to do
is in our field I mean I'm just putting
it in my tech what's called text field
but you can put it on a label you can
just print out on screen or anywhere you
want but what I'm going to be doing is
taking the first object from this array
which is a string at objects 0 and I'm
going to be putting it in our text field
right here so now whatever was the last
thing we typed in our text field is now
going to get loaded in North text field
and after this we need to go ahead and
of course release our array why not and
sir saying all right we're done oh not
quite we need to do one more little
thing see there's kind of a weird thing
here you don't really need to understand
what's going on but anyways we're going
to be working with something called
notifications and we actually need to be
we actually need to register to be
notified um well I'll show you guys
what's up type the code for you i ah ok
shin there we go and just name this app
or something and get you I application
shared application and this is pretty
much our application itself and what we
need to do is in this code I'm go to NS
Notification Center there we go default
center add up server I just wait for it
to type it for me our ad observer self
which is this class for key path um yeah
we don't want to what's this method
right here give me the wrong method get
me wrong parameters at least all right
put semicolon right there and yeah so
get rid of all these parameters at
observer self that's good all right now
for selector evidently we're going to
build this ourselves at selector this is
the method that you want to get called
application will terminate there we go
now start with typing in some stuff for
us so actually have this copied over
here because let me just go ahead and do
this and I'll talk you guys through it
again anything that is in our you know
what's called don't worry about it if
anyways what we need to do is we need to
register to be notified anytime
you know back to the other thing you
don't need to understand how our
microwave works in order to use a
microwave but anyways these have to do
with notifications notifications are
pretty much how objects talk to each
other and what you need to understand is
this pretty much is the method that you
want to call you know don't even worry
about it just remember to add this code
and here's what I'm going to do whenever
we go over notifications I'm going to
tell you guys about it that would make a
lot more sense instead of throwing
everything at you once so I know it's
let's go ahead and build the story and
uh you know maybe if I have time to talk
you guys through this is that my
rambling so now we have an empty text
field and now let's go ahead and add
some text called bacon now let's go
ahead and close our program go ahead and
close and when we close our program this
application will turton terminate
notification will be called in hence
application will terminate that method
is going to be called so now whenever we
say we may go ahead play another game go
ahead and play chicken bounce play
here's a little game i'm working on
chicken bounds chicken bounce bounce
chicken all right now I did that came
back and check it out our bacon is still
there sir saying all right how did this
work well what we did it first is we
called view did load so it says all
right the first thing I'm going to do is
check if a file exists it does so now
what I'm going to do is get the contents
of that file and throw in my text field
so this is my text field that's what
happened and now whenever you closed it
like that application will terminate
terminate terminal will terminate gets
called and what this does is take
whatever information is in that text
field and stores it in your file so then
whenever you open it again it'll get
updated so check this out if you want to
change this bacon go ahead and change
this cheese and go ahead and close that
whenever you open it again lb cheese
it's saving data to a file and then
reading it again so this is a pretty
cool way that you can you know
safe high scores for games user settings
and everything like that so I hopefully
hope this tutorial is in over ten
minutes and again like I said
notifications are a huge topic way too
confusing tell you guys about and you
know five minutes so I'm going to have
to tell you guys about those later but
anyways just go ahead and include that
code for now I promise I'll clear things
up later and yeah that's all I have for
you for this story so thank you guys for
watching don't forget to download my app
I'm super excited about it and yeah i'll
talk to you guys later see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
