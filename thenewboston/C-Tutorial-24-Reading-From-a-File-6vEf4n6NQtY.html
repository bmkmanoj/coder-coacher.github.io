tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
to show you guys how to read a file I
already showed you guys how to write a
file so it only makes sense so the first
thing that we're going to need to do is
include smart libraries so let's go
ahead and put include and the first one
we're going to include is something
called f Stream I think we include this
last story but i deleted it since then
so and another one we want to include
about their own another one we want to
include in the last one for this
tutorial is a c' STD lib i believe this
is a c standard library and this F
stream is going to let us read files and
we need a method from the C standard
library because we're going to be using
just one function to shut down in case
everything goes around so not really
important not part of the tutorial but
you definitely need them so how this
program is going to work is we're going
to show a blank line on the screen and
we're going to have the user type the
name of a file they want to open and
when they open it it's going to read
through it so let's go ahead and the
first variable we need is a file name so
care file name and just set equal to 50
or something should be plenty enough
unless you have some huge file names so
the next thing we need to do is in order
to open files we need a special object
um to open them so I'm going to name my
object Bucky
so from f if stream go ahead and give it
a object again I'm going to name my
Bucky you can name yours whatever and
now anytime we want to work with files
we have to use that Bucky object and
this can use the functions to open files
read files write files but anyways
that's the object you need so the next
thing we want to do is give the user an
opportunity to write whatever file they
run open so of course use your C in
and get line and this is going to give
them a cursor of course and whatever
they write is going to be stored in
filename and just put 50 again make
sense and now after they enter that
there whatever file a name they type is
going to be stored in the variable file
name right here so now what we wanted to
do is open it using our file object so
Bucky again open
that's a built-in function in C++ and
let's go ahead and open file name the
parameter it takes is what file you want
to open and of course don't forget your
semicolons like I've been so now what we
have here is I'm pretty much made a
variable and object we set all right go
ahead and enter a file name and then I'm
going to open that file so now let's do
some housekeeping stuff the first thing
we need to do is test if the file is
open and if it isn't we want to exit the
program immediately so let's go ahead
and put if and play explanation point
Bucky is underscore open and this would
test Bucky is open will be true if it
opens so if explanation point it means
all right if this is not open what do we
want to do there we go well what we want
to do is exit and then go ahead and
right exit underscore failure and um
this if you're wondering where this
function came from this came from the C
standard library so if the file can't
open we just want to exit the program we
don't want to you know this is a simple
program I'm going so you know no need to
do anything else so easy enough and let
me scroll up right here so I can show
you guys a little more and now we can
move on so the next thing we want to do
is if the file is open then actually do
something besides just having a blank
cursor sit in our screen so let's make
another variable called a word and set
it equal to 50
and I'm sure having been you figured my
semicolons I've been programmed Python
all day so I might forget my semicolons
might not so the next thing we need to
do is get the value the first value from
that document so go ahead and get word
and now let's say while Buckey good
again good is built-in function and this
is going to say all right Wow we aren't
to the end of the file yet and don't use
is open because if you use is open then
it's going to keep going so good is a
function that means all right as long as
you aren't to the end of the file and
remember this um while loop is only
going to run if the file is open so we
don't have to test for that and what do
we want to do if the file is open well
let's go ahead and just output to the
screen what's in the file so see out
word remember that's the value and then
let's go ahead and add a space in
between because if we don't it's going
to look like huge long word because
whenever it loops through it's going to
emit two spaces so let's go ahead and
after that let's go ahead and just get
the next word so let me run this for you
guys in as you can see well you can't
see it crack I tried drag it didn't work
but anyways I have a file in the same
directory named beefy and I'm going to
go ahead and open that so execute
compile and run come on baby see how
many errors I got come on come on error
go so let's go ahead and type in beefy
dot txt go ahead and there's only one
sentence is it says this is a new file
that Lai ya tid oughtta and if you don't
believe me here's beefy right here this
is a new file BAM so let's go ahead and
try to enter a file that we don't have
um let's go ahead
see I had beefy in that same directory
but I don't have a file called like um
tuna fish or something so tuna fish dot
txt
open that it exits so let me show you
guys one more time how this works we
went and we cluded this stuff so we can
use the built-in functions that came
with what we want to use you should know
what what those mean but here's to the
meat of our program we first made a
variable called file name because
whenever they inputted that we need
something to store their file name in we
next built an object so we can work with
files we had them in put something on
the screen and it's stored it in the
variable file name we next opened that
file depending on what it was we set our
array if that's not a file and if we
can't open it just exit the program like
we did when we type tunafish but if it
is then do this what you need to do is
we need to make a new variable to store
the values each value was a word so
that's why I named the word and then
what this did is just loop through each
word and put a space in between and at
the end of that of course system pods
return nothing yadda yadda yadda not
that exciting but you need to know it so
that's your quick tutorial on how to
open files and how to read from them
again this isn't the ideal ideal wool
way you want to do this but this is
probably the easiest way that I can
explain so that's why I did that so
again thank you guys for watching don't
forget subscribe and I look forward to
seeing you in next tutorial so thank you
and I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
