Photoshop cs6 tutorial in this tutorial
we're going to be learning about working
with the linear and nonlinear history if
you were wondering what that was from
the previous video so linear history
follows a linear path within the history
panel and the last thing that you do on
here is the last thing that you actually
did on your on your document
what nonlinear you can actually do other
things within like the middle of the
history panel if you wanted to so what
we're gonna need to do is go into our
history options real quick by clicking
on this button up here go to history
options and just make sure the allow
nonlinear history is unchecked for this
part we're here at least so do a couple
things in your document to make your
history panel about this long or
something like that
so I've done a few things and now what I
want you guys to do or I'll just do it
is click somewhere in the middle so if I
go over here to the middle here you can
see now that all these things have been
great out and they've actually been
those steps have been deleted and these
are steps that I had before in the
document and now we're back to here so
what it basically did is a ton dude 1 2
3 4 5 6 7 they're on dude 7 times and
this is what I had 7 undo states ago so
if you click all the way done at the
bottom they're still there so that's
what the linear history panel looks like
so let's go and go back to our history
options and then this time let's allow
nonlinear history and hit OK let me undo
that right there
I didn't mean to click on that so with
that selected let's go into the middle
here and now you can see that all these
states here haven't been deleted
now I can just go in and add whatever I
want in this section here so I'll just
draw on this layer back here and that's
headed at the bottom as you can see so I
come down here at the bottom and now
I've got this whole snapshot looking
thing and now this is the latest thing
that's going on at the bottom so if you
want to go back and kind of like it
helps you like think outside the box
that I had two effects and things like
that to your document now I can always
get rid of this one by just going and
clicking on it and pressing oops sorry
clicking on the layer I clicked on
delete layer by accident and clicking on
the trashcan and it'll delete the state
there and I can click on the trash can
again to just delete that so that's what
the nonlinear history is like you can
click up here and not everything goes
away or is deleted or anything like that
one thing I wanted to let you know about
working in linear and nonlinear history
is that linear history is more RAM
efficient so it's less hard on your on
your memory working in nonlinear is more
RAM intensive I also wanted to let you
know that once you delete something in
your history in your history panel you
can't ever get it back so make sure when
you delete that you really know that you
want to delete something I'm gonna go up
and turn off my nonlinear history
because I don't really need it and I
don't want the extra intensity used on
my RAM so I took that off now if your
document is bogged down and you had
actually have liked the chance go into
your options menu here and you have a
clear history button and just be warned
that
when you click on the clear history
button there is no undo for it so I'll
just do that now so you can see what
it's like and what it does is it clears
everything before your last before your
last step so we've got that going on
there and it's pretty pretty useful now
the history panel works on every single
layer so if i do oh if i do something
with this layer and maybe move it here
or something like that it's gonna show
up in the history panel for and it's but
yeah it's definitely gonna show up in
the history panel and the history panel
is gonna contain history from all
there's not just one single layer when
you click on it so that's that that was
just something I was trying to get to
it's ready through you guys I guess so
that's about it for this tutorial thanks
for watching this one you learned about
nonlinear and linear history and how you
can use them differently so I look
forward to seeing you guys in the next
one
have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
