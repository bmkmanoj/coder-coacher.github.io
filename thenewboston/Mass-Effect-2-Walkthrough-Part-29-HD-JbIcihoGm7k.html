concerns about waking it yeah you've
said that a few times now a normal
Krogan is dangerous this one was created
and likely educated by a madman there's
no way he's getting out unless one of us
lets him out or unless oquirrh installed
some sort of failsafe or a malfunction
causes the tank to shut down I'm not
saying we take a crowbar to it right now
but I'm not giving up a potential
resource it's your decision commander
just be careful noted the cargo hold is
safe enough while I decide what to do
with them
commander he received a new message at
your private terminal
the subject is stable Shepherd
integration with onboard systems was
seamless stand by I'm gonna open the
tank and let him out Cerberus protocol
is very clear regarding untested alien
technology
I won't be second-guessed on my own ship
by my own ship do it very well Shepherd
the controls are online the switch and
consequences are yours
human male before you die I need a Ning
i'm commander shepard of the normandy
not your name mine I'm trained I know
things but the tank oquirrh couldn't
implant connection is words are Hollow
warlord legacy grunt grunt grunt was
among the last it has no meaning it'll
do I am grunt if you are worthy of your
command prove your strengths and try to
destroy me why do you want me to try to
kill you want I do what I meant to fight
and reveal the strongest nothing in the
tank have arrest what I want I feel
nothing for Oh kieres clan or his
enemies that imprint failed he has
failed without a reason that's mine one
fight is as good as any other might as
well start with you I have a good ship
and a strong crew a strong claim you'd
make it stronger if you're weak and
choose week enemies I'll have to kill
you our enemies are worthy no doubt
about that that's acceptable
I'll fight for you I'm glad you saw
reason offer one hand but arm the other
wise Shepherd if I find a clan if I find
what I want I will be honored to
eventually pit them against you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
