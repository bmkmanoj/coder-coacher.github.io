Photoshop cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy blackford today
we're gonna be talking about working
with the layers comp
our layer comps panel and pretty much
what the layers panel is is it takes
like snapshots of your document and
creates a layer comp now to bring up the
layer comps window you can either click
on this like magazine page looking icon
here and then I'll have the layer comps
or you can go up to window and then
click on layer comps right here and I'll
bring it up for you know all you need to
do is have a document open and then have
your layer comps tab here open so that
you can follow along so within your
layer comp panel click on the create new
layer comps button here and you can name
it whatever you want and I'll just say
v1 for version 1 and it's gonna apply
position apply the visibility position
or layer styles which is like blending
modes and things like that so and then
leave comments if you really need to so
I'm gonna click on all of them and hit
OK now all I need to do is maybe bring
something up new move around another
image
let's move this text around and we can
move this and put a layer style on it
we'll put a stroke around it real quick
so all I did was come down to this I had
the layer selected come down to this FX
and click on stroke and let's make it a
little bit bigger so you can see it and
hit ok so that's got a stroke this is
newly visible and this has been moved in
position let's create another one and
save v2 hit OK and now we can look
between these and see the differences
this is the version 1 this is the
version 2 and these are both saved
so you can have different versions of
your document using these layer comps
it's really nice or you can start out
and then like keep adding and if you
don't like it you can always go back to
your old layer comp that you started out
with first and then start over again now
you can just cycle through these by
using these arrow keys here to cycle
through your different Erica R layer
comps or you can just click on the
actual box next to the layer comp to
make it visible the button here in the
middle that looks like kind of like a
recycling thing that is the update layer
comp button and if I move something
around like I moved this down here I
could now update this layer comp and now
every time I look at it it's going to be
just like it is how I updated the comp
and just as easily to remove a layer
comp just click on the trash can here
which is the delete button and it will
delete it out for you no it won't be
there anymore
if I hit step backward edit step
backward it'll undo your delete there so
a good use for using layer comps is to
have a like an original version and then
versions with like effects applied so
we're gonna create two different
versions here and I'll just start out
with this one right here and this is
going to be double click on it to bring
this up and this is gonna be without
effects and I'll hit OK and this one is
gonna get deleted and then we're just
gonna add some effects so down here at
any of these that you want and inner
glow to this one okay and then I'll use
this one and then I'll add another I'll
use a emboss and bevel
just you can do whatever you want you
can see it just beveled the edges and
now I can create new layer comp and this
is called width effects
okay and then you get this where you can
see the different effects see you put
onto your image or with your filter
effects or with your filters also you
can do that kind of thing too so that's
how you can use layer comps to your
advantage and that's it for this
tutorial so thanks for watching and
