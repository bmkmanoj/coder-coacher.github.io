your 17th iphone development tutorial
and in this tutorial we are going to be
covering a new topic auto rotation is
going to be pretty sweet so go ahead and
create a new project view based of
course and go ahead and name this well
go ahead and name what everyone i'm
going to name i rot two and i'm going to
save it just like that now the first
thing we need to do is go ahead and in
your classes whatever you named your
class go to view controller dot m and we
need to scroll down go ahead and delete
this comment hate that comment I don't
know why all right so we see a bunch of
commented out methods right here but
what we are interested in this is in
this last commented out method so go
ahead and delete the comments from it
and by the way the methods name is
should auto rotate to interface
orientation so pretty much this is the
auto rotation method this is pretty much
the method that says what orientations
do you want do you want to be able to
turn your iPhone sideways and still run
your program if you want to be able to
turn upside down is still we're on your
program I mean that's pretty weird if
you do that in general you don't want to
do that but anyways what you need to do
is return yes for the orientations you
support and no for the ones you do so by
default the interface orientation is
only equal to orientation portrait this
pretty much means just holding it
straight up and down not landscape not
tilting it to left or right or anything
so I mean this is only returning yes so
it's pretty much only returning one
orientation so if we turn our iPhone to
the side of course our programs to run
but everything won't move around and
cool like you know when you're browsing
safari on your iphone or ipod when you
tilt it it like shifts the landscape
mode that's what we want to create a
program like this so what we want to do
is we want to pretty much support every
orientation except upside down so go
ahead and instead of it setting equal to
this one go ahead and set it equal to
all of them except and here's how you do
this so
if you wanted to go ahead and set it
equal to every orientation all you need
put is returned yes and that would
return yes for every single orientation
but now we want to set it equal to
everyone except UI interface orientation
moving like this p porcher and let's go
ahead and press escape upside down right
like that and by the way if you want to
see all your auto completes just press
escape and it'll show them to you so now
that we've got is UI interface report
your upside down so this interface it
says this is pretty much saying what
interface orientations do you want to
support we want to support all of them
except upside down and I know it's a
super long name but that's pretty much
what upside down means so go ahead and
build and build this and make sure you
don't get any errors and we succeeded so
now that's all the coding that we need
to do pretty sweet huh so go ahead and
expand the resources and go hop into
your interface builder by clicking view
controller XIB and now your interface
builder is going to pop up and let me
move everything around just like this
and just like this too so now hold on a
second all right got everything where I
wanted it so now what we want to do is
add some crafted screen and actually
rotate it and see what's going on so
let's go ahead and add six buttons I'm
going to go ahead and add one right
there one right there one close to the
middle as you can doesn't need to be
perfect and through at the bottom man
this is looking good
all right now once you got your six
buttons just go ahead and double-click
each one and add 1 2 3 4 5 and anyone
can guess what this one is six I
should've did it seven throw you off but
you know what that'll be way too
confusing so now that we got this built
I mean that's pretty much all we need it
so go ahead file save and then in your
Xcode go ahead and build and run so now
we got this awesome program with six
buttons that pops up so saying all right
let me just move my how do you tilt this
if you want to go ahead and simulate
tilting it or turning it I guess you
might be able to say go up to your
hardware and put rotate left rotate
that's a better work so now you see our
iPhone rotates left or our iPod what is
this by the way this is I guess it must
be iphone if it has these bars but
anyways moving on you see now that we
rotated it left I mean our buttons moved
around on that's what we wanted to do
right but you see let's see one two
three four where the heck did five and
six ago so I mean there's some issues
that we got to work out and we do this
in something called the size or well
it's just the attributes tab and that's
what we're going to be going over the
next story so now that we finally
learned how to support pretty much any
orientation we want and we learned how
to rotate our iPhone in the iPhone
simulator we're able to start correcting
these books so that's what we're going
to be going over in the next tutorial
guys it is super easy trust me no coding
involved or anything so you definitely
want to stick around for that because I
mean you don't even gotta write code and
follow along I have to do is sit back
grab some popcorn and watch soil so I'm
looking forward to teaching it ti so uh
yeah I mean that's how I got nothing
more to say why are you still watching
story so yeah I will see you later oh
yeah by the way don't forget subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
