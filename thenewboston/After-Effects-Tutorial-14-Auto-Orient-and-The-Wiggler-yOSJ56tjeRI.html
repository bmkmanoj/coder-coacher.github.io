After Effects tutorial in this tutorial
I'm going to be going over a couple
rotation things and we're going to be
using a tool called the wiggler in this
tutorial so let's just go ahead and get
started the first thing that I want to
show you guys is how we used to make
things rotate along a path before and
how they do by default so let's go ahead
and get your object it doesn't matter
what what what it is and get your
position I'm effect out and go ahead and
make three well actually you don't have
to make anything i'll just show you how
it's done just i make three key frames
and i'll show you that by default after
effects has this object kind of the same
level left and right when it moves along
a path but sometimes you don't want to
do this and you want the object to kind
of follow the path like it's kind of
going like a roller coaster and here's
how you do that anytime you want your
object to follow one or more keyframes
this is called auto orientation go ahead
and select the key frame 0 you want and
again if you click the property it
selects all the keyframes next thing
from there you want to go to layer up
here transform auto orient and you want
to put orient along path go ahead and
click OK and as you can see when you do
that your object is oriented along the
path which it aligns with or whatever
it's going so that is how you get an
object to go along the path so if you're
animating something like a roller
coaster or something like that it's a
lot easier and make sure when you're
done with that go to the layer where is
it transform auto orient and click off
or else it's going to stick with you and
it's going to be annoying when you're
trying to orient other stuff another
thing that I want to show you guys how
to do is something called the wiggler
and what this does is it
um pretty much as wiggles your objects
pretty simple so to open this you need
to go to window and make sure your
what's it called panel called the
wiggler is open make sure there's
checkbox next to it mine's already
opening right here so I don't have to
worry about anything what the wiggler
does is adds a bunch of random key
frames so in the middle of whatever
keyframes you selected so that it gives
it a wiggle effect and you can do this
to any property not only position but
position is most easy to see so go ahead
and select a two or more keyframes as
you can wiggle only one keyframe I'm
going to go ahead actually I'm going to
delete this middle one and right now you
see Charlie chupacabras just going from
left and right I'm going to want to add
a bunch of random key frames to make
them shake all over like a crackhead or
something so go ahead and select your
key frames oops accidentally deleted one
so select all your key frames and go
over to the wiggler in here is what you
need to select you want to pick apply to
spatial path now spatial and temporal
are actually two different things
spatial means in space and temporal
means in time and since position is of
course space temporal would be something
like opacity where it isn't like moving
anywhere just doing something over time
getting brighter or getting a dimmer so
that's a that's what temporal wouldn't
mean but position you always want
spatial noise type this doesn't really
matter in this case it's just so when
you look at your chart um the lines are
either going to be jagged or smooth it's
not really important don't worry about
that and dimensions again since this is
spatial these are the axes x axis y axis
do you want to do all the same most of
the time you want to click all
independently since you want all your
key frames to act independently the
frequency is how often it's going to
insert key
frames and magnitude is how um severe I
guess you could say the differences is
going to be so let's just go ahead and
say we want about um 11 key frames per
second and we wanted a pretty harsh just
so I can show you guys so now when I hit
apply you see that the wiggler added all
of these random keyframes in our
animation now if we see Charlie and we
plays animation he's going to wiggle all
over the place again um if we want to
only add a couple and not make it this
will probably be better and this is
where the frequency of four per second
and the magnitude of 18 as you can see
Charlie only Wiggles a little bit so
that's how you can get objects to wiggle
in and out and a lot of people don't
know this but and even if they've been
working with after effects for a while
but you can actually wiggle other stuff
besides position now I know whenever you
think a wiggle in your head do you think
of like an object of wiggling but you
can actually wiggle stuff like opacity
and things like that too for instance
let me go ahead and get rid of our other
wiggle keyframes on position if you go
to opacity just make two quick keyframes
and let's say let's put them at fifty
percent each put this at 50 and put that
one to 50 you can actually select both
of these and wiggle these just like you
would anything else and what this
happens what this does is it doesn't
really make your object wiggle like up
and down when you wiggle opacity it's
going to make it flicker on and off like
a light bulb burning out or something so
let's go to home apply it and as you can
see it added a bunch of wiggle keyframes
to our thing now press space and I don't
know if you can see it on youtube but if
you do this you can see that Charlie's
he's like flickering on and off
only play one more time for you and I
thought if it isn't good and you can't
see it I'll prove it to you right here
you can always look on the graph right
here and see your Wiggles um in a
graphic kind of way so this is the
opacity right here as you can see he's
kind of shooting up and down all over
the place so anytime that you want to
randomize it even more you can go to
your graph right here and you can
manually adjust it but most of the time
you just want to stick with the basics
because this wiggler gives you enough
control where you can customize it how
you want it so again that is how you use
the wiggler in Auto orientation to
orient objects long path and don't
forget that you can wiggle stuff besides
position any of your attributes you can
wiggle so keep that in mind in play we
play around with a wiggler a little bit
and learn how to use it so I hope you
enjoyed watching and I'll see you next
