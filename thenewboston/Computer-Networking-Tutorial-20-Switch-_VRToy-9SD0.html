video I want to talk to you about the
basics of switches what the heck they
are and when would you ever want to use
one so say that some company called you
and they said okay we have a bunch of
devices right here
all of these laptops and we want to get
them all online connected to the
Internet
now during their phone call with the
boss or whatever he's like art you know
what I also only want to use Ethernet
cables I don't want to use Wireless at
all because I was reading some article
online and I read that Wireless is a not
as fast and B it isn't secure as
Ethernet so we're going to hook all of
these up through Ethernet and no
wireless at all so right okay you know
what we can do that we can do that the
first thing we decide to do is we don't
need a wireless router so we just buy
this one without any wireless
capabilities so we hook up our modem and
we start hooking up all their devices
boom you're hooked up boom you're hooked
up boom you're hooked up and okay you're
hooked up too but now we're looking down
on a router and we're scratching our
head because on the back of our router
we only have four ports four different
places where we can plug in Ethernet
cable into so we have a bunch of other
devices that we need to get online what
the heck are we going to do to solve
this problem well check it out
dunt-da-daaaaa
this right here is a switch let me
change my color
now all this device does this switch is
it gives us more ports and let me show
you how this works so this router that
has four different ports four plugs in
the back that you can plug an ethernet
cable into so for the first three what
we're going to do is we're just going to
hook these up directly to the laptops
one two three these bad boys are online
now that fourth port instead of taking
it and hooking up to another device what
we're going to do is we're going to take
this and hook up the ethernet cable to
the first port in the
which and then what we're going to do is
we have all of these extra ports that
can now be used for additional devices
so we can take another Ethernet cable
boom boom and boom so check it out so
again that is what a switch is and let
me pull up a switch and show you guys
what it looks like in real life all
right so this is just the first one I
found it's the number one bestseller the
most popular one on Amazon and again
this is what it looks like in a real
life and of course this right here is a
five ports which one of these has to be
devoted to the router the other four can
be used to hook up additional devices
you can also choose to get a switch with
more ports but those are more expensive
depending on your need choose however
many ports you want and also you're
probably going to see the words
unmanaged and managed as well whenever
you're looking at switches whenever you
see the word unmanaged this means that
you can pretty much just take it right
out of the box plug it in and it's going
to work whenever you buy a managed
switch this just gives you some more
settings it allows you to monitor the
network
um maybe alert you and something goes
wrong it can tell you which parts of the
network are used more than others so if
you just need something really simple to
connect more devices then just buy an
unmanaged switch but if you want a
little bit more control over your device
then buy a managed switch and yeah there
you go that's the basics of what a
switches I'll see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
