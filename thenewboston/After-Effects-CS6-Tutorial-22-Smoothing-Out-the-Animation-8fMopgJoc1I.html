Effects cs6 tutorial for the new basta
and my name is buddy Blackford and this
time we'll be going over Keith a
keyframe velocity again this time I'll
be showing you a little bit about Auto
buzzy a keyframes and linear and I'll
show you like the difference between
them it should be a quick tutorial and
we might as well get started and let's
get on it so I'm using an arch with
three points this is my motion path that
I've used by animating position of this
tunic and so as you can see right here
this is how it moves in the previous
tutorial I explained
easy-easy 50 frames and how those help
make your animation more realistic and
smooth around the eye so what I want to
show you this time is when you add an
easy ease keyframe let's add it at the
end here f9 is the hotkey and it changes
to an hourglass and we know that it has
been easy ease because the for one it's
an hourglass down there and for second
the the frames in the motion paths have
been condensed at the end in the middle
here we there is a way to smooth out how
this tuna can goes around this curve and
makes it more appealing to viewers so
click on your keyframe in the middle and
hold ctrl and click on it again it
should turn into a circle now this is
called an auto bezzie a keyframe and
keep an eye on your points here the the
frames the little dots on the motion
path keep an eye on them while I switch
between Auto bezzie a keyframe and the
linear keyframe
well let's give me let's move it over
here you can see that it moves a little
bit to smooth it out which means I have
it in a pretty good position right now
so let me move it out of position a
little more you can see that there are
it's going to take longer to get to here
to this key keyframe then it will to get
down from here to here I hope I smooth
it out you can see now how it changes
the keyframes it makes it a little bit
more smooth so try I'll drag this back
in the middle and make for a smooth
animation there let's preview the
animation now he's coming up he's
accelerating out of it and then
decelerating at the end so that's
another way for you to animate the
keyframe velocity again this was just a
quick tutorial to show you that to get
off the keyframe to get off the auto
Bezier a keyframe hold down ctrl or
command on the Mac and click on it and
that's all for this tutorial hopefully
guys you learned something real quick
and we'll move on to the next tutorial
where we will be talking about the graph
editor and how to use that to make your
animations perfect so see you guys next
time have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
