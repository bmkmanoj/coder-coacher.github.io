tutorial and in this story as promised I
told you guys we're going to be building
that method switch views so I did not
lie not this time at least maybe a
little later so go ahead and copy this
from your interface file switch views
copy and paste it right under
viewdidload and paste it right there so
now let's go ahead and build body for it
and in case you guys forgot since the
last tutorial what this method does is
it's pretty much looks at which view is
currently being shown and if it's the
red view it shows the blue boot if it's
the blue view shows the red view simple
enough so the first thing that we need
to test is what view is showing so go
ahead and make an if statement and if
pop up those put self I'll type this in
10 out then I'll show you guys then I'll
explain one typo if self dot read class
view the super view equals nil then do
something server saying alright we're
going to be testing first if is this red
classes view equal to nothing so if this
red classes view is not being shown or
it doesn't exist then this is going to
be equal to nothing so if this is the
case then we want the red code to show
up because pretty much if this red view
is equal to nothing then by default it
means that the blue view is already on
the screen since that was the default so
saying alright if that red view is equal
to nothing then what do you want to do
well instead we just go ahead and
showing the red view we first need to
check if we even have a red object so
let's go ahead I mean like check this
out if it's the first time the user
presses that button we don't even have
an instance of that class yet so that's
where we're going to check first if self
dot read class is equal to no
and again this means if it's the first
time they press the button what we want
to do is we want to get an instance of
that class and make you know our object
from it so go ahead and read class just
name your object read and by the way
that's this is the same thing this week
that we did up here just copying it for
the red class instead the blue set it
equal to read class allocate some space
in it with nib name and the name name
for this is I named mine red window and
for the bundle go ahead and press and
nil don't even worry about that means
too confusing and for now let's just go
ahead and put self doubt read class and
set this equal to read so what we're
doing is we have this property already
in our switch class that we
automatically built called red class and
we're just setting it equal to this so
pretty much self-taught red class and
the red object one in the same really
easy so now once we created that object
we don't need any more red release
pretty simple so now of course once we
created our object let me make sure I'm
in the right one once we created our
object what we need to do is actually
show it on the screen so in order to
show on the screen we first need to take
that blue view and remove it from the
screen so blue what's it let me think
what's name blue class duh view and the
method to remove a view from the screen
is shouldn't click that remove from
super view and that's all you need to
put so it says alright I'm going to
remove some view from the screen what
one the blue view and now once that's
removed we of course you need to add to
read view to read view we need to add
the red view so self view and that's the
current view insert subview
come on view there we go red class dot
view that's the red classes view but you
guys can figure that out at index zero
so it appears behind the tab bar so we
said all right so that's simple enough
then we run no no so this is pretty much
checks if the blue view is on the screen
add the red view and now we need to make
the exact same thing backwards else if
the red view is on the screen then add
the view of you boo boo add the blue
view there we go so let's go ahead and
if self dot blue class is equal to two
equal signs nil if it's equal to nil
then go ahead and by the way if you're
saying all right we already created an
object then why do we have to create it
again well usually you wouldn't have to
but just in case your objects gets
flushed from memory you want to create
it again just to make sure you have it
and this happens sometimes if you have a
huge project sometimes your ipod is
going to delete memory automatically to
make a room for new stuff so anyways
just go ahead and create your new object
again so blue plus we'll get practicing
creating objects how cool is that name
your object blue again it can be the
same as before and of course this is
going to be an object from the blue
class allocate some space for it and you
know that in it with nib name tab and of
course the nib name is blue window de
xib but don't include the xib and bundle
set this equal to nail but put that
outside just like that and now we need
to do is set the property for this class
blue class set equal to the object that
we just created in the last line and now
once we're done with that object go
ahead and put blue release alright
pretty simple so now after we're done to
this else after that in the else
statement but outside the if statement
what we need to do is remove that red
class so red class
dot view remove from super view looks
good so we took the red out of there now
let's put the blue one self dot view
insert subview looks good blue whoa whoa
insert cellfood blue class dot the view
property from it and at index zero and
why did that's not Pablo did I mess
something up insert so few blue class
that view I mean everything looks fine
things were popping up though so anyways
I guess you have time to go ahead and
finish this class the only thing we have
to do is have two more little things
dealing with memory in your did not
receive memory roaring put if self dot
blue class view super view looks good is
equal to now so if that's equal to
nothing then go ahead and take self dot
blue class and set this equal to nothing
free up some memory and else it must be
the red one so let's go ahead and we
really didn't need those curly braces
but if self dot red class set this equal
to know and this pretty much just frees
up some memory like I said before and of
course when we are done with everything
all of our objects since we allocated it
we need to make sure that we release
them so red class actually we didn't
allocate these we retain them the same
thing you know doesn't matter and blue
class release and that is all we need to
do so these last two things i typed in
we're just for a handling memory i mean
i guess technically you don't even
really need them but it's really poor
program practice if you don't so that is
pretty much we did pretty much made a
bunch of different objects and switch
them out as appropriately needed and i
probably have a bunch of errors in this
but when we build it I will find a mom
will correct them but for now I mean it
looks pretty good right now so that's
all I have for you guys for this
torial in the next tutorial not again
would tell you guys not even give you at
this guy's a hint about what I'm doing
you guys are going to have to stay tuned
and see so anyways thank you guys for
watching over good subscribe and I'll
see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
