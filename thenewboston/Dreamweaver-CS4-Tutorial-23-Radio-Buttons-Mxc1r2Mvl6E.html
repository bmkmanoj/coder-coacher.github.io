checkboxes and in this tutorial I'm
gonna go over radio buttons they are
very similar in the way that you create
in the way that you use Dreamweaver to
insert checkboxes and radio buttons the
only difference in between the two is
that the actual little piece that you
click on and radio buttons is a circle
and the one in the checkboxes is a box
but the the larger difference is when
you're using radio buttons you can only
select one choice and with checkboxes
you can select as many as are displayed
in front of you so radio buttons are
useful when you want the user to only
select one thing like for instance if
somebody's if you you're creating a
forum where somebody is what you want to
know what their income is are you aware
you want to know what their favorite
color is or just basically when you want
to give the user a choice of selecting
just one particular thing so let's
create an example that shows a group of
radio buttons to select a color a
favorite color so you go over here
inside of insert and you click on you
click on a radio group and we're gonna
call this group color and we're gonna
say green and you can use tab to go to
the next instead of clicking it's faster
green blue blue let's add another one
red red and then if they don't like
green blue red I'm gonna add one that
says none of none of the above
and for the value I'm just gonna say
none and we're gonna leave leave the
default layout using line breaks and say
okay it's very similar to the last
example where we created checkboxes
except this time we have created radio
buttons so to prove that you can only
select one I'm going to launch this
after it's been saved and you can see
that you can try to select more than one
but the radio buttons are only gonna let
you select one particular piece inside
of this radio group so now you see the
differences in between checkboxes and
radio buttons the very two very useful
ways of getting user input when you have
multiple options and that is it for this
tutorial in the next tutorial I'm going
to be going over drop down menus and
lists very interesting stuff so make
sure you guys keep watching and
subscribe and see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
