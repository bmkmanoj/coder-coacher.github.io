with a video tutorial for the new Boston
in this video we're gonna be taking a
look at creating a jQuery plug-in but a
plug-in that we can actually go ahead
and pass parameters do different
parameters so I'm gonna go ahead and
create first of all a simple plug-in
that allows us to change the background
color of a particular element and it
will allow us to pass a variable with
this no obviously the actual idea of a
plug-in that you know can change the
background is quite pointless but in
this case we're just going to be looking
at the concept of actually passing
variables to functions so let's take a
look at what we've included on the page
before we start we've obviously got
jquery i've got this file called plugin
j/s which is where i'm going to be
writing my plugin and then I've got ext
dot J is where I'm going going to be
actually making use of my plugin so
calling my plugin so I'm gonna go ahead
and create a P element on the page and
I'm just gonna write just a paragraph
inside and when we refresh we can see
that we've just got just a paragraph so
at the moment this is obviously just a
paragraph in actual fact I'll go and
change these two strong tags just so
it's a bit easier to see so we've got
just a paragraph here and what we want
to do is we want to create a plug-in
which allows us to highlight the
background of this here with any color
we wish so we're going to be able to
pass a particular color to this strong
tag or any select that we use now
obviously inside say ext dot J s we
could go ahead and make sure the
document is ready
and then we could create a function
inside here and we could say normally
what we would do is strong dot CSS back
ground color and then we can provide a
background color for example yellow and
we'll achieve this effect here however
what we want our plug-in to do is we
want to our plugin to be called
something like highlight and then we
want to supply a color in here like
yellow and we want that to do the same
thing Oh in actual fact no we don't want
it to do that we want it to be color
yellow like that that's what we want to
happen and then what we can do is we can
give it multiple values as well for
example if we wanted to change the size
of it we could go ahead and specify the
size as well you know like we're
essentially learning how to use settings
inside plugins so let's go ahead and get
rid of that for now we want to go ahead
and start developing our plugin that's
going to take use of or make use of what
I've already said so let's go ahead and
first of all outline our plugin this is
just function and then inside a dollar
sign and then what we're doing is we are
opening up in two curly brackets at the
end of here we want to go ahead and
write J query so this is the standard
and correct notation for outlining a
plugin now let's go ahead and give the
plug-in a name so I'm gonna say dollar
sign dot F n and then I'm gonna give my
function a name or my plug-in the name
and I'm gonna call that highlight so
that is equal to a function and then
inside of here is our plug-in code okay
so this is the standard notation for a
plugin obviously I've already in the
previous tutorial talked about plugins
in jQuery but we're doing exactly the
same thing again but this time we're
gonna set up some allowed settings we're
first of all gonna do the color one and
then we're gonna say change and have a
setting called size or something you
know so okay we're going to create a
variable called settings and let's just
bring this up down a bit
so it's easier to see and this is going
to be an array so the array is going to
contain like color and then I'm gonna
say null
so essentially what I've done is I've
I've created a set of settings if you
wanted to do say more settings you could
come down here and just bring this in
and you could go ahead and say sighs no
now what I always do is I always set
these to null first of all and then
obviously they'll be defined when we
actually use the plug-in here so they'll
change so I always define them as null
just you know so I think it just looks
better and it's it's easier to work out
you know that you're just setting an
array with settings rather than you know
choosing default values however if you
did want to go ahead and put default
values into here you can and then if
they're not specified by the plug-in as
the user calls the plug-in they'll just
revert to the original settings but for
now I've kept it as null just because
you know I want to keep it I want I want
the user to actually provide me with the
color so the next thing we want to do is
go ahead and merge settings with with
that if we pass through to the plug-in
and we need to plot a pass them as
options so we passed them as options but
we want to merge it with settings so
these can take effect and we can
actually grab the values</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
