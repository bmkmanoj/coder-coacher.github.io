on the beach what they use to have
and it makes boiling water a whole lot
easier
well the sons Thurmond says so this is
probably gonna be my last video of the
night overall I say it was a pretty good
day I actually found somewhere that's
decent to stay it actually is a lot less
buggy
whenever you're by the creek in
especially with the fire going so I
should get sleep tonight it doesn't look
like it's gonna rain so that's one good
thing and I'm still incredibly hungry
like I can't even explain there's no
animals that I can catch I was really
really hoping to catch a fish today but
uh they're there but I just don't know
what I'm doing wrong I don't know how to
catch them I mean it's not like I have
the proper supply so so I don't know
what the plan is I have no idea where I
am my compass is broke no one knows
where I am so they're not gonna find me
I know I have to keep moving but any
time I I feel like I want to move I'm
afraid that I'm just gonna go to a place
that is a lot worse than here so part of
me wants to keep moving and tells my
feet just keep moving to find something
but pardon me also it just wants to stay
near the creek where I know this is an
okay place to be so but I need to eat
soon that's my number one priority so I
guess tomorrow I'm gonna get up early
I'm probably gonna stay here for the
majority of the day tomorrow and try to
find something to eat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
