tutorial that I'm making for the New
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to create your own
events so all you're going to need for
this tutorial is a button and a class
and inside of your class just make sure
you have a public property alright so
we're just going to go ahead right here
and create our event so we're just going
to save public since we want our event E
public and then we're just going to say
event alright now after the event
keyword we have to provide a delegate
and this delegate will decide the return
type of our subscriber methods and what
parameters will be passed to our
subscriber methods and a subscriber
method is basically any method that
wants to be called whenever the event is
raised or whenever the event occurs so
for example on this method right here is
a subscriber method it subscribes to the
bottom one click event so whenever the
button one is clicked then this method
right here will be called and the return
type for this method is obviously void
and the two parameters that are passed
through are an object called sender and
event arguments and event arguments are
basically just information about the
event and this right here is just a
default um delegate is called the event
handler delegate and that just means
that the return type will be void and
these are the parameters that will be
passed to the subscriber event an object
sender and this is basically just the
sender object or the object that it came
from and then like I said event
arguments are just information about the
event and the event arguments class just
on its own event art um basically has no
information about the event so if you
have no information to pass about your
event and its use on the event handler
delegate so we can just go ahead up here
and say public event and then put event
handler after it so this is our delegate
that we're going to be using for event
and then following the delegate we just
want to give a name to our event I'm
just going to call it arm on property
change because this event is going to be
raised whenever our property is changed
then of course we just have to end
the line with a semicolon alright so
basically like I said we just want this
event to be raised whenever this
property right here is changed
so we're just going to say right here
after it sets the name string to the
value that user sets this property to
we're just going to go ahead and raise
this event so to raise the event we're
just going to say on property change and
then right through here is where we want
to pass the parameters you have to pass
through an object sender and obviously
the object that it came from is this
class right here so we can just say this
and then for the event arguments we're
just going to create our own event
arguments so we can just say new event
arguments since we have no information
to pass through on the bow our event all
right so now we successfully have freed
in our event and this event will be
raised whenever this property right here
is changed and I haven't really
explained this yet but an event is
basically just a special type of
delegate and what makes it so different
from a delegate is you can only use the
plus equals and minus equals operator
with it meaning you won't be able to say
on property changed equals null so you
won't be able to wipe all the methods
stored inside of our event so you can
basically only add methods to your event
or take the map so that you add it away
all right so we're just going to go
ahead here and I'm going to show you how
to use this event right here so just we
have to create a new instance of our
class so my class is going to call it MC
instead of equal to a new instance of my
class now we're just going to want to
create a new event handler for our event
so we're just going to say MC dot on
property change you know what it's going
to say plus equals and then we're just
gonna hit tab twice so basically what we
did right here is we just add this
method to the event so now whenever the
event is raised this method right here
is going to be called and I'm just gonna
have a message box show saying um
property has changed because this event
or this method will only be called when
the property has changed so I'm saying
the property
as change alright and right now the
property hasn't changed so whenever I
click the button nothing's going to
happen yep and now if I were to go ahead
and change the property this method
right here will be called so if I say MC
dot name equals and then like Adam or
something then right here it's going to
tell us that the property has changed
because of course we did change the
property yep perfect all right and let
me just go ahead right here and walk you
through this one more time because it's
sort of confusing alright so right up
here we just created our event and just
set public events since we wanted to
make our event public and then we set
event handler and this event handler is
basically as a delegate and the delegate
like I said will decide what the return
type for the subscribing methods must be
and what the parameters passed the
subscribing methods will be and since we
use this default event handler delegate
on the return type for the method was
void and the parameters passed through
was an object called sender and event
arguments and remember event arguments
is basically just information about the
event and just the event arguments class
on its own basically means that there's
no information about the event to be
passed through all right and then what
we did right here is whenever the user
change the property we raised this event
so we just said on property change which
is the name of our event and then for
the objects under that we had to pass
through we just did this and then we had
to pass through event arguments and of
course since there is no information
about the event we just did new event
arguments right there
all right and more about on this
delegate you could go ahead and create
your own delegate and have custom
parameters we pass through and your own
return type but we're just going to
leave it that right now so that's pretty
much it for this tutorial on treating
your own event so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
