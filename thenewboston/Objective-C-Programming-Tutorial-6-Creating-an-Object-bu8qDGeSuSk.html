to your let's see sixth objective-c
tutorial and in the last couple
tutorials what we did is we set up the
interface which pretty much describes
everything in the class and we also set
up the implementation which tells the
methods gives them kind of instruction
on how to do their job and now we're
getting to the last part of this program
and this is the actual program section
that's going to have the main method in
it so I told you guys the basics about
the main method and a couple tutorials
go so let's go ahead and build it it's
pretty much where everything happens so
go ahead and put int main and is his
parameters and again I'm not going to be
going over these these are something
called command line arguments and we'll
be going over these and probably like 20
stories but for now just follow along
int arc C and then char and then a
pointer to Arg V
and then and that and now we can go
ahead and start building our main body
so the first thing that we need to do in
Maine is some housekeeping stuff we need
to set up the NS auto-release pool look
at that it already filled in for us and
just go ahead and put a pointer to pool
and again I'm not going to be telling
you guys what pointers are now that's
enough it's more advanced topic so set
this equal to put your brackets and
brackets in there and put NS
auto-release pool and then go ahead and
put a LOC which means allocate and in it
which I'll tell you what it means in a
second so now we pretty much have
everything we need to setup for now let
me make sure that I didn't type anything
around all right we should be good so
now we can get to the heart of the story
and that's creating objects now like I
said an object is pretty much an
instance of the class so for example we
have a class called person already and I
belong to that class that class is
pretty much a classification for all
people
me being Bucky will be an object of
person so what we need to do to create
an object called Bucky is first say the
name of the class we want to use and
that is person now after that what we
need to do is put that weird pointer
again that we didn't learn and put the
name of our object Bucky and then in
your statement so what this does right
here is say our a we going to create an
object named Bucky and it's going to
belong to the class or classification of
person so now this object is going to
inherit all of these traits age weight
and all these methods but before we get
started using those methods we need to
do a couple more things now that we have
our object created called Bucky let's go
ahead and first allocate some memory so
put Bucky equals
person Alek and what this means is
pretty much hey we got this object and
we're going to need some memory from
your computer so go ahead and reserve
some memory for me so your computer will
do it and the thing we have to do after
this is go ahead and put Bucky equals
and in your brackets put Bucky in it and
what this does is initializes the object
or pretty much starts the objects and
makes it usable so now that we have a
usable working object we can begin using
the methods that we created for this
class so in order to use a method in
Objective C what you need to do is put
brackets and then the first thing you
write is the name of the object and my
object is named Bucky and we have a
couple methods that we already defined
up here we have print set age set weight
and what print does is pretty much print
out its aging weight so let's go ahead
and put Bucky and the first thing I want
to do is use this method called set age
so after you write your object go ahead
and put space and put set age now if you
see up here set age need some
information in order to work it needs an
integer value which would be its age so
in order to pass in as value as is
called what you need to do is after set
age add a colon and now it needs an
integer value and I'm going to write 23
so what you're doing is this you created
an object named Bucky and credited its
method called set age and you pass in
the value 23 so what it does now is this
goes up here the set age and it says all
right you gave me the value of 23 so I'm
going to take the age variable that you
defined in my interface right here and
I'm going to set it equal to 23 simple
enough so after this what you want to do
is you want to do the exact same thing
for set weight so go ahead
but Bucky because that's the object you
want to be applying methods to what
method you want to apply set weight and
if you remembered when we created this
method it says alright you're going to
have to pass me in or give me a piece of
information and it better be an integer
so let's go ahead and set that integer
set it equal to 350 and go ahead and put
: and now what it's going to do is take
that information and set it equal to
this weight variable right here so now
we call these two methods and we also
pass in the information they needed so
they can set the variables equal to
those numbers so the last method that we
have in this class is this method right
here called print and the cool thing
about this is it already has all the
information it needs so we don't need to
pass it or give it any information so
all we have to do is and pretty much now
that Bucky has an age in a weight now we
can use our print statement so let's go
ahead and again put the name of the
object and just go ahead and write print
and since it doesn't take any arguments
right here we don't need to put any
extra data in there so go ahead and end
that and once we're done using our three
methods you're saying alright that's it
but we actually need to do one more
thing we need to call a method on Bucky
called
release and this is just good
housekeeping I think that um your
program will do this by default but
later on we're going to need to be doing
this
what release does is free any memory
that we borrow to create the object
earlier so whenever we allocated memory
we pretty much were saying the computer
all right we're going to need some
memory for this object but we'll give
the back at the end I promise so we did
all the stuff we need to do to Bucky and
at the end when we were done doing
everything we say all right we're done
in this memory you can have it back and
that way we keep a good relationship
with the computer you know so after that
we also need to drain our pool
of memory so pool drain so drain our
memory for the entire program not only
our object and the last thing we need to
do is since this main needs an integer
value back remember whenever we return
zero it means that everything went all
right
so if it finally runs all this and your
computer knows if I get the value of
zero back it means everything went good
so let's go ahead and build and run this
and see if we get any errors so set it
succeeded and let's go ahead and run
console to see what we did it says I am
23 years old and weigh 350 pounds and
that's what we wanted it to do so one
last time want me sure let me show you
guys what happened we set up an
interface which pretty much describes
every piece of information we're going
to be putting in our class in the
implementation we gave our methods
instructions of how to do their job now
in this main method right here what we
did is we made an object called Bucky um
save some space for created it and now
we called the method set age and pass it
in the value 23 so what it did is it
went up to this method right here set
age took of that value of 23 and set it
equal to the variable H so now Bucky's
age is equal to 23 after that we put
Bucky set weight equal to 350 so we went
up here took 350 as W and set it as
weight so now Bucky's weight was equal
to 350 and after that we were able to
use the print method and the print
method said our I am variable years old
and I weigh variable pounds fill in age
and weight for that object and you have
yourselves a complete computer program
and after that we just gave back all the
memory from the object and for the
program and we returned 0 which means
everything went all right so that's
pretty much the essentials of how to
create a simple program in Objective C
using objects methods classes and all
that good stuff
so thank you guys for watching in the
next tutorial I don't know where we're
going to be covering but it's going to
be awesome so don't forget to subscribe
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
