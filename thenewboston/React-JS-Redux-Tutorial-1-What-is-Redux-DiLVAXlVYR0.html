gentlemen welcome back to another
fantastic tutorial series
my name is Bucky Roberts and in this
course I am going to be teaching you
guys how to use react with redux now
before I go any further I just want to
mention this in order to understand what
the heck is going on in this video
series you first have needed to watch
react J as tutorials for beginners this
is my very first intro to react series
and in this series I teach all the
basics of react what it is what it's
used for all of the fundamentals so once
you watch this tutorial series you are
ready to move on to this one so this one
is kind of part two in a way so like I
said this one is going to be covering
react and redux now before I get into
what the heck Redux is and why we need
to use it I first need to talk about a
little problem that we have whenever we
try to develop a single-page application
so that's kind of what react is it's a
library for making single page
applications now this website right here
it isn't one this is just my website the
new boston.com
but say that I was thinking about making
this a single page application so all
right I need to kind of start planning
everything in my head so let me just
talk you guys through this so I know
that whenever we use react the different
parts of your website are pretty much is
called components and each component has
a little piece of memory with it and we
just call that state so this playlist on
the left I could probably make that a
component and then this video player
right here
could definitely make that a component
on maybe this progress bar and these
buttons that could be one and maybe this
little input form right here that could
be a component in all of these different
components they each would have their
own state their own little chunk of
memory to manage for example what videos
to display on how far the progress bar
was you know blue and how far was gray
and maybe this form needed some state to
remember what
user was posting what question so
basically if I'm trying to plan this in
my head I'm thinking of all the things
that can go wrong and all the things I
need to take care of already
I mean the user they're going to be
doing a bunch of stuff they're going to
be clicking buttons they're going to be
favoriting videos they're going to be
asking questions right here and then of
course I have to manage all my states I
need to have a state or an object to you
know keep track of all the videos and
then another one for the active video
and then another one for the progress
and then okay there's just a bunch of
stuff a bunch of different parts I have
to make and on top of everything on top
of everything once that's all done I
need to figure out how everything is
connected how everything communicates
with one another how whenever you click
an item in this list it displays a video
right here you know what I decided that
this is just way too overwhelming I
can't deal with this I'm just going to
go watch orange is the new black for 16
hours like you usually do and you know
I'm done programming I can't handle this
well what if I told you guys that there
was actually an easy way to set all of
this up that no matter how big your
software project was no matter how many
different pieces you had involved that
you could actually architect this or set
it up in a way that you can manage
everything easily so even though you may
have a bunch of different components and
they are all communicating with one
another and connected in these weird
kind of ways that you can actually set
this up to manage everything beautifully
whoa ladies and gentlemen that is what
this tutorial series is about and that
thing is called redux so what I want to
do now is I kind of want to give you
guys a really brief overview of redux
and talked to you guys about all the
different pieces and by all the
different pieces I mean like there's
just like seven different pieces so it's
going to take like three minutes but at
first if you guys are like you know what
this is just it just looks like an
overly complex way to manage your piece
of software well this is the cool thing
even though it may seem kind of
confusing at first the thing is
like I said no matter how many pieces
you decide to add to your application
later on no matter how complex you think
your software is going to be it all
still fits in the same architecture so
at first it may look a little
overwhelming but this is as complex as
it gets no matter how big your app is
this is all there is to it so with that
being said let's go ahead and get
started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
