going to teach you guys how to read from
a file and actually what I want to do
first is right now we just have bacon is
good not very cool actually want a
couple lines to read I don't know if we
just have one line Dorito be kind of
boring so go ahead and type I don't know
two or three more lines so bacon is good
arm I really like to eat a like to eat
meatballs and then we'll just say cheese
I don't know like a freaking haiku or
something bacon is good really like to
eat meat both cheese so go ahead and
save this in so right now we pretty much
created this file right here created it
with C and last sorrel and then we edit
it in notepad or any text editor you
have so now let's go ahead and read it
in C so the first thing remember
whenever working the files is just that
file pointer I'm going to name it F
pointer again why not
so what we need to do is read this first
thing F open again just think of this
function is pretty much arm the
equivalent of opening up your notepad
program so f open pretty much opens up
its own version of notepad even though
that's not what does but if you think
about it that way it's going to be
really easy to understand this function
and of course whenever you have notepad
open you need to select what file you
want to work with and we're just working
with this bacon text file so that's the
equivalent of doing file open that first
parameter and the last one is what do
you want to do with it well in less oil
we wrote the file and now we just want
to read it you're pretty much saying
whatever's in here get ready to just
give me that information read it back to
me now what I want to do is print it on
the screen and we actually need one
other thing to just print it in this
little command line thing because right
now here let me close this up close F
pointer
so right now this command line or this
um yeah I guess you call it this little
command line black box this is very
simple program it can't just take a file
and read it this actually needs
variables in C that's what it was built
for so in order to display the contents
of our file in that little command line
a window we actually need to first store
store the content in arm something that
C can use such as a character array so
I'm going to sort in this single line
array because I'm going to be printing
it out line by line so once we have an
array created what I can do is just make
a very basic wot loop and this is how
you read a file line by line now the
first thing is we need to say run this
loop pretty much from the beginning of
the file to the end so by default
remember our pointer or file pointer is
going to start at the beginning so we're
pretty much going to say you loop until
the end how do we do that well we'll say
X let me just type in then talk to you
guys about FeO F f pointer and hit enter
so basically what this means is file and
a file in this explanation on mark you
know that it means not so what this is
saying is as you read the file this file
pointer is going to progress like this
it's going to go to the end and then
start on a new line and it's going to go
all the way pretty much left to right
exactly how people read in real life
from left to right line by line and what
this is going to say is keep looping
until you get to the end of the file in
other words as long as the file pointer
did not reach the end of the file yet
continue to run this simple enough so
now we can just go ahead and um the
first thing that we need to do is
actually say okay f gets gets one line
just like it does in the command line so
f gets
single-line 150f pointer what this is
going to do is it gets a line now before
we just you'd gets gets to get it from
the command line but in this case it's
going to get your file line-by-line
so instead of using standard input such
as keyboard it's going to use that file
so the first time it's going to be equal
to this the second time is going to be
equal to this and the last time it's
going to be equal to this which is
cheese so that's what F gets those and
now we can just use regular puts because
we're not putting it to a file we're
just putting it to the command line for
the user to see and of course the
information was stored in single line so
just print out whatever it is on the
single line and that's it so let's run
this and check it out so what it's going
to do is it's going to go through and
get all that crap line by line and then
print it out on the screen so bacon is
good I really like to eat meatballs in
cheese now the only other thing I want
to point out is this you see how there
as a space between every line well the
reason for that is because this remember
puts automatically adds content to a new
line every time so we understand why
this stuff is on new line but why the
space in between where is that extra new
line coming from well it's coming from
here in New York X file even though you
can't see it your computer programs see
this at the end of every line a new line
character and this is how um your text
editor knows to put each of this crap on
a new line however let me redo that
actually redo redo however what's
happening in this program right here is
it's copying all of this with F gets and
then it's putting it to a new line so
whenever it puts that to the new line it
adds the other new line from puts plus
the new line that was already in this
text file right here so that's why you
have a space between every line even
though your text file up
not too so again one last time if you
got this down move on next tutorial
basically we open the file we said okay
we want to read from it using this our
character and then we said okay we
pretty much need to character a ready to
store all the crap that you're going to
read read it line by line print it out
on the screen and then when we're done
direct with everything close it out very
simple stuff now we know how to write
files and read files the only other
thing that I want to talk to you guys
about is how to append files how to add
on to the end of this and once we're
done with that it's actually going to be
like two seconds we can learn about
random access files and a whole bunch of
other cool stuff but for now thank you
guys for watching
we're going to subscribe and we'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
