Adobe Illustrator cs6 tutorial my name
is buddy Blackford and I've been working
with you guys on the past couple Adobe
tutorials I did CS or After Effects cs6
and Photoshop cs6 so now I'm onto
illustrator so today in the tutorial
we're going to learn about the
Illustrator cs6 system requirements and
I'm going to set you guys up to get
started so you can follow along with the
tutorials a little bit better so first
of all let's go over the system
requirements I'm going to bring a file
over all right a page over and you can
find this in the Adobe help and
illustrator has some minimum
requirements they're not too high but
you pretty much you need to follow these
so that'll work it will work correctly
so if you're trying to use like an
old-ass laptop or something like that
it's not going to illustrator cs6 isn't
even going to work so make sure you have
some of these things so for Windows
you're going to need the Intel Pentium 4
or the Athlon 64 for AMD for Macintosh
you're just going to need a the 64-bit
intel based multi-core and pretty much
all you really need you need two gigs of
hard drive space you need a 1 gigabyte
of RAM for the 32 bit and 2 gigabytes of
RAM for the 64 bit but 8 gigabyte 8
gigabits is a recommended for using this
program because it will make it run a
lot faster now you want to use you want
to have a pretty good monitor and you
want it to be in HD you're going to need
a 16 bit graphics card and those are
pretty much what you really need to get
into this but I can't really think of
anything else that you absolutely need
so there's a couple things that you
might want to know when you're
working in a illustrator the first thing
is that illustrator has a preferences
file and you can find that if you go to
edit preferences this isn't the file but
these are where the preferences are now
I can go over these for you but these
are all the default preferences and the
quickest way to do that to get the
default preferences so that they'll be
like exactly like mine and you'll see
everything like I have here is to go
into your preferences file on your
computer and delete it and the way you
could do that and I pulled up another
page this is also on the Adobe help page
if you go to Illustrator cs6 this is
where your preferences files are going
to be for these different computer
differences here so this is where you
look and you go into here and you exit
out of you close out Adobe Illustrator
and then you delete the Preferences file
this is a for if you already have messed
with the Preferences and then you start
Adobe Illustrator again and it'll
automatically bring in a new preferences
file that you can use and it will be the
defaults so that's how you reset the
defaults for the Illustrator cs6 and I
think that's been up long enough another
thing that I wanted to go over was the
different types of illustrator that
we've got here we've got a 32-bit and a
64-bit mode for illustrator and the
32-bit and 64-bit refer to a way that
the computer processes information the
CPU more precisely and let's see if I
can go into mine here we go if you look
up here we've got Illustrator cs6 that's
just the regular and that's the 32-bit
and then you got Illustrator cs6 64-bit
now a 64-bit system it handles a Ram
more efficiently and what it does is it
if you have more than 4 gigabytes of RAM
4 or more then it's going to be able to
use the
when you have when you're using the
32-bit when you start going over that
amount of RAM is going to swap to the
hard drive and that decreases your
performance so if you can go use go
ahead and use the 64-bit mode another
thing that you need to be aware of when
you're using the 64 bit or 30 or when
years in the 64-bit mode is that any
plugins that you you you were using
before if they were in the 32-bit mode
they're not going to work in the 64-bit
mode so there's a little trade-off there
and sometimes companies or people make
plug-ins that only work on the 32-bit
mode not sure why they don't have it
made them for both but that's just a
trade off that you need to use I mean it
doesn't increase performance drastically
where you're going to go down to a
snail's pace or anything like that but
you can definitely tell when you get
into larger projects that have a lot
more stuff you don't have to like wait
as long for stuff to load and things
like that so ensure a little recap of
what I just went over I went over the
system requirements you need to have the
Intel Pentium 4 or AMD Athlon 64 if
you're on Windows or the multi-core
intel-based Macs for the Mac operating
system you need two gigabytes of hard
drive space and you need one gigabyte
for 32-bit and two gigabytes for 64 get
64-bit and it is recommended to have at
least 8 gigabytes if you're working on
this if you have more that's great
because especially if you're in a 64-bit
because that is going to help out a lot
if you only have a 32-bit then you only
really need three to four mega three to
four gigabytes because the computer is
not really going to be able to handle it
and then remember I just went over the
difference between 32-bit and 64-bit and
in that 64-bit can handle more matzo Ram
and give you better performance
so remember also the the defaults and
you need to just delete out your
preference file
and you just have to go back because I'd
exit out of the webpage to go back in
the video and check out where the
defaults are using the Adobe homepage so
it takes a lot everybody for work are
watching the tutorial and we're ready to
get started in Illustrator in our next
tutorial and we'll start going over the
interface have a good one everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
