issues right now first of all if we look
at the snail he looks like he's just
humping the ground and well that's
obviously not what do we want him do
with that animation we want him to
actually look like he's crawling going
lesson right and second of all look what
I just noticed look look at his shell is
just like sitting on his back he's not
even in it so well we can't fix that but
uh we can make sure that he's not
humping the ground and just moving away
and also look what happens when my dude
runs into him I mean he can kill him but
right now I'm just running into him and
I'm not even getting hurt so we're going
to add that flesh to the player whenever
he you know runs into him improperly so
let's go ahead and add that first so in
the event sheet what we can do is and
this is another thing you're going to
understand it really easy if you are
ever programmed a computer right click
right here and hit add an else statement
and I'll show you guys with do so the
action that we want to add is actually I
don't even need that is this player and
the flesh and we can just go ahead and
set this all the defaults and hit done
and let me show you guys I don't play
the game person show you guys what's
happening what we just did so look at my
player okay so whenever he runs into the
stale now he flashes and if you guys
didn't know what I was talking about
before that resembles him getting hurt
of course we can still kill them like
before so what this means right here and
I'll tell you guys what a else statement
is real quick is basically it's first
going to detect or test did your dude
collide with that snail is he touching
the snail in any kind of way if he is
test these two conditions the first one
is if he's falling or is he jumping on
the snail kill the snail if he wasn't
falling that's what an else statement
means if this condition right here is
false what this means is do this instead
so did he collide with us now if he did
destroy this now if he didn't then it
must mean
he collided with it from the side so
just make the player flash and in my
last tutorial series the beginner one I
showed you guys how to like deduct
health so you guys can do all that maybe
put a little Hut up on the screen but
for now I just want to show you guys how
to make a simple platform game well got
like the hiccups and whenever i hiccup
sometimes my bird kind of embarrassing
but oh well whatever what do you do
alright so now that we got the player
flashing the only other thing we need to
do is take care of the snails humping
behavior in other words make him crawl
so the reason that he's just humping the
ground right now instead of crawling is
because we added that animation but we
didn't add the platform behavior so he
can stay in the same place and be
animated but he can't move around so the
first thing we need to do is give him
platform behavior and that basically
allows him to move around so again make
sure he's selected under behaviors what
we want to do is add a platform behavior
which is right here so now our snail can
move around left and right pretty
freakin sweet and also I want to show
you guys something else
since this snail image is actually
really cool the box around the snail is
pretty much exactly where we want it to
be for the snail left right up and down
so we don't need another blue box like
this to detect um the snails body like
we did for the player the only reason we
this is because his arms were sticking
out to the side kind of wide but for
this no blue box is needed so that's
awesome it's going to make our game
development a whole lot easier also
another thing I want to mention is
whenever you're making enemies for your
game make sure that you make their
images nice tightly bound and then you
won't have that issue as well but
anyways make sure that you have the
snail selected and in the properties
plant panel actually I want to well we
can just do it from right here in the
properties panel this speed right here
is kind of fast for the snail so what we
want to do is we want to set the max
speed for the snout at something like 50
because well snails are slow another
thing I want to do is
I want to set the acceleration to 100
and the deceleration to 100 because well
we just want to slow them down because
well snails are slow and another thing I
want to point out is what we just
animated are the snails platform
behavior pretty much how this entire
character can move around in the game
he's going to move left and right slow
he's going to accelerate and decelerate
kind of slow they're different from the
animation speed this animation speed is
basically saying how fast do you want
this to play in other words how fast is
he going to be humping the ground so
actually let's go ahead and uh make them
hump the ground real fast just because
uh well just because I'm an idiot and I
want to see how it looks
oh wow that is awesome
I I don't know if you guys can saw
because or hold on a second
look at him Wow okay and another thing
that I you guys probably noticed is
whenever I hit up this now also jumped
up and this is because I'll show you
guys how to fix this problem actually
will keep his up on the humping the
ground speed at UH whatever I had is set
at 100 or whatever and also why not just
a couple of things
um let's go ahead and move this down
move all these down okay right around
here okay what was I talking about okay
and actually I'll set him here a default
and the reason I'm doing all of this I
can select everything is because you
guys saw as soon as I jumped off the
platform
then automatically like jumped on the
snail and I just want to avoid that move
him a little closer to the ground and
now like I said what I want to do is I
want to make it so when we jump the
snail doesn't also jump and I'll
actually do that in a second and I'll
show you guys how to fix that but for
right now I'm going to add one other
thing before I start messing with other
stuff and that is I want to lewd load in
a new spray object so if I double click
this and click spray object I know if I
did that too fast sprite 2 I'm going to
load in that blue box again which is the
square right here now the reason that
I'm loading this in isn't because we
need to give the snail a new body it's
because whenever we have them move
around from left to right if we just
have a move left all the way he's going
to eventually fall off this edge right
here or if we have them move right all
the way he's just going to fall off that
edge real quick so I'm going to do is
I'm going to add these boxes right here
and they're pretty much they're going to
be invisible whenever you're playing the
game but to the excuse me to thus now
they're pretty much going to set
barriers so he's going to crawl if you
hold down control and copy this as well
we're pretty much going to say haste now
only crawl back and forth between these
two barriers so I'm actually wanna you
probably want to rename this like edge
marker and hit enter and obviously since
they're instances all of these ones are
called edge marker right now and like I
said what it does is obviously just mark
the edge of it now another issue is that
if we just played the game right now
these would be visible so go ahead and
set the visibility to invisible right
here so now this now is going to have an
invisible barrier where they're pretty
much
contain two now after this what I want
to do is I want to add an instance
variable and basically what we're going
to be doing is we're going to be looking
at the snail and he's going to be armed
crawling left and right but we pretty
much are going to say once you hit this
box right here change your direction and
also change your animation because we
don't want them just the curl left and
right like this we wanted wants to get
here to mirror like we do the player
flip around and start looking like it
crawls the other way so in order to
create this instance variable make sure
that you have the snail selected and on
the left hand side select add or edit
instance variables now we don't have any
yet so we'll just create a new one right
here and the name of this is just going
to be action for the type it's actually
going to be test and the initial value
is we're going to set this as what way
is the snail looking so right now he's
looking right so do this animation and
the description we don't need that so
basically we're going to say eventually
this is what we're going to do once you
come in contact or collide with this box
then change the instance variable to
left and also make the animation look
left then when you hit this one change
it back to right and start crawling back
this way so that's like it's going to be
some very in Bavaria I mean incredibly
simple artificial intelligence and I
guess I can fix that out one other
problem we had right now and that was
this when the user is jumping freakin
snail actually I need to change that to
when the user jumps the snail jumps and
that's because we added platform
behavior basically saying arm you're
pretty much going to mirror a lot of my
behavior pretty much the user is going
to control the snail but we want to
actually change that so if we select the
snail on this one right here it's called
default controls we're going to select
no now what this means is the
sir can no longer control this object
themselves and the reason that we wrote
that is because we are going to
eventually give this artificial
intelligence so they can you know crawl
back and forth on their self so that's
why we don't need any input from the
user to tell the enemy what to do and
the hiccup herbs all right so this was
invisible and I change the effort I made
the instance so now even though we can
see these in our development these are
both invisible as we can see and also
lastly whenever we jump with our player
it doesn't control the snail as well so
now the next thing we have to do is have
him move left and right and you know
maybe even speed up the humping the
ground animation who freaking knows so
uh thank you guys for watching and I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
