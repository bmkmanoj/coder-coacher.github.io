last time we talked about brush modes
and this time we're gonna be talking
about fills and gradients now as you
know is it what a fill is is it fills
whatever selection you have with your
foreground color so just pick a
foreground color and fill it like so you
can also fill selections letter shapes
just say you wanted to fill this just go
to your paint bucket tool click it and
fill it now you have a couple options
how to fill items first is just to grab
the paint bucket tool and click and fill
it another option you have is to go up
here on your main menu bar click Edit
fill and click OK and the last option
that you have is to hold down the shift
key and press backspace then just press
OK in your item mo fill
now as you see up here at the sub Tools
menu you have a couple choices for
ground and pattern and when you're using
basic fills always pick foreground in to
fill it with your foreground color and
as you know the modes that we talked
about last time the opacity is all the
same in this tolerance and all these
other checkboxes right here comes into
play when you're filling photographs and
not just basic images so once you start
filling photographs we'll talk about
those but next I want to talk to you
guys about the pattern fill you can also
fill shape with basic patterns as you
see when you click the pattern this
little box pops up right here you can go
select any of the patterns from that
Photoshop is preset select one and you
can fill your shape with it
now the other tool under the paint
bucket drop-down list is the gradient
tool and what a gradient is is just a
fading of colors it fades the foreground
color into the background color in this
case red and white and all you have to
do is click and drag it's pretty easy to
see how it works
and right here are all of the shapes
such as a diamond
Circle
and some other ones as well right here
you have all the preset colors that
Photoshop has if you want to use any of
those preset color as you can
and of course the modes and opacity same
as any other tool so you have all these
preset colors or you can make a basic -
gradient but what if you wanted a custom
gradient to do that you would double
click this gradient box on the toolbar
right here and this brings up the custom
custom gradient box and you can add as
many colors to your gradient as you want
to change the colors you simply click
these things called color stops and as
you can see your color selector box
clicks up and you can change the color
from here but if you want another color
all you would have to do is click under
here until your finger cursor pops up
and click Add stop as you can see
another stop pops up so let's say we
want to make a red white and blue
gradient just go to one your color stops
and double click it select a red for the
middle one we'll select the white and
for your last color sub right here we'll
select the blue color as you can see red
white and blue is now selected so press
ok and as you can see in your main
gradient box it's a sub toolbar you have
a red white and blue fill gradient now
just simply click and drag anywhere on
the screen and as you can see we have a
custom red white and blue gradient this
is a way to make custom gradient with as
many colors you like
now the last thing I need to talk to you
about is something called a custom noise
gradient so go back to your custom box
and under the gradient type you can see
we have solid selected you can also pick
a noise now when you do this Photoshop
gives you a random band of colors now
yet and you can always click randomize
to get another band and I've yet to
figure out how this is useful in any way
but it makes some cool designs sometimes
anyway so so just click OK click the
shape that you want simply drag and as
you can see instead of a simple gradient
Photoshop gives you a wide band of
colors so if anyone knows why this is
actually useful comment me or let me
know cuz I'm stumped on this one but it
looks cool either way so now that we
learned how to use the filter tool and
gradient tool and the next topic we're
going to be getting into some cool stuff
such as
restoring old photographs and how to
remove sections of an image now as
always if you missed anything I went
over today you can go to my website the
new Boston calm and of a step-by-step
instruction on everything we learn thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
