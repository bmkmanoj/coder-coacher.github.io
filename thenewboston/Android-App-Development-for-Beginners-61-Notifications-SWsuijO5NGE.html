video and in this tutorial I'm going to
talk to you guys about notifications how
to create them when you use them tomato
tomahto and this is actually my second
time recording this video because I just
made one like 10 minutes ago but I was
editing it getting it ready for YouTube
and I realized that I just spent like
four minutes just telling you guys a
story about my life
wasting time so I was like you know what
I probably shouldn't make that again
focused on the notification Android
stuff instead of me just rambling on
about my life so here I am take two
alright so what is a notification you
guys already know what it is let's say
that I don't know someone likes your
Facebook post you're going to get a
little icon bloop and then it says
whenever you slide down the status bar
alright Bucky Roberts left the comment
on your Facebook post or whatever like
that it's pretty much just a little
alert that um lets you know that
something is going on and the cool thing
about this is you can be completely out
of your app you can be on your home
screen maybe just check-in the time
whatever and you don't have have to have
your app open it'll just make a little
notification right there and yeah so you
guys already know what that is so that's
what we're going to learn how to do so
the first thing we need to do is say
okay just for this test app when do we
want to send notifications because
typically you're going to have some
service running in the background
checking a database for like new
comments or new likes or something but
for now we're just going to make a
button on the screen and when you click
it it sends a notification because you
know it's pretty easy for this example
so delete this text view and drag a
button on there oh that one looks nice
and we'll just say um click for
notification you just say click if you
want it doesn't really matter and the ID
of this I'll just write Bucky's button
so whenever we click this what's going
to happen is it's going to send that
notification and of course we need an
onclick method where is owned alphabetic
warrior probably could have guessed that
Bucky's button clicked so again this is
the method we're going to be building
later on that's going to send the
notification to the system so that's all
the interface is going to be again all
the hard work we're going to be doing in
our code via that notification thingy so
the first thing I want to do is you can
actually probably get rid of these don't
need you guys for this tutorial and
clean all this stuff and there they are
right there all right
so well I'll explain what all of this
does or actually you probably will
figure it out by the time I can even
explain it so those are all the imports
pause the video copy them down now the
first thing we need to do is we need to
build an object that's pretty much going
to be the notification itself and by the
notification itself I mean this thing
right here so the notification is kind
of two parts the first part is the
little thing you see on your status bar
which has a little icon and a little
message that says like Bucky Robert
select your post that little message is
called the ticker it's usually like one
sentence long maybe just a few words
just a little indicator that let you
know hey you have a new notification
then you slide down with your thumb or
your finger or whatever and then this
whenever I say the notification I'm
usually referring to this part so I know
it's like a two-part process but
whenever I say the notification itself
I'm usually referring to this main
notification which usually consists of
an icon which may be like the logo of
your app that's typically what it is or
if it's on like some social activity it
may be the person who either liked or
commented or sent you an invite whatever
and then you have this text right here
and aside from that you have the time
so again it's made up of a couple
different things on an icon text which
is actually a title and the body of the
text in the time and I'll show you guys
how to customize all of these well right
now so the first thing of course is in
object so we can actually start building
that notification so it's actually
notification compat
right there in any call builder on it so
this pretty much lets you build a new
notification simple enough and I'm just
going to name mine notification because
I'm that creative by keishon there we go
notification make sure you spell it
right now another thing that you need is
this let me type this out real quick
private static final int you know just
name mine unique ID and set it equal to
some random number for right now how
about I'll just throw your fingers on
the keyboard four five six one two why
not so what we're going to be doing is
we're going to be giving an ID number to
each notification that we build all
right why do we need an ID number for
the notification well check this out
typically the user has a bunch of
notifications which means that your
phone has to keep track of them all so
to keep track of for example this one
new Google+ notification your system
says okay whenever I click this I need
to go to the Google+ app whenever I
click on like this one three new
messages I need to go to the Gmail app
and in order to organize all your
different notifications we need to pass
it along an ID number because if we
didn't have this then your system would
just view everything is a plain basic
notification and it wouldn't know how to
handle each one so that's why you need
an identity an identity or yeah to
identify each one whatever alright so
now let's go ahead and actually do
something with this objects set equal to
what it needs to be you
- and that is equal to new notification
compat purpose you just copy this
notification compat dot builder and of
course what you pass in here is just
this for context now under this another
thing that i want to do is well i'll
explain it in just a second if you call
notification set auto cancel and then
you pass in true what does this mean why
would you want to cancel your
notification whenever you created this
activity well this method gets called
whenever you open this screen right here
so why would you want to cancel or in
other words delete your notification
well it's because of this let's say we
were making this app for Google+ and it
said okay Earl libertad' you back
alright so you click that because Earl
you guys are good buddies you want some
more information and you got sent to
your app well you went to the app and
then that notification didn't disappear
just stayed at the top of your screen
you're right wait a minute I just
clicked it and isn't that supposed to go
away whenever I click it
well this set auto cancel means whenever
you go to this screen whatever
notifications you have relating to the
screen you're just going to go ahead and
delete them so again it's just uh I
don't know it's just kind of like
standard program practice whenever you
click a notification it deletes from
that top system status bar so simple
enough so now what I want to do is now
that we got all the housekeeping stuff
taken care of is actually start building
that notification adding the icon the
title all that good stuff and in order
to do that remember we said whenever we
click this button it's going to call the
method bucky's button clicked so that's
what we're going to be doing in the next
tutorial actually learning how to
customize our notifications</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
