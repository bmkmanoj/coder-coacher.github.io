take pictures with the camera what I
want to do now is I want to show you
guys how to apply photo filters or other
cool effects to your photos so by the
end of these tutorials you guys are I
don't want to say that you're going to
know how to make like Instagram photo
filters because those take a lot of time
and um you need like a background in
photography but I'm going to show you
guys the real basics of how to bring out
your highlights or contrast and also
apply some cool overlays so the first
thing I want you to do is this I already
uploaded two photos this one right here
is just my profile photo if you want you
can just go get any two square photos
but if you want these ones that I'm
going to be working with go to my forum
in this link and just right click and
save as and I save this one as what did
I say with this Bucky jpg in this one
that white one you saw what we're going
to be doing here is we're just going to
be placing this on top and I know it
looks white right now but this is
actually clear as you guys can see right
here so again whenever we place this on
top of this image what's going to happen
is it's going to give a nice frame and
give it that old vintage arm scratched
up kind of looking effect again this
looks it looks kind of weird and it just
makes my image look dirty but if you
have like a background in photography
then I'm sure you guys can change that
so anyways go ahead and right click both
of these save them as so they're saved
to your computer so the first thing we
have to do is add them to our project so
I started a brand new project nothing
new blank activity whatever and we need
to get those to our drawable folder
right there so if you go and cut these
just cut those and then open up Windows
Explorer
wherever you have your project what you
can do is you can navigate to your
drawable folder by going to app source
main re S which stands for resources and
you can just stick them in your draw
ball segment in trouble HD PA
and just paste those in there so now we
can actually close out of this and if we
look back in trouble we see that we now
have that Bucky JPEG which is my face in
that dirty which is pretty much some
like a frame all right so now what we
have to do is we actually need an area
on our app where we can display an image
so get rid of this textview right here
and there's going to be one single
widget really easy just kind of drag
might as well just drag it right in the
middle all right now this is kind of
annoying me that it's just a little
pixel by default so the first thing I'm
going to do is I'm gonna go down to
minimum height ever right there that is
maximum all right so I'm going to give
it a minimum of 300 DP and 300 DP all
right pretty good so this is just so
whenever you're developing your
interface you can kind of it's a little
easier to visualize than that one little
pixel right there and also the other
thing that I need to do is I need to
give this an ID and I will give it an ID
of Luckies image view all right so now
we have an area where we can display a
photo and again what I'm going to be
doing is I'm going to be displaying my
face and one thing I'm going to do
before I show you guys how to add that
overlay to it to make it a little
vintage look is I'm just going to show
you guys how to apply effects manually
and we're going to invert the image now
if you don't know what invert the image
is it um this is like on every photo
editing program but it pretty much makes
you look like you're going through x-ray
machine or something so it was one of
the easiest ones to implement all right
so hop over to mainactivity and the
first thing I'm going to do is clean
this up I also as a side note I change
my color my comments to this kind of a
green blueish turquoise kind of color I
it looked like gray like a light grey
was kind of hard to read in the video so
I like I might come into pop and stand
out so that's what I did
all right where was I so what I want to
do now before I begin is I want to
import a bunch of stuff and I already
have them copied so here you go and
again if you want to actually what I'm
going to do is I'm going to take all of
the source code and I'm going to post it
on that exact same on forum topic that
you guys download the images so if you
just want to copy all of these and paste
them in then please do that it will save
you a bunch of time so now the first
thing I want to do is I want to get a
reference to pretty much this image view
and also these images right here so
let's go ahead and do the image view
first so image view I think it was named
Bucky's lucky's or
Lucky's plural or not for a possessive
image view alright so I want to get a
reference to my face which is my profile
photo
so I'll just say drawable Bucky's face
Lucky's Fame the interesting photo and
what we're going to be doing is we're
actually going to be taking this right
here which is a JPEG as you can see and
in order to work with it for Android you
need to convert it into a bitmap image
now a bitmap allows you to work with the
individual pixels you can JPEG and pings
they're good for just displaying like
logos and graphics and buttons on the
screen but if you ever want to be able
to manipulate the individual pixels then
you need to convert it to a bitmap so
again this is the JPEG version and what
we're going to be doing is we're going
to convert to a bitmap image all right
so this myself a little bit more space a
your alright so on create the first
thing I want to do is I want to take
Bucky's image view actually set that
what did
our image view envied by dr daddy all
right so this of course just as a
reference to this and you guys already
know why we need that so we can actually
display something there now let me get a
reference to this JPEG right here in the
way we do that is we gotta get their
resources and then since it's trouble
you got to get the trouble got to get
the trouble and what trouble that you
want how about this one name Bucky
alright so again all we are doing right
here is getting a reference to my face
and it is a drawable so that's why it's
giving me this error right there
alright so now the JPEG is stored in the
variable Bucky's face but remember I
told you guys that you need to convert
it to a bitmap in order to use it so we
already have a variable called bitmap
image where we can store the information
so bitmap image now to convert a jpg to
a bitmap and what you do is this if you
go to bit map where yeah bitmap drawable
buckey's face what this is going to do
is it's going to take this and cast it
into a bitmap drawable object and then
on this you need to call the method did
i just type hey get huh look at that
they are kind of similar on the keyboard
anyways get bitmap so again it's kind of
a weird syntax right here but this takes
jpg and converts it into a bitmap so we
can work with the individual pixels so
now what I want to do is I want to add
some photo filter to this bitmap now if
I write all the code in here then it's
going to get messy so what I'm going to
do is I'm gonna store an entirely new
variable called new photo and this is
going to be equal to invert image
function that we're going to be creating
later on now let me pass this in right
here
alright so again it's giving us error
because this is going to be the method
that we create in the next tutorial
that's going to take your image and
convert it or in other words invert it
apply some cool effect to it so I'm
going to be passing in the original but
map image which is pretty much that
image you saw of my face we're going to
be inverting it and I'm going to store
the new data and variable called new
photo and what we want to do with this
new inverted photo well of course we
just want to display it right here so if
you go to Bucky's image view in order to
set that content of the image view to a
new photo let's say set image bitmap new
inverted photo so that looks pretty good
for this tutorial that is how you set
everything up and in the next tutorial
we're actually going to be digging
through them pixels and I'm going to
show you guys how to tweak them and
create a cool inverted image effect</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
