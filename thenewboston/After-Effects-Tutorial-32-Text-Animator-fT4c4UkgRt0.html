tutorial and in this tutorial I'm gonna
show you guys how to use something
called the text animator now a text
animator is it's pretty much a sweet way
to animate text and is different than
your basic transform properties so let's
go ahead and get started the first thing
I want to do is if you have your path
from last tutorial get rid of that so
you just have basic plain old text on
the screen nothing interesting about
that so when you have text on the screen
you're going to have this text option
right down here and you're gonna see you
have this little thing called animate
right here this is your text animator
and then what we want to do is animate
the position of this text and make sure
you're not doing it and transform notice
that there's position down here what we
want to do is go to animate click that
right and click position right there and
now under animator one animator one
we're gonna have a position property and
what this is gonna do is give us the
position of the text right there
but moving this would be just kind of
useless because we could do that with
the transform so what we want to do is
open this range selector and now we see
the start and offset and all this stuff
so go ahead and move your position
somewhere down to like right there maybe
like 100 percent down or something and
now you can see what the start and end
does this range of start and end says
where you want your text to be affected
see if you won't only want to affect
half of it right there move to 50% and
as you can see only 50% of the text has
moved down see the other text is
unaffected totally and again you can
select the range in the middle by doing
something like moving the start and the
end point and then only your middle text
is able to be animated so this range
pretty much sucks the range of text you
want affected in the range you don't
select is going to be totally unaffected
by your
Meishan so let me show you guys a neat
little trick that you can do with this
move this start to zero in the end all
the way to a hundred and this means that
all of your text is gonna be affected
that's why it all was moved down so
let's go ahead and in your cert go ahead
and click that little stopwatch so it
can animate then move your current time
indicator similar to five seconds or
something and then go ahead and scroll
on your text to 100 and as you can see
the text slowly jumps up like this so
what this does is say all right it's all
affected and now none of its affected
and it gives you a cool little effect so
go ahead and scrub this all the way to a
zero or not scrub it just move it and
now player animation and you can see all
of your text is becoming affected too in
affected and gives you guys a cool
little text effect now we can enhance
this even more by adding more properties
to this so let's go ahead and add an app
asset e property and again make sure
you're at home on your current time
indicator is zero zero in time and going
ahead in right on your animator one go
ahead and click add property opacity and
now at the very beginning what you want
to do is set opacity all the way to zero
or somewhere close to it and now as you
can see as our current time indicator
moves more and more and text becomes
unaffected not only does hop up but also
fades into opacity this is because it
says re at the beginning
zero to 100 everything was affected so
everything is gonna be totally
transparent but as we move along then
more and more text is not going to
become transparent anymore so that's
pretty much um basics of that let me
play this for you guys now not only when
we do this those the text and move but
also kind of fades in kind of jumps up
from nowhere so let me play that for you
guys one more
since is just so awesome Wow would you
look at that let's just sit back in my
ear for a second so again how I did that
um you need to open a new animator with
this animate and then start an end
it pretty much chooses how much of the
text you want to affect and then just go
ahead and change position and opacity
and bam you got it so that's my quick
tutorial on what text animator is and
how to use it in the next tutorial
probably going over some texts some more
and some other cool things you can do
that but for now that's all you get so
don't forget to subscribe and I look
forward to seeing you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
