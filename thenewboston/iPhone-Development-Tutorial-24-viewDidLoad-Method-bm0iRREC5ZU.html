iphone development tutorial and in this
torial we're going to be working in the
implementation file of the switch class
so go ahead and jump right into that and
remember this is the class that manages
pretty much all the views so we imported
switch class that header obviously and
we need to import a couple more things I
spelled it right yep I didn't put a
pound sign so go ahead and import that
blue class that header and go ahead and
import that red class dot header looks
good so after that remember in our
interface file we made these two objects
red class and blue class to access
whatever we needed from inside those
classes so go ahead and synthesized but
these so synthesized blue class
synthesize that object and aunt
synthesize red class system synthesized
that red class object so now
automatically build setter and getter
methods so after this we need to build a
method called it returns nothing returns
void it's called view did load order
saying RA so this is a method that we
must of declared in here what the heck
where is it almost been a prototype note
num num it actually is a method from our
parent class uiviewcontroller and
remember whenever you make an
implementation or pretty much the body
for the method that's in parent class it
pretty much overrides it never seen all
right why do we need to override this
method what's the point if it's already
created this method gets called whenever
a view is first loaded and it's pretty
much a method that you're supposed to
override whenever you first load method
to say what do you want to do when
disputes first loaded all right so when
the view is first loaded we need to give
them a view by default so I mean you can
use blue or red it doesn't matter they
didn't select anything yet so let's just
go ahead and give them the blue view so
in order to do this put blue class and
create a new object called blue or
something and by the way what we're
doing
is all we're doing here is we're going
to be creating an instance of the blue
class so blue class allocate some space
and of course initialize with nip name
and if I do that right there so now you
put the name of the nib file and then go
ahead and press at in I named mine don't
forget blue window and another thing you
might want to take note of whenever you
get the file name of the nip I'll i mean
the files name is actually dot X I be
like that but don't include xib it
already knows since you're initiating it
with a nib name it already knows it's an
innate so for the bundle don't even
worry what this is just go ahead and put
nil and now what we did of course is we
created an instance of a blue class and
stored it in the object to blue so from
here what we want to do is take our
objects or our property and sign it to
this instance right here so they equal
the same thing so self dot blue class
and go ahead and set this equal to blue
so now this and this are the same thing
pretty easy huh so what we want to do
now is now that we have created an
instance and assigned it to our property
we can go ahead and we actually need to
insert this view pretty much remember we
had that root view that we created and
we would need to insert the sub you to
root view and the Rufio I'm talking
about is the one with the toolbar we
created in the last tutorial so let's go
ahead and pretty much make the show up
on the screen that's what I'm trying to
say so the method to this is self dot
view and insert subview just like that
and now you're right what's subview do
you want to put in we want blue dot view
and this pretty much means the view from
the blue class at index 0 serves anr it
what does all this mean well we have
this main view it's the main view that
controls everything and by inserting a
subview view what this does is it
inserts blue view behind the toolbar in
is saying alright you have this main
view and then you're
a subview behind it but how does it not
how to go behind the toolbar and not in
front of the toolbar and cover it up
well it index zero this is where your
position everything index zero means go
behind everything and since we want our
toolbar to stay in front we put this
index zero so by inserting subviews and
this is the view we want to insert we
put on which make this view show up on
the screen so that's key thing you need
to take from this whatever you put in
here that's what view shows up on the
screen alright so after this we just
need to do blue oops not hell okay
release because remember we allocated it
right here so we need to release it I
tell you guys that 100 times before and
you need to call one more method
superclass view did load so check this
out this method is viewdidload and we
just need to call it in super class
because uh it's just one of those
housekeeping things whenever you use
this method all right simple enough and
yeah with that being said i'm actually
going to be teaching you what I need to
teach you in the next tutorial and
remember we already did this right here
this is what happens is soon as you load
before the user even presses any buttons
at all this is what they're going to see
that's all we did in this tutorial so in
the next tutorial remember we built this
method switch views and what this method
is supposed to do is take the button the
user presses and give them a view
depending on which view is already
showing to switch the views out but I
don't have time in this tutorial do it
so in the next tutorial we're going to
be building this method right here and
it's a pretty big one so yeah grab with
some popcorn and uh you're going to be
in for quite the ride so I thank you for
watching don't forget subscribe and I'll
see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
