second video and in this video as
promised what I'm going to do is show
you guys how to code that I forgot what
I actually even named my method where
the heck is it Oh grab HTML info that's
probably pretty important so what I'm
going to be doing is showing you guys
how to code this method and basically
what it does is it takes a look at our
XHTML or I guess this is just a basic
HTML document and it grabs the
information that we need which is
essentially the titles and the values so
you know the last method that we coded
basically did the advanced stuff now we
just need to pretty much populate these
two things the hash map and the
ArrayList so this is pretty much the
easy part actually so drive it void grab
HTML info doesn't take any parameters
and the very first thing we want to do
is we want to make a few variables to
store the title on the address URL you
know just housekeeping stuff so string
title because the title of the website
is of course a string string address URL
which you know I don't think I need
explain you guys what that is
and the int counter and the reason that
we need a counter let's go ahead and
start it is 0 is because you know how I
said that I have two web sites in here
arm you know my main website in my
Twitter and each one pretty much has an
ID number the first one is 0 my twitter
is 1 I could add you know my Google Plus
which is to YouTube which is 3 so on and
so forth since I want this to be
compatible no matter how many um web
sites you have I'm going to go ahead and
make a loop that starts at 0 and this
just going to loop until the end so that
way if you have 10 web sites a hundred a
thousand this program is going to work
no matter what so go ahead and start at
zero and that's why I started my ID
numbers at zero now after the encounter
what do you want to do is you want to
set the title
you pretty much want to kick-start it
off at zero so title equals get
parameter and parameter is title plus
counter so pretty much title zero so
what am i doing in this well what this
method does right here get parameter is
it's going to go ahead and return the
value where title zero is so let's go
ahead and look where is title zero right
here so the value of this is the New
Boston org so in other words the very
first title is equal to the New Boston
org so again the reason that I named
everything title zero title 1 title 2 is
because every time we want to you know
get the value all we need to do is
increment this counter through a loop
and it's going to grab different titles
so that's why you need to setup your
naming conventions just like I did with
a word title and the value right after
it so now you know I keep talking about
loops loops loops let's go ahead and
make the loop right now so while not too
white that's so racist
so while title is not equal to null
because basically check out what happens
it's going to loop through title 0 then
it's going to look through title 1 then
it's going to look for title 2 and title
2 doesn't exist so it's equal to null so
that's what we're pretty much saying as
long as you have you know websites then
what do you want to do well what we want
to do is the first thing we want to do
is we want to grab the URL so we pretty
much use the same functionality as here
but instead of the title parameter we're
going to use it for the address
parameter so just store this in the
variable address which is what we
created up here so address equals get
parameter address plus counter so the
very first time that this loops through
let's see what address zero is so since
our our counter is a zero on the first
loop it's going ahead going to store the
value of HTTP the new Boston no org in
the variable address now remember right
now this is only a string and we can't
have that because like I said our hash
map only stores URLs and like I said
Java can't open strings it can only open
URLs so what we need to do is convert
this to our you to a URL object so in
order to do that go ahead and put a try
statement and actually want to just go
ahead and catch us right now because I
friggin hate caches for some reason
malformed I have to make sure I freaking
spell desert URL exception and name this
on URL exception and might as well
handle this so URL exception will just
print stack trace there we go so
basically now that we handled why is
this a oh I need to go ahead and write
some try code in here all right so now
what we want to do that we took care of
the catch which is pretty much
housekeeping stuff is convert this
address which is a string to a URL
object now we already have we already
told um Java that we're going to make a
URL object and store it in the variable
URL so let's go ahead and say URL equals
new URL now in order to convert a string
to our URL object just go ahead and pass
in a string right here and what this
basically does is it runs this class and
creates a URL object out of this string
address so basically every time that we
loop through right now it's going to
grab the value from this string or
excuse me the value from
this parameter which is just a string of
text called address and in this line of
code it's going to convert that to a URL
object so why are we converting it to a
URL object well because our class in it
it uses a hash map which has a string
which is the title of the website
associated with the URL object so now
since that's the case I think it would
be a good idea to actually add this
information into the hash map so
remember our hash map was named website
info and in order to add um keys and
values in order to add things into your
hash map you actually need to use the
object put so the first one as you can
see is the key and the key here is title
which is the title of the website and
the value is the URL object which is of
course if you couldn't guess URL so
every time this little line of code runs
it's going to add a new item into your
hash map the title and the URL so our
first key value pair in our hash map is
the new box in the org which is the
title and the URL which is actually a
URL object now that's much easier for
Java this URL right here the next object
it's going to add whenever it loops
through the next time is buckey's
Twitter and Bucky's Twitter URL as a URL
object so the last thing that we need to
do is we need to add the crap to the
titles ArrayList so remember when we
created this titles ArrayList right here
well let's go ahead and populate that
and this is actually really easy write
the name of your array list which is
titles right add and then write title
right there so remember the title is
pretty much that first thing we grabbed
from that parameter and we're just
adding it to the ArrayList much like the
same way that we added crap to arm was
it called the hashmap
so now that our try-catch is complete
and all the housekeeping stuff is pretty
much
Kaira outside your catch you want to do
two more things the first thing you want
to do is increment counter so plus plus
counter so that way you know you're not
stuck on zero the whole time it goes you
know title zero title one title two
that's why we increment that of course
probably didn't even explain that now we
actually need to change title and set
this equal to get parameter title plus
counter just like before so why do we
need to do this because remember what
our loop is going to do is it's going to
keep looping until it finds a title that
doesn't exist so it's going to say okay
does title zero exist
yup that's Bucky's website this title
one exists
yep that's Bucky's twitter this title to
exists well no that doesn't exist so now
if it doesn't exist title is going to be
equal to null
it's going to break out of the loop that
means it's done looping through all the
websites so in the next video I'm going
to show you guys how to add this applet
to an actual website and get it running
in working so anyways thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
