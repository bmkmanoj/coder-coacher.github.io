Premiere Pro tutorial and in this
tutorial now that we know how to apply
effects to our video clips I'm going to
show you how to adjust and alter the
effects and it's probably going to take
a couple tutorials so just stick with me
so let's go ahead and apply a simple
effect to this video clip let me get
something that's very apparent and when
I say all right
I probably should mention this first
when I say we're going to apply effect
and then we're going to change the
settings you're like alright if you have
the effect on there what the heck do you
need to change for example if we apply
contrast to this clip we want to tell
the program how much contrast if we want
to say all right tint this video clip
blue we're going to need to tell it how
blue or how much blue to add to it so
each effect has a bunch of settings to
go with it so let me make something
that's really apparent so let me go to
video effects and let me look for
something stylize these are some really
obvious ones and poster eyes if I can
find it I remember that one go ahead and
drag this over to your video clip and
let go and what this does is it takes
that clip and it makes it into a poster
or at least it tries to actually if you
go ahead and turn this off you see this
red hot chili pepper poster that's a
really good example that this would be
what it would be previously like this
food fighters one a real life photograph
and we would want to poster eyes it so
this is actually a really cool tutorial
in that sense we're going to turn this
into this so let me go ahead and if we
can see if we maximize poster eyes we
see a setting called levels now it's
pretty much saying all right how much do
you want to turn it from reality into a
cartoon so if we go ahead and give it
something like 66 this is getting
towards more realistic however if we
bring down the setting and by the way if
you hover over it you can click it and
change it manually and hit enter or you
can just go ahead and click and slide
left or right like this and it will
change it just like that
so for example if we change it to three
or four check it out and now looks more
like a poster so this is a real quick
example of how we can change a setting
on an effect depending on what we're
going for
now posterized to be honest I don't
really use a lot this is like kind of an
effect you use if you're making of music
video in the 1980s or something so let
me go ahead and show you guys how to do
some things real quick if you ever are
working with an effect and you're not
quite sure if you want to apply it to
your final video or not you can go ahead
and hit this little FX button right here
and this is going to temporarily hide it
or turn it on so let's say do I want
that I'm going to go ahead and turn it
off on okay what one looks better turn
off and on and off and on and that way
you can kind of see kind of preview it
without having to delete it permanently
however if you do want to delete it
permanently all you have to do is hover
over the name which is in this case
posterized
and hit delete and there you go your
effect is gone for good
so again posterized isn't the best
effect but let me show you guys in fact
that I use every single time on every
single video I ever made and that is
under adjust if you go ahead and apply
levels and I'm just going to go ahead
and drag this to the effects controls
and drop we get to mess with all these
levels now I only mess with the top to
black and white and this is pretty much
customizing the contrast of your video
now I don't know how good this is going
to pop up whenever I do a YouTube
tutorial so I'm going to kind of blast
this out what this is pretty much as
asking you is I'm going to make the dark
pixels darker by going head and sliding
that over to I don't know let me say
somewhere around 20 and I'm going to
make the light pixels lighter so this is
it 255 which is the very top I'm going
to go ahead and drag this down to 240 or
something like that
and I don't know how good this is going
to appear
go ahead and bless this even more on
YouTube since you know I kind of have to
process this video then upload it to
YouTube then you watch it on YouTube so
make sure you're watching this on full
screen so you can see the difference
again you never really are going to use
posterized that's kind of a fun one but
this one is really good if you want to
take any video that you film with your
handy cam and turn it into an instantly
better looking video clip let me go
ahead and turn this effect off and you
see it kind of looks washed over glazed
gray kind of now turn it on and suddenly
the contrast just pops out the darks are
dark darker and the lights are lighter
so again that's the beauty of levels and
let me go ahead and bless this even more
see it pretty much lets you customize
the contrast now again I wouldn't ever
want to do it this much this is this is
just so I want to make sure you guys can
see what's going on on YouTube but that
is one that I use a lot so guys don't
forget levels that will come in handy so
let me go ahead and delete levels in if
you noticed before you even apply any
effects at all any video clip you select
has some effects that are already built
in and you're saying alright where the
heck did these come from I didn't apply
these ones well the reason they have
these is that they're common to every
single file on Premiere Pro they all
share the same four basic effects in
that's motion opacity time remapping and
volume now some things like pictures and
titles they don't have volume or audio
so they aren't going to be there with
this but motion opacity and time
remapping is all the same now motion if
we go ahead and scroll down to the sub
effects we can see that it pretty much
changes the position of your entire
video clip so you usually just want to
leave that the same however if you're
messing with it and you're like alright
I accidentally hit something I got that
messed up just go ahead and hit this
button right here and that's going to
reset everything to normal so again I
never really touch motion opacity
however is something that's
come in handy a lot whenever you're
wanting to fade now it's pretty much a
transparency of your video now if we
just went ahead and shut off all our
videos you would see that it's black we
just have a black video behind
everything so the transparency whenever
we put it down to zero it's pretty much
going to say all right it's totally
see-through if we fade it up to around
50 then it's going to be able to see
some of the black behind it and if you
go ahead and turn it to a hundred it's
going to be totally opaque so that's
what opacity is pretty much the
transparency for those of you guys who
didn't know time remapping is pretty
much the speed how fast your video is
going to play it's pretty much whenever
you're working with slow motion or you
want to give it the speeding up effect
like a fast-forward effect maybe in a
car chase scene this is when you would
use that but I really don't like to use
it that much and the volume of course
whenever you I don't know maybe you want
to just totally shut off the volume or
maybe you're playing a song and you want
it to fade in that's when we're going to
be working with these volume effects
right here but for now I don't really
want to get into it into the next
tutorial and then in the next tutorial
I'm going to show you guys how to work
with something called keyframes and it's
going to make it a whole lot easier so
in this tutorial I just want to point
out that yes indeed there are four
built-in effects already and that's what
they do
and aside from these four built-in
effects you can also apply other effects
and whenever you do you can go ahead and
change the settings of those effects by
just expanding and changing the settings
like that so with all of that that
should keep you busy for a while but
once you're done messing around with the
effects make sure to check out my next
tutorial where I'm going to be talking
about how to work with keyframes and
that's a whole nother world and once we
learn how to work with keyframes that's
all there is to cover with effects so I
know there's a lot to cover with effects
but trust me guys just applying some
simple effects to your video can make a
world of difference between the video
quality between something that you go
and shoot out and it looks like crappy
YouTube quality to professional expert
looking video
so I'm going to be showing you some tips
later on but definitely stick with me
watch these tutorials and you're going
to be a pro in no time so thank you for
watching don't forget subscribe and I
will see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
