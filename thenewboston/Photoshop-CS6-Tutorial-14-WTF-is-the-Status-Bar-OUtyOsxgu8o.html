hotter than Satan's nipples in my room
today because it's 80 degrees out or
like 88 or something like that with like
100 percent humidity or something crazy
like that but this is buddy Blackford
and today I'm going to go over something
with you that most tutorials probably
haven't gone over about Photoshop and
that's this little status bar down here
that a lot of people don't even know
exists or they didn't even know that you
could actually change the different
types of things that are down there so
what I want to do today is just go over
the status bar and what each of these
things will tell you now the first thing
it starts off on always usually is
document sizes now that's a pretty
self-explanatory Rand what do these two
different numbers mean the left number
tells you the flatten size of the image
file so when all the layers get
condensed into one and the right number
indicates the size of the current file
which is like all your layers like
opened up together so these three layers
all together equals a 7.3 3 megabytes
and then if I select them all and
flatten it into just one image with no
layers it'll be two point seven five
megabytes so that's what the document
sizes being if I go up here to Adobe
Drive nothing is going to show up but if
you have a file management enabled then
something will show up there for you now
I want to say that if I talk about
something and it doesn't make any sense
to you right now just keep it in the
back of your mind and then when we get
to the tutorial where we discuss that
later then you'll be like okay now I
remember that it was in the status bar
so just kind of keep this stuff in the
back your mind and if you're taking
notes just put it like put make like a
little note to like come back to it or
something like that
so we've got the next one which is the
document profile now this displays the
color profile for the document and srgb
blah blah blah this number that's
usually means it's for web so there's a
whole there's a bunch of different color
profiles that are used for some of them
are used for printing some of them are
used for video and some of them are used
for high quality image like high quality
images from like a DSLR camera etc
there's a whole bunch of them so this is
the shows your color profile so these
are like quick reference like little
things we got document dimensions and
instead of coming up to image and then
like canvas size and checking out the
document dimensions here you can just
check them out really quickly here and
then it also gives you the resolution so
this document is 4 inches by two point
six six seven let's see the next one
is scratch sizes so there's two numbers
here the left number indicates the
scratch sticks are why I just said a
swear word sweet the scratch disk space
and that is required by Photoshop and
then the right number has the available
space that you have so I only need 891
megabytes and I've got 10 gigs of space
allocated for Photoshop so that's good
we've got efficiency next and this shows
the percentage of available ram and
script scratch disk space so I'm running
at a hundred percent efficiency
and let's go to the next one timing
pretty much records the amount of time
to perform the last command that you
just did so if I like try to like put
like a filter on let me try Oh quick I
know that this does man who cares
I can always undo it I'll just throw a
filter on and that filter took zero
seconds to do so now go back and undo
that and step backwards again nope nice
but that's what the timing does it just
shows it how much in between that only
you can tell if your photoshop's lagging
and all that stuff and you can tell
which filters and effects and stuff like
that pretty much take long to like apply
some of them take a little more power to
our processing power to use so we'll go
to current tool and when you click on
your different tools here it's going to
tell you the name of your tool down
there at the bottom which is pretty nice
let's go to 32-bit exposure and it lets
you control like the overall image
exposure so we've got everything going
on we can see all our stuff going on
here and we got three channels and all
that kind of stuff
exposure works in 32-bit only I mean
we're in the 64-bit version of Photoshop
so it's not going to work in this and
then we've got a save progress which
probably when I save it it'll probably
show up so let me save this and that was
so quick that it didn't take it like any
time but if I have a lot more stuff
going on a whole bunch of layers it'll
take a little bit longer to save then
you'll see the save progress then that
way you can tell if your Photoshop has
crashed or
or anything or froze or anything like
that so that's the status bar for you
and you may not see that in other
tutorials but I'm going to go in a
decent amount of depth through my
Photoshop tutorials with you guys so you
guys can like get trained properly in it
so thanks for watching this one and
we'll see you in the next tutorial and
hopefully it's not so effing hot in my
in this area so thanks a lot see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
