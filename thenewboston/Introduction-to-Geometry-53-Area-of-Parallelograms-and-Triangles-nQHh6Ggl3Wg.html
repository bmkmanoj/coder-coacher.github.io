parallelograms and triangles and these
are a little bit harder to do than
rectangles and squares but not that much
you just have to make sure that you're
substituting the right values in so for
a parallelogram to find the area where
we're going to do base times height in
this height if you see right here is
called the altitude and it's always
perpendicular to the base that's why
when we do a square we don't have to
find a new altitude because this side is
the altitude or a rectangle because this
side is the altitude of a rectangle but
because the parallelogram doesn't have
right angles we have to draw in this new
height and then our area is base times
height and for a triangle it's pretty
similar if you look if I were to draw in
this diagonal of this parallelogram I
would get a triangle that's why when we
find the area of a triangle it's
one-half base times height because it's
a half the area we would get if we had a
parallelogram and in a triangle unless
it's a right triangle because a right
triangle already has a height because
this is perpendicular to that unless
it's a right triangle you have to draw
in a height in here and then your area
is one-half base times height now
sometimes you're going to have to draw
your height outside the triangle or
outside you shouldn't have to do it
outside of triangle often but sometimes
you have to do it for a parallelogram
because this is the only place where
it's going to form a right angle but you
want to make sure that you use this
piece as the base instead of this whole
piece and then your height is still
going to give you the right area so now
we're going to do some examples to find
the area of the parallelogram so they've
already drawn the height in for us
and they told us that the height is
seven now the height is always going to
be perpendicular to the side that we use
as the base so for this particular try
or parallelogram this is our base or
this one but since in a parallelogram
opposite sides are congruent it doesn't
matter so our base is eight so the area
of this parallelogram is 7 times 8 which
is going to give us 56 and there aren't
units on this one but say they told us
that these were in centimeters our area
would be fifty six centimeters squared
now we're going to do one more example
find the area so they give us our height
and our height is equal to eight now if
you look when we use our base we need
this entire side not just this piece of
the base so in order to find out with
this but this part of the base equals
we're going to have to use our
Pythagorean theorem to solve for B so if
you look right here inside this bigger
triangle a right triangle is formed
right here so we're going to use the
Pythagorean theorem on this right
triangle to find be so a squared plus B
squared is equal to the hypotenuse
squared eight squared is 64 plus B
squared and if you plug that into the
calculator you get 17 squared is equal
to 89 so b squared is equal we're going
to subtract the 64 over and I'll get 225
if you take the square root of that and
put it into a calculator you get B is
equal to a plus or minus 115
or not a hundred and fifteen just 15 now
if you remember where this is a distance
we can't have negative distance so we're
just going to take the positive value of
B so this is 15 so to get the whole base
i'm going to add 6 plus 15 if you do
that you'll get 21 so to find the area
of this triangle we're going to take
half the base which is 21 times the
height now it doesn't matter what order
you multiply in because multiplication
is commutative so I'm just going to do
the easier one first one half times 8 is
4 times 21 it's going to give you eighty
four so our the area of this triangle is
84 and pretend the said inches inches
squared so that's all with
parallelograms and triangles make sure
you come back and watch the next one
where we're going to do areas of a
trapezoid</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
