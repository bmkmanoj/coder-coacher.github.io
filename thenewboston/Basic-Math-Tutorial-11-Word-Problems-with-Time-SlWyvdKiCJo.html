of time these are word problems first
word problem says your friends that are
riding his bike at 9:35 to get to your
house it took them an hour and 15
minutes what time need to get to your
house we can figure this out in two ways
we can look at the clock put your hand
on the nine the hour hand and the minute
hand on the thirty five so it took them
an hour and fifteen minutes so we take
the hour hand one hour goes up advances
one to the ten and the minute hand
advances 15 5 10 15 so they should both
be landing on the 10 to read this it
says 10 50 and that's your answer to do
without the clock you can just do
strictly math so your friend started
writing this bike at 9:35 took them 1
hour and 15 minutes all you have to do
is add one to the hour it's 10 and add
15 to 35 5 + 5 is 10 carry the 1 3 4 5
at 10 50 and that is your answer so a
second where parlament says you leave
for the grocery store 5:45 and arrive
back home at 7:30 p.m.
it takes you 5 minutes to drive the
grocery store and 5 minutes back how
long did you spend shopping at the
grocery store you see you put your big
hand on the 5 big hand on the 5 or the
hour hand and the minute hand on the 45
so that's a 5:45 you ride back home at
7:30 so you put the hour hand on the 7
and the minute hand on the 30 so you see
the hour hand advanced 2 hours and the
minute hand went back 15 minutes 2 hours
- 15 minutes is
equivalent to this - this to make it
easier to do in your head so it took
them one hour and 60 - 15 Bravo 5 put 10
10 minus 5 is 5 5 minus 4 is 4 so that's
1 hour and 45 minutes but you also have
to take an account the five minutes
taking to drive there and the five
minutes taking back so 5 + 5 is 10 so
you subtract the 10 so it took you one
hour and 35 minutes of shop in the
grocery store we can do this all without
using the clock as well let me delete
all this real quick so what you do is
you put down the five forty five and the
seven thirty you subtract the five 45
from the seven thirty
let me just erase this real quick
so you take 7:30 and you subtract 5 45
but senses aren't this is the 45 is
greater than the 30 you have to
equivalent
the one hour in two minutes so you are
able to do this so every 60 minutes
equals 1 hour so 730 is equal to 690 so
you subtract the 45 from the 90 bring
down the 5 8 minus 4 is 4 and 1 so it's
actually 1 hour and 45 minutes and you
also have to subtract the 10 minutes it
took you to get there and back so it's 1
hour and 35 minutes let's use a
different example so your dad wanted to
go to the 1210 movie it takes them 45
minutes again
