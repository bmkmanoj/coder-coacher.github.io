Photoshop cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and today
in Photoshop cs6 we're going to start
working with text styles and I'm not
talking about fabrics or Cotton's or
anything like that I'm talking about
paragraph styles and character styles
and these basically hold information
that contains settings for like types of
fonts that you want to save or
paragraphs that you want to save so a
paragraph style is a group of paragraph
format settings that can be applied to
text and a character style is a group of
format settings that can be applied to
text as well so one of them the
character styles are applied to
basically like your font and the
paragraph style is basically applied to
your paragraphs so let's go ahead and
start working on this I created ahead of
time a character style that I wanted to
use and I'm just gonna start typing out
something and pretty much it's good to
have a style because you can take over
any type of text that you have and
change that really quickly with your
settings that you already picked out so
select your layer well I'm gonna select
my layer because you guys don't have one
yeah I'm gonna select my layer and I'm
gonna click on this button right here
and it's gonna change my text to when I
set it to in my style here now if I want
to make a new style which we all should
right now go ahead and click on this new
style button I'm gonna delete my layer
out real quick first alright now I'm
gonna make a new style
it's called character style one comes up
go ahead and double click on that
and we can rename it and we can name it
whatever you want to I'm just gonna
tutorial styles when I'm gonna name mine
we can select our font that we want I'm
just gonna slide this Apple Chancery and
I'm not well I'll select something else
I'll select Arial and that way I can
flex selecting my style as well now this
go bold my size I'm gonna make 30 so
everybody can see it
my currying metrics leading auto
tracking it's gonna be at zero you can
change it to all caps small caps or
normal your position my color I'll just
make it like I like that I think of this
kind of blueish color here alright and
then we can't apply these kind of things
to it too as well underline bold I
already have it set the bold up here so
I don't really want the faux bold and
now I'm just gonna go ahead and hit OK
and I have created my style now I'm just
gonna start typing some stuff this text
size is really huge for some reason
alright let's uh type in something new
so we'll just do no coming out with some
of my characters on add I just picked
I'm gonna take that off we'll just make
it this color or something like that
where are these take those off okay all
right now I've got that in there now I
can go back to my paragraph or to my
character styles here and make sure my
layer selected and hit this button and
it should change it out yeah there we go
for some reason is saved it as Ariel
sometimes it does that I think this
might have some bugs in it or something
let's go back to Apple Chancery wherever
that was
oh yeah we set it as Ariel never mind
that first time I thought I had selected
Apple Chancery but we changed it but now
we've got this and it applied this to
the underline and everything to it
because I applied the thing applied the
style now I've been one since I've been
working with this it's been a little bit
I would say it's not buggy it's just
like when it doesn't do like the things
you want it to do all the time so you
need to like pretty much follow the
directions through and make sure you're
doing it right or else you're gonna
start overriding things and everything
else so if you hit the wrong button down
here you could accidentally override all
the settings that you used and override
it with whatever you just typed in so
that can get annoying so just be careful
so let's start going over some new
things and I wanted to let you know that
these paragraph styles and character
styles are new to cs6 so this is
something that they're trying to
implement and I'm sure they're gonna get
a little bit better back in the next in
the next iteration so I'm not sure if
this is a little bit better in CC but
we'll
because I haven't checked that out yet
but in Photoshop that's fairly new
Photoshop cs6 so one thing that's pretty
cool is that if you already have some
Styles selected you our Styles created
you can switch between these Styles so I
can click on the basic one that I
created and it'll change to that I can
click on none and it'll change to
whatever I had whatever is set to none
so this one has an underline on it and
standard roman vertical alignment that I
put onto it let's check out some of
these in advance character formats you
can see we can fix up the height the
width and the the word the thing that
where it is on the height and on here so
like how high it is on the line that you
are typing on forgot the name of it
right off the top of my head and then
we've got open type features and this is
for some of the open type fonts they'll
have it the heaven Oh next to the name
when you're going to select a font and
you've got some different things going
on here that you can add to the open
type features so just a mess around with
those will on your own time I don't want
to have to waste your time by showing
you every single one it's something that
you can check out in your own time so
we've got the ability to switch and you
know how to create so you can create by
hitting this button right here and the
options panel is always open there to
for you to change to fix up some things
you can load up styles that you have
saved you can download them off the
internet and load them into Photoshop
and then you just have a bunch of them
for easy access
and all that stuff so let's go to
paragraph Styles right here we've got
basic paragraph
and I can apply that clicking on the
button here and it just applied the
paragraph options if I double click on
this we can see that there's a lot of
features so basically we've got our font
family and all these character options
and stuff like that that we had in the
last one we've got these formats here
that were in the last and the open type
features so it contains the character
styles along with other paragraph styles
so just to remember that when you're
using this so character Styles has a lot
less in it and paragraph Styles has a
lot more in it we've got our indents and
our spacing that we can go through we've
got we can fix up our alignment and
everything like that we've got our
composition pretty much just keep it on
Adobe single line composer justification
this we can put in percentages to show
which where we're going to be within our
paragraph if it's justified so you would
set that if I go to my indents and
spacing we got our justifies here and
then we've got hyphenation
and you can actually set how much it's
going to hyphenate and everything like
that within this section so that's
pretty cool and the same way to apply it
the same as the other ones so that's all
I wanted to show you about these new
text styles and remember not the fabrics
they deal with text in Photoshop cs6 so
