Robertson welcome to your very first
tutorial in biology now in this video
series what I want to do is I want to
talk to you guys about many different
topics concerning biology for example I
want to talk to you guys about DNA and
genetics in cells in bacteria in life
and a whole bunch of interesting stuff
but since this is the very first video I
think what we should do in this video is
just stick with the very basics and the
first thing I want to do is talk to you
guys about what is biology so let's go
ahead and answer that question and the
definition of biology is this the study
of life in living organisms all right
that makes sense up to a certain point
up until organisms because you may have
heard of organisms before and you may
have your own definition but the
scientific definition of an organism is
a living thing well that's easy we know
what living things are I'm a living
thing plants grass is a living thing my
puppy named old Dan cutest puppy ever by
the way is a living thing but whenever
we talk about living things believe it
or not things get kind of complicated
because then you have to ask yourself
what is life well of course if you ask
your grandma or your best friend or even
if you ask a philosopher what is life
everyone is going to give you kind of a
different definition of their outlook on
life however whenever scientists and
biologists were first deciding you know
what what is life
that's the problem that they had
everyone had their own separate
definition of life itself so what they
needed to do before biology was even
invented which is of course the study of
life is scientists needed to agree on
the definition of life so right now
modern-day what they did is they made a
definition based on eight different
characteristics or eight different rules
that something must follow in order to
be considered a living thing or an
organism so what I'm going to do in the
upcoming videos I don't know if it's
going to take just this video or maybe
I'm going to have to split it up into
two or three videos but I'm going to be
covering each rule one through
and these are the rules that define the
characteristics of life so let's go
ahead and get started with rule number
one now rule number one or in other
words the first characteristic that
something must have in order to be
considered a living thing is that living
things are made of cells now you may
have heard of the term cells before if
not don't worry you're going to be
covering them in a few videos but every
living thing is made of cells and these
things called cells contain something
called d-n-a now the reason I said if
you never heard of cells before don't
worry about it right now is because even
though the definition of a cell is like
the smallest single unit of life I
really don't want to get into it any
more than that and this is why some
people go to school for eight years and
then they work their entire career
towards learning about the human cell
just the human cell so obviously it's a
very complex topic and I really can't
you know tell you guys everything about
a cell and you know five minute video so
that's why I want to talk about it in
detail later on but for now just
remember the rule of something or that
something has to follow in order to be
considered a living thing is that all
living things are made up of these
smaller units or smaller living things
called cells and in every cell is
something called DN a now you guys are
also probably familiar with DNA if not
once I draw the picture you guys are
going to understand what it is it's the
thing that kind of looks like a twisted
ladder and it has these little rungs in
between and even though you may be
familiar with a shape but not exactly
what it is again we're going to be going
into more detail about what exactly it
is but for right now if curiosity is
just killing you and you want to know
what it is
DNA is basically the genetic material or
instruction for the structure and the
function of cells basically it's part of
the brain of the cell so without DNA
your cell would be kind of dumb</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
