your 30 second Java tutorial and in this
tutorial i'm gonna be teaching you guys
how to pass arrays into methods now i
tell you guys how to make basic methods
and i also taught you guys how to use
simple variables and methods well a race
can be a little tricky so that's what
i'm going to teach you guys how to do
this time so before we start passing
arrays into methods we actually need in
array so let's go ahead and make one
again called bucky and i just make your
array initializer and put 3 4 5 6 7
might as well and that's that for now so
now that we have an array we actually
need to build a method to do something
to this so here's your main method right
now so go outside your main method and
again make sure you're inside your class
by outside your main method and go ahead
and type public static void and then
name your method i'm just going to name
my change because i'm going to want to
change my array now what you need here
is the type and your local arm like how
we built a variable last time you wanted
to do the same thing but instead of
having just a variable name you want to
put those square brackets over it and
that says that alright we're going to be
building a method here and it's going to
take a parameter of one array so make
sure you name a variable which is
actually an array and add those square
brackets and that's how you tell that
you're going to be putting an array in
here next go ahead and let's add
something so we can put in our method
that we just built so in this method
what do we want to do to change our
array let's just say we want to take all
the values in our array and add 5 to
them just add something real simple so I
can show you guys so just add a basic
for loop to loop through put int counter
make sure I spell it right set it equal
to 0 because that's the first index
counter is less than X length and
remember that's built-in thing that Java
knows and then just add one and let's
just put X counter and plus equal five
and what this does right here is it
takes on all the indexes in the array
and adds five to each value of them so
again you should know what this does
already don't forget to put it in a
separate method aside from your main one
so now that we got a separate method
built and again the most important thing
probably in this tutorial is in this
parameter in this method make sure to
have an array instead of just a regular
variable so now back in our main method
what we wanted to do is just call on the
method so how you do this is put the
method name and in your parentheses go
ahead and write the array name so mine
is Bucky and again since I'm Java
already knows how long it is you don't
have to put how many elements like four
or five all you have to put is the name
of the array since this is Bucky with
this many elements just put Bucky and it
knows our matically how many elements is
supposed to pass into Urich
so now our array is changed so we made
an array we changed it so now we just
got printed out on the screen so we can
see it so let's use that enhanced
for-loop that we talked about in the
last Oriole and once I get my
parentheses and Y again this is called
Bucky and let's just put system
out print line and we'll print Y so that
should work I believe so let's go ahead
and run this and as you can see the
original array was three four five six
seven and our new array is eight nine
ten eleven twelve so it added five to
the array which we wanted to do so let
me show you guys one last time what this
does
we made an array like we did a million
times called Bucky three four five six
seven we next said or I take that array
Bucky and pass it into the method change
or says all right where's the method
change oh it's down here so I took that
array now what am I supposed to do to it
Oh take each of the values in add five
to them all right I did that now let's
come back here alright what do you want
me to do next well just print it all out
on the screen and we know how to do that
from last time so make an array change
it print it out on the screen and again
um the syntax is a little different than
making a regular method so pay attention
especially that you don't need a number
right here and also that you need to
define your array right here so aside
from that it's pretty simple so pay
attention to that play around with it
and get good at it and then once you're
good you can move on to my next tutorial
so thank you guys for watching I hope
you learn at least some of this don't
forget to subscribe to my channel and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
