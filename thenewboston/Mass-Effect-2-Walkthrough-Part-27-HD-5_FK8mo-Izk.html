ah
hey have a nice trip
concentrate fire on my position
can you cover
I need cover nice shooting
thank you sir
understood
here you are it's about time the
batteries on these tanks will not wait
while you play with these idiotic mercs
I take it yer oquirrh you don't seem
particularly cage or grateful that I'm
here you may claim to be here to help
but a formerly deceased Shepherd is not
a sign of gentle change surprised old
Croghan should know you Oh have you
forgotten your actions of the Maya I'm
sure you're eager to retell the story
such a team siren the spectre trader
threatens the return of the krogan horde
by curing the genophage undoing the
gentle genocide of the torrians and
Solarians thoughts before sarin can
deliver his in districts in rod shepherd
securing victory through nucleophile i
like that thought it has wait I didn't
have a lot of room for finance if
there'd been any other solution I'd have
considered but I approve sarens bo horde
were not true growing numbers are no not
nothing the mistake of an outsider one
that these mercenaries have also made
I gave their knee to my rejects flower
army but she grows impatient it's time
for you to take me out of here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
