day 3 I left the beach obviously as you
can see and I started walking upstream
and I found a little I was like a little
Brook that led to the main river so I
started walking along that because I
really don't want to follow that River I
didn't know where I'll end so that's
where I am right now as you can see it's
a little bit different than in my speech
and it actually rained a little bit last
night which kind of sucked because and
now my hoodies soaking wet but um I did
get some sleep
surprisingly I think it's because first
of all I had a fire for a little bit
until the wood got all wet and there
also weren't as many bugs by the beach
which is pretty cool and another thing I
think that the first night I was way too
worried about you know just like random
noises like anything that made a noise
that kept me awake but now last night I
was just like whatever I'm way too
hungry to be worrying about REM noises
keeping me awake and I just figure if
something makes a noise and some animal
comes and it's either gonna get a meal
out of me or I'm gonna kill it because I
am incredibly hungry right now this is
I've never been so hungry in my life so
right now I'm kind of hoping that
something tries to attack me because I
will kill it and eat it
no matter what and other than that I
don't know if you guys can hear the
Thunder or heard the Thunder but I feel
a couple of sprinkles right now so I got
feeling it's going to start pouring on
me again so that's why I wanted to film
now before it started raining again but
anyways I think I'm gonna continue to
follow this Creek and I also got rid of
my little spear that I made because I
don't know first of all I wasn't
catching any fish with it and second I
think that the next pond I come to or
Creek or a lake or anybody of water then
I'm gonna try to make a smaller spear
and catch a frog with it because I think
that's my best source of food fish
even if I found a fish according to
those minnows they're gonna be way too
fast for me to catch even with a spear
so it's starting to sprinkle now so I'm
gonna go ahead and pack my camcorder way
maybe I'll film me walking with a GoPro
but uh anyways I'll give you guys a
update whenever I can
well it did rain a lot a lot harder than
I thought it was gonna and at first it
was alright because first of all it was
a lot cooler whenever it started raining
so I wasn't so hot I actually got to
wear my hoodie as you can see and I can
put my tripod in my hoodie pocket
whenever I'm wearing it and it's just
tight enough so it doesn't fall out
which is awesome and you know you have
both your hands for you to swap bugs or
whatever but also freaking dragonflies
doing acrobatics also whenever it's
raining there are no bugs which is
awesome and now that stop grinning as
you can see they're a bunch of bugs
flying around in my head but it was a
lot cooler I got to wear my hoodie the
tripod no bugs in right now I am at a
beaver pond I'm guessing it's a beaver
pond because there's a lot of trees then
maybe it's just a regular pond but you
see all these trees in the ground I'm
guessing that a beaver did that so
that's where I am
after raining it actually was raining
lightly at first which is awesome but
then it started freakin pouring and as
you can see my pants are soaking wet my
boots so I'm just gonna keep walking and
I guess the planner right now is I found
this mountain let me give you guys good
view see that mount on the way up there
that's where I'm gonna climb I'm
guessing that it's I don't know it's
probably going to be a couple miles a
couple of hours so I get to get to the
top but hopefully
I find something that resembles a human
being either people hiking or a
telephone pole or if I get to the top
I'm gonna look all around fine you know
a small town or road anything at all I'm
hoping I'm ready to get out of here I
haven't had anything to eat and I had to
look around this pond no frogs
whatsoever so there goes that plan but
uh that's flame gonna climb the mountain
and take it from there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
