everything we learned in these past
couple lessons about multiplying to
solve polynomial equations so the first
thing we're gonna do is distribute this
2 and this 3 and we're gonna collect
like terms and solve so 4x minus 2 is
equal to 3x minus 6 plus 10 I combine
these two I get 4x minus 2 equals 3x
plus 4 I'm gonna add this 2 over and
subtract this 3x over and I get X is
equal to 6 so now we're just gonna do
some more examples practicing's solving
these polynomial equations ok so we're
going to distribute this 2 again and
this 3 2y plus 2 times 1 is 1 is 2 plus
3 times y 3y minus 3 times negative 1 3
9 so we're gonna combine these like
terms so we get 5 like positive 2 minus
3 negative 1 is equal to 9 subtract that
not that one over and we get 5y is equal
excuse me add that one over I've I is
equal to 10 y is equal to 2 okay so this
one looks a little more complicated but
the main thing to remember right here is
that this negative right here stands for
a negative 1 so even though it doesn't
look like we have to distribute it we do
because the signs gonna change when we
multiply by that negative 1 so X minus x
squared minus 1 times 2x x times
negative 1 negative x negative 1 times
negative 1 positive 1 5 plus 2x minus
three x squared oh I forgot an x squared
on that X right there so X minus X those
X's are going to go away negative x
squared minus three x squared gives me
negative three x squared plus one is
equal to 5 plus 2 X minus 3 X well I'm
gonna bring this five over here and
subtract or add this 3x onto the side so
that's gonna go to zero one minus a
negative or one minus 5 gives me
negative 4 is equal to 2x if I divide by
to get X is equal to negative 2 so we're
gonna do one last example and this one's
a little more complicated because we
have a lot of squaring out to do but
it's really helpful if you remember this
little pattern that we figured out when
we square binomials remember you get a
squared plus 2 a B plus B squared so for
this one 2x plus 1 squared I just have
to square the first one 4 x squared I
multiply these together 2x times 1 just
be 2x multiply it by 2 plus 4x and
square this term right here which is
just going to be 1 and this is gonna be
- and at first I'm gonna keep I'm gonna
square this first and I'm gonna keep
these terms inside parentheses so that I
don't forget to distribute this negative
1 so I'm gonna do the same thing right
here first squared is 4x squared these
two multiplied is this time it's going
to be negative 2x times 2 negative 4x
and square this one it's still going to
be positive 1 I'm going to square this
one the same way x squared multiply
these together you get 6x times 2 is 12
X plus this one squared 36
- x squared so I'm gonna combine these
terms on the side just because I know
that x squared - x squared is just gonna
go to 0
now I'm gonna distribute this negative
one to each one so I get 4x squared plus
4x plus 1 negative 1 times 4x squared
negative 4x squared negative 1 times
negative 4x it's gonna give me positive
4x negative 1 times positive 1 is going
to be negative 1 and I just have 12x
plus 36 left on this side well a
positive 4x squared and then negative 4x
squared is gonna cancel and positive 1
and a negative 1 are gonna cancel and 4x
plus 4x is 8x is equal to 12x minus 36
I'm going to subtract the 12x over an 8
minus 12 is negative 4x is equal to
positive 36 divided by negative 4 again
X is equal to negative 9 so that's all
we're gonna deal with today but in our
next lesson we're going to talk about
how we can use algebra to solve
geometric problems like in geometry when
we find perimeter or area we're going to
use our polynomials to solve those so
make sure you come back and check that
