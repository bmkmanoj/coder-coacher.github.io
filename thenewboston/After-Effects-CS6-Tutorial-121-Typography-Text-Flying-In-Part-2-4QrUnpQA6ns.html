because it's gonna fly in and this is
this is where we want our final
positions so keyframe this where you
want it and your final position and
keyframe and then what we're gonna do is
we need to overshoot and undershoot to
create that bouncy effect so we're going
to press page up to move backwards a few
frames so we're gonna go three frames
one two three and this is gonna be plus
50 for the overshoot or for the under
shoot I think I can't remember what so
and then we're gonna go three spaces the
same way again by pressing page up so
three frames one two three and we're
gonna go negative 50 and that'll be
keyframed and then we're gonna come to
our first frame and hold shift and make
this come off the screen that likes so
so let's Ram preview it and see if it
looks correct
it's zoom in so I can see it better
so that looks right we got the bouncing
right and everything it just it's just
really really slow so we are going to
speed it up a little let's move these
keyframes in I'll try that see how fast
that is hmm it's a little still a little
too slow just only a little bit though
let's preview it again there we go that
looks better now we can also add some
motion blur to it would see how that
looks
got enable the motion blur button right
here about that
there we go
so we've got some motion blur on there
like that as you can see and as it's
flying in and it fades off as it slows
down so what we're gonna do now is just
copy these keyframes onto the other
layers here so let's open the position
on both of these like both of them
right click separate dimensions we're
good there select these keyframes I'm
down here and we're gonna hold ctrl or
command on the Mac and press C for copy
or you can come up to here and hit edit
copy and we're gonna come down to the
last keyframe here and move ahead by
pressing page down one keyframe and
we're gonna paste this on the Z position
and it's gonna paste where our current
time indicator is at currently so ctrl V
now we can see this one's a little too
this one's not far enough out so let's
move it back so it's off the screen
there we go and then we'll come to the
end and move ahead another keyframe or
another frame and paste on the Z
position here so this one we need to
move a little bit out again
so we got some messed up nests going on
here at 6:25 should be at zero there
Oh when I moved the Z position I moved
it for all them so I'm gonna move back
so this is where we started when I first
pasted it on and I just want to move the
Z position for this keyframe I had all
of them selected so it moved everything
back now let's see now it's in the right
spot so there we go now we can copy
these key key frames again move ahead
one frame and paste on the Z position
for this word now let's see how it looks
by previewing it
there we go that's cool let's add our
motion blurs you can add them on if you
want or you don't have to if you don't
want whatever you think looks better and
whatever your client thinks looks better
so now we're gonna do the same thing
with our picture here it copy actually
let's copy these keyframes down here
because we want it to come out like this
one does oh yeah edit copy and now we're
ahead one keyframe let's paste on here
and the z-position is now a little too
far so we'll come out like this looks
good a nibble of motion blur close all
these up and let's rent the RAM preview
and see how it looks and there you go
that's how you create some text that's
flying in and we've got the nice
landings there and in motion graphics
when you make those nice bounce backs
and overshoots and undershoots it looks
more real in our eyes expect that to
happen so when you're doing something
right and nobody notices it then you
know you've done it right I mean if
you're making something and nobody
notices that you did it right then then
you did it right obviously so there we
go so that's it for this one thanks for
watching and hopefully you guys can
create some cool looking stuff I look
forward to seeing you guys is progress
if you ever post anything on YouTube for
us to see and up like the video if if
you liked it this hour download the
video our thumbs down it I mean if you
didn't like it subscribe because we're
gonna have a bunch more After Effects
tutorials coming up and we're gonna
start getting into the some more awesome
things where we're going to start making
stuff look better since we have covered
a lot of the basics so far now we're
gonna start seeing us make some really
cool stuff so see you guys in the future
on another tutorial thanks a lot for
watching goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
