tutorial and in this lesson we're going
to be learning about dogs so you know
how people say that dogs can hear better
than humans
well actually whenever they're saying
that what they really mean to say is
dogs have a wider range of frequencies
that they can hear in comparison to
humans so dogs can actually hear at the
frequencies from 40 Hertz all the way to
60 thousand Hertz now remember that I
said is a Hertz whenever we talk about
waves is basically one cycle per second
now whenever we're talking about sound
waves we know that sound are just
vibrations in the air so this means that
if you were a dog your ear could pick up
on anywhere from 40 vibrations a second
to 60 vibrations of air per second and
you would perceive that in your little
doggie brain as sound pretty sweet huh
so now let's go ahead and take a look at
the formula V equals wavelength times
frequency and say that someone asked us
to calculate the wavelength that this
range is so the wavelength for 40 Hertz
all the way to 60 thousand Hertz well
let's go ahead and start filling in
these variables right now velocity is
how fast are these wave well excuse me
sorry just ate a hot pocket how fast are
these waves going to travel now we know
that all sound waves travel at 340
meters per second how do we know that
because that's just the speed of sound
in normal air now I know this doesn't
have anything to do with this lesson but
just a fun fact whenever the molecules
are closer together they travel faster
so since water molecules are closer
together in more jam-pack than air
molecules the speed of sound and water
is up to four times faster and actually
in solids like copper and I know it's
kind of weird to imagine a sound
traveling through you know a piece of
copper or something but the speed of
sound and copper is I think four
thousand six hundred meters per second
it's like 13 times faster than air but
anyways just remember that
speed of sound and air 340 meters per
second that other stuff was just me
rambling on so what we want to do is we
actually want to five the wavelength of
these forty and sixty thousand Hertz so
we'll just go ahead and put a question
that question mark right there because
that's we're trying to figure out now
the less variable of frequency
well our teacher asks us to figure out
forty and sixty thousand so I'll just
put sixty thousand I'll leave the units
off there for now now the very first
thing we need to do if we take a look at
this formula this is a formula that
solves for velocity however we already
have velocity so we need to change this
formula to suit what we were looking for
and that is wavelength so the formula re
when re n would be wavelength equals
velocity over frequency so let's go
ahead and do one at a time we'll start
with the lower frequency which is forty
Hertz or forty vibrations per second so
in order to figure this out we'll just
go ahead and set wavelength equal to
velocity which is 340 over forty and
once you cancel out with all the units
or something you can see that the lower
wavelength that a dog can perceive is
eight point five meters so if anyone
comes up to you and is like dude Bucky
if dogs could see sound in the air I
wonder how long apart the waves would be
and I could say well on the lower
frequency they would be exactly eight
point five meters apart and they're like
whoa Bucky I'm impressed how did you
know that like don't worry about it bro
but anyways asked me another question
and they say what about the higher
frequency of sixty thousand so of course
I got to go do the math for this we'll
just go ahead and keep the same formula
it would be three hundred forty because
the velocity does it doesn't change the
only thing that changes is the frequency
which is now sixty thousand and once you
do the math you get a range of 0.0 0.7
meters so again one last time if you
were a dog with superpowers and you
could see sound in the air then you
would notice that the waves would be
either 8.5 meters apart or point zero
zero five seven meters apart depending
on the frequency of the sound</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
