tutorial in CSS last time we learned how
to write basic syntax for CSS and this
time we're going to be learning how to
group different elements in CSS now last
time as you can see whenever we wanted
to write a rule for the same selector we
simply wrote a rule and then directly
underneath it wrote another rule fully
for it now this works just fine and
again it can be interpreted by any
browser just fine but there's actually
an easier way to group these two rules
and that's by doing this in the same
declaration you can add a different
rules by separating them with a
semicolon so after the word blue I'm
just going to type a semicolon and type
another let's say background color
and I'm gonna set it equal to red just
like before as you can see we now have
two rules one changing text color blue
and one changing the background color
red let's save this and see what it
looks like in Internet Explorer and as
you can see it's the exact same as
before but it's a lot better organized
in your syntax
now most people add different rules on
different lines just to keep things
organized and they usually add a
semicolon at the end of every one no
matter if it's separate or not this is
just good practice for when you're
writing syntax it just gets you used to
the feeling of adding a semicolon and it
makes it a whole lot easier when you're
typing long rules so while this is one
way of grouping your declarations you
can actually group selectors in a
similar way say not only you wanted
apply this rule to the body but you
wanted to apply it the heading is as
well you could go down here and type in
heading 1 and then start typing your
entire declaration all over again
or you could do something else if you
have the same rule that you want to
apply it's a different element you can
simply add a different element by
pressing comma and typing in the name of
your element so as you can see this role
not only applies to the body but also
the first headings and the paragraphs of
your entire website and we did this
without having the type two entirely
separate rules
now if you want to use a rule on
something but you don't want it to apply
to every single element say you wanted
to change something about the heading
but you didn't want to apply to all the
headings as it would right now you can
add an attribute that CSS included
called the style attribute now this is
useful when you only want to change one
element and not all of them in your
entire website so let's say we wanted to
add a border to one of the headings
heading number three so let's go ahead
and create a heading heading number
three and inside we'll write using style
attribute and we'll go ahead and close
it just like any other normal normal
heading but we want to add an attribute
that's going to give us a border with
three pixels and we only want it to
apply to this and no other headings so
let's go ahead and add the attribute
called style and set it equal to border
with three pixels and we'll make it
solid and black now as you can see this
is the exact same syntax of CSS and if
you wanted to add another rule you can
simply add a semicolon and type it in
just like you did before the only
difference is instead of using curly
braces you use quotation marks so as you
can see if we save that and viewed it in
Internet Explorer we now had a heading
with a black border around it and this
would apply only to this heading and not
any other heading number threes so this
is a way where you can apply CSS to only
a single element versus this which would
apply it to all the h1 and all the P
elements on your page so now that we
learn how to group selectors and use the
style attribute to apply CSS to a single
element in your page next we're next
time we're going to be learning how to
use keywords and strings and of course
if you want to review what we went over
today you can go to my website at the
New Boston comm I'll give you a
step-by-step instruction on everything
we learned today Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
