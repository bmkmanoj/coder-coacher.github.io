welcome to your very first tutorial in
iOS development with Swift now in this
tutorial series what I'm going to do is
I'm going to show you guys how to create
awesome iOS apps and that includes the
iPad the iPod Touch the iPhone any apps
that you want to make well you are in
luck because this is the greatest
tutorial series ever created now before
we get started I want to mention a
couple things first of all what is Swift
I never heard of this thing called Swift
before I'm kind of familiar with
computer programming but I know what the
heck's going on there well whenever
Apple first allowed developers make um
like iOS apps for the iPhone or whatever
they used a programming language called
objective-c but now just a few months
ago they came out with a brand new
language called Swift and it's pretty
much the future of iOS development so
before we get into you know adding all
the buttons and stuff on your apps I'm
going to teach you guys this computer
programming language and then once we
learn the basics of that we can move on
to making cool like iPad apps or iPhone
apps whatever you want to do so now that
that is out of the way let's go ahead
and get started I didn't want to give
you guys you know like a huge long intro
about the history of it but you know
just a little quick info so the first
thing you need to do whenever you want
to create I Oh s apps is you need an app
yd and if you go to this website right
here developer.apple.com you probably
already have one if you're working with
mac this is where you can pretty much
set up all your account stuff so the
first thing you need is an Apple ID so
if you click this button an app ID is
pretty much just uh I don't know like
any arm like google has you make an
account yahoo MIT has you make an
account well this is like Apple's
account for their main overall
everything so of course you just fill in
your first name your email password
typical stuff right here I actually
already have an Apple ID and like I said
I'm guessing you do too Oh someone's
text me right in the middle my tutorial
I might as well just go ahead and read
it
does this say it is my mom and she says
dinner at her house tonight they're
having meatballs so looks like I'll be
eating meatballs tonight cool cool all
right so now that you have an Apple ID
again I didn't want to talk you through
that because it's like typing your name
type in your last name you know you guys
can figure that out but now what we need
to do is we need to create a developer
account now whenever we have a developer
account what we can do with this is we
can download all the cool tools like
Xcode and Xcode is pretty it's just like
a really fancy text editor that you can
use to write your code and there's also
like the iOS SDK that we need and this
is pretty much arm the software
development kit specific to iOS apps so
all the stuff tailored to developing
like iPhone and iPad apps so those are
two things that we need to get so let's
go ahead and sign it now and figure out
how to do that so sign-in all my stuff's
there developer cool and you just sign
in okay the lie if I want to become a
Apple developer and all right so I
definitely read all that I know it
looked like I wasn't reading it but
trust me guys I yeah I read all the
speed of reading 101 all right so just
agree to this and okay our first
question what role best describes you
probably I don't know like incredibly
good-looking today oh they don't have
that one so let's just say that I am a
software engineer
when did you start developing for Apple
platforms we'll say pick whatever one
you want now what are you developing I'm
only been showing you guys how to
develop iOS apps anything for mobile
handheld devices so I'm just going to
click apps right there we can also do
with this these tools is you can just
develop like regular software for the
Mac like I don't know like programs like
Skype and you know like photo editors
whatever you want so if you want to do
any of that then you can fill out
whatever but again this is Toro series
is just for iPhone and iOS apps
so okay while other platforms do develop
for Android and uh Microsoft Windows do
a little bit you have on the side all
right now register thank you for
registering you are now able to sign it
to the website so hit continue and check
