Photoshop cs6 tutorial where we are
going to go over how do we use content
aware scale
do some pretty advanced scaling
techniques and it's actually really easy
but some people don't know what content
we're scaling is so whatever and my name
is buddy Blackford so let's start
getting in on this tutorial what content
we're scaling does is it looks at your
image and sees what the important parts
are so it's gonna look at this image and
see that this lifeguard tower is the
important thing in the image and when it
scales the image it's gonna try to keep
this the same size while you see well
like using stuff like the sky and the
sand and stuff
those are going to be scaled or crapped
out or whatever it whatever it does so
let's start with this now now you can
either select make a selection and you
can edit the selection that you made or
you can edit the whole entire picture so
what we're gonna do first is edit the
whole entire picture it so I can see so
you can see what's going on so the first
thing I do is though is show you what it
does when it scales on its own so I'm
gonna hit ctrl T to bring up my free
transform and when I scale it like this
you can see how this card tower gets
skinny and everything gets smushed
together and all that jazz I'm gonna hit
cancel up here we're gonna cancel that
and we're gonna go to content we're
scaling so let's go to edit and come
down here to content aware scale alt
shift ctrl C if you want to use that so
watch what happens now when I go to
scale from the same exact side look at
the sand and how it kind of like meshes
together and the same as the water and
now you notice that the the guard box
for
the lifeguard box there or whatever it
is the lifeguard tower I guess that's
the same size and content or scaling
recognized that that it's the same size
now it's starting to crush in a little
bit or it can by trying to but it still
tries to keep the decent size now when
you get to something like this you can
see that some of the legs are broken in
half and stuff like that where it tried
to scale and then that roof is like
distorted a little so you can't go like
all out right next to it and try and
keep the size you would just use a crop
tool for that obviously well you can
scale part of the image and still keep
the size of your lifeguard tower so it's
really cool now we've got a couple of
different options up here this is the
anchor point of from where you're
scaling so it's your reference point and
just click on any one of the dots to set
a different reference point from where
you want to scale you can enter in your
different guidelines or enter in your
different Heights and widths and all
that stuff for you so you can adjust the
scaling that way we've got this button
right here which sets it back to what it
was
sets it back to zero it's just a little
triangle button if you have an unchecked
it's going to have it at what your scale
over here is set at so if I move start
moving this you can see that the x-axis
is going and if I move it this way you
can see that the y-axis is moving over
here on these so I'm gonna cancel and
then we're gonna go back so we can have
our edit content to where scale so we
can have our options back up here now
you can adjust the width in the height
and right now they are locked so if I
adjust the width to 50% of what it was
the height should also be affected
though not locked oh now it's locked
so
go back edit oh man I can't undo it
there we go every time you have to click
on it again which is pretty annoying I
wish it just wouldn't have like a reset
button or something like that so if you
have this button unclick it'll do it
independently if you have this button
actually clicked then it will resize the
scale with around the same size so that
way there and it's gonna use the content
and we're scaling when it does this so I
can put it back to 100 and it'll be what
about what it was before
now this amount here it could it's the
amount of content where we're scaling
versus the amount of regular scaling so
I put this if I put this amount to 0
it's just gonna be like a regular scale
and it's gonna basically do it like that
if I put this to 50% it's gonna be half
content or scaling and have regular
scaling and obviously at a hundred
percent all content we're scaling so
that's a little thing you can use there
you adjust that to get like different
kind of effects if you if you're going
for that kind of stuff
protect here you can use a an alpha
Channel
to protect what you want to use so if
you've had an alpha channel for this
guard box here that you created it would
know to just use the guard box or to use
the life guard box and it would know to
use the Alpha Channel to protect a life
guard box if you don't know what an
upload channel is I suggest you look it
up but it's basically a black and white
image where the white part is what is
masked out or what you want to keep and
the black area is pretty much what you
don't want to keep it's hard to explain
just without any like tools or anything
like that it's one of the harder things
to explain in graphic design or motion
graphics or any
like that so I suggest that you go in
and look that up just type in alpha
channel definition and Google and it'll
give you a probably look at Wikipedia
say that you can look it up thank God
for Wikipedia the next button we have is
protect skin tones so that's this little
person right here and if you have people
in your image it's gonna know to protect
those people because they have skin
tones on there so it's gonna preserve
those areas now these buttons over here
this button with this the like the no
sign here that's to cancel your whatever
you using and I did that a few times
within this tutorial and the check mark
here is to commit to the changes that
you did another button for the check
mark is just pressing enter so that's
how you use the content and we're
scaling it's an advanced scaling
technique that's really easy to use so
go ahead and just like use that to make
your images cool and keep the are keep
your important stuff intact without
having to crop your image or something
like that it's a little bit like
cropping but not so much say you had two
people standing on the opposite side of
each other in a photo one person is on
the far right one person is on the far
left and you want it to content or scale
it so those two were closer together but
you can but you don't want to crop out
the middle because then it's just gonna
look stupid so you just content or scale
them together and it looks like they're
closer in the image so um that's how you
do it so we'll see you guys in the in
the next tutorial where I'm not sure
what we're gonna be going over so I'm
not gonna say so but I appreciate you
guys watching and watching through the
tutorial series have a good one
