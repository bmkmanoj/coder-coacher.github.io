introduction of XHTML for those people
who don't know what XHTML is it's the
language that they use to create
websites with in other words if you know
what XHTML is and you know how to use it
then you're gonna be able to make
websites and for those of you who have
learned HTML or are wondering what it is
and if it's the same thing it kind of
isn't it kind of isn't hTML is the old
language that they used to make web
pages with but now they made XHTML it's
a lot better and a lot newer and
actually in a little bit
HTML isn't even going to be around
anymore so this is the new language that
they use and for those of you still
don't really understand what it is I try
to explain a little better in order to
make a website you don't just make a
bunch of pictures and words and put it
down like a text document you actually
have to make a code that the browser can
interpret see the browser doesn't see a
webpage like mean you see it what it
sees is this a bunch of code like this
that interpreted in all the pictures and
all the text on it is interpreted
and that is what it sees so if you go to
view source on any webpage then order to
show you the code that we actually are
going to be making and these tutorials
are actually going to teach you how to
create this code and what it all means
and all that so if you want to know how
to make sweet websites and you're in the
right place so let's get started
the first thing you're gonna need is
something called a text editor and
chances are you already have one on your
computer if you have a PC you can go to
start programs accessories and you have
notepad this is one that you can use
it's a pretty basic one but I would
highly recommend using a program called
notepad bus and this is what it looks
like and if you want to know how to get
it then all you have to do is type in
WWI note
calm and when it's a search type in
notepad and this is all free and it
should be the first one on the list
right there and go pad 475 and you just
downloaded it and follow download it
then follow the instructions and once
you have it downloaded you should have
this and it should be you're ready to go
and like I said it's all free but the
only thing you need to do is download it
so once you've got that downloaded
you're ready to go in word you start
making websites so in the next video
you're gonna be creating your first
website I just wanted to give you
introduction of how browsers see the
website first and um if you're not
already there and got a WWN you Boston
com it's my website and it's where I'm
gonna be posting all these videos and
I'm gonna be giving you a step-by-step
instruction on each one my videos and
it'll help you follow better along with
if you like thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
