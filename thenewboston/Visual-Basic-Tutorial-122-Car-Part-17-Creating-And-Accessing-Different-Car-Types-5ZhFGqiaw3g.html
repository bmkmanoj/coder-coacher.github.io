youtube.com slash the online gamer for
the new Boston and this tutorial we're
gonna be working more on the car
application now if you don't know what
this is you may want to move back to the
beginning of this series now I may not
be at the right spot that the wit that
we were in the last tutorial because
I've had a record this several times and
each time I just keep messing up and
I've had to do it a whole bunch and I
keep having to undo the code and
hopefully I'm back where I was
so this if statement right here that we
added it is not necessary we can just go
ahead and set the vehicle type to the
selected item of add new car hold on we
only want this is if statement gone okay
so now we can do is let's go ahead and
create the new car one up here so dim
new car one so now that we've created a
new car one we haven't set it equal to
anything what we want to do is create a
create another if statement so if they
want to create a new car will do if
combo car types
dot selected index is equal to zero then
new car one is going to be equal to a
new all cars car so it's just going to
create a car object and so else if so
else if combo car types
dot selected index equals one
then we'll go ahead and create a truck
object so new car 1 equals new all cars
dot truck car and then else if one more
time for the sports car so elsif combo
card types dot selected index equals 2
then we'll go ahead and type new car 1
equals new all cars dot sports car so
now we can do is we can just take this
out right here and let's see so using
new car 1 what we're gonna do is set the
values and after it's done using it's
going to in that the it's going to get
rid of new car 1 so if we come over here
to new car VB I added this vehicle type
right here and whenever it loads it's
going to set the name of the vehicle
type color of vehicle type which is the
selected item in the combo box so that
the it just works with that car that I
selected
now I can't remember if I've said that
in the last tutorial but I thought that
I'd point that out anyways and we've got
this combo box right here that lets them
select the car in the collections
it has car chocolate sports car so index
0 index 1 and index 2 so let's go ahead
and run this and hopefully it'll work so
we'll select a truck looks like a new
car and it's not showing up so let's see
what the problem is ah here we go we got
name of truck so we'll just set it to
Toyota Tundra we'll make it white well I
would give it two doors set the
horsepower to 300 go ahead and click Add
and you can see here we have our Toyota
Toyota Tundra now it did open a
new instance of new car that we did not
warrant so let's go ahead we're here to
take this out right here that's why it
was showing up so now we only have one
show dialogue and it's gonna show what
we wanted it to so let's come over here
and just change things a little bit so
let's set the selected item of this by
index 0 at default so we'll go through
the properties
and what we need to do is come over here
to form one and whenever the form loads
let's just go ahead and set the selected
item in that so Karmakar types dot
selected index is going to be equal to
zero at the beginning so if they create
car it's gonna go ahead and
automatically create a car for them now
if we didn't set this in next we'd have
to have an error handle a handler that
said that would stop them if they didn't
create a they didn't select which kind
of car they wanted to create so now we
can use the get power-to-weight ratio so
we can convert the car at list car
selected index so this can be a sports
car or a truck and we're gonna get the
power-to-weight ratio so let's go ahead
and run this and we'll create a new
sports car so we've got the name of
sports car let's just do Corvette color
is red we'll give it two doors set the
horsepower to 200 now you can have it
automatically set the number of doors
based on what kind of car they type so
that when they open up the swarm it's
already at 2 for them I'm gonna leave
that to you guys to figure out so if you
go ahead and click Add we've got
Corvette we can get the power-to-weight
ratio and it says infinity and that is
because we didn't set the weight of the
car so let's just go ahead and add a
default right here so we'll set the
value of the weight to a to 1,000 so dot
so come up here to truck car and new car
1 dot weight
or let's see
so it looks like we're gonna have to be
using a lot of logic to set in the
weight of the car and add a lot more
code so let's just go ahead and do that
in the constructor of all cars so go to
sports car sub new and we will set the
weight equal to 1000 pounds to start off
with because if not we would have to
completely recode this right here and
you guys can do that if you want to see
what you can do with it but for the sake
of this tutorial we're just gonna leave
it the way it is so go ahead and run
this will create a new sports car what's
the name of it - Corvette we'll give it
I will say that it's green give it two
doors and set the horsepower to 300
click Add we can get the power-to-weight
ratio and so we didn't select an index
there so let's try this one more time I
will select sports car new car just add
some stuff in here I will make it 300
horsepower click Add now I have to
actually select that then when you get
to power-to-weight ratio we get it 0.3
which can only be done with sports cars
and not with cars or trucks now if we
create trucks so we can access stuff
that only trucks can have and so on and
so forth so thanks for watching and stay
tuned for the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
