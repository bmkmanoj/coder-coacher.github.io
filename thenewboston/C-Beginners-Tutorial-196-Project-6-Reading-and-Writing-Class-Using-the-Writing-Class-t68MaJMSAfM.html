authorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial we're going
to use our reader and writer class and
make sure that they work so the first
thing that you're going to want to do is
make sure that you have a button on your
form and then once it's there just go
ahead and double click on it alright and
then we're going to want to create a
using statement or the namespace that
our reader and writer class are in and
they're in the Adam's IO namespace you
probably need your something different
so we're just going to say using and
that namespace alright and now we're
just going to create an open file dialog
so that we can browse for the file that
we want to write in so I'm going to say
open file dialog the file dialog and I'm
just going to check to see if these are
actually did select a file in there Open
File dialog and if they do then we're
going to open a new writer and you're
going to write inside of that file so
let's say a writer W or writer who
prints a new writer and then inside of
the writers constructor we have two
options we can either pass through just
the path to the file and then the endian
type will default EB big-endian or we
can pass through the path and the by
order so if we wanted to make the buy
order big-endian little-endian we could
explicitly tell it to well I'm just
going to make it be big endian so I'm
not going to tell it to be big endian
says they'll deepali be big endian
anyways all right so we're just gonna
have create a new writer off the file
that user opens we're going to say oh
FBI file name and then we're just gonna
want to write on the string right at the
beginning of the file so we're just
going to write Adam right across there
alright so we're just gonna save w dot
write unicode string and then we're just
gonna run all right Adam
and since we're writing Adam getting in
a file I'm at the offset zero zero that
just means that we don't have to specify
a position since the default position is
zero anyways and then after it writes
this we're just going to go ahead and
close the writer so that if someone
wanted to they could access this file
after it's done writing alright so let's
go out
debug here click this button or as for
that untitled file on my desktop click
open and I should have written atom
right across the file
yep arrow atom and unicode string as you
can see each character takes up two
bytes and it's big endian unicode
because we can see right here
um just a is with me 41 and it goes 0 0
and then 41 so it's big endian unicode
alright but what if we wanted to write
little endian unicode we could use the
change byte order method to change the
bike order to little endian so it'll
write little endian now so we're going
to set the buy order to little endian
and that we're going to want to change
the position to want to change the
position to 0 x 1 0 so they'll begin
writing right here instead so we're just
going to say w dot position control is 0
X 1 0 &amp;amp; 0 X 1 0 is just right here as
you can see offset 1 0 alright so let's
just go ahead and make sure that this
works as well let's choose our untitled
file go back to HX d and we see yep a
row atom in little-endian unicode all
right now let's just test one more thing
and make sure that the writes introduced
correctly and we're actually going to
have it write it in big endian so i'm
gonna eat this and we're gonna have it
right at the position to 0 so we're
going to change the position 2 to 0
right here we're just going to say w dot
right and then we're just gonna want to
write in 32 and we're just gonna have it
right 0 x e FD and then FC and that's
actually that you int so you go into
there okay now should work properly all
right so just make sure that this works
here open our untitled file
open the back HX d and yep as you see
here o FF e FD and FC and you can tell
it's a big-endian because it wrote it in
the same order as we told it to write it
alright so
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
as you can see both our reader and
writer class work perfectly so see you
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
