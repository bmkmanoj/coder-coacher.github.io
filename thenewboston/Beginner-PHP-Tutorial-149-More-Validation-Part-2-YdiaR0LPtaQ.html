oh no I've done that again when we take
that array from there so it can be a bit
fiddly when you're writing all on one
line but you'll get used to it
eventually so I've just missed that all
right now okay so let's go back and
refresh ok so we've solved the two
visible problems that we have now let me
just go ahead and register another user
so say Craig password pass one two three
I've got my database up here so I can I
can click on my users and check how
we're doing here
so password pass one two three pass
password oh no sorry pass one two three
first name Craig now let's let's have a
look in our database at the length of
the surname so let's click on structure
and see how many characters we have so
we're storing this as a variable
character data type with 40 characters
maximum 40 characters so what happens if
we would just say let's just say m 1 2 3
4 5 6 we'll do it another way
we'll say ABCD efg that's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
EF sorry ABCD efg hijk 6 7 8 9 10 11 so
we can get rid of okay so we've got 10
characters here and then the reason I'm
doing it in as the alphabet is just so
you can keep an eye on what's happening
so let me copy and paste that 4 times or
3 more times so we've got three
instances now of this now what happens
or four instances of this we've got ABC
up to j and ABC up to j and ABC up to j
and then ABC up station we've got for
lots of this this is 40 characters long
so when we click register they see
is going to be able to this is going to
fit inside our surname field in our
database however what happens if we
let's say go back to our form and we
copy and paste it in one more time now
that's going to equal I've copied and
pasted it in another time so we've got
ABC up to J - J - J - J up to J so we've
got five instances of this same text so
we've got 50 characters overall now
let's click register you've registered
so everything's appears to have worked
correctly now let's go and browse our
table and we'll come down we can see
that out our use names being popped in
now we need to I'm going to click on
this so little edit button and I'm going
to have a look at what's been stored
here so we've got ABC up to J ABC up to
J ABC up to J and ABC up to J now we've
only stored 40 of the 50 characters we
entered and the reason for this is our
varchar' only allows for 40 characters
as we've already looked at under the
structure tab so what we need to do is
when we're registering the user we need
to look at checking up here we need to
check how many characters each of these
are not including the password because
that's hash to a 32 character hash
anyway using the md5 functions we don't
need to worry about the password it's
just the username first name is surname
that we need to check and we do have one
other issue with the database which is
usernames if I was to now register a
username
let's say with the username Craig but
with a small C this is going to be
allowed by this is going to be allowed
by our by our code the reason being is
we're not we're not talking about I
don't yeah we're not we're not we're not
look at what we're looking at case
sensitive comparison so if I was to
register a user on here called Craig
let's go back to the register page with
a small say
and Craig a more just pet I don't know
Garrett okay Malcolm okay so now let's
click register Oh No using Craig already
exists maybe okay yeah maybe maybe I'm
wrong in that sense then so we've got
yeah okay so we don't need to worry
about that so let's just focus on this
maximum character amount we have so what
we first are all going to do is edit our
HTML form to only allow a maximum value
to be submitted on the form and this
isn't an entirely protect against
inputting masses of data because we're
only allowing in that within the HTML
obviously someone could take your HTML
page they could change this to your
server so your your your domain and then
the URL that registers locator and they
could submit the data from you know a
local PC their own PC so what we need to
do is we need to change the these fields
to have a max value first then we need
to check the length in PHP as well so
let's give it a property max length and
for username let's just refer back to
our database so we know exactly what we
what the lengths we're dealing with so
we've got 30 for the username 32 for the
password like I said we don't need to
worry about like the hashes more or less
always going to be 32 characters and
then 40 and 40 for the first image sir</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
