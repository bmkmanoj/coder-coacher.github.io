tutorial and operating systems using the
command line and in this tutorial we're
just going to be not really going over
any technical stuff but learning how to
change the properties and how to make
our command line more useful in a little
more pretty so what people don't realize
is when they open the command line they
just see this little black screen with
gray text and they don't know that they
can change it really or they don't know
any options since there's not really a
menu or task bar at the top but if you
want to get to the properties what you
have to do is go up to this title bar
right click it and go down to properties
or you can just click this little c /
box right there and go down in
properties they'll take it to the same
place so go ahead and click that and now
you can see we have a whole array of
options open up to us many of them are
pretty simple but some of them are kind
of confusing for example the cursor size
small medium large of just you know what
the cursor is I hope and the large is
really easy to see but I prefer small
sense it's uh oh I'm just used to it I
guess display options of course the
window gives you a little window like
this right here or the full screen takes
up your whole computer screen I suggest
working with a window because then when
you're looking at your folders in the
well just just work window for now
you'll see why later now for the
confusing stuff the command history what
this is is it stores every command that
you want to work with now you might say
alright just jack it up all the way well
here's a problem with it every command
requires memory so once you increase
this number it will also increase the
amount of memory so i suggest to leave
it right at 50 now this number of
buffers what this means is the number of
individual histories or each process you
want to do so for it in the same rule
applies for this so for is also good for
right here here and make sure you don't
have this checked if it's checked now
the quick edit mode and the insert mode
for this you want to work with the
insert mode what this does is well the
quick edit mode allows you to use the
mouse when working with entries directly
but um you want to work with the insert
mode sense when you work with entries
directly it messes up and some of the
options we're going to be working with
so pretty much leave everything on this
screen default unless you want to change
the cursor size or you want to work with
full screen now the font this is pretty
option the window preview is just the
window this this is pretty much all
obvious on this screen the font will
find you want to work with I like
working with the default because it's
easier to see
um you can pretty much figure all this
stuff out it's pretty straightforward
the layout is a that's where we get in
kind of a shady area the screen buffer
size is the P is a part of the screen
that stores the information this black
part right here now the window size is
actually the window itself so what if
you I know you're thinking what if you
have this buffer sizes store the
information bigger than the window size
itself well if you do that then it makes
these little scroll bars at the bottom
and sides of it like there is right now
it'll make it to the side of it so you
can see their information and that's a
kind of annoying to me so I kind of like
to leave this at the fault in this
window position just whenever you open
your control panel I mean a command
prompt it it puts the window where you
want on screen it's a totally useless
because you can just move it with this
thing but if you want to change it go
ahead now the colors right here are
pretty much straightforward as well the
screen text it's a gray default I always
like to set that to white since it gives
a little more contrast in the screen
background is this black part right here
I'm going to go ahead and set that dark
blue since uh just blew nguoi are my
favorite colors it has no effect at all
on the coating of your what we're going
to be working with so just go ahead and
work with this so pretty much the only
thing that isn't straightforward are
these options and you could leave those
at the far in default anyways but just
in case you want to change them things
around I just wanted to show you where
the command prompt properties things was
so once you got everything situated
click OK and it says apply properties
okay
and now you can see all your changes
appear so once you have this ready and
you have it all pretty and it's ready to
go you can move on to my next tutorial
and we were actually be getting started
working with files thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
