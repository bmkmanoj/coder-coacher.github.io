shooing his bullets out let's go ahead
and make those balls fall from the sky
so we're actually gonna make two new
methods the first one is just gonna say
uh let's just say to create a new ball
so we're gonna create a method called
crate ball node and what this is gonna
do is essentially just create a ball
from it's gonna create it on the top of
the screen and then the cool thing about
this is since we have gravity already in
our environment we don't have to add any
vectors because remember before whenever
you're shooting at the arrow we need it
to add that initial force but now if we
just create a spray on the top of the
screen it's gonna fall down by default
which is really stinkin sweet so let's
go ahead and do that let me give myself
more space so you guys can see it easier
all right so first thing we need to do
is we need to get a reference to this
image right here that's the ball so I'll
say let's just call it ball Y naught
equals s K spring node and the parameter
is image named and it was named star
ball dot ping star ball all right so now
that we said okay we're using this image
it's gonna say okay well where do you
want to put it now we want to the ball
to pretty much appear in a different
place every time we just don't want to
fall in from the same point so we're
always gonna make up here at the top of
the screen but the X is gonna be random
the left and right so it's gonna fall
onto maybe from the left maybe in the
middle maybe from the right who knows
it's gonna be random so if you put ball
dot position what we can do is we need
to set the position equal to a point so
CG point make now again the X is gonna
be random and I really don't like how
Swift ran numbers are generated it's
kind of confusing so what we have to do
is we actually have to create a new
method and that's gonna be the second
method in this tutorial and it's just
gonna give us a random number from zero
to the width of the screen so maybe if
the width is like 720 pixels it'll give
you a random number 0 to 720 and then
the bub will appear in a different
position every time now for the
y-direction up and down we always want
to make them on the top of the screen
since that's where they're gonna start
to fall down so we can just use self dot
size dot height now again for the random
number method I'm gonna create
we're just gonna pass in self dot size
that width and this is gonna get the
width of the screen and then we can use
that actually might as well just create
the method right now to uh generate
random numbers so random number between
0 and width so what was it called random
number and I'll call it the perimeter
maximum sense we are already know that 0
is the minimum the very left and the
maximum of course would be the entire
right which would resemble at the right
hand side of the screen so somewhere in
the middle of the screen and it's
actually a float that we pass in and we
need to return a float too to make a
point on the screen so CG floats all
right now the formula that or not the
formula the function that we use that's
built in to generate random numbers it
actually takes a you int pretty much an
integer so we need to convert this float
value that we passed in two integer
first so I'll say let max int just set
equal to you int and it's actually 32
and of course that's maximum and for the
ending result that we want back or just
call it result we're gonna call the
formula arc for random uniform this one
right here you int 32 so it looks like a
really stupid and confusing name method
but all its gonna do is it's gonna
generate a random number for you and
again iOS Swift it takes care of it
behind the scenes you just pass it in a
maximum value and it generates zero to
that value so again it's going to
generate zero to like 720 or 1080
whatever the size of the device is and
all I have to do now is return that
value so CG float since the result is
actually whatever this return and result
so again this is a really weird way of
generating a random number from 0 to
some maximum value but again that's a
swift iOS got to blame them and not me
so now we generated a point that has a
random x value that's always going to
appear at the top of the screen now
we're just going to continue on setting
some other parameters for that ball note
sprite so the first thing I want to do
is I just want to give it a name gonna
name it ball note and for the physics
body we just got to set up some
collision detection stuff right here so
this equal to s K physics body now again
remember this is pretty much the frame
around your object and this is used of
course with the collision detection and
all that good stuff so for the parameter
I'm gonna type circle of radius and what
is the radius since we're using a
circular object well the radius of
course is just half the width so ball
the size of the ball over 2
all right now the last thing we have to
do of course ball dot physics body use
this precise collision detection and set
this equal to true and that just make
sure that we enable collision detection
and now we just add it to the screen so
self dot add child ball so again all
this is going to do it's just going to
create a ball node in a random X
position so it's always gonna appear at
the top of the screen so we're gonna
call this every I don't know like maybe
two seconds and if that's too easy then
we'll call it like every one second the
faster we call it the harder the game's
gonna be but uh yeah that is that method
and now what we need to do is we need to
set up the animation for this and it's
real quick but I'm gonna show you guys
that in the next video since this one is
getting kind of long so see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
