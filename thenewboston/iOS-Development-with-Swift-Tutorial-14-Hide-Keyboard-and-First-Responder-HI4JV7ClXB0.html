designed looking pretty good so check
this out
now of course whenever the user looks at
this screen and they're ready to login
to our app what they're going to do is
they're going to click this little email
input and that software keyboard is
going to pop up now sometimes in your
simulator pops up sometimes it doesn't
the reason that it doesn't always pop up
is because this simulator is actually
hooked up to the keyboard on your
desktop or just on your main Mac so it
says ok you probably don't want that
little software keyboard to pop up but
for this example we actually do so if
it's not popping up make sure you have
your simulator selected and go to
hardware keyboard toggle software
keyboard so again this obviously happens
all the time on actual devices so you
don't really have to worry about doing
anything in your code to it but just for
a little simulator issue that's what
happens so they're going to start typing
in their email whatever it is at
whatever comm and they're going to say
ok my password by the way I'm going to
show you guys how to you would never
want to use default plain text for a
password you're always going to want to
use a secure password so it has those
little circles or atracsys buffer right
now you know this is just a demo so they
type in their password and then they hit
login oh wait a minute this keyboard
isn't going I so login well maybe I just
have to tap the background nope that's
not how the heck do make this keyboard
go away so that is one problem that we
have and that's why we need to use
something called a first responder now a
first responder is essentially a way of
Apple saying ok whatever element
whatever item the user is currently
interacting with this item must be
important now your iPhone already has
default behavior built in to handle some
of these items so let me go ahead and
run this simulator again so of course
one of the default behaviors whenever
user clicks in one of these text fields
is the pulp this keyboard and it makes
sense it's actually really smart and
handy because you don't want the user to
click this and then
you know the keyboard doesn't pop up so
it's really smart that they said okay
this element right here this input field
is now the first responder but the bad
thing about this is because is pretty
much whenever we click away it doesn't
know when to give up that first
responder status it doesn't know when to
say okay this element is no longer
important so you can hide that keyboard
now we have to do that manually so I'm
going to show you guys how to do that in
this tutorial so let me just go ahead
and hide this panel right there and I'm
going to put my split screen view on so
we can see the brains and if you click
the Venn diagram then it will show the
assistant editor and let's go ahead and
get rid of all of this so get rid of
this get rid of these default override
methods we don't really need them so
what I want to do is I want to first
just get a reference or an outlet to
both of these elements right here so of
course anytime we want to do that select
this text field hold down control and
drag and I will name this one I'll just
name it email and of course it's an
outlet hit connect so we now have a
reference to this now just do it with
here hold down control drag and right
underneath this one I'm going to name
this outlet how much will stick with
password and hit connect so now we have
a reference to both of these things and
eventually what we're going to be doing
is we're going to say okay they're not
important anymore
so first when do we want to say that
well whenever the user clicks the login
button then what we're going to do is
we're going to call a method saying okay
they obviously click this login button
so they're obviously not interacting
with these so you can drop that first
responder Bs all right so anytime we
want to call a method whenever they
perform an action what we need to do is
we need to control drag and remember
that is called an action whenever the
user does something and what do we want
the method to
we're just leaving like button pressed
now of course this is a button and
everything else is good so this is the
method that's going to be called
whenever they cook the login button so
that is one instance where we want to
hide that keyboard so again what do we
do to hide the keyboard well all we have
to do is we need to say ok this is not
the first responder and this is not the
first responder pretty much give up that
priority so we need to access both of
these fields and drop the first
responder status so self dot email dot
resign first responder so this is going
to do is it's going to go to this object
which is that email field and resign
first responder pretty much say hey
operating system I'm not important
anymore don't worry about that keyboard
and we can do the same thing for the
password field resign first responder so
again whenever we click that button now
give me a little warning it scared me
for a second so let's go ahead and build
this and see if it works all right so
they want to login to their email and
they also want to log in there's their
password pretty cool they click login
and check it out it says ok neither of
those are important anymore
so you can hide the keyboard pretty
sweet and of course if you click back on
them then boom you're you're good to go
again it pops up the keyboard
automatically but you know the user is
like you know what I don't remember my
email address so what I'm going to do is
I don't want to click login how do they
typically hide the keyboard while they
just click somewhere in the background
all right so I don't click login but
whenever I'm clicking the background
this keyboards not hiding so how do I
take care of that well in order to add
that functionality what we can do is
this all right so there's a built-in
method
called touches began and what happens is
it gets called any time the user touches
their finger down on the main view just
on the screen so by default it's not in
our class because it's a method that we
have access to but it isn't overridden
because you hardly ever use it however
in this instance it works great so if
you go and call touches begin and then
just hit Enter or return
what it does is it says ok this is the
method that you're overriding and I'll
just write built-in method and what do
you want to happen whenever the user
touches the screen well all we want to
do is we first want to access the main
view so self that view in that view
refers to the main overall view the main
container in other words your entire
screen now if we just write end editing
this takes a parameter and just write it
was type of turtle right there now all
this is saying is we want to end the
editing of all items so all items that
are in here including both of these stop
editing them now of course whenever we
stop editing them it means that of
course we're not using them and they
give up first responder status so again
if we run this in now if we tap the
background ok now that's not working
again because hardware title software
keyboard that's kind of annoying I
really hope they do something with that
type your email type your password and
now you can click a login and it will
hide and of course if you just tap the
background anywhere like here it'll hide
it as well so now our app is performing
like the user expects and it saves them
some headache and well there you go that
is what the first responder is and those
are two methods to give up first
responder status to hide your keyboard
so I think guys for watching and I don't
even know what we're going to be talking
about in the next tutorial but is going
to be sweet so I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
