Android tutorial for the new boss in
again it's me Travis we're going to do
in this tutorial or we're going to start
building and in the next few tutorials
is basically an application that we can
use the cameras phone or the phone's
camera and then you know set that
picture that we we capture up to the
phone's background or wallpaper of the
actual phone so you know it's going to
be a pretty cool little application for
the most part but as always we're gonna
have to set up the XML layout and we're
going to introduce a few new items
within the XML layout so we're gonna say
other Android XML file and we're going
to call this photo all lowercase again
every time you guys make an XML or
anything under a resource folder in
lower case hopefully you guys know that
by now
and so that's crazy XML I know for some
reason why I use the screen capture my
computer super slow but we're going to
add in this tutorial is basically we're
going to add two buttons and first an
image view for the most part so that's
going to kind of give us where we're
going to get our image back from and it
gives you a couple default items that
you can set it up to start with see I
usually don't use the drag and drop so I
was kind of wondering what this is but
we're going to start with the icon the
default image that they give us just you
know for for simplicity sake and then
we're going to go in and add two buttons
one to access the phone and actually I'm
trying to think what we can do that's
different
you can add an image button as well
we're going to throw one of those in
there and okay so as you can see the
image button kind of adds an image
within there if you want and then when
you click that we're going to take a
picture and then when we click this
button it's going to set the picture to
the to the paper or to the wallpaper for
the most part so I mean nothing to new
but a little bit so let's change the
width and the height of our image view
to like something like 250 DP for both
the width and the height change your
image button let's say the width to like
125 DP wrap content and then our button
will say 125 as well now let's just
change your references real quick image
view so I V for image view and we're
going to call this returned picture
because once sorry our camera takes
picture it's going to return that
picture and set it as that image U and
then let's go to our image button IB for
image button and we're going to say take
picture take pic something like that and
lastly just a regular button let's say
set wallpaper
and change the button text for the most
part to set wallpaper as well so nothing
too new in this tutorial as you can see
the image view is new I guess we could
probably almost set the height so I'm
gonna change that real quick you guys
probably notice that as I was doing it
and you're like oh you're an idiot
Travis I'm like yeah I am just kidding
but there we go hopefully that looks a
little bit better maybe we want to
Center this so we're just going to say
Android layout gravity equals centered
just copy that that code and paste it
for all these other ones as well so not
too not too pretty there for that but
you know basically that should work for
the most part yeah that should work so
that that's basically the setup for the
XML and then we're going to get into our
our programming in the next few
tutorials and finish this up but again
thanks for watching guys and hope you
have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
