tutorial than I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm gonna be
showing you how to you could go to
keyword and how to use regions so for
this tutorial all are going to need is a
button and a source statement so back
when we learn without switch statement I
told you that you wouldn't always see
great to you another option is to put a
pro to be over here and the go-to will
basically allow you to jump to a
labelled line of code and labeled code
is can be a case thing and then I'll
show you another example or later on so
if you just put go-to in that case Adam
right here it will just basically go to
this case and execute whatever code
within here so it'll just basically jump
to that code right there so first it
will be this message box so now I need
to bug we should get a message box
saying the default and then we should
get a message box saying hello default
on the hello
perfect now we don't always have to jump
to something labeled with case we could
just label code ourselves so we could
just say my code and then just put a
colon after it and then we can basically
put any code in here you want so I'm
just gonna have a message box show hello
and then we can just go to keyword to go
to this code right here so we can just
say go to and now it was basically jump
to this program here and if you were to
use this inside of a for statement so
it's not like or all the steps where we
show you that basically stop so if you
ever have used a go to keyword inside of
code it'll just jump to that code and it
won't ever come back to the code
just a goat-cheese mic over here and
we'll only get one message box because
it will jump to this code right here and
then it will stop will never go back to
this for you well yeah well I got one
message box because like I said to
jumpstart this code right here never
goes back alright so now that you know
how to use it go to your keyword I'm
going to show you how to use regions and
what region you allow you to do is
basically hide code it basically just
creates another one of these misty
levels on here so it basically just
creates another one of these like -
things over here so click this like -
thing it will basically who's tied this
code blocker here yeah and we can
basically meet the end region if we had
like a whole bunch of variables that we
didn't want to look at every time that
we were looking at our code so in order
to create a region here is going from
the pound key and then type and then
following the region keyword you can
always give a name to your region so I'm
gonna multiply region or you can be
followed leave it with no name and then
to end your region you don't want the
pound key and tight and region and
obviously this little highlight over
code inside but we're just a bunch of
code in here basically hiding this
little subtract part yep so now we don't
see it anymore it just makes it a lot
cleaner if you have like a whole bunch
of methods that you don't want to look
at and you already know what they do and
you know that they're correct and this
is the region to hide them alright so
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
on the go to keyword and using regions
so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
