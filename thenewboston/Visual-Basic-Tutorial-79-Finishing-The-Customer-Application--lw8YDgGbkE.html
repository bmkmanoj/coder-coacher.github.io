youtube.com/scishow and live gamer for
the New Boston in this tutorial we're
going to be finishing our customer
application and then after this tutorial
we're going to be simplifying things a
little bit and just be looking at arrays
them ArrayList themselves and some other
stuffs that you can do with ArrayList so
if you remember from the last tutorial
we made this right here and we override
it the two string function so that when
we click list customer it gives us the
information that we want now if you
don't know what I'm talking about go
ahead and move back to one of the
earlier tutorials and you should see how
we did this now what we're going to do
in this program is whenever the user
selects one of these it's going to
automatically fill in these fields right
here
with the selected information so what
we'll do is we'll come back here in our
code and if you remember we created this
display customer sub right here and what
it does is we pass a customer object to
it which is a structure and then we set
the text of text name to the customer
type that they passed and then the name
property then we need the first name and
the last name and the email all of this
same customer structure and we set them
to text first name text last and or text
email and text name which are these text
boxes right here so now what we're going
to do we're going to come over here and
we're going to select our list customers
list box and we're going to be working
with some of the events so if you click
the lightning bolt it will open up the
events for you and you can see that
we've got a whole bunch right here and
what we want to do is we want to select
selected index change so I'll just
double click on that and it will create
this sub for us so now inside this sub
we are just going to reuse code that
we've already created displaycustomer
and this is why subs and functions are
so useful because you can reuse the code
in different ways that you may not think
of it first
and it makes programming a lot faster
and a lot easier so
going to do is going to call display
customer and we're just going to pass
the customer that the user has selected
now to do this we're going to have to
create a property so we'll come up here
and let's just get some of this code out
of the way so it doesn't confuse you and
let's just do it right above list
customers so what we're going to do is
we're type private and we're going to
make this property read-only because
you're not going to have to do any
changing of values so we'll type
read-only property and we're just going
to call this selected customer and the
type is going to be the customer type so
it is a we use the customer type and
it's a read-only property so now what
we're going to do is we are going to get
the current index that is selected and
we're going to try and convert that to a
customer object now it will work every
time because it's not possible for them
to add any other items to the list that
aren't customers so what we're going to
do is we're going to type return and
what we're going to do is we're going to
take the selected customer that they
have in the list box and we're going to
convert that to a type customer so what
we're going to do is want to use ctype
which we have learned in an earlier
tutorials so now we're going to do is
we're going to type object customers ok
sorry about that we're going to use my
customers instead of object customers
now my customers is our ArrayList that
we have here so what we're going to do
is going to access an index of that
array list now since everything added to
our list is by index let's see let's
just comment this thing out real quick
okay so since everything that we added
yeah
let's comment that out too okay
everything that we added is by index so
this right here's of index zero this
right here's of index one and this right
here some index two and this is of the
ArrayList so index zero one and two and
it is the same in the list box we got
lucky with this so the list box this is
index 0 this is index 1 and this is
index 2 so they're going to be the same
so we can get the index of the selected
item in our list box and we can use that
index in the index of our ArrayList now
this might be a little confusing but I
will go ahead and type this out so
you'll see what I mean
so we're going to use control Z and will
uncomment it so we're going to use the
index that is selected in our list box
so we'll just type list customers dot
selected index so what it's going to do
is if they select index 0 which is Sam
it's going to get the item in the
ArrayList my customers at the index of 0
which is going to be Sam and so we're
going to get that and we are going to
try and convert that to the type
customer so olders type customer and
that is our second argument because
we're trying to convert it to a customer
but what if they haven't selected a or
what if they selected index net negative
1 or no index at all because it starts
at 0 and if the index is negative 1 that
means nothing is started so we can just
prevent an error from happening by
typing if list customers dot selected
index does not equal negative 1 so if it
doesn't equal negative 1 then it's going
to go ahead and return this right here
and we will go ahead and end if okay so
now we're going to do is we're going to
come down here and we're going to
uncomment this code so we're going to go
ahead and type display customer
and then selected customer so what this
is going to do is get the current
selected customer so it's going to
select customer is going to be equal to
the customer at the index of whatever
you've selected so and then display
customer will add the name the first
name last name and email to these text
boxes so let's go ahead and run this and
see what happens go ahead and click list
customers and if we select one of these
here you can see that it adds them to
these text boxes right here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
