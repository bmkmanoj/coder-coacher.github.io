and CSS last time we talked about
relationship among tags and this time
we're going to be talking about more
about descendant selectors now last time
we had a relationship with just two
elements but there is no limit to how
many elements you can have in a chain of
relationships for example we had
something like this two elements and we
just had a simple declaration now what
this would do is apply the color red to
all that heading ones if they were
inside the div tags but you could also
do something like this what this would
do is apply the color red to all the
heading ones only if they were in
paragraphs only if they were in tables
and only if all that was embedded in the
div tag now your chain can go on for
however long you want as long is the
soonest was an ancestor of the earliest
one you should be all right now another
neat thing you can do is include the
universal selector when using these
basic descendant selectors and remember
the universal selector is any asterisks
or a symbol above the eight and what
this would do right here is apply all
the elements under the div tag the color
red and this is one way you can combine
the universal selector with other
selectors to format elements on your web
page and the last thing I'm going to be
talking you guys about in terms of
selectors is something
some way where you can combine different
selectors for instance this would change
the paragraph to the color read the text
and you can also combine this with a
descendant selector such as this as you
can see this would change the heading 1
as long as it is included in the div tag
to the color red and it also change all
paragraphs no matter where they were to
the color red so as you can see there's
a lot of different ways to use these
descendant selectors in conjunction with
other selectors and next time we're
going to be talking about how descendant
selectors to apply in other ways but for
now that's all the time we have so if
you missed anything that I went over
today you can go to my website the New
Boston com now i'll talk about it give
you step-by-step instruction thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
