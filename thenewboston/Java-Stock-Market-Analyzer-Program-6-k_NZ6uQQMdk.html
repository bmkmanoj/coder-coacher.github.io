six tutorial and how to create a drop of
stock market analyzer program and in
this tutorial we're gonna be building a
new class which I already built and I'm
gonna be teaching you guys how to take
that old array that we created with all
that string information in it and
convert it into the kind of information
we want and this is either a float which
is pretty much a number with a decimal
point or a date since remember the first
item in each of those rows was a date
object so we need to separate that
object in extract it from all the other
numbers such as floats and stuff so as
you can see I already created a new
class called formulas because I'm pretty
much going to be put in a couple of
formulas in here and don't forget to
import java.util and simple date format
like this so now our pretty much program
has three classes this stock market
class which has our main method in it
this read files class which in essence
pretty much just reads whatever file we
tell it to in this formulas class which
we're going to be building today so
hopefully work your way up to here so
let's go ahead and get started the first
thing we need is of course an object
from this read files class so go ahead
and put read files and name it like R
something in it set equal to new read
files so now we can use all the methods
in read files through the object R now
what we need after this is we need to
some different arrays we need an array
to hold the data and we need the array
to hold the dates so let me go ahead and
I'll show you if I can remember right
put it C stocks Dow here we go since
this first item is a date so we're gonna
be storing all of these dates in the
first column in an array and we're going
to be storing all of this data
everything but these dates in another
array so this one was going to be one
dimensional one and this
is going to be two-dimensional since it
has more than one per row so let's go
ahead and create a float and this is
gonna be a multi-dimensional array and
name it da ta array and set it equal to
new float and for the row number set r
dot fine row number right there and for
the column number remember it's going to
be equal to seven
since there were eight originally but
we're taking one of the dates away
actually there are seven originally and
we're gonna be filling the day one with
a zero but don't worry about that for
now and we're also going to be creating
a date array so name this da-te array
and set what its own equal to new date
and of course the length of this is
equal to r dot find row number right
there so again we have this final row
number method that we built right here
and that is why we needed to build it
since whenever we created our array we
needed to figure out how long to make
our array so that's why we needed that
method so now that we created our object
so we could pretty much use these and a
data array and the date array let's go
ahead and make that date array right now
so in essence how I'm going to create
this day array from the old array that I
just showed you is I'm gonna pretty much
loop through that old array get the
first element out of each of those rows
and put it into my new array so go ahead
make a method called public void create
date array make sure you spell that
right pretty important and for your
arguments where you're going to pass in
here is the old array now put string and
make sure you don't hit caps lock string
you're going to pass in a
multi-dimensional array and you're going
to name it n so now anytime we put n it
knows we're talking about our array and
now we need a simple date format object
and I'm just going
d/f for date format so I remember and
this pretty much means how you want your
format how your dates are formatted so
I'm going to set it equal to new simple
date format and as your format right
here
you type a string variable of year your
year year
- month month and your months have to be
in capitalized letters and then your
days are in a lowercase so that's how
our date is formatted in our file so and
make sure you put uppercase ends because
the lower case M has to do with minutes
I believe so now that we got our date
format we can go begin making our loops
so for let's go ahead and loop through
the rows first it's x equals 0
then go ahead and put like X is less and
the length right there and just go ahead
and increment it by 1 each time using X
plus plus and now for our inner loop and
I got a what the heck do I got that oh
here we go make sure you don't do that
so now we are looping through our rows
now we got to loop through our columns
so for and we're just name this one in y
equals 0 Y is less than n of X dot
length and just increment that by Y each
time so now we're not only looping
through the rows each time over also
looping through each element in the row
and what we want to do as a function
here if y equals 0 and what this is
gonna mean all right if we have if we
get the first item in each row what do
we want to do so let's go ahead and put
if y equals 0 and why do we need this
check to make sure it's the zeroth
element aka the first element because we
don't want to convert anything else to a
date except that first element so let me
show you guys are real quick sucks
now we don't want to convert any of
these to a date right here we just want
to convert that first element right here
which is the zeroeth element
here here here so this is the zeroth
element in row zero this is zero in a
row one two three so that's why we have
to check and we only want to do this if
Y is equal to zero remember Y is the
column so what do we want to do if y is
equal to zero well let's go ahead and
first make our try catch catch all
exceptions exception e and and I spoke
exc PT island exception e and just put
it equal to something like system out
print line just print out e there we go
and now for our try statement let's go
ahead and put date the first thing we
have to do is have a new variable called
new date you can name it and we need to
parse the old day or pretty much change
it from a string to a date so what do
you do is set this equal to the date
departs it in DF date format parse in
your rate in the argument what do you
want to parse what we want to parse n
which is our multi-dimensional array of
X that's the row number of 0 because
it's a 0 element and you can put Y right
here but remember we're checking for Y
up here so it's only going to run if Y
is equal to 0 and now we need to take
the date array we just created date
right remember we created it right here
it's a single dimensional array of X and
we need to set this equal to new date
right there so it's pretty much is this
is going to run through your old
multi-dimensional array this is going to
check if it's the first element in the
array this is going to change it from a
string variable to a date and what this
is going to do is put that verb excuse
me put that value into a new array
called day array and this X will
increment each time so that is how that
happens so we're going to be pretty much
doing the same thing with the data array
but since it's a multi-dimensional rates
going to be a little different but for
now we have this set and all we have to
do create the date
ray is just run this method so that's
how you do that
so I'm thank you guys for watching and
next toriel I probably going to show you
guys how to create the data array so
again thank you don't forget subscribe
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
