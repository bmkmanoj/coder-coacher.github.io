so feel like you can add a little bit of
color to if you would like to so don't
go too crazy with the color though or
else it's going to start coloring your
object so you just want to stay like low
on the color now in the back here we
have what's called a backlight some
people call it a rim light and some
people call it hair light and sometimes
it's on the ground like pointing up but
most of the time it's on a light stand
above the subject and pointing down on
it what it's gonna do is pull the object
off from the background and after I get
done telling you about these lights I'm
going to show you what they look like
turned on and turned off on the main
object so here's my backlight it's
another spotlight and the position I'm
gonna go into the a new position in the
camera I'm gonna go to the left and I'll
show you that the position and heights
of these so we have these around like
the height this one should be up a
little probably a little higher there we
go so they're pretty much above the
subject or around the top or level with
the subject so we got the backlight back
here and that's above and pointing down
onto the subject from behind now here's
my settings here I even decrease this
even more the backlight does not need to
be really bright so it's just basically
there to give like a an edge around the
object it kind of like gives like a glow
around the object and it sets it off of
the background sometimes a lot of people
say you need to use like some diffusion
on it so that you would do that by
either changing the color of the light
so make it a little like grayer or if
you want or just set the intensity down
so that's how I achieve my diffusion was
just setting the intensity down
so that's the that's the light settings
for the backlight now let's go into our
active camera so we can see how the
lights affect the subject so you're
going to want to set up your key light
first so I'm gonna turn off these other
lights and I'm gonna turn off the key
light and we can see how they affect the
object so in in 3d when you don't have
any lights in After Effects it's just
gonna look like this and it's not gonna
look like much of anything as I have
discussed in previous tutorials we're
gonna turn on the key light now this is
your main light now it's coming from
over here on the left hand side and it's
pointing down pretty much on to the
object so you can see that the right
side of the object isn't totally lit up
we're gonna need that's why we need to
fill light so let's uh throw the fill
light in there wait for this to load up
and now we've got to fill like filling
in the different areas that we would
like so I've got the shadows filled in
and you can see like the bevel and
everything on there I made a hard bevel
on these so you could see what it looks
like and I got a sneeze I'm gonna pause
this for a second and that was a
relieving nice sneeze so we've got
everything filled in some of the edges
aren't but I like having sometimes the
edges of the white to be a little dark
it gives it a little more dimension now
if I wanted to I could pull it over
towards the right side a little more the
point of interest and fill in a little
more of the letters here so they're not
so dark on the edge no the last thing I
want to show you is the backlight and
how that affects the scene I'm going to
turn this on and pretty much the
backlight will just pop off pop
everything off the bit off the
background now I wish it wouldn't show
up there but
it's going to so it's it's a little in
the way but it pretty much is just gonna
pop it off the back now our background
here isn't in 3d so it's not gonna be
the most you're not gonna see a whole
lot of difference and you're not
supposed to see a whole lot of
difference
no I one of the things about visual
effects let me turn the backlight back
on is that if nobody notices that you
did something then you did it right and
that's true because you don't want
people to see things that pop out when
you're trying to make things look
realistic if you did it and things pop
out and they catch the eye then
obviously you didn't do it realistically
and I'm not talking about things that
look cool I'm talking about like
real-life lighting and colors and all
that stuff so when you're trying to make
something look realistic that's how it
is
so there's your three point lighting
system back out and this is what it's
going to look like now I could possibly
move this over here a little more to
catch the SPN a and you can see how
that'll work in a second there you go so
there we go now that's about what there
is that's a good idea on how to use the
three-point lighting system and a lot of
studios and a lot of people use the
three-point lighting system as their
basis for setting up a shot and making
it look real so thank you for watching
this part of the tutorial maybe throw in
another lighting system there's a four
point lighting system there's other kind
of lighting systems that you can use you
don't have to use spotlights
you could use the parallel lights if you
want you can use a point line in the
back if you would like as your backlight
now that they all do kind of like the
same thing just remember that the
parallel lights have the hard shadows so
I mean that's why I like to use the
spotlights more for these and when
you're using
spotlight emulates what's really used in
studio lighting more closely than what
than a parallel light so that's a that's
my tips for you thank you for watching
it and give it a thumbs up if you liked
thumbs down if you hated and subscribe
if you want some more After Effects
videos and you want to stay in the loop
everybody see you later and keep on
lighting see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
