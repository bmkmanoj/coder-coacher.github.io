story we're going to be learning about
the mathematical operators because if a
computer is really good at one thing
it's math it's pretty much the best
calculator in the world so well let's
just go ahead and get started now we
already saw in a couple examples before
I think I like added some things and
might have subtracted some stuff but let
me go ahead and just make a little
variable and my cursors messing up at
the beginning of every tutorial like
usual and I'll just name it wait and
I'll put my weight in there set it equal
to of course my weight which is five
hundred and ninety five pounds now let's
just go ahead and print out something
real quick so we can start testing these
bad boys and I'll put if I eat a
watermelon
I will weigh not weight way and we'll
put something like percent d lips now
after this of course what we can do is
we can just go ahead and put a variable
name in but I also want to mention this
what people can do and I don't really
see this lot and it's really useful is
they can actually write an entire
equation in place of just a variable
name so you can put something like
weight plus I don't know what's the
weight of a watermelon twelve pounds
maybe I don't freaking know so what this
is going to do is is pretty much going
to calculate uh this expression right
here which is five ninety five plus
twelve and then output it on the screen
and pump that on new line and my old
program still running from the last
tutorial and run this bad boy so
apparently if I eighty twelve pound
watermelon I'm going to weigh 607 pounds
simple enough so we saw that we can add
using the plus sign and another thing
that we can do is subtract of course to
multiply its the asterisk it's the
little symbol above the eight on your
keyboard to divide it's the forward
slash it's I don't know where it is on
your keyboard snakes to the shift on my
keyboard and one other thing that
can do is actually this one right here
the % now this is called the modulus and
let me go let me show you hit what it
does so this doesn't really make sense
because you know if I do watermelon I
weighs 7 pounds so you're wondering how
the heck did it get 7 that it divided by
something well what the modulus is is
the remainder whenever you divide so
whenever you divide 595 by 12 you're
going to get some number and you're also
going to get a remainder of 7 so
whenever you want that remainder again
use the percent sign it's called the
modulus now let me go ahead and show you
guys something else and this is probably
going to help a lot of people understand
why they're getting some different
values in their program so let's go
ahead and make a few numbers a and we'll
set this equal to 86 or something and be
set equal to 21 and then just go ahead
and print some crap out and might as
well just print like I don't know keep
it simple I guess so we'll print out the
result of an equation and that's a over
B so why the heck am I telling you that
you know we already learned that you can
put equations in there no big whoop Oh
check this out let's say that we had a
float as well and let's just name this
like C or something so float C set it
equal to 86 point O and float D and
we'll set this equal to 21 point O so
let's just copy this bad boy and of
course we're not going to use percent D
we're going to use percent F which means
printout a float and we're also going to
use C and D C D so what I want to talk
about right here is this whenever you
use in equations in here like this in
your dividing numbers whenever you
divide an integer by another integer
check it out
the result is going to be an integer for
now whenever you take a float and
divided by another float the result is
going to be a float
so that's going to come in handy later
on when you ever you guys get a bunch of
bugs and also if you guys are like
alright I'm dividing 86 by 21 and I know
it's not an even number so why the heck
has it given me four because you know
four times 21 is 84 so what the heck so
just remember that because if you don't
you're probably going to come across
some trouble in the future so whenever
you want a float result use float
numbers whenever you want to integer
result use integers simple enough easy
to remember so for now that's it in the
next tutorial we're going to be talking
about the order of operations and also
I'm going to be showing you guys a cool
way to assign values to more than one
variable it's going to be awesome I'll
see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
