Photoshop cs6 tutorial buddy Blackford
here and I'm gonna teach you about how
to use the clone stamp tool now the
clone stamp tool allows you to sample a
part of an image and then apply that
sample somewhere else on the same image
or even if you want to on another
document now for example what that means
is so say I want to take this button
right here and apply it right here and
here and here in between the other
buttons to add more buttons to the shirt
well you can do that using the clone
stamp tool it basically just copies that
button and puts it and you can put it
wherever you want the clone stamp tool
can also be used to repair images or get
rid of things such as scratches and all
that kind of stuff so we're gonna go
over some of the ways to use clone stamp
tool using this image so let's start by
zooming in a little bit so we can see
what's going on I'm gonna zoom in on
these buttons and this pretty good
now one thing keep in mind when you're
using the clone stamp tool it's gonna
take this exact image now if you'll look
at the shirt you can see that this
button right here is definitely brighter
than this button down here so when you
try to like add it it's gonna look
stupid anyways I'll show you so the
first thing we need to do is select like
an area for our clone stamp tool to
sample from the way you do that is by
holding down all on your keyboard and it
turns into like a little crosshair here
and then that way you can pick your
sample area so I'm just gonna pick this
button right here actually I'm going to
pick the top button so we can show you
the what I'm talking about with the
lighting and everything like that so
just hold down a button and click and
it'll have the area sample for you and
you can see that now it turns into a
button the next thing you need to do is
come up to your brush and pick your
brush pick a size and make sure that
your hardness is up
at a hundred percent if you want the
whole entire button the show if you move
the hardness down for example I'll move
it down to zero the button looks faded
and blends in more with the actual image
instead of standing out as its own
button so here it is at 100% you can see
it's way more defined so that's how you
do that you can increase your brush size
as well to get more of the sample area
so that's how that works
I'm gonna lower my brush size back to
see somewhere around just so that the
button is showing so about this I got 20
pixels here so all you need to do now is
click and it'll place the button and you
can see there it has placed the extra
button in the area now what I was
talking about earlier with the lighting
and everything let me go place this
button down here next to this one
obviously that doesn't look right
doesn't look like it belongs so what you
need to do is just sample one of these
other buttons near it and put that down
there like that and it looks like it
actually belongs in the picture now
something some other things I'd like to
show you have to deal with this top menu
bar up here with the different ways that
we can use our clone stamp tool okay
we've got our different blending modes
here to show how the clone stamp tool
that you are the stamp that you put down
blends in with the other our blends in
with the original image now if you don't
know about blending modes and what they
do check out my tutorials on blending
modes it's a like a three or four part
tutorial where I explain each one in
depth and show you in pictures how do
they work
we've got our opacity here which
obviously toggles the transparency of
what you're putting down so if I go down
to zero
it's pretty much I put it that I click
there to put down my clone to put down
my stamp and nothing happened because
they trans passed it was at while it's
at 1% you can't even see it
I put it at 50 around 50% and I click
you can see that it barely shows up so
I'm gonna go undo those moves so I don't
have a bunch of random buttons hiding in
the background there the next button
that I want to go over is this a line
button here now what the align button
does is allows you to keep sampling from
the same point but it won't give you the
same exact image when you're trying to
put it down so take for example let me
take a sample of this button now we have
this button every time I put this down
the button is going to show up as the
same button every time now let me click
on aligned here and then I sample this
button now I set this button down and
now the image is going the same so the
button here is the same exact point here
but as I move away from the button then
I set down it's also picking up the same
distance away from the original button
so if I move over a little bit you're
gonna be able to see this little seam
and there's the seam right there and if
I start painting you will be able to see
the seam and what I'm talking about so
you can also hold down when you're doing
this so that's what the align button
does
now I forgot to mention it earlier but
if you're using a Mac the option key is
what you're going to hold down instead
of the Alt key on the Windows platform
just remember that all and option are
interchangeable with the mac and Windows
platforms so now I want to show you like
another way to use this
and that be like cleaning up like
scratches or anything in there so I saw
this table in the back that has this
line going through it and your client
wants you to make it just one table so
nothing it's not all like coming through
so what I'm going to do is make sure a
line is on and I'm going to sample the
table and then all I'm gonna do is hover
over top of it and just start dragging
and you can see it goes way too far I
need to back up and I need this sample
up here closer to the top get get the
edges aligned now I can start dragging
and now see next to my cursor you can
see a little plus sign that's where
you're sampling from and now I'm just
gonna have to lower my brush size down a
little bit and get this little area here
let's see if I can get it so it looks
somewhat decent back up a little let me
back up here a little bit more so now
you can see that the table has been
somewhat fixed now we're gonna have to
add some like maybe some blur to it so
it blends in a little bit better there
we go and now you've got a table that
has been made just one and you can kind
of see how I might have to blur this a
little more to get a better effect
looking so it doesn't look like there's
a painted streak in there but just mess
with that and for the most part when
you're working with stuff in the
background everybody's going to be
focusing on the focal point of the image
and they're not gonna notice that kind
of stuff in the background so just keep
that in mind when you're working with it
and you don't have to worry too much
about blurring as much if you have
something in the background now if I was
to do something like that right in the
foreground you want to get it as perfect
looking as you can and that's just a tip
that I've learned from working on lots
of professional projects and movies and
things like that
where they're just gonna be focused on
the front so that's a basic introduction
of the clone stamp tool and how you
would use it in like a real image so
take that knowledge and then I'll be
doing a more advanced clone stamp tool
tutorial later on that shows you how to
use different options and use different
source points and things like that which
will be which will make more sense when
I get into the actual tutorial so thanks
for watching this one and keep keep up
with the tutorials to figure out when
the next clone stamp tool advanced
tutorials coming up so thanks a lot and
have a good day everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
