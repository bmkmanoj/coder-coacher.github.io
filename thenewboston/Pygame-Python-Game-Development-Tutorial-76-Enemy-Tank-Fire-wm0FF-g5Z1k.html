their paella tutorial video in this
video we're gonna be doing it's
continues to work on our enemy tank and
we're gonna be giving them artificial
intelligence of sorts so to sort we're
gonna go ahead and scroll down and what
we want to go to is the tank firing
option where's that okay so far shell
and I thought we would get away with
doing like a simple editing of this fire
shell function but the enemy tank is
going to go through some analysis to
decide where he wants to shoot his shell
so I'm gonna go ahead and we're gonna
get rid of these old options here and
I'm gonna go ahead and highlight this
and copy and since we're cut let's go
ahead and get rid of this as well so
within our Photoshop function get rid of
these this if statement so it is only
starting shell equals and then the
negative equals so then below that let's
go ahead and paste and scroll up and now
we're gonna call this let's make some
space though we're gonna call this e
underscore fire shell so that's efore
enemy then we're gonna go ahead and get
rid of this if statement again only this
time we leave the plus equals like that
and then e fire show we have to go down
a little bit to where we call it and
we'll do e underscore fire shell and
then we'll get rid of this tank enemy
parameter and real quick um let's just
run there really fast see if okay so our
enemy tank is firing but the problem of
course is that the enemy tank does not
have any sort of idea about where or why
he's firing so now that we made those
close quick changes let's go ahead and
go up to e fire and how might we
actually solve this problem like how do
you actually have the enemy tank figure
out where he wants to shoot well first
of all this artificial intelligence he
you know we're not gonna write a script
that like
looks at at the image of the game and
says okay there's this blob of X tank
here and we're gonna fire and try to hit
him like I was saying in the beginning a
lot of video game is stuff is just kind
of illusion or deception really um as
far as so like when it comes like your
enemies intelligence they're not
actually intelligent it's a very
calculated process usually that we go
through to determine you know like where
like for example for firing the shell
you'll see that we're basically getting
basically in a brute force our way
through finding the best method to fire
and then what we do is we add a slight
degree of randon randomness to it and
then that degree of randomness that we
add to that will kind of add more
randomness or take away or randomness
and that will be the difficulty of our
enemy so if we have a really hard elite
enemy he's not going to be very random
in his deviation from the perfect shot
if we have a poor shot and a mirror a
really easy enemy he's not going to be
super accurate he's gonna have a lot of
randomness to his shot so he might
actually only hit you 1 out of 10 times
whereas the really good one is gonna you
you know at least 1 out of every 2 times
but probably like 2 out of 3 or
something
so anyway II fire shell you've got you
know your your your random height here
you've got all the barrier stuff now
we're gonna go ahead and pass a couple
more variables and we're gonna say pee
tank X and P tank why what's that mean
that's the player tank ex player tank Y
so we're going to go ahead and stuff in
the players location so II fire-show
will come down here and we'll come all
the way down down to where we call it
here we go so a fire shell and now we
want the x and y coordinates of our
player tanks so we'll just copy this and
paste and paste and my dog is making a
whole bunch of noise out here let me let
me kick him out real quick all right uh
where was I so main tank x-men take Y so
that's where the player tank is so now
we'll come
right back up to our firing function so
if our show
now how will we figure out where where
we're going to shoot the show basically
we only have one major variable that
we're trying to find and that is power
and there's all kinds of ways that we
could do it we could possibly figure out
what it would take for this algorithm
right here to hit the numbers but
there's an even slightly easier way to
do this and that is to just simulate the
fires
okay so we're Monte Carlo Eng basically
to find our answer so we'll come down
here so he force and well so we'll leave
fire we'll leave like this this bulk of
code that's still gonna run eventually
but what we're gonna do is modify
basically gun power so we pretty much
don't need that anymore soon but yeah I
will say current power I don't say right
now that equals 1 and then we're going
to have a variable called power
underscore found and that's going to
equal false now and then what we're
gonna do is we're gonna say wow not a
power found what do we want to do we
want fire a bunch of that's exactly
what we want to do so why not power
found we'll go ahead and do a current
power plus equals 1 do that now at the
very end would be the probably better
place but I don't think 1 or 2 percent
is gonna be the answers that's 1 so
current power plus equals 1 then we're
gonna say fire equals true and basically
this code right here - the prints pretty
much in in the we're gonna run these
checks yeah so basically run all this so
we'll copy this and let's go ahead and
paste that here and now let's go ahead
and shift it over because this is not so
one tab now we're gonna go ahead and get
rid of all these print statements first
of all
we're just gonna clean up most of this
we do want the shell that hit the ground
and stop at that point we do care if it
hits the barrier obviously that was no
good we'll go ahead and get rid of these
print statements regarding the barrier
this falls and then basically what we're
gonna ask is for the one where we hit
the ground basically right here
the question is you know it's going to
throw an explosion and the question is
is that explosion by the players by the
player right so what we can ask is if P
tank X plus 15 is greater than the hit X
while that is sound well hit X is
simultaneously greater than P tank X
minus 15 so the location of our tank
that means we found the proper proper
information so what would we do well we
would print whoops we will print target
acquired
and then what will we do what will we do
next
and that would be power underscore pound
equals equals true now what we want to
do is basically we can write at this
point all we need to true true and so
that'll give us the target acquired and
then we have power found equals true and
then well now current power will have
been modified to the perfect power level
that we want that's why we modify it
immediately there so then when we go to
to actually fire we can scroll down here
and let's see I'm all lost fire equals
to join show while fire below uh and
basically we have gun power instead of
gun power we would want that variable to
be current
power so we would just change that to
current power there and that should do
it
so um let's go ahead and run that we'll
see we'll see if that worked out fire
got a massive explosion going on here
first of all we're rendering every
explosion that's a problem let's go back
up to you fire uh so it's up let's stop
doing that stuff stop drawing the the
thing there and then we also don't want
to be exploding let's go ahead and stop
the explosion from occurring there and
so that's if the explosion and then also
we don't need any explosion there either
although I'm not sure I don't understand
why I didn't move but it's yeah we want
to throw a quick they seem right here
we're just gonna say if current power is
greater than 100 we're gonna go ahead
and say power
underscore found so that I'll get us out
of that now what I'm a little concerned
about at this point is why that hit see
like oh okay so now he did fire and
apparently it says oh well he fired okay
well what he did was he found 100% and
took a spot into the shot some reason
he's not finding the player tank okay
sorry about that um so yeah the problem
is a really stupid problem so so the way
that we're doing is we're brute forcing
the the solution here and the way that
we do that if you recall what effects
like the path what is the shot of the
power well that was right down here
right gun power so I was not replacing
that variable so what we need to do is
we need to take current power and we
need to put current power divided by 50
we need to put that in there otherwise
absolutely no changes 50 so if that 50%
powershot didn't make it we would have
gone forever so anyway let's try that
one more time
play and we'll go ahead and fire an
enemy tank fires and yeah yeah it's us
we'll move fire enemy tank fires and
boom yeah it's us yeah we'll go ahead
and hide over here fire and boom yeah
anything now let's go ahead and move our
tank right here though
yeah well fire we miss and then the you
can you know that the tank ran through
one all 100 options because it you know
it clearly shot at 100% shot so that's
what I mean and also that's why
brute-forcing is it it's instant right
so I fire he fires it's like an instant
thing it just it just it ran through all
the options pretty much instantly so now
as you can see I mean he's just he's
going to demolish us so obviously we
would want some degree of randomness
here otherwise we're never gonna win but
that's how we know what the perfect shot
is then we can add a little bit of
randomness to it and then we can also
depending on you know the shot right so
the shot might be a perfect direct hit
and or if the shot might be a little bit
off something like that so we want to do
damage based on how good the shot
actually was and we actually have to do
damage which we have not done yet
so yes we still got a few more things to
do but hopefully you guys have been
enjoying as always thanks for watching
until the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
