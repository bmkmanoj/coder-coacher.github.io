tutorial that I'm making for New Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to
begin our fourth project and we're going
to be making an address book so in this
tutorial all we're going to be doing is
making a user interface so the first
thing that we're just going to want to
do here is add a group box to the form
and inside of this group box is going to
be a list view basically displaying the
people's names so I'm just going to name
this group box people alright and inside
up here I'm just going to drag a list
view so let's go over to your toolbox
and drag a list view over and you can
dock it in the parent container if you
want or you don't have to it doesn't
really matter alright and public we're
also going to want to have a group box
for all the person's information so I'm
just going to resize this here to fill
up the rest of the form and I'm going to
make its text information and we're
actually going to be renaming this to
the person's name and then their
information so this that's more fancy I
guess and inside of here is where all
the user's information is going to be
displayed so we're just going to have a
label next to a text box or other
information so the first thing that
we're going to have is a full name so
let me just get text box here so you can
type in it and change that name
obviously
size it to make it bigger and there you
go I'm just going to make this Degas
text whole name
all right and maybe reposition it so
it's more towards the top so we have
more room to work with and I'm going to
copy this because we're going to have
several text boxes in here the next one
is going to be for their email so right
now address right there and the next one
is going to be 4 on their street address
alright street address and
next thing that we're going to have is a
date input for their birthday so I'm
just going to copy the label or if you
use a label and I'm just going to make
this be their birthday because sometimes
it's hard to remember people birthdays
and just going to go up here and I'll
get a date/time picker control and just
drag that over and I like to format the
way it is so I'm just going to leave it
elongated so we can actually see like
the day of the week the month and stuff
with that we don't need the time really
all right and then we're going to want
to have one big text box at the bottom
and that will just be for additional
notes on the person like like who their
parents names are and stuff like that if
you ever want to remember it so
additional notes alright and then Xbox
around here now we're just going to make
it multi-line so you can have a lot of
notes so just check this multi-line
check box right there or you can go over
to the properties panel and change the
multi-line property to true now I'm just
going to drag this bigger about like
that we're going to have buttons at the
bottom and those buttons will be for
things like saving adding and removing
the user and I'm just going to select
this whole thing and hold alt here and
move it around so that it's more
centered inside of this groov box
alright now that looks much better then
I was going to get a button and we're
going to have three of these at the
bottom like I said before the first one
is going to be for saving any changes
that you've made so I'm just going to
say Save Changes and just make that
bigger so you can see all the text then
I'll just copy this button so I don't to
go over to the toolbox and get another
one and I'm going to make the text of
this one add contact and then we're just
going to want to have one more and
that's gonna be for removing the contact
so I'm not going to make it so and we're
also going to want to have a context
menu and that'll be for so you can
right-click inside of this all list view
right here so that you can remove a
person so let me just get a context menu
strips and we're going to just only have
one option and that's
I said going to be for removing the
person all right and the last thing that
we're just going to want to do here is
rename the form so I'm just going to
make it say address book oops
address book and we're also going to
want to make it so that you cannot
resize or maximize the form so we're
going to change the form border style to
fixed single and then we're also going
to make it so you can't maximize the
form so it is that the maximize box
property to false alright and that's
pretty much it for this tutorial on
setting up the user interface for our
address book in the next tutorial we're
going to get into actually saving
settings and stuff for your address book
so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
