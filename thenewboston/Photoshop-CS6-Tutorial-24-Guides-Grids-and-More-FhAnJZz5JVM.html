Photoshop cs6 tutorial about setting up
your preferences I'm buddy Blackford and
I want to start immediately on getting
these getting through these different
preferences so this time we're in the
guides grid and slices preferences and
we can go over this one fairly quickly
and by the way to get to your
preferences you just come up to edit
here and then preferences is down at the
bottom so let's get into this
so guides are the the lines that you can
pull down from your rulers over here on
the side where like my mouse is right
now and up here at the top you can pull
down guys and I made a tutorial about
this it's tutorial number 19 I think or
somewhere around there so you can change
the color of those guides and then you
can change it from lines and dashed
lines however the dashed lines is kind
of more like really closely dotted lines
so just keep it on the lines I don't
really see why you would want the dashed
lines because they're so close together
it just lit almost looks like a line
we've got our smart guides color here
you can change those easily just
whatever you want just make sure it's
not I wouldn't have it the same number
or color as my guides or anything like
that and then for a grid here
this changes the grid system within
Photoshop so you can pick your own color
here or have a custom then you got your
different styles and then how many grids
are in each of it so right now it is a
gray color the next thing we got down
here is four slices like the slicing
tool which is in one of these and
pretty much it's going to just show you
the the line of the slice in whatever
color you choose and then whether or not
this plays a number value for each slice
so that's it for this one which is
fairly simple let's go to plugins and
here on our plugins here we've got only
a few different preferences that we can
change you can set up an additional
plugins folder if you would like and
what you do there is you just check that
box and then you come into like maybe if
you have an external hard drive and you
want to use that a folder within that
for where your other plugins are so you
can use that as well when you change the
or when you add the third-party plugins
this way through the plugins folder they
show up within the filter menu so it
just keeps like it helps you click keep
things organized you can what's new in
here is this filters thing here where
you show all the filter gallery groups
and name and that appears within the
filter menu up here so this this menu up
here I won't
I won't be able to show you unless I
restart Photoshop because you can say
see changes will take effect the next
time you start Photoshop so just try
that out for yourself II would if you
would like and then we've got our
extension panels here what allow
extensions to connect to the internet
and load extension panels and that's for
other like Adobe connected things like
Adobe cooler which is a color scheme
like extension and I would just have
these checked unless you're like really
don't want to be connected to the
Internet too
I guess so I'm just keep these like that
and then we can come down here to type
which we only have a couple things use
smart quotes you want to have that on
because in that basically it's one of
the one of the rules of graphic design
is make sure your quotes are correct and
just use the smart quotes the next one
down here is the enable of missing glyph
protection and that pretty much selects
like unreadable characters so you can
see what's going on and the next one is
show fundings in English and if you
don't want that then I'll show them in
their Roman names so like I've never had
unchecked this before so I'm not really
sure what it does but because I want to
see everything in English and then you
got your text engine options here which
pretty much East Asian Middle Eastern
I've always just kept us on East East
Asian so just it's up to you which you
want to have your text engine options
there so that's gonna be it for this
tutorial and I look forward to seeing
you guys on the next tutorial where we
we really won't be doing too much more
of this preferences stuff and start
getting to some the cooler stuff so I'll
see you guys then good luck have some
fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
