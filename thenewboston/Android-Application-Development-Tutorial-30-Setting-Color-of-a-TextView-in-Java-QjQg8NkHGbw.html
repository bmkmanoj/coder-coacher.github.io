Android tutorial for the new Boston
we're going to learn how to set text a
certain color and then probably we're
going to be done with this application
after the next tutorial where I'm going
to show you guys about random and so
what we're going to do is set up just
kind of the bracket for the next
tutorial
so again we're just going to say else if
we're probably going to learn about
setting text in this tutorial as well
even though you guys already know that I
believe so we're going to call this one
else if WTF all uppercase and that
stands for where's the fridge so we're
going to create if the text equals where
the fridge one asked one last little
thing here so now what we can do also is
every time this button is clicked we can
say display which is our textview dot
set text and we're going to do is set
this equal to whatever the input is so
we're going to say check and then it's
gonna you know just set the text real
quickly and then check if it's left
right center blue or WTF where's the
fridge yet so what we can do is if it's
none of those we can just say else if as
well or we're just going to say else
because this will be everything else if
it's none of those options we're going
to say else and then we can say display
dot set text to 'invalid again and also
we're going to just change this back to
kind of the starting point so we're
going to say display dot set gravity to
sinner
so again we refer to the gravity class
and then type sinner and that's about it
we can change the text back just to get
it kind of default where it started at
but now what we're going to do is we're
just going to change the color of the
text when it's when someone types blue
and lowercase so we're going to say
display and I mean pretty much all this
is getting confident and you guys can
kind of look through these methods and
figure out for the most part what they
do at least the set because we can set
some of these some of these things up
and that's what we pretty much use is
set gravity and this one's going to be
set text
I mean we've used set text as well but
this one's going to set text color and
we're going to give it the color blue
and again we can refer to the color
class just like we did with the grass
set gravity and we refer to the gravity
class we refer to a class called color
and it's kind of scroll through some of
the options as you can see you can put
the Alpha which is transparency red
green blue and integer for the most part
and just RGB as well or you can just use
some of these colors they have set up
for you as well so we're going to just
use this blue that they have set up and
there we go pretty much your
applications done what we're going to do
in the next tutorial is basically finish
our application because I don't want to
do a ton of else if statements and show
you guys simple stuff for the most part
I just wanted to show you guys the
random method in Java because you know
if you're creating a game or something
that has a dice and you probably want to
use the random so it's random each time
we're going to kind of go through that
with this what the frig so I'll catch
you guys then so see or where's the
fridge sorry not what the fridge what am
I saying
that makes no sense alright well we'll
catch you guys in the next tutorial see
