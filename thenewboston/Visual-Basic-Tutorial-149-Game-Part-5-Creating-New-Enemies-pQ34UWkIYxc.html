slash the on life gamer for the new
Boston and in this tutorial we're gonna
be working on the game now if you
remember from the previous tutorial we
had it randomly generate an enemy based
on well whenever we click spawn enemy it
randomly generates an enemy now you can
see I set the image of this to a zombie
at the beginning because I added some
stuff to the button spawned so that it
checks to see if there's already an
image in there now it didn't actually
work out the way I wanted it to but you
can look at it if you want I just check
to see if the image equals the zombie
then I'm just going to go ahead and set
enemy type equal to a next to another
integer this didn't work out too well
because when it does that it doesn't
send it back up to the top of the Select
case so basically what I wanted to tell
you is to set this to 4 and not 3
because it generates 1 it can either be
1 all the way up to 3 it can you don't
go one below the max value now this that
I added right here works some time
sometimes but not all the time so if you
want to put that in you can go ahead and
do that so go ahead and run this and you
can see what happens if you spot an
enemy you can see it spawned a villain
then a dragon then a zombie a zombie
again
you can see it's a little more random
now and we can spawn different enemies
it's not spawning the same one over and
over again sometimes we'll get the same
one over but it works a little bit
better than it did before
so I'll just go back to this code you
can pause it right here if you need to
so put that in if you want it's not
necessary but it will help a little bit
so what we need to do in order to use
our classes from our game class library
we need to have game GUI selected and we
need to come up here to project and we
need to add a reference now we need to
reference the dll that we created by you
by creating our class library next see
there's a whole bunch of stuff that we
can reference that's built into the
dotnet framework you see I've got a
whole bunch of stuff right here we're
just gonna select projects and we'll
select the game project and we'll click
OK
ok so we'll come up here and right
before forum 1 let's go ahead and create
a private variable so we'll do private
current enemy now we're not going to set
this to an age certain type right now
we're gonna do that whenever they spawn
an enemy so if they spawn let's say a
zombie will type current enemy equals
and we want to create a new instance of
zombie now since we added a reference to
that DLL file what we can do is type
enemies library dot Sambi so current
enemy is now a zombie and so now that we
could our current enemy what we want to
do is set some values for this progress
bar so we'll come over here and first we
need to come over here to the properties
and we need to find the max value which
is 100 which is what we want it to be so
then we'll type progress bar or progress
bar enemy sorry I got interrupted there
so progress bar enemy dot value is gonna
be equal to 100 so let's go ahead and
run this and you can see was spawning
into me let's spawn until we get a
zombie so we spawned a zombie and you
can see it set the progress of our value
progress bar value equal to
100 now let's go ahead and do this for
each of the cases so current enemy it's
going to be equal to a new enemies
library dot and we're going to do a
villain VB now let me get this out of
the way real quick you can see that we
accidentally made the class villain vbv
B instead of just villain but we don't
really need to change that so we set the
current enemy and to a new villain now
let's go ahead and set the progress bar
but one thing that we should do instead
of just setting the value equal to 100
when you just use indirection
so we'll use current enemy dot
health so you can see that if we try to
access health it's not there that's
because when we created this variable
it's not said to any sort of data type
so what we can do is use polymorphism
so if we use enemy's library dot enemy
we can create we can make this current
enemy any type of enemy we want we can
make it a zombie a villain or a dragon
and it will it can still be represented
as an enemy
so if we use current enemy dot health
now you can see that it will show up and
that we can use it so we just need to
use current enemy dot health here so
this way instead of having to know the
values ourselves and setting them when
we create this you know just get the
stuff that's already there for us to use
so current enemy equals new enemies
library dot dragon and then progress bar
enemy dot value is going to be equal to
current enemy dot health
okay so now that we've added the stuff
that we need to create a new enemy
object and then set the value of the
progress bar let's go ahead and test
this out and see if everything works
fine so let's go ahead and we can spawn
an enemy and we spawned a zombie spawn
that guy we can spawn the villain we
just want the dragon and each time it's
actually resetting this progress bar and
we just can't see it so go ahead put
this code in if you have it you can add
this if-else in diff right here if you
want and then make sure you make objects
and set the value of the progress bar
and once you've done all that go ahead
and move on to the next tutorial where
we will continue working on this project</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
