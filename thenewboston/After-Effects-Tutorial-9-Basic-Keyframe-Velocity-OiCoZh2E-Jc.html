After Effects tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm gonna be teaching you how
to adjust the speeds and velocities of
your keyframes on a motion path so the
first thing we want to do is make a
motion path using the position hotkey P
so I'm gonna take Charlie and move them
down to the bottom left and make his
first keyframe there then about halfway
through the animation it's gonna go up
and at the end he's gonna end in the
bottom right hand corner now well I want
you guys to take know of and I'm gonna
tell you first is the speed of your
animation is controlled by these little
dots those are called frames well your
animation does is hop from one of these
dots to another until it gets the
keyframe so if they're evenly spaced out
then our object is going to move at a
constant speed the closer they are
together the faster our object moves or
the slower object move the more they're
spaced out the faster our object moves
so this is um good by default they're
evenly spaced out but sometimes we want
to have it look like it's accelerating
or decelerating to make it look more
realistic as you can see right now if he
goes it kind of looks like he's just
sprinting out and then he's going
hitting a brick wall and it's not very
realistic to make this a little more
realistic we should have them start out
kind of slow then get faster and then as
he's stopping kind of slowed down a bit
so I'm gonna teach you guys how to do
that um let's go to our last keyframe
and make sure it's selected if it's
yellow it's selected go up to animation
go to keyframe assistant and go to easy
ease the hotkey for this is f9 and once
you hit that you can see that your
keyframe instead of a little diamond it
turned in a little curvy yellow kind of
looks like an hourglass kind of thing
and another thing to take note of is
that these dots are no longer evenly
spaced
these are kind of um farther apart
meaning that our objects going to go
faster and at the end the tighter
together they are or I'm just gonna kind
of slow down at the end it looks like
he's coming to a nice stop so let's go
ahead and I'll show you guys what it
looks like as you can see if you pay a
careful attention he just come into a
nice stop at the end so again you can
either highlight a keyframe and press f9
I can't press f9 though cause uh my
screen recorder will stop and do some
crazy stuff if I press f9 but uh and if
not animation keyframe assistant easy
ease and this will make all the frames
around that keyframe ease in or ease out
now if you want to get rid of this just
hold down ctrl on your keyboard or um
what is it command I believe it's on a
Mac and just click and again if you want
to get rid of it hold down ctrl and
click with your mouse and these will put
it back to the default um was it called
the same speed throughout so if you
wanna so that's pretty much how you ease
in and ease out using a position path
and in my next tutorial I'm gonna be
going over how to do this and in very
advanced we learned how to just apply a
default ease in and ease out but if you
want to give it a custom easing these
out then I'm gonna be teaching you guys
how to do that using the graph editor in
the next tutorial so thank you guys for
watching learn how to do ease in and
ease out and once you learn that you can
move on to my next tutorial so I'll see
you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
