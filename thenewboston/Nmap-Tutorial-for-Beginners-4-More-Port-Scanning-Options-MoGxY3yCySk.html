this video I'm gonna talk to you about
some port scanning options that are
definitely going to help you out
probably one of the most useful videos
in this series today so by default if
you guys are familiar with servers and
you know devices and stuff like that you
probably know that there are 65535 ports
available on your server now 99% of
these ports they're never used they're
never open you don't have to worry about
them there's probably only like a
handful like I don't know I want to say
20 or so that are used like you know the
majority of the time now whenever nmap
looks at a server and it starts scanning
by default it's only going to scan the
1,000 most popular ports so that's the
way that your tool works by default and
like I said the reason for this is
because it takes time to scan ports so
if every time you wanted to scan the
device it had to scan 65,000 times you
know any server your skin it's going to
take like two hours so there are ways
that you can you know actually do a
thorough scan and there are other ways
that you can speed it up as well so
that's what we're going to be learning
but just remember by default and map
scans the 1000 most commonly used ports
and by most common error I mean SSH FTP
MySQL on HTTP you know all those ones so
if you just want to scan the top 100
instead of the top thousand then your
scan is going to work a lot faster and
you can use the flag minus capital F so
this just means fast and if you just
scan some IP address or domain name then
there you go so again in instead of
doing the thousand like it normally does
look how fast that took so it cuts it
down by a tenth of the time and gives
you the same results that we got before
now another thing that you can do is you
can actually only scan specific ports so
let's say that you just figured out this
really awesome well I guess it wouldn't
be awesome for everyone else awesome for
you vulnerability with MySQL and HTTP
what that could be I have
idea but you only wanted to scan certain
ports like maybe three specific ones
then what you can do is you can specify
them using - P so from here I'll show
you guys a little shortcut you can
either just scan one like if you only
want to scan port 20 or you can scan a
range so ports 20 through 25 and if you
want to do multiple ones that aren't you
know what they called 1f consecutive
then you can just separate them with a
comma so let's just do a 20 through 25
and 80 and 443 so we're going to do 20
through 25 and then 80 is just HTTP in
443 is HTTP and I'll just do it for the
new Boston comm so there you go and this
can save you a bunch of time as well
because again it's not scanning a
thousand it's only going to scan
whatever ones you specify so there you
go so it's going to say okay these are
all filtered SSH is open and boom pretty
much you know we saw all this before now
another cool thing that you guys may
found useful is if you want to scan
ports by name then it may be a little
easier than you know remembering the
port number so let's say you want to
scan a native space there HTTP which is
port 80 and my SQL but you don't
remember the port number for my SQL you
can actually just write my SQL and this
right here is a comma in case you guys
can't tell in the video so there you go
so let's scan my server and see if I
have HTTP in MySQL up and running
alright so we have this up and running
because it's a web server and MySQL is
filtered so there you go now if you guys
ever get hired by a company then it's
always a good idea to scan every single
port now like I said this is going to
take a long time because you know there
are over 65,000 of them but I mean if
they're paying you especially by the
hour then you probably want to do this
now I'm not going to do it because like
I said it takes forever if you write - P
this indicates that you want to scan
every single pore so just right you know
the New Boston comm if I can type and
hit enter and there you go so that's how
you do that now another thing that and
this is something that I use almost all
the time is nmap - - open so this is
going to scan just like before the 1,000
most commonly sports but it's only going
to display the open ports because if a
port is filtered and protected by a
firewall or it's closed off and there
aren't any services running then I
really don't care about it because it's
likely not you know a huge vulnerability
so this scans and mother effer
all right well you typically don't want
to add that you typically don't want to
add this but I have sausage fingers so
there you go all right so this scans it
just like before but it's only going to
return like I said the open ports so
boom roasted toasted there you go so
those are some quick scanning options
that you can use again I like the - F
for fast and I also like to specify
sometimes like if I'm only scanning for
FTP or MySQL or some ports that I know
are typically vulnerable so there you go
hopefully you guys enjoyed I will see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
