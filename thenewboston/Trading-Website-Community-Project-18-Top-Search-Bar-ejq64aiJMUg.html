eighteenth mother effing tutorial and in
this video we're going to be working on
this search bar at the top the bar that
allows you to search how awesome is that
so the first thing that we need to do is
we need to go ahead and create a div for
the search bar now in the main.css we
already named this div top search pretty
much this is the area where we need to
put it so let's go ahead and do that
right now div give it the ID equals top
search and if we go ahead and take a
close look at the search bar we can see
a couple things this isn't any ordinary
search bar this is actually a form a
form with three elements it has an input
section for typing in your keywords it
has a drop down menu for refining your
search selecting your category maybe I
want to search for books Hunger Games
and it also has a third search or submit
button that just says search on it so
basically an input a drop down menu and
a button so since this is a form we of
course you need to go ahead and make a
form right here now the form name let's
just go ahead and name it input now for
the action what this is going to do is
anytime we submit this form we want to
take the user to a search page and
that's where our script is going to want
run so our script is on search PHP and
maybe we'll code that next May we won't
who knows and the method of this is
actually get I keep hitting freaking
shift on the keyboard if I hit it one
more time I'm going to drop kick my
keyboard I swear I will so like I said
this form has three elements an input a
drop-down menu and a button so let's go
ahead and work on the first element
first which is the input section where
they input their keywords now the type
of data for this is of course just
regular text that they can search for
now for the ID let's just go ahead and
give it an ID
oh my god are you freaking kidding me
give it an IB of keywords and it also is
going to have a name of keywords IDE
host keywords name equals keywords now
how big do we want this box to be well I
already figured this out and if I put
its size 100 then it's going to look
pretty darn pretty so let's go ahead and
give this a size of 100 and that's going
to make sure it fits nicely across our
website now the last couple things we
need to do is we need to say okay what
class CSS wise do you want to belong to
well we already made a class called
search box and what this does is it
pretty much just gives a nice padding
and whenever the user types in text it
colors it to a nice grey color and aside
from this the very last thing that we
need to do is whenever you have an input
not only on this form but on any form in
HTML you can have a default value now
whenever you have a default value for an
input before the user even types in
anything that's the value that appears
in that form so the default value in
this case what we want it to be is
whatever the users last search term was
so if you remember up here we stored
their last search term in a variable
called default text so now all you have
to do is we need to set the default
value for this form equal to default
text now this is the code that right
here that makes their last search term
in conjunction with this equal to the
default value for the form pretty
awesome huh now the only other minor
thing I want to do after this is I want
to add a non-breaking space now all this
does is it gives you one more space
between this element and this element
because I just think it looks a little
bit better now our input section is done
we referenced it correctly whenever we
code in PHP we just have to name it
keywords and we'll be good to go now
after this we need our drop-down menu
are many that's going to be responsible
for all pretty much all of the
categories whenever the user wants to
refine their search okay I want to look
for Hunger Games but do I want to look
in all categories do I want to look in I
don't know like a sports memorabilia
what on what the heck do I want to look
hunger games under so the first thing
that we need to do is we need to make a
drop down menu now in order to do this
in HTML you make a select form and you
give it the ID you can actually give it
whatever I do you want but I'm going to
name mine category I think that's
appropriate since you know we're
selecting categories now I also want to
give it a name of category just like
that now the next thing I want to do is
I'm also going to go ahead and give it
the search box class and what this is
going to do is whenever you have this
drop down right here it's going to give
the text a nice I don't even know if you
can tell this from YouTube but it's not
black it's kind of like a nice gray and
also a little bit of padding just so it
blends in with the rest of the website
so pretty much this is going to have the
same look is the other form elements now
after this check it out let me go ahead
and take a deep breath because I'm going
to need to explain some things whenever
you make a drop down menu in HTML what
you do is you make to select tags and
you put all your options in between
those select tags however I just don't
want too hard I shouldn't say hardcore I
just don't want to write the options
right here because what if we decide
that you know what we actually need
another category well then we're going
to have to go back in anytime we wrote
all the categories on our website
whether it's the drop-down menu or on
the left hand side right here we're
going to need to change it in every
single location kind of a pain right
well it would be however that's not how
we're going to create our website we're
smarter than that what we are going to
do is we're going to create a list of
categories one time and we're just going
to include that whenever we need it so
let's just go ahead and we won't make
the function right now but we'll add
comment to include categories here in
that way our categories are going to be
so much easier to maintain we only have
to change them in one location in one
little bit of code and then they update
across our entire website pretty sweet
huh so the last thing I want to do for
this tutorial is just make an echo
statement pretty much closing everything
out so the first thing that we need to
do is close our select tag select and
probably need to add the proper closing
tag and after this let's go ahead and
remove this in our forum there were
three elements there was an input
section there was a drop down menu and
the last thing was a button to pretty
much search for your results submit the
form so let's go ahead and coat that
button right now before closing out our
form so let's go ahead and put input now
in order to make a button the type
equals submit the value the value
whenever you're making a button is what
text do you want to appear on the button
I'm just going to go ahead and say
search and the class we already styled a
class called button remember in main.css
this huge thing right here that is the
button looks so yep we do not have to do
that again so basically there you go we
pretty much created a form with our
input section our drop-down menu even
though we didn't make our categories yet
and also the button that submits the
form so the last thing that we need to
do is close out the form and also close
out this last div now before I let you
guys go I want to mention this because a
lot of you guys are probably going to
ask me questions about this you're
saying how do you know when to use
single quotation marks and how do you
know when to use double quotation marks
and I'm going to be talking about this
for the rest of torial so if you guys
know then just go ahead and watch the
next video I'll see you then but for
those of you guys who don't know when do
you single
quotation marks and when to use double
quotation marks in PHP whenever you use
single quotation marks it takes
everything in here and it just prints it
out as is on the screen whenever use
double quotation marks what it does is
it looks for any variables or any values
that it can interpret in between before
printing it out on the screen so since
we just have plain old HTML in here in
here with the null values I can just go
ahead and use single quotation marks
however in here when we do something
dynamic which is use this variable we
don't want the variable dollar sign
default text printed out on the screen
we actually want the variable to be
interpreted go ahead and grab their
keywords and then print it out so
whenever we have you know variables or
something to use use double quotation
marks whenever you just have HTML use
single quotation marks anything you
don't need interpreted so there you go
there you have it in the next tutorial
we're going to be creating these links
and also the categories so thank you
guys for watching don't forget subscribe
although I'm guessing you probably
already are and i'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
