the 35th pygame tutorial video in this
video we're going to be talking about is
upgrading our apples so our snake looks
pretty darn good at the moment but our
Apple is pretty boring so our snake
looks cool and but our apples are just
square uh-huh so in this video we'll be
talking about is updating our Apple
whoops
anyway um in fact interestingly enough I
just happened to spot a little bit of a
glitch there
if we're going like this let's try this
again right so our snake head is facing
the wrong way after a game over so let's
go ahead and fix that really quick as
well quit okay um to fix that we should
just need to okay so here's our
direction I thought we were already
changing that because I think we affect
direction yeah down here so we're just
going to call a quick Direction equals
right one more time
in this script that way every time the
game loop begins so just the initial
will be facing the correct direction
so let's just test that really quick
we'll just let it game over here proceed
playing and yeah we're facing the right
direction now okay cool so now what we
want to do is won't update the Apple
search loader so let's say bit of paint
and just as a quick aside the apples
thickness was thirty I'm just trying to
find it here it is 30 so we want a
picture of our Apple to be 30 by 30 so
let's open up paint where is paint there
it is
and this time we'll go to resize and it
will be 30 pixels and then by 30 and
then I'm going to zoom in a little bit
and then now draw my Apple
I'm not the best but Apple looks
something like that's a hard a couple
trial and error and we'll have a
good-looking Apple here cool that's good
enough I want to make the edges go all
the way if I can and I will do the exact
same thing over here so at the moment it
really looks like a heart that's okay
hopefully y'all's looks a little better
than mine but you know fill it that and
then an Apple has you know like a little
stem and then we have we use on an apple
so I had some leaves here awesome oh my
goodness boom boom and let's just give
it a little rounded look and now we have
ourselves an apple okay easy enough so
they go file save as and we'll save this
one I've already made an apple but I'll
save this one's Apple to dot PNG close
out and now we want to have that
transparent background so I'm gonna pull
up GIMP and quickly do a transparent
background on that again it's not
absolutely necessary especially clear
background is white but it will help the
game look a little bit better if we do
give it a transparent background since
it doesn't take too long with GIMP or
most applications we're gonna go ahead
and do that so open and this one is
desktop Buckey Apple two colors color to
alpha okay file export export replace
export done okay and we'll discard those
so now what we want to do is we're going
to go up to near the top of our script
and just underneath IMG which is our
snake head we're going to do apple IMG
and that's going to equal pi game dot
image dot
load and then we'll use we'll use the
one I just made so Apple to dot PNG and
then once you have the Apple image the
main thing that we want to change is
where we're actually drawing the apples
so it's near the bottom for sure so I
thought yeah this would be it right here
so this is where we're drawing our Apple
so I'm going to go ahead and just
comment that line out because we're no
longer to draw the Apple with the draw
rect instead we're going to draw our
apple with an image display so to do
that we have game display so this is the
surface that we want it to go to and
then we're going to blit to surface and
then what do we want to blit well we
want to blit the Apple image and then
where do we want to blit it that's going
to be R and Apple X and then R and Apple
Y and that should blit it to our surface
I'm gonna clear out the space and let's
save and run that see how we did welcome
to slither C so now we see we have a
nice lovely Apple there no no no no eat
that up
nice got it cool so now we've got an
apple got a nice looking snake we still
need score and we still need to upgrade
our icon so we're gonna be working on
that in the next video also I did happen
to notice aside from the other error
since we've changed the Apple up a
little bit the Apple is no longer a ten
by ten it's plausible that the Apple is
somewhat off of the screen so we're
going to work on fixing that as well so
stay tuned for that as always thanks for
