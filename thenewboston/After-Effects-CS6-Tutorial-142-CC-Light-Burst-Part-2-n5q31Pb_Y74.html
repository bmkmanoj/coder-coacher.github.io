seems to have like a warping effect
because everything is actually kind of
getting warped by the blur so keep that
in mind and if you don't want such a
heavy warping effect start off with a
less of our ray length I'll show you
that with the less of the Ray length and
I hit you to bring up my properties that
have keyframes on them so let's go to
the next one
for ray length and we'll start it off at
something like 30 no preview this again
hopefully it doesn't take a long time
again but it looks like it is so pretty
much it's not gonna be as crazy as the
last animation that we just looked at
but I wanted to show you both show you
both ways to see it so you can see what
was going on also you may not want to go
exactly to zero on this but that's up to
you I just wanted to show you like
pretty much how it looked so let's go on
to a solid and show you what it looks
like on that or a certain layer so we'll
turn off the adjustment layer so it's
just like this now and I'll bring up
just a salad as a background now I'm
gonna add the light bursts onto this
generate CC light burst and now this is
what it does when it's on the background
it kind of creates it creates a bright
spot which can be nice sometimes so
you've got the bright spot that you can
see in the back and if you increase the
rate length or anything like that it's
just gonna increase the size of the
bright spot there the intensity is gonna
set up how our increase halloi intense
that light is in the middle like that so
you can put on some like hot spots or
you can simulate like a Sun or something
like that
if you if you wanted to
now if I click on the I'm gonna put it
back in the middle here and if I click
on the different types here we got
straight which is no effect different
than than the fade here when it's on the
background then we got Center which you
can see like it creates like a box like
effect for some reason so that's how
that's what I wanted to show you with
the different types here now fade OOP
clicked on the wrong thing just click on
this and will bring it up here into the
corner or something like that now you
can see how it looks like there's a like
a light source coming from like the
corner so this is a good way to add like
a light source and then you can use that
light source looking object to put like
a spotlight up there and then use it to
shine onto your to shine onto your logo
or something like that if you're trying
to light it up correctly or make it more
realistic so let's throw it on to like
one of the logo items here and see what
happens so I'm gonna delete it off of
here so we don't have to worry about it
being all over the place and we've got
our logo here we'll put it right in the
one on the middle and put CC Labor's
done and now you can see that it fades
how I'm these ones you know it's gonna
act pretty much like it did on the
picture and everything else won't the
intensity I put way up by accident so
what I wanted to do but it'll blur out
and lighten up the object here or I can
decrease in it doesn't do it as much but
that's how it works on that so you want
to make sure that your Center is
probably on it but if we take it off you
can add the blur and shoot the blur out
to the side if you put
to the side now since this object here
is going to have an alpha the halo alpha
should work on here so let me put this
back in the middle and let me click on
the halo of a button and you can see
what it does it just makes it an outline
around the Alpha so that's what the halo
alpha button does and you can use that
as an effect if you ever need to in the
time of on and off client comes up with
something like that you may want one
that's inside out so there you go you
can turn down the railing and turn down
like the intensity and stuff like that
so that's what it looks like at a
hundred percent it's pretty much an
outline so there you go that's how you
use the CC light burst effect to create
different effects and now you guys are a
pro at using that effect so thanks for
watching this tutorial I look forward to
seeing you guys in the next one and keep
on lighting stuff up bye bye everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
