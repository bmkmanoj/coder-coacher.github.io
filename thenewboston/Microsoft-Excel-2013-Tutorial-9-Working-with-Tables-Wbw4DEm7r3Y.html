video what I want to do is I want to
cover the rest of the basics about
tables so in the very first tutorial
maybe it was a second one I keep
forgetting but I showed you guys how you
can change the table style in other
words the basic coloring for the table
and that is if you go up here you can
hover over each one that you like and
you can also drop down if you want some
more options but basically whenever you
click one let me find a good one mmm
this is harder than I thought okay this
one right here so whenever you click one
it actually sets your table to that
style now you also have another option
and that is a theme and a theme is kind
of different than a style because a
style is pretty much just the color of
it a theme is other things like font
size and stuff like that so if you go to
the page Layout tab you're going to see
this drop-down right here that says
themes now keep an eye on the table in
the background whenever I hover over
these you can see that the actual font
is changing the font size so that's the
difference between the two I actually
kind of like this one Aion all right
kind of a nice classy look in my help I
want to have to remember that one so
that is how you can change the overall
look and feel of your table now if you
hop back over to the table tools and
designs I'll show you guys some other
really nifty options and the first one
is this header row checkbox so I'm going
to be showing you guys a couple things
in here the header row of course is the
very first row some people like it some
people don't something that is pretty
much appears on your table by default
that I really don't like is this banded
rows so by default it is checked and
again that just means color every other
row to look like bands and I think
unchecking it gives it a little more
professional and cleaner look so I
typically I'm going to have mine
unchecked maybe I have a checked if
they're easier
see how the Toros know I like it this
way
actually you know what for you guys
easier to see whatever and this last one
this filter button of course is the
button that appears on the header now it
not only is just a filter button that's
just what they call it but of course as
we already saw it's the button that
allows you to sort your data as well so
that was incredibly handy so I'm going
to go ahead and leave that one on and of
course you have another slew of options
right here but you guys can figure out
what they are those are the most common
ones and well if you guys ever want to
change it that's where they are now
another thing that I probably should
have point out it point out it pointed
out that's what I meant to say all right
is this so these are your default table
styles but what if you're looking
through these and you're like okay I
want to have a table style that matches
the exact color of my website and I'm
not really finding it right here well
what you could do is you can hover down
to this option new table style and this
allows you to pretty much format a table
style exactly how you want it so you can
say okay so the first column stripe I'm
going to format this to whatever font
border fill just like any other you know
editor that you use before and what you
also want to do is you want to make sure
to give it a descriptive name kind of
like um
Bucky's room website theme or um black
and gold or something like that because
I don't know it's just easier to see
whenever you're looking at all your
styles so if we ever want to create a
custom one there you go so now that we
have time to kind of move on to actually
working with the table well this is kind
of how I wanted to break up the story I
wanted to show you guys how to style the
table make everything look pretty and
then um kind of show you guys the
options of everything so now I want to
show you guys had actually move it
around within your spreadsheet so the
first thing that a lot of people have
problems with is how to select your
entire table now of course you can do
this let's scroll down
on the phone you know what as a pain in
the butt already because if it's huge of
course I already already I'm having
problem finding the end of that so then
they go up here now this button right
here this little arrow it selects your
entire spreadsheet not very handy if you
want to just move this table around your
spreadsheet so if you ever want to
select just the table this is what you
can do you can go up and look at my
mouse cursor right here you see how it's
the fat plus sign if you move in the top
left corner you're going to see that it
moves to a right down arrow in other
words in east south or south south east
arrow so click that and what this is
going to do is it's going to select your
table right like that now whenever you
have it selected you can do a couple
things with it you can either just cut
it and move it to anywhere else that you
want or what you can do is you can move
it to a new spreadsheet and I'll show
you guys a really cool way that you can
do that so this little arrow button
whenever you click that it's really only
good if you want to format the data in
your table but as you guys can see we
have a little problem whenever we try to
paste it
um we're leaving all of this stuff
behind which what you know that's kind
of important too so how do we select
that well I'll show you guys a real cool
way click any cell within your table and
hit ctrl a and that's going to select
exactly what was selected before and now
hit ctrl a again now as you can see not
only did it select the data within the
table but also the headers itself so
again that was ctrl a select it twice or
excuse me
hit ctrl a twice and it's going to
select your entire table so now you can
do something like I don't know just cut
it and let's say you want to do
something like move it to a new
spreadsheet boom look at that
now the one other thing that I want to
point out is this
let me just undo that and deselect it
what if actually let me scroll out it
will probably be a little bit easier all
right too much all right there you go so
I want to show you guys a real quick way
to move around your table or not move
around your table just move your table
without having to copy it or cut it what
you can do is you can actually take your
mouse and you can move it until it gets
to the border any border actually it
doesn't matter if it's the left one or
the top one and look what happens
I go from the fat plus sign I almost
want to call it the Red Cross it's like
it kind of looks like the Red Cross logo
but it's all white so I'll call this the
white cross from now on that's my that's
my own version of the symbol they're
actually probably is a name for if
anyone knows leave a comment below but
check this out it goes from the white
cross to the four directional arrows now
what this means is move around so
whenever I get those four directional
arrows I can just go ahead click and
drag and check it out so again white
cross move it to a border to get those
four directional arrows and move it
around pretty stinkin sweet so those are
a bunch of different ways that you can
select the data within your table select
the entire table or move the table by
dragging and dropping really easily so
thank you guys for watching arm well
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
