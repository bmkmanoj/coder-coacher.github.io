tutorial in this tutorial I'm going to
be talking you guys about the last loop
I promises the last one it's called the
for loop now what this allows you to do
is execute a certain condition as many
times as you want and it's easier just
to see so let me just go ahead and
explain you guys what I'm doing
the first syntax you need is called the
for and then in your parentheses you
have 3 what they're called parameters in
the first one you initialize the
variable so let's just have number we'll
set it equal to num and we'll set it
equal to 1 this is what you set your
variable equal to and first one next add
a semicolon and then you set what is
called a condition for your variable so
we're going to say when variable num is
less than or equal to 5
and of course as your semicolon and then
the last parameter is what you want it
to increment by so we're going to say
take the number our variable and
increment it by 1 every time so now I
have a variable equal to 1 and we say
every time it's less than or equal to 5
add 1 so this means whatever process
we're going to take next it's going to
go through it five times so let's go
ahead and type a process in use your
curly braces and the process we want it
to do is echo the statement hello world
and then we're just going to add a line
break so it actually goes on to the next
line just easier to read so now we said
for this variable that you're going to
execute five times we want you each time
to echo hello world so let's save this
take a look at what it looks like as you
can see it executed hello world five
times and you can change this by
changing any of these parameters right
here and that's how you get a certain
condition to execute a certain number of
times
using PHP Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
