show you how to find or search for
specific documents based on whatever
criteria you want to use so say it first
what we wanted to do is we wanted to get
all the gold leaves from the team well
what we do is call DB players and on our
collection before we learn about this
function called find now find you use
whenever you're trying to select that up
and a since we just left this blank by
default it's going to return every
single document in your collection in
other words every single player now if
you only want to search for specific
players such as the goalies we need to
do is you need to throw in some search
criteria so in your curly braces you're
going to want to give it a name value
pair or a key value pair so I'll say
position goalie and if you run this it's
going to give us back to goalies scroll
down here marc-andre Fleury and thomas
grace so this is going to return all the
goalies for your team and if you just
run or return one goalie then you use
find one and it's going to give you the
first one which was marc-andre Fleury
now if you want to get more specific so
say for example you wanted to search all
players who were on defenseman and they
were 21 so maybe you're looking for the
next hot young defenseman I don't mean
hot like their cue I mean like they're
the hottest thing to come up since
Sidney Crosby who is the best player in
the world by the way so what you do is
before got all my crap messed up now so
you'd use position
defensemen and you can also include
another piece of search criteria by
separating it with a comma so age 21 the
numbers don't go inside quotation marks
and search and you can actually prettify
that be a little bit easier to read all
right so now as you can see we found one
defenseman Derick Pouliot who is 21 and
of course a defenseman now if you ever
want to search based on or criteria for
example if you wanted to say give me
everyone who plays left-wing or
right-wing this is what you would do
DB players find now inside here you'd
have an object and anytime you see the
dollar sign that means that it means
something special to Mongo all the like
special keywords are preceded by a
dollar sign so you would say or and that
just tells it you're going to use some
or criteria now inside an array just
like before throw in whatever criteria
that you want so position what would you
say left wings yeah let me just copy
this because I'm lazy and right wing and
you need to separate all of your
criteria with commas so this is going to
do whenever we run it is it's going to
return all players who play either right
wing or left wing so say that you wanted
to find all the players who were greater
than 30 I know maybe the general manager
said to cut all the players who are
getting too old so what you would do in
that case is called DB players find in
as your search criteria you would want
to search based on their age and as the
value what your object would be is this
the keyword for Mongo is GT which means
greater than and then type in some
values such as 30 now me organized this
way guys
see a little bit better now there's also
some other search clauses LT is less
than you can also have LTE or GTE
which means greater than or equal to 30
and there's also a last one called NE
and this route return all players not
equal to 30 so everyone except the ones
that were 30 years old however we just
want the ones who are greater than 30 so
if I run this this is pretty much going
to give me all of my old players so I
don't know if I do you guys saw that but
as you can see there are all older than
30 now we already know that whenever you
want to do something like search for um
all the players on a team who are
centers then what we would do is we
would just use position center and run
that but check it out it's giving us all
this information right here and most of
the time you don't want every single bit
of information inside your document say
that we only wanted their name well all
of a Sud be kind of a waste it would not
only take up more time but say that you
know we only had limited memory it would
waste all of our memory not very
efficient so what we do in that instance
is we would actually add a one more
parameter inside find now inside this
object what we could do is we could say
what data do we want to return well we
would say name one and anytime you have
a one after it means return this this is
true now another thing I want to point
out is whenever you're searching for
documents it's always going to return
this object ID by default so you have to
actually explicitly say that ID I don't
want to return so this pretty much gives
you the same results before you're
always going to find all the center's
but now you're saying just return the
name and not the object ID
I think I messed something up there all
right so run this you check it out
actually let me clear that so you guys
can see a little bit easier all right so
now it finds all the centers but it
returns only their name I'll show you
guys what I was talking about before
if you don't explicitly say not return
the object ID then it's going to return
the object ID in your results so just
some other things real quick let me
alright so right now we're returning all
the center's and just their name really
simple but say that we only wanted to
return arm three of them instead of like
all of them maybe we had like a hundred
in the league we only wanted three all
it would do is we would tack on another
method called limit three or whatever
number you want it to return and this
order turn the first three now you could
also instead of limit there's another
cool function called skip and what this
does is it skips the first couple of
results so if we skip the first two
obviously the first two are Cindy cross
me in Mex little they say cross me
Sidney Crosby and Maxim Lapierre it
would skip those two so it would start
with afghani Milken I'm going to turn
the way turn can't talk today return the
rest kind of a tongue twister so again
anytime you want to limit the results
use limit anytime you want to skip over
the first couple of results use skip so
a lot of information I blasted in your
guys's head but yeah thanks for watching
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
