squaring binomials and the reason we
learn how to square binomials after we
learn how to foil is because that is how
you that's the same way we're going to
go about squaring this binomial so a lot
of people when they see this a plus B
squared they would write a squared plus
B squared well this does not equal that
because this is saying a plus B times a
plus B and when we foil this out we get
a squared plus outer a times B a B plus
in our B a plus B squared so you get a
squared plus 2 a B plus B squared and as
you can see this is not the same thing
as a squared plus B squared so you have
to make sure that you foil it out every
time you square binomial so now we're
going to do a couple examples so this is
the same thing as this times this so
we're going to multiply the first 225 B
is squared then we're going to multiply
that out sides so 10 B the insides 10 B
and the outsides so 25 B squared plus 20
B plus 4 so now the shortcut to this is
knowing that this is that you're
squaring a binomial you can go back to
this formula right here and just follow
this step so you square the first term
so 25 B squared
you multiply that these two together and
you get 10 B
and then you multiply it by 2 you get 20
B and then you square this last term and
you get 4 so if you can remember the
shortcut it will save you a little time
but if you can't then just foil it out
like you would boil out a normal
binomial so this time we're going to do
this one using the shortcut so we're
going to square the first term 2 times
these two terms multiplied 7 a plus 2 B
and square the last term now I put these
two in parentheses so that we remember
that we can't just square the a we have
to square the 7 as well so this becomes
49 a squared plus 7 that should be
multiplication 7 8 times 12 B is set is
14 a B times 2 is 20 a B plus 2 squared
is 4 B squared which is just B squared
so that's how you square a binomial so
that's all we're doing the squaring
binomials today but make sure you come
back and check out our next lesson where
we're gonna use all of our knowledge of
multiple multiplying and adding and
subtracting binomials and polynomials to
solve polynomial or create equations so
make sure you come back and check that
out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
