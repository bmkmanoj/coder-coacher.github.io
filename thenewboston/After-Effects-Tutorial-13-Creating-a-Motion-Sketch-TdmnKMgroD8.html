Effects tutorial and in this tutorial
I'm going to be teaching you guys how to
make a motion sketch now what a motion
sketch was or is is actually a path that
you draw by hand that you want your
object to follow and the benefits of
doing this over what we learned before
is it gives you a lot more control and
lets you be a lot more detailed with
your objects animation so to do this I'm
just going to show you guys how to do it
rather than talking about it go ahead
and go up to window and click motion
sketch right here if it's already have a
checkbox next to it then you don't click
it make sure you have your motion sketch
panel open then go ahead and find your
panel wherever open and make sure your
presets are at 101 and wireframe now
once you click start capture your mouse
is going to turn into a little crosshair
this means that you're ready to animate
and start drawing your motion sketch so
go ahead and click start capture click
on your object and start drawing your
motion sketch as you can see you now
have made a bunch of keyframes that you
want your object to follow so go ahead
and click spacebar and as you can see
charlie Chupacabra is following my
motion sketch that I just made now as
you can see this is a lot easier way if
you want to have a detailed motion
sketch that you can um make it and it's
a lot easier than making all these
keyframes one by one but the first thing
you probably notice is like the massive
amount of keyframes on this line now
while this gives you a lot of control it
is very hard to animate if you wanted to
animate one of these keyframes it's
going to be a pain in the butt so to get
rid of these keyframes there are two
different ways that you can make a
smoother path so let's go ahead in the
first way that I want to show you is
actually um is by opening something
called the smoother so go up to the
window go down to this tool called this
smoother and once you have your pass
selected go ahead and raise this
tolerance depending on how many
keyframes you want the higher the
tolerance the less keyframes you're
going to have in the easier your paths
going to be able to work with so raise
your tolerance and click app I'll apply
and as you can see all those keyframes
turn into just a couple keyframes so
that's one way of using the smoother to
give you less keyframes and also on your
motion sketch another way that you can
do that is let me go ahead and make a
whole new one another way that you can
do that is actually by changing the
smoothing before you make your sketch at
all now be careful when you do this
because when you do it this way you
can't go back and change it you have to
change it the other way so once you're
sure that you want to change is
smoothing before you can change it and
then you can make a whole new motion
path now you see in this time it has
about only 1% of the keyframes that it
did last time so again this motion path
would be clearly a lot easier to to move
around if we decided to change something
so that is how you make a motion sketch
and it gives you a lot more control than
if you were just to make keyframes one
by one and it's a lot quicker so I make
sure you learn how to use a motion
sketch make sure you know how to use
this smoother to make less keyframes and
the easier editing and once you learn
all that you can move onto my next
tutorial so thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
