Effects cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and in
this tutorial I want to show you how to
add more effects to your to your
existing effects on top of like your
images or your different layers so when
you put in certain effects so I'll just
throw an effect on that I know has this
on there it come most of most of them
come with like an effect property called
blend with original and what that does
is pretty much blends it with what the
original image you used to be so this is
the original image and then this is that
the original image like taking
completely out of it and just the effect
on there so a lot of the some I mean
some of the effects don't have this on
there and what I'm talking about
like in effect like the fast blur that I
always use that doesn't have blend with
original on there as you can see here so
when I try to blur this there's no way I
can like blend this in with the original
effect and this X up here isn't wasn't
originally on the picture that I picked
out but I put it on there because that
word was not needed in the in the
picture and whatever this thing is here
this picture so that's not gonna be
affected just so you know so the way we
want to add that up when was original in
there we're gonna use an effect called
CC composite so CC and then I type in
another C it's gonna be right here
called CC composite we're gonna put that
underneath whatever effect that we're
doing on our layer so if I blur this up
to like something like this you can see
it's being blurred the pictures being
blurred now I have the opacity here and
I can move that back and forth to blend
more with the image
now let's put this repeat edge pixels on
so it actually doesn't blur thee at just
the edges so it doesn't look like I'm
lying but this is what I'm talking about
you can use this and effect now to
composite on top now the good thing
about composite CC composite is that
we've got the different blending modes
on here also so if we wanted to
composite behind now for this effect is
the composite behind doesn't work in
front does however so and then we can
use something like I'm maybe screen and
then or something like that you can
throw a blending mode in there on it and
lower this opacity to blend with
original for effects that don't have it
so that's pretty much a quick tip on how
to use CC composite and make sure that
it's underneath the effects that you
want to use so if you put it in between
effects it's just gonna work on the
effect that's above it so that's it for
what I wanted to show you thanks for
watching this quick tip and I'm gonna be
creating some of these quick tips on the
some of these effects so you can know
how to use them in it and add them into
your workflow now thanks for watching
again which I already just said like two
seconds ago but I'm really thankful this
time so see you guys later have a good
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
