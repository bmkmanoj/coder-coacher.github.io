welcome to your second walk through kind
of gameplay video of left 4 dead 2 and
this is 3 section and this is a section
where you go through the median
obviously and one thing you need to know
it up don't get tangled up in those
trees right there because it's kind of
hard to see around you when you're in
those trees so try to get out of them as
soon as possible and yeah make sure you
take care of that hunter and kill these
people and now once you're done killing
all these people let me grab these pills
real quick and hopefully there are some
claritin d because my nose is kind of
stuffy right now but anyways once you're
done make sure you got your teammate
with you and if you have a bio bomb when
you climb on top of this and now is a
wonderful time you use one just toss it
down there and just unload because a ton
of zombies will come but not just go
ahead and stand on here with the rest of
your teammate and start shooting people
to clear it out in evidently or not
evidently um if I can say obviously
maybe I don't know you're going to
eventually need to walk over to the
stairs right there so go ahead and clear
a path over there make sure again that
you have your teammates with you and you
don't want to shoot that really and
definitely and don't want to walk in
that so go ahead and yet bang bang him
in the head I was gonna say bang him but
you know I definitely don't say that and
grab one of these up late bombs a pipe
bomb is my favorite bomb in this is
definitely going to come in handy in
about probably a minute once we get the
next area so you can shoot that in a
cosmic fire middlebourne who's ever in
there so yeah now I just gotta wait
because I shot that now not the
brightest idea but I did it because you
know I can't help myself so are
I hear something and I don't like it so
now that that clear is often here go
ahead and kill this little guy right
here and now I got a charger right here
that we need to kill so yeah just shoot
him until he dies hopefully he doesn't
charge it first and kill this boomer so
he explodes all over and now let me wait
hour and a half for my gun reload and
climb up these steps and now we get to a
location where we can unload or exhuming
load up get new guns this is my favorite
gun right here here a tactical shotgun
and let me use my health pack so i can
just grab another one real quick so let
me hear myself and open this and very no
health pack so i just wasted that one
that's very cool just pills and i
already have filled so that was a
complete waste make sure not to do that
and now this is where you want to use
your pipe bomb with all these instead of
trying to shoot them and get her just
toss your pipe down pipe bomb down and
now you see that they all run to it and
now look they all explode so for some
reason these infected are attracted to
pipe bombs not one of the better
qualities that they were adult when
developing this disease but you know
it's a quality that they have so might
as well take advantage of it and let me
grab this multi of cocktail right here
that might come in handy if i want to
burn any zombies but yeah with a bio
bomb or um really any bomb it's good to
throw down right there because then you
don't have to fight all of them and you
know you don't get injured don't have to
waste your bullets and you know it's
pretty cool watching a bunch of zombies
blow up so imma kill these before we put
him in him and I probably want to switch
over to this bio right here because
these molds off cocktails aren't the
easiest thing to use so I mean you can
use this bio chemistry I just popped up
whenever you want to attract a huge
horde and this is yeah probably
should've walked right in that and
whenever you got a huge horde and you
want to distract them you can just throw
this bio bomb down
and pretty much just start raining
bullets in the middle of the pile and
it's like a mosh pit of zombies and you
can just rain billets so thank you
