am playing another team deathmatch game
on us would not not sub-base derail and
I am using a famas with no attachments
here first blood
second blood oh that's that's not fair I
got shot in the back anyway um I'm using
the FAMAS this game scavenger stopping
power and ninja as I said before it as I
said before is team deathmatch and how
are we losing right now I don't get that
I don't get how that's possible anyway I
get that guy back and I still don't get
how is it took four shots to kill that
guy even though Billy shot him three
times even if one was through a wall
ability I'm using if the moss here
because as you probably saw in the last
game I was using this car I didn't feel
like using and just decided to use
different weapons or maybe it was
because I wanted to get attachments
either or anyway um in this game mostly
I was just running around the map pretty
much the same skills being set up as the
last game you can get down go die see a
claymore right here it definitely tells
me there's a guy up there most likely
sniping yes
a double-kill kind of epic film trying
to blow up that claim more than the guy
so it didn't matter let's see
I get yes I get that double kill gets me
my Harriers which I put pretty much
right next to myself Renaissance man
and that part right there was extremely
lucky that guy epic failed and of course
I oh how I died
90% of the time is being shuffled back
don't know why that that's just why now
that's just why and or how I died
you can ask anybody I play with any of
my friends too ac-130 that's pretty rare
let's see I take out this ec130 and I
start and I start doing some work simply
put they all just get a nicely like
annihilated and with my Harrier it's not
that much not top health not much help
to them so yeah
that's what you can see that's what you
see that's what happens when you blow up
people's hair to get hit by an ac-130
you get hit by God knows how big that
shell is on a c-130 and that's just what
happens see here I don't get how I don't
not sure if the guys were inside I'm not
sure how I didn't get that guy but
anyway I'm already 21 and to win this
game if you can believe sure I got an
ac-130 but so what
they c-130s is still awesome even if I
got it I'd probably still do just as
good in the let's see what am i doing
now yeah I think kill steal see you can
go down you can go die come on people at
this point I'm just kind of looking
around
just looking around at this one area
because I know that their spawn they're
pretty much just like spawning there and
as I died again
I get guess what sniped that seems to be
my two main ways of dying don't know why
it just is
snipers you just can't see them this
might be a little bit hypocritical but I
really hate snipers even though I'm
really good at sniping with Americans
you know I really really hate snipers I
just really don't know why but I just
honest-to-god hate snipers okay that's
right keep that right there I don't get
put a full burst into him and he still
doesn't die oh he knifed me debatable
it's debatable anyway uh I'm not sure if
the spawns changed yet in this game but
I'm pretty sure they do at some point
and I get that guy and let's see what's
happening here not much
yeah I'm pretty sure at this point at
this point in the game the spawns
changed so or people are everybody on my
team was just pretty much just like
trying to run around and pretty much
just do the exact same thing that we
were doing like 30 seconds ago okay all
thankful to that UAV I thought there was
a guy coming up here and I think I start
either get these go no I get I jump down
I get these guys right here yep jump
down I get this guy right here and he
had martyrdom all and thankfully he did
not kill and my splashed both gets me a
chill past 12 definitely the best
shotgun in the game and right here I'm
about to get my second Harrier I think
where the game ends
or at least they get yep my second
hairier boy no here's when I get my
second hairier maybe anyway yeah
whatever
I got shot in the back as I said before
that's just what happens he shot the
back doesn't help at all stop father
okay well I'm looking around the games
about to end
get one guy and then right here I guess
da da da the game winning kill okay so a
pretty good game for that I got it see
ya that's me my awesomeness in the game
when he killed with mindful moss and
let's see how this goes and an overall
score of 33 and five what that's pretty
much it I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
