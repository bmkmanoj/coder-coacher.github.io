PHP tutorial and in this tutorial we're
going to be finally making a PHP file to
connect to MySQL so before we even get
started right in our PHP script in
notepad go ahead and add your user Bucky
or whatever you called it to the
database game so go ahead and click Add
give it all privileges and make changes
what this is going to allow is the user
Bucky to alter the database game so go
back and now we're as you can see the
database now has the user
Bucky in it so let's go ahead and
minimize this and open up notepad I
already got it open so before we get
started I'm going to tell you guys that
you're going to need some information
that you should have had written down
your user to the database your password
to the database - password in your
database name now once you have all that
you can finally start making your
connection file so let's get started
make sure my cursor is in the right
place there we go
so go ahead and put your PHP outline
tags now I'm going to go ahead and save
this is a PHP file right now save as a
connection file and save it as a PHP
make sure it's on my desktop and we are
good to go so now it's saved as a PHP
let's go ahead and start connecting the
first thing that we're going to want to
do is open a connection between this
website and MySQL so to do that we need
um we need to make a variable that's
going to have the my SQL connect
so let's go ahead and type a comment
real quick and right opens connection to
my SQL Server now if you don't know what
this means it's just a comment has no
effect on the coding at all you can
actually write whatever you want here
and it's not going to matter at all but
for the sake of not forgetting and
organizing especially when you're
working with these it's a helpful to add
comments whenever you need them so let's
go ahead and make a variable called DBC
and this is going to be database connect
in you need variable because it's easier
and I'll show you why now what this
variable what this variables value is
going to be is a connection so type in
my SQL underscore connect in this I'm
not making this up you can't change this
this is built-in to PHP to connect to
your MySQL databases so make sure you
type that in exactly as I did now go
ahead and add your parameters and inside
your parameters you're going to have
three values and they need to be in this
order so pay attention your first value
is going to be where your server is 99%
of time it's going to be a local host
unless you're using a host that's
different than your domain name which is
just crazy
so to always type in localhost because
it's right on your server the next piece
of information is the username this is
username to your database and mine is
the new beau uh nurse under slash Bucky
and make sure you have this typed in
exactly as it is and make sure these are
in single quotation marks too and the
last but not least is the password that
you want and mine is password don't tell
anybody I don't know who could figure
that out and I will be changing this
after
I upload it so no one tries the hack on
my site so now that we have a variable
anytime we call this variable it's going
to connect us to our database using a
song here's what it's going to do it's
going to run through all these make sure
your username and password is correct
and then if it is then it's going to
connect you so let's go ahead on the
next line and make a simple if statement
let's say if the variable database
connect so what this is pretty much
saying all right if the database isn't
connected then what we're going to want
to do is kill it make it die and this is
means end it it's your means and the
script and we're going to make it die
and we're going to want it to say not
connected and if we want to get fancy
we can also add my SQL error and add
another empty parameter close it off
alright my parameters are good and also
add your ending : so right now we're
going to say all right connect to MySQL
if it can't connect for some reason then
end the script no use continuing and
tell us why it's not going to connect so
now we have a basic connection to our
server and in my next tutorial I'm going
to show you how to connect to the
database so right now it's going to
connect but it's going to say alright
what database do you want and that is
for the next tutorial but right now I'm
running
out of time so study this make sure you
write your variable make sure you
connect and make sure that all of these
are typed right how you want them and
pay attention and once you get this move
on to my next tutorial thanks for
