solving word problems using equations so
what's gonna happen is we're gonna get a
statement that describes a situation in
words and what we're gonna have to do is
create an equation that represents that
sentence in order to find out what a
number is so for this first one it says
the sum of twice a number and 21 is 83
so we're gonna take this piece by piece
in order to set up an equation so this
sum means we're gonna be adding two
things together so what we're going to
be adding is twice a number
oops and the number 21 so when it says
twice a number
it's hinting at a certain operation and
it's hinting at multiplication so twice
a number would mean two times a number
and we're gonna use and and you always
have to write what your variable
represents so n is a number so twice a
number two N and it says here the sum so
sum means addition so we're gonna be
adding 2n plus 21 and it says is 83 well
in math is means equals
so when we say that it is 23 it means
that this equation equals 83 so now
we're going to solve it like any normal
equation and what most people find is
that setting up the equation is the
hardest part because once you go once
you do that you can solve it like you
would solve any other equation so we're
gonna subtract 21 from both sides you
get 2 n is equal to 62 divided by 2 and
n is equal to 31 now the tricky thing
about word problems is you always have
to make sure you solve the equation
correctly and answer the problem so this
one just tells us to find the number but
sometimes the word problem is going to
ask us for something different and we
have to make sure we are answering the
problem completely so we're gonna do a
couple more examples 6 times the number
increased by 3 is 27
find the number so 6 times a number so n
is gonna be our number again and is a
number so 6 times the number 6 and
increased by 3 now increased is another
word used for addition so if we increase
this by 3 we're going to add 3 to this
and once again we have is which means
equals so equals 27 when I subtract 3
over when we get 6 and equals 24 divided
by 6 and equals 4 and once again it says
find the number so this is our final
answer we can stop there
so we have one more problem we're gonna
do four-fifths of the class went to the
zoo if 64 kids went to the zoo how many
kids are in the class so this one's a
little more complicated and we're what
we're gonna use is we're gonna use C to
represent the class so we're gonna take
so since four-fifths of the class of
always is gonna signify multiplication
because you're saying we have this many
of something else so in order to find
out how much we have we're gonna take
the fraction times the number so we have
four-fifths of the class which we're
gonna write as C went to the zoo and we
know that four-fifths of the class is 64
because it says 64 kids went to the zoo
so now we're gonna multiply both sides
by 5/4 this is gonna get a C we can
reduce by fours this becomes 1 this
become this becomes 16 and 16 times 5 is
equal to 80 so if you set it up this way
and make sure you put units and that
means 80 kids so if you set it up this
way you're gonna get your final answer
and since they want to know how many
kids went to the car in the class and
this tells us how big our class is
that's how we know we completely
answered the problem but I'm going to
show you another way to set it up and if
you set it up this way you have to do an
extra step to make sure you answer the
problem completely
so you remember when a while ago we
talked about proportions well if we were
to write this as a performer portion it
would be 4/5 is equal and since this is
the smaller number and this is the total
we're gonna put 64 over X and if we
cross multiply we're gonna get 4x is
equal to 64 times 5 and X is gonna give
you if you plug that into a calculator X
will also give you 80 so see how we we
had to do this extra step right here but
you always want to make sure you answer
the question completely using the
correct units so that's all we're gonna
do with word problems today but make
sure you come back and watch your next
video where we're gonna talk about
inequalities</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
