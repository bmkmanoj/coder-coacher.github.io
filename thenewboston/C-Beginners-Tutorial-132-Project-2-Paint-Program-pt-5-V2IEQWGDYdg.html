thirty second c-sharp tutorial and in
this tutorial we're gonna continue
working on our paint application and in
this tutorial we're going to basically
be drawing images onto our panel using
the graphics class so we're going to
basically allow the user to drag images
onto our panel and then when they drag
them onto our panel we'll have it draw
onto our panel
so first thing that we're gonna want to
do is allow drop or set the allow drop
property equal the truths that we can
accept information about file or the
image to be exact that the user drags on
to our panel and then we're going to
have to go and create a new event
handler for when you either drag
something onto or over our panels so
that we can make it appear as though
that they can drop something so let's go
over to the events over here and go over
to drag enter and just stop okay alright
and then we're just gonna want to set e
which is this data or drag of men tarde
we're just going to set the effect these
will to drag drop affects all like I
said before that will basically just
make it appear as though you can drop
something on there and the next thing
that we're gonna want to do is create an
event handler for the user actually
drops those images onto the panel so
that we can draw them but before we can
draw them we have to get into pass to
all of the images that few drops onto
the panel and we're gonna have store
that information into a string or a
image and sub that equal to e or our
drag event our data and then you get
data method to retrieve information
about the files that the user has
dropped on to up and if basically just
calls for a string format and we're
going to be using data formats class to
access the file drop format so we don't
have to memorize and this get data
method returns an object so we're gonna
have to cast that into a string array so
string array right here and that will
just basically convert this object that
the user
I mean it's dip data method returns into
a string array so now this image path
variable basically this holds the paths
to every image that you have drops onto
the panel and we're basically just going
to be looping through all of those paths
and drawing those images on to our panel
so we're gonna say for you string tap-in
image paths and then we're just going to
draw on to our panel so we're going to
be using Ichi for our graphics and then
you draw any method to draw the image
onto our backs and the first parameter
that does draw image method calls for is
an image to draw and that's just
basically going to be imaged that the
path is to so we're going to be using an
image class from file method to get the
image from the file or from the path and
now we're just going to pass the path do
this from file method to get it so that
in the next parameter that this draw
image method calls poi is a point on our
panel that we want it to draw and we're
just going to have a draw on our add to
zero zero so it'll basically be in the
upper left-hand corner so now I'll need
to bug here and drag an image on to our
panel
it should draw it at 0 0 basically just
up into this upper left hand corner so
now we just drag this person image on
there and as you can see it appears as
though we can drop it and when we drop
it it'll just draw it into the upper
left hand corner and now that it's on
our panel we can use all of our drawing
tools that you've created to draw on
this image so we just wanted to say draw
eyes on this guy we could do that
eyes a mouth whatever so yeah that's
pretty much it for this tutorial so see
you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
