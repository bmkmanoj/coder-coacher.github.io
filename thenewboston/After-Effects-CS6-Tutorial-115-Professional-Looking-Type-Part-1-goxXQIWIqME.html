After Effects tutorial my name is buddy
Blackford and today I want to go over
some typography rules so you guys know
how what to do and what not to do when
you are creating your text so you may
new know how to use the text tool and
everything in After Effects but when you
started creating your stuff it looks
unprofessional and people say it sucks
when you try to have them critique it
and you get all mad and can't figure out
what's going on so I'm gonna give you
some basic rules to follow
so you don't have to deal with that and
you already know what's happening when
you sometimes when you give your first
rendition of what you're making to your
client and he sees that it looks
unprofessional and your typography is
all messed up sometimes they don't even
respond back to you and that's happened
to me before when I first started out
and I didn't know why and then I figured
out because my stuff looked
unprofessional so he didn't even bother
and then you don't get paid and you
waste your time so let's start out what
I'm gonna do is have the incorrect way
for you to have your paragraph or type
typed out here and then at the bottom
I'm going to have the correct way I am
going to pause the video at times so you
don't have to watch me type and I'll
have everything just typed up the
correct way and the incorrect way to
show you what's good and what's not good
so I'm gonna pause now and I'm gonna
type in the correct way actually the
first thing I wanted to tell you is the
definition of typography in case you
were like what the hell is he talking
about
so typography is and I'm reading this
off Wikipedia is the art and technique
of arranging type in order to make the
language it forms most appealing to
transparent learning and recognition so
basically what it means is making your
text look cool and appealing so the
first thing that we want to go
/ is having too many typefaces so I'm
gonna type out that stuff now and then
come back so see you in a second alright
so as I said having too many typefaces
looks bad so what I've got up here on
the top I've got a certain text and then
I've got another text that has a
typeface that's too too big and then
I've got a different font here and then
here's another font I hope you guys know
what that one is please don't use that
one and and then we're going on through
more different fonts going on here and
you can tell that does not look
professional at all so you want to just
stick with one or two fonts and these
are the same font and they're in the
same font family so what I've got on
this one is myriad Pro and the top
section here is a bold condensed and
then I'm down here and I've got regular
and that's what everything else is and
in the paragraph so this looks this is
correct and this is incorrect so the
next one I want to go over is spacing
this is a rule where you don't want to
crowd your text too much it's hard to
read and I mean when you first look at
it it's like kind of daunting for
everybody you also don't want to space
out your text too much because then it
just looks like the words aren't like in
a sentence together if you can
understand that so the correct way is to
adjust your spacing so it's in a
visually appealing way if you have a lot
of stuff in your text and you can't fit
it onto your page you just want to maybe
like select a condensed font or just
shrink shrink it down inside a font or
size
that way you're not like everything has
I'm like breathing room I guess
and don't limit it to just your taxi you
also don't want to have it like right up
against the edge of the page you want to
give yourself some room so it looks nice
nicely spaced the next rule I wanted to
go over with you guys is don't use too
many fancy decorative fonts so I mean
you found one that looks cool and you're
using it but don't overdo it
if you look at this real quick can you
read it in like a second and figure out
what's going on or is this really really
hard to read now if you really needed to
use a fancy font limit your use like in
the correct way here and just make sure
that you're not blasting out all caps
and all that stuff so just pretty much
just limit the use of your fancy fonts
they don't need to be used on everything
the next rule that I want to go over is
readability so you want to make sure
that people can easily read what's going
on and it does not hurt their eyes so
you don't want dark text on top of a
dark background you also don't want like
small font on top of a high contrasted
background so it's gonna be like hard on
someone's eyes so if you when you look
at this one here it seems to be like
giving you like flashing like in your
eyes it's weird looking and I hate it so
be careful of going across an item in
the background make sure it looks nice
on the eyes and be aware of your colors
that are in the background and make sure
that they are like a good color palette
so you can figure out what it looks good
together I mean obviously this does not
look good together when you're working
with a color and all
just fix these up real quick I have this
locked let's just make this like red
bright red and the text we can make that
like here's a typical thing that people
used to do back in the day when we made
our like when people are making their
websites and I can make this bigger
almost done sorry so here we got some
really bright text on to a really bright
background and this hurts people's eyes
also and to be honest sometimes just
black and white for your text is the
best because it's not like so crazy
bright if you're gonna use color I
always suggest not having it at full
blast
so desaturated it a little bit and I'll
show you what I'm talking about here if
I go to my color picker here the color
isn't blasted all the way to the end and
it's not all the way up to the brightest
and it's not down here to the darkest so
it's in the middle and it's not like
touching the edge of your color picker
