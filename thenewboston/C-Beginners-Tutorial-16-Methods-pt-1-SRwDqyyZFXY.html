tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to use methods so all
you need for this tutorial is a button
and once you have it on your form just
go ahead and double click on it alright
so a method is basically any block of
code that you're going to want to use
more than once so and buy a block of
code I mean any code inside of these two
curly braces right here so the code
inside of here is considered a block of
code so the first step in creating your
method is going outside of this method
right here you still one can enter and
go outside of here and then you're just
going to want to type void and we're
going to be getting into having
different things here but right now just
type void and then you're going to want
to give a name to your method I'm just
going to call it message because we're
just going to have a message box show
inside of here all right and after you
type the name of your method just type
two empty parentheses and later we're
going to get into actually having things
inside of here but right now to set two
empty parentheses after the name of your
method and then of course we're going to
want to have the two curly braces and
inside of here is basically the code you
want to happen and user calls and this
method and you may have those
parentheses there okay and like I said
we're does not have a message box show
inside of here so just a message box dot
show and I'm just going to make it say
hello
all right now in order to access this
code we're still want to go up to under
a button one click and type message and
put two parentheses after it and then of
course end the line so basically what
it's going to do when user clicks this
button is it's going to see message
right here and it's going to want to
look for a method with a name of message
so it's going to go down here and see
this method says message right there and
then it's going to execute the code
inside of this block right here so it's
going to do message box that show hello
so now maybe bug you should get a
message box that says hello yep perfect
and the cool thing about methods is you
can call this as many times as you want
from different locations and by call I
mean just
use it so if you're going to have
another button right here also copy it
and when the user clicks on button - if
you wanted the same code to be executed
we could just call that message method
right there so now when user clicks
button one it's going to go down here
and do this code and then when the user
clicks button - it's going to go here
and do this code as well so no matter
which button you click it's both going
to do the same thing should get yep
hello and you get hello there as well
perfect
all right now what if we wanted the user
to be able to choose what they have in a
message box well what you can do right
here is just put whatever variables you
want to be passed into here so we're
just going to want to have a string to
pass so that will be displayed inside
this message box so we can just say
string message all right so now
basically what we have inside of here is
a string variable to work with and we're
just going to have that be displayed
inside the message box all right so now
whatever I'm string that the user or the
caller wants to be displayed in the
message box would be displayed so
whenever we call this method now we have
to pass through the string that we want
displayed inside of the message box so
we're just going to have it passed
through Adam so now what it's going to
do is it's going to call this message
method it's going to look for this
message method and now it's going to set
this string message variable on equal to
whatever the user passed through so
since I passed through Adam it's going
to say string message equals Adam and
then it's going to display the message
box with Adam inside of it but let's say
down here when the user puts button too
we wanted to display Bob in the message
box so now what it's going to be right
here is call this message method then
it's going to set this string variable
equal to Bob this time and then display
Bob inside of a message box so let me
click button 1 we should get Adam inside
of the message box yep and then we put
fun - we should get Bob inside the
message box yep perfect
all right and what if we want to be
easier to pass through multiple
parameters so you wanted the user to
pass through the title of the message
box well we'll just go ahead put a comma
and say string title
now the caller has the pass through a
message and a title so it's put a comma
right there and then it's vital of your
message box we're just going to make it
say on hello and we're just going to
make it say hello about as well so hello
all right so now it's going to do here
on your button one click is going to
look with this message method so it's
going to go down here and that's going
to say string message equals atom and
then it's going to say string title
equals flow and you want the title the
message box to be the title that the
user passes through so it's going to put
a comma right there and say title
alright so now it's going to say string
title equals hello menaces going to have
the message boxes title be the title of
user passed through which is hello and
then for button twos click it's just
going to say message look for this
message method set this string message
equal to Bob and it's going to set this
string title equal to hello and then
we're going to get a message box that
says Bob inside of it and then it's
going to say hello for the title so
let's just see if this worked here we
get atom inside of it and a low on the
top for button two you get Hello on the
top and Bob inside of it perfect alright
so that's pretty much it for this
tutorial on methods and next tutorial
we're going to get into changing this
alright so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
