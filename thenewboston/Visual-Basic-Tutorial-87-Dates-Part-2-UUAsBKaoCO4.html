slash on live gamer for the new boston
and in this tutorial we're gonna be
talking more about dates now if you
remember in the previous tutorial we
created a date object and set it equal
to the current date and then we just
went ahead and showed that in the
message box now what we can do is we can
extract certain parts of the dates so we
can get the month the day of the year
hours minutes seconds the day of the
week or the day of the years and all of
these are available to us inside of the
date class so let's go ahead and show
some of these so we'll type message box
not show and we'll show the month and we
go ahead go ahead and add current date
dot month and we'll just create a couple
more of these
and we will show the various parts of
the date so we'll just do year
now you can see that these don't have
the little purple boxes here they have a
little box here with a finger pointing
at it and what that means is that it's a
property or a variable so this isn't a
method or this isn't a function like the
two string or too short date string this
just gets values from the object that
we've created so let's go ahead and show
some more stuff here so we can show the
day which will show the the current day
of the month
now we can get the hour and the minute
and the second so let's go ahead and
type that so we'll type our and then we
will add current date dot our and now
what we can do is we can add what's
called environment dot new line now I
may have talked about this in a previous
tutorial but what this does is it takes
this string right here and then when we
add environment dot new line it'll go
down the line for us
now let's go ahead and add some more
stuff so we'll add will do hours minutes
and seconds so minute and we'll go ahead
and add current date dot minute and then
we'll do seconds too so environment dot
new line and we'll go ahead and add
seconds
current date dot second okay so let's go
ahead and fix this right here we do not
need these parameters now what we can do
is we showed the month year the day the
hours the minutes and the seconds now we
can get the day of the week in the day
of the year which is of type integer so
the day of the week is either gonna be 1
through 7 and the day of the year is
going to be either 1 through 365 or 366
for a leap year so we could type message
box not show day of week and we'll go
ahead and add current date dot day of
week now we will show the day of the
year so message box not show day of year
and we will add current date dot day of
year ok so now what we can do is we can
run our program and we it will get all
of these time values so here we have our
long time value which shows the the
month the day of the month the year
hours minutes seconds and p.m. or a.m.
then we get month 5 so it is the fifth
month of the year which is May year 2011
which is of course the year we get the
day which is May 9 we get our 19 and
this goes by the 24 hour time period so
our 19 would be 7 minute is 29 minutes
and second is 18 seconds so 7 29 18
seconds it is the first day of the week
because it is Monday and the day of the
weeks start from Monday in visual visual
basic they do not start from Sunday and
then the day of the year is 129 so I'm
go ahead and put this code in if you are
already have it and once you've used
some day functions gets
values from your date objects and you're
familiar with that go ahead and move on
to the next tutorial and thanks for
