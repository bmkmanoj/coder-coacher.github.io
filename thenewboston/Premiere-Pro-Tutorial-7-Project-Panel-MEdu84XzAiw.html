Premiere Pro tutorial in this story
we're going to be going over the basics
of the project panel now if you didn't
know one of the main panels that you re
working with the most and you were
definitely need is called the project
panel and it's on default docked in the
top left of adobe premiere pro so let's
just find our way around here a little
bit one of the most common tools that
you'll be using in the project panel is
this little tool right here it's called
the new item and what does is when you
click it it gives you a drop-down list
of all the new items that you can make
mostly you want to make a sequence which
is kind of a series of clips a title
which you know what that is a black
video where you see if you click it it's
just a plain black background and that's
used a lot in the backgrounds of titles
when you don't want it to be transparent
and you want to be black instead with a
cash showing up in the title showing up
and stuff and another thing you might
want bottom like very much is just
universal counting later that's the
old-fashioned count down from four three
two one but uh oh I really like that too
much because it uh it's not very new
it's kind of a old thing another thing
that I want to go over in the project
panel is how to expand this panel if you
go to the right and see these two double
arrows and drag it you can see all of
these um characteristics of your clips
as you can see you have name label
framerate uh when it begins and ends the
end points and out points and these can
be useful to different people for
different reasons and because of that
Adobe lets you rearrange these how you
like to rearrange you simply grab onto a
name by left-clicking it as you can see
when you start dragging it highlights
if you just want to move it around move
it between whatever you want and let go
again click it hold on and you could
rearrange your characteristics of your
clip however you want another thing that
you can do is sort the all of the
elements in the project panel according
to how you want more Harry think you're
going to need them as you can see right
now they're sorted by name you can tell
this because there's a little arrow by
name if you just click that one time the
arrow points down and all of the
elements in name are sorted by
descending order again the arrow pointed
up is ascending the arrow pointed down
is ascending and not only can you saw in
my name again sorting by label frame
rate or any of these characteristics
right here even media duration see how
long your clips are but most people
would just go ahead and sword in my name
now besides organizing your clips like
this there is one other very useful
thing that another way that you can
organize your clips and this is called
bins now too now if you didn't know a
bin is pretty much the same thing as a
folder or directory in Windows it's a
place where you can just keep all your
files or clips or anything you actually
want to put on it so to create a new one
just click this little bin symbol and as
you can see you can name it I just name
my new bin and now once you name it you
can go ahead and drag clips or anything
else you want down in it just hold it
and when the bin is highlighted let go
and your clip is automatically in your
new bin so let's move a couple clips in
here and now we have two clips and our
new bin and as you can see we can sort
these easily if we want to minimize them
just click the arrow if we want to show
everything in our bin click our out
arrow and if we ever want to take
anything out of the bin just click it
and drag it out as you can see this is
out of the bin anything that's indented
a little bit is in the bin
anything that's out of it is of course
out of it so let's click that drag it
out and anytime you want to get rid of
bin just right click it and press clear
now make sure everything is out of your
bin when you clear it because if you
have stuff in your bin and clear it
it'll actually get rid of everything in
there so make sure everything's out of
it before we clear it and I hope you

panel and next tutorial we're probably
going to be going over a timeline panel
