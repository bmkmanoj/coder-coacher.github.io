tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial we're going
to begin learning about the I disposable
interface but before we can do that
there are a few things you have to learn
about first so for this tutorial you're
going to need to have a button and
you're also going to have to have a
class with a constructor inside of it
alright so one of the things we have to
learn about before we learn about the I
disposable interface is something called
a destructor
now we already learned about
constructors and constructors are called
whenever you initialize your class so
here you just put some code inside of
our constructor right here saying hi and
the ctor
which is just short for constructor and
then if we were to just initialize our
class or it appears to say my class I'm
speaking new line class then this code
will be executed so pretty simple stuff
we already learned about this so since
we just initialize our class right here
yeah we get a message box saying I'm a
constructor since um we have a message
box inside of the constructed alright so
I'm still thrown about D structures
though now D structures are called
whenever your object is destroyed and by
destroyed I mean all the information
inside of it is just deleted and wiped
from your computer so there are only two
times when this can happen and the first
time in this is whenever your
application closes so in order to create
a destructor you're just going to want
to hold shift and go above your tab key
and just press that button and it'll
make a little squiggly sign and then
you're just going to want to type the
name of your class so my class and then
you're just going to want to have to
empty on parenthesis and in your
destructor you cannot have any
parameters for your destructor you
cannot provide a return type and you
cannot put a access modifier on it or
anything like that
you can't overload it so this is all you
get right there all right and then we're
have some code happen inside of our
destructor so I'll just say all right
Here I am
the structur alright and I think I
spelled it right but that's okay okay so
this code will only happen when our
application closes so now when we click
this button right here let's create a
new instance of our class and call the
code inside of the constructor yep I'm a
constructor now we don't get this code
from the destructor yet since our
application is still running but if we
close it we get that code I am a
destructor and just closes right up
alright and there's one other time where
you can dispose of your object and
that's if you call the dispose method
and the only way that you can have the
dispose method is if you inherit from
the I disposable interface and we're not
going to get into that in this tutorial
that's actually what we're going to do
in the next tutorial but remember back
when we use the binary reader and binary
writer class there was a method inside
of there called dispose and dispose
we'll basically just delete everything
um that has to do with that object off
your computer so it's not even there
anymore so here just create a new
taxable to do system dot IO binary
reader BR just a new binary reader just
do like file your system that I Oh file
open read and then just keep playing
right there all right so now that we
have a binary reader right here um we
can dispose of it by calling the dispose
method from this binary reader class so
if we just do BR dot dispose that will
call the destructor inside of the binary
reader
um class and this obviously no code
inside of the binary reader
destructor me to show a massive box so
we can't actually see what's happening
but whenever you dispose of your method
it will call the destructor all right so
that's basically just the purpose of
this tutorial in the next tutorial we're
actually going to learn how to create
this dispose method we can't just say
like create our own dispose method right
here it won't work like that we actually
have to inherit the I disposable arm
interface alright so
it's pretty much it for this tutorial so
see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
