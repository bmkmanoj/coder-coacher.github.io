fifth objective-c tutorial and in this
tutorial we're going to be going over
the second part of the class and that's
the implementation now we already gave
our program something called an
interface and this pretty much said
what's going to be in the class we have
a age await and couple methods so what
the implementation section is is is
pretty much a way to say all right we
told you we're going to have some
methods in the implementation section
we're going to give you actual
instructions on how to do the methods
for example if we had a method called
sleep we're going to say in our
implementation section we would say all
right in order to sleep um brush your
teeth lay in bed put your head on the
pillow close your eyes so let's go ahead
and just get started
so unlike last time where you set at
interface to give the interface you need
to do at implementation there we go want
to make sure I didn't type it right and
big words and what you have to do after
this is say what class you're working
with then that's the same one is your
interface person so this is an
implementation for person so let's go
ahead and inside this we can go ahead
and start building our methods so the
first method we had is remember we had
print set age and set weight so here's
the cool thing in order a method
consists of two parts the method header
which is the name of the method pretty
much and the method body and inside the
method body is the instruction and the
cool thing we already got our method
header built so go ahead and copy this
and go ahead and paste it this is the
method header what it means is what kind
of information are you going to be
receiving back and what's the name of it
again we already built all this so
pretty cool now in order to build the
method body go ahead and put curly
braces and inside your curly braces
right after this is the instruction of
whenever I use this method called print
what do I want to happen well whenever
we all uses method called print' what do
we want to happen
let's just go NS log which means print
out on the screen and then go ahead and
put it in quotation marks I get rid of
all the stuff I don't like doing first
and then go ahead but I am let's put
percent I which is going to be age so I
am 23 years old and weigh a percent I
should we put libs alright this will go
ahead and put pounds
I don't like lbs how does that make
how's that mean pounds at all lbs
doesn't make sense so we're going to say
I am variable years old and weigh
variable pounds so now it needs two
variables and that of course would be
the age and the weight so that's why the
print format that I taught you guys like
tutorials go that's where it's coming in
handy so we already got the method built
we got the method header and the method
body that makes up the method done so
now we got two more methods builder
right here so let's go ahead and copy
this one set age except for the
semicolon copy it and paste it right
under here and paste so now when we
build method body here's what this
method header is saying we have a method
that's going to return nothing we're not
going to want anything in return it's
going to be called set age just because
we thought it was a cool name and it's
in our a in order for me to do this
method I need some bit of information so
you better be passing me a number here
and I'm going to treat it is the
variable a so here's what's going on
here you're going to have a number
you're going to pass in later like 23 so
whenever you use a is going to be equal
to 20 equal to 23 so let's go ahead and
and set age our age variable equal to a
so pretty much age is going to
eventually be equal to 23 when we get
the next section simple enough and let's
do the same thing
with the set weight method copy the
method header let me see
there we go and the method body this mag
look at my keyboard on this look how
tiny this is it's like a phone sort of
cell phone hello hello
anyways that's why I'm like alright
we're the numbers on the right hand side
and taking a long time and stuff it's my
first Mac I apologize but anyways back
to the tutorial let's go ahead and set
weight equal to W and then once we're
done with implementation section which
pretty much means instructions on how to
do the method go ahead and press at and
so how does you improve your know when
the implementation starts it says at
implementation and how does it know in
this section and at end so here's what
we did our implementation section is
pretty much essentially to build our
methods we built the print method just
by putting in a print statement in it
that's the only instruction we have to
do for the set age method we gave our
method header and we set our write as an
argument we're going to pass in an
integer value that's going to be treated
is the variable a so whenever you get
that variable set it equal to age and
we're going to be doing the same thing
with weight later on in our program
we've been calling this method called
set weight and then we're going to put a
number what we want our weight to set to
so go ahead and set that weight equal to
W and in the next tutorial we're going
to be going over the main programming
section and this is gonna put everything
the use and make everything make sense
so for now uh that's all the time I have
but thank you guys for watching don't
forget to subscribe and I will see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
