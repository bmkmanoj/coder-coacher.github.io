welcome to your very first video
tutorial and how to make games with
construct two now actually before I
think it started teaching you guys stuff
I want to mention that if you're
watching this video on YouTube make sure
that you're watching it in full screen
and also 1080 if you just watch it in
that little youtube player you're
probably not going to be able to see
what's going on at all
so again full screen 1080 that's what
I'm recording in and if you do that
everything is going to be crystal clear
so if you just click this video because
you guys want to know you know how to
make some games then you are in luck
because what construct 2 is is it's a
piece of software that you can install
on your computer actually have it uh
downloaded and installed right there but
it's more than just a piece of software
it's actually an entire game engine now
what I mean by that is this way back ago
whenever they first started making like
Nintendo games say the person who was
making Super Mario Brothers he made the
game and he made a function where Mario
could jump run left and right and hop on
monsters well then another guy who was
creating another game he made function
where the dude could jump run left and
right and jump on monsters and people
kept doing this over and over and you're
like you know what maybe we should stop
coding the basic crap over and over and
over again and just save it in one
specific file so we can reuse it
wherever and then we can concentrate on
you know the good stuff of the game like
the graphics the logic the story cool
stuff like that so that's what construct
2 allows us to do so the first thing
that we need to do is of course download
it now it's actually really easy to
download and install so I'm not going to
you know take you guys through the
process of clicking next next next next
a hundred times that's all you do but I
do want to talk to you guys about the
different licenses if you're just
watching these tutorials and you want to
test it out that's fine just go ahead
and download this free edition you
download this and I you know just pretty
much click on the file install it on
your computer and then you're going to
have a icon like this I'm actually using
this personal Edition
and the reason is because you know I'm
not a company or anything I'm just going
to be using it myself on my own computer
however if you ever want to think about
selling these games and it says it right
here if you ever think you're going to
make more than five thousand bucks in
revenue then you need the business one
bug in I'm using the personal one you
can get the free one it doesn't really
matter so go ahead and download the free
version and then once you have it
downloaded open it up by double clicking
it and the very first thing you're going
to see is this and also if you have the
free version it's going to say okay you
should upgrade enter your information
right here but I have the personal one
like I said so that's why my info is
popping up right here and the first
thing you want to do is you want to
start a new project so click this and
then you can just go ahead and click new
empty project and hit open never seen
okay what the heck game are we even
going to create well for these first
couple videos I'm actually going to be
teaching you guys how to make this game
right here so this game right here is if
you press up down left right on your
mouse and you can also click later Mouse
the shoot and of course if a monster
runs into you you die this was actually
a game created by I believe they're one
of the employees who work on this
program right here but they made it
tutorial on this a while ago and it was
kind of outdated so I just wanted to
talk you guys through this tutorial one
more time and also it was a text
tutorial so I had to read it which kind
of sucked many ways that's what game
we're going to be making and if you
watch it now then everything's up to
date you know um
the tutorial that they made this it was
on like the software that was made back
in 2010 so that's where we're going to
be doing so if you're wondering alright
looks like a pretty cool game but where
I get all those images well lucky for
you if you go to and I'll put this link
below the video if you go to this link
right here it's going to take you to my
forum and I have all of the images right
there so you can just go ahead click
save as click save as there's actually
one two three four five images
which is the background and all the
other stuff you need for the game and
then just go ahead and save them in a
folder called game or anywhere on your
computer and when the time comes I'll
teach you guys through how to use each
one of those images so basically click
on the link below download all of those
to your computer save them make sure
that you have a construct to download
the free version is fine and also make
sure that you created a new project and
then once you have everything set up you
can go ahead and watch the next video
where we're actually going to be
starting to build the game itself and
guys I also want to mention that if you
have no experience in html5 or no
experience in programming at all it's
absolutely fine I'm going to um I mean
it's better if you do but these
tutorials are aimed at just someone who
wants to learn how to make a basic game
and wants to learn how to get started
with construct 2 so anyways thank you
guys for watching and uh well I'll see
you guys in next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
