is bucky roberts and welcome to your
very first video of this little mini
series where i'm going to be teaching
you guys how to download and install amp
amp of course being an acronym for
Apache MySQL and PHP and if you guys are
watched in these videos I'm going to
guess that you probably already have a
pretty good idea of why you would want
to install these things but for those
people who don't if you are a web
developer and you make PHP based
applications you can go ahead and
install all these things on your
computer and then whenever you run your
PHP script it's going to run just like
it would on a server and it basically
eliminates the need to buy like shared
hosting or purchase a server from
somewhere else so you can go ahead and
develop and test PHP applications right
from your own laptop or desktop pretty
freakin sweet so another thing I want to
mention actually before you started with
everything is guys I know that there are
packages that bundle all this together
and you can just you know download them
real quick quick and press the next next
next and then you have a patchy MySQL
and PHP all in one shot but the reason
that I want to take you guys through the
individual process of downloading and
installing each element piece by piece
is it gives you guys full control in you
guys will have a really good
understanding of what goes on behind the
scenes and also if you ever want to go
back and tweak anything then it's really
hard if you have like a single installer
but this way you have full control it
buh-buh-buh-buh got freaking kennel
cough phlegm in my throat we have full
control over each piece of the stack so
the first thing that we need to do now
now that my dumb little introduction is
over is we need to install Apache the
first piece of the puzzle but before we
do that we need to go ahead and download
and install this thing called visual c++
redistributable and you're asking
yourself Bucky why the heck do I need
this visual C++ crap that isn't Apache
MySQL so what's the point well we need
to have this on our computer before we
start installing crap
because this is actually the thing that
allows us to install everything else so
if you go to this website Apache
Lounge comm slash download you're going
to see a link for VC 11 and that's the
visual c++ redistributable and a little
side note you're going to want the
version 11 if you're using Windows 7 or
Windows 8 if you're using anything
before that
for example Vista or XP or anything
you're going to want the version 10 I'm
running Windows 7 so I'm going to go
ahead and download this so go ahead and
click this link and it's going to take
you to this page where you choose
download now what we're going to do is
we want to choose this version right
here times 86 and you're like oh wait a
second Bucky I actually have a 64-bit
operating system so I'm going to choose
64-bit well don't do it always whenever
we're following these next couple
tutorials always download the x86
version of everything and the reason for
that is because whenever we do install
Apache MySQL and PHP everything is
compatible with this x86 aka 32-bit
version so no matter what operating
system you have never um download the
64-bit version of anything it'll make
things a whole lot easier so I actually
already have this downloaded so let me
go ahead and find it user downloads and
the reason I did that is because I don't
want to you know waste them and I just
sit in here while it downloads so
whenever it downloads you're going to
get a file like this it says well V
crown credits the x86 whatever so go
ahead and double click that and we need
to give it permission to run and I'm
going to I'm going to guess that a lot
of you guys already have Visual C++ are
your computers already because a lot of
people watching this tutorial are going
to be you know web developers and
programmers and stuff like that so if
you already have it on your computer
like I do it's going to give you a
little pop-up like this and then you can
go ahead
hit close if you don't have it then it's
going to take you through the easiest
installation ever you just have to hit
next and it pretty much says install
just a really simple wizard boom you got
it so I'm going to go ahead and hit
cancel because I already have it
installed no need to install it again so
once you have Visual C++ on your
computer we can go ahead in download
