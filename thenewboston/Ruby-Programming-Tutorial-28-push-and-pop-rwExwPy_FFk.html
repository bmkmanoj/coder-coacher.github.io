Ruby tutorial and in this lesson I'm
gonna be talking more about arrays and
showing you guys a couple cool ways that
you can add elements into an array so I
showed you guys how to pretty much
create a full array last time with all
the elements already in it but now I'm
gonna show you guys an alternative way
because often what you want to do is at
first you just want to create a blank
array and then maybe you want the user
that's using your program to be able to
fill it up or other programmers and you
don't know what all you want on your
rate first so the first thing that
people do is typically create a blank
array and here's how you do that instead
of putting square brackets with a bunch
of things in it just put empty square
brackets square brackets with nothing in
between now go ahead and hit enter and
check it out we have an array called
cheese and nothing is in this array yet
so let me show you guys how to add
elements into your array after you
created an array the first thing that
you could do is you can use well go
ahead and type the name of your array
then use the double less than signs now
okay I might as well type out the whole
command because if I try to explain what
I'm gonna talk next it's not gonna make
sense so first item so what we wanted to
do is we want to add a bunch of strings
or a text into this array so the first
way is to do this and this is called
pushing or adding an element onto the
end of the array so basically we have
the item we want to add which is called
first item now you can kind of see these
double lists and science is like arrow
flowing into cheese so now whenever we
hit enter this item is gonna flow into
the array cheese check it out now if you
go ahead and print out cheese on the
screen we have one item in there so
again that is called pushing or
basically adding in elements and the
onto the end of your array now you can
also do this in an alternative way
now that's go ahead and type the name of
your array which is cheese and use the
push method now this is pretty much the
same exact thing as before but it's
easier for a lot of beginners to
visually see what's going on now rather
than the stubble
less than operator so now in between as
your parameter for push go ahead and
type in whatever item you want like
second item now go ahead and hit enter
and what this is going to do is it's
gonna push this item on to the end of
your a basically add this onto your rate
pretty good pretty good
so now just like before we can access
the individual elements by putting Chi 0
which is the first item or cheese 1
which is the second item and we can you
know print them out on the screen we
could I don't know change them if we
want we can do a whole bunch of sorts
sort of things with them so now let's go
ahead and take a look at that cheese
array one more time it has first item
and second item let's go ahead and add
one more item on to that and you know
I'm not gonna do third item because
that's just boring let's just go ahead
and do tuna Micke tuna that looks pretty
good so now our array consists of three
items first item second item and tuna
make tuna sound them pretty good so now
that we know how to add items onto the
end of your array I think it would be a
good idea to learn how to take items off
the end of the array so pushing remember
this pushing is adding items on popping
is taking items off so let's go ahead
and pop an item off the end of this
array now a key thing you want to take
note of is this since you're saying okay
remove an item from this array you don't
need to specify the item that's what a
lot of people confuse about whenever you
pop an item it doesn't need parameters
it's just gonna take the last one no
matter what it is so go ahead and put
cheese pop that actually sounds like a
soda drink or popcorn or something and
go ahead and hit enter and now it
returns the you tuna Mick tuna now the
reason it does this is it's pretty much
saying okay this is the item that we
removed from your array so before our
array was first item second item in tuna
Mac tuna now we popped off the last
element which was tuna tuna now if you
just go ahead and take a look at cheese
check it out
it now only consists
the first item and second item but to
Namak tuna is no longer on there and we
can go ahead and print out well pop off
another one but actually might as well I
was gonna say something else but
nevermind I was getting flabbergasted so
let's go ahead and pop off the next
element what one does this pop off the
second item now if you go ahead and take
a look at that cheese array it only has
that first item pretty interesting huh
so there you go there's your quick
tutorial on how to push pop in all about
cheese so thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe and yeah I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
