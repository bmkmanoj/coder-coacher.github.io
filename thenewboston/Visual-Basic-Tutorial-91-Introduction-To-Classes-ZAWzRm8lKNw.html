slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
looking at classes now classes are a way
to take subs and functions and to
encapsulate them inside of what's called
an object so that you can better
organize your code and it promotes reuse
of code so that it's easier and it
doesn't take you as long to write the
same thing over and over again so let's
go ahead and create a new project we'll
just go ahead and select windows forms
application and we will call it person
now go ahead and click OK and wait for
that to load so before we before we add
any controls to our form 1 let's come
over here to our solution Explorer will
click on person and then we'll
right-click it click Add and then we're
going to add a new item now I'll shrink
this down some now go ahead and select a
class right here and we're going to name
our class person
okay so now that person has loaded let's
go ahead and add some stuff to this so
we will add a couple variables so let's
use the keyword public so that we can
see those in our form 1vv class so do
public wait as double and we'll just go
ahead and set that equal to let's say 8
pounds so if the person was just born so
let's do public money as double and
we'll just let them start off with $100
and then we'll go ahead and let's leave
it at that
okay so now let's create some functions
and methods that we can use so we'll
type public sub and then we will just
type eat and let's say we will have them
pass how many pounds of food they wanted
to eat so we'll type 5 al pounds as
integer or let's just do a double and we
will type weight plus equals and then
we'll do pounds
and now we will do public sub exercise
and we will bivalve the time
so by eval time as double and so
whatever the exercise will do wait -
equals we'll just do like time so let's
say they workout one hour we'll just do
divided by 10 now I didn't do much
thinking on the calculations for this
I'm just doing it for the sake of the
tutorial so they will do public sub work
and then we will buy Val hours as double
and now we're going to do is let's come
up here and give them an income so
public income as double let's just pay
the minimum wage to start off with so
now we're going to do is we're going to
type money plus equals hours times
income so however many hours they work
it's going to multiply that by their
income and add it to money now when we
create our person class we have these
public variables up here but we don't
really want the other classes to be able
to directly access those variables so
let's just go ahead and make those
private so we'll do private money and
private wait so now no other class can
see these variables and now let's make
some functions that will let other
classes get these variables but it won't
let them change it so we'll just we'll
just type public sub get wait
and since this is going to return a
value we need to make it a function so a
public function get weight as double and
we're just going to return the weight so
return weight and we will do this for
each one of our variables so we'll do
money and income so public function get
money as double and we will just return
money and we'll do this one more time
for the income so public function get
income as double and we will just return
the income okay so now let's make a sub
that will allow you to increase their
income so we'll go ahead and type public
sub increase income and we'll have them
by Val amount as double and so whatever
amount they pass this sub we're going to
go ahead and type income plus equals
amount okay so now that we've created
our class if you don't have this code
already typed in go ahead and do that I
will scroll through this and if you have
any questions leave them in the comments
I'll let me zoom in real quick okay so
if you need to look at this pause any
time in here so we just made a couple
simple subs and functions and we have
some private variables that we're going
to be using so now that we've created
our class we need to be able to use our
class so I'm stay tuned for the next
tutorial and we're going to be talking
about that during that one so thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
