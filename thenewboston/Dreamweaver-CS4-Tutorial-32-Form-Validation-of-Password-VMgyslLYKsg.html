to go over spry validation of a password
and what this is is you know when you go
to website and asks you to create a
password with either uppercase letters
uppercase letters and numbers letters
and numbers and special characters
there's a lot of different options that
some sites require you to to follow or a
lot of requirements that some sites
require you to follow whenever you are
creating a password and in this tutorial
I'm going to show you how those sites do
that using Dreamweaver okay so let's get
started and we're going to create a spry
validation password so go over here to
the left and our insert group and click
on spry validation password and it's
going to ask you for an ID in the label
I'm going to give it an ID of new
password and label is going to be create
a password there we go and I've been
having a little trouble trying to get my
span to show up in my properties
whenever I click inside of the span so I
have to go inside of my my page
properties here and then just say okay
and then it pops up with my properties
so if you're having that same problem
inside Dreamweaver click on the page
properties inside of your properties tab
down here at the bottom and then just
click on OK and it should pop up with
the correct spry password properties
alright so here we have a lot of
different options we have the options
for the amount of letters that we want
to put in we also let's say let's give
it a min
of 16 characters and a max if are a men
of eight characters in a max of 16 and
what that's saying is basically the
password has to be between 8 and 16
characters and below that you can give
it some more options we can say that
they have to have at least one letter
and at least two numbers and we're just
going to leave the uppercase ones blank
for now and we're going to leave all the
max blank when we're going to set the
min special characters to one and the
special characters are things like
question marks and exclamation points or
periods you want to make sure and be
very specific about what special
characters are to user that way they
know what it is some some people might
and some people might not know but for
this example we're going to use the
question mark as a special character so
just to just review what we have clicked
on here we have set the password to have
a minimum number of one letters in a
minimum number of two numbers and then a
minimum special characters of one so I'm
going to run this try save it and test
it out here there we go so I'm just
going to make someone to type in
something that is not legit and submit
it and it says the minimum number of
characters is not met okay of course I
only typed in one so now I'm just going
to type in just letters as a password
I'm going to actually type the word
password and that's a characters but it
does not meet a specified strength and
that means that it does not have a
number or a special character so I'm
going to add the number one but i'm not
going to add a special character and
it's still going to give me the same
error so now i'm going to add a question
mark
and an explanation and it's still saying
that I'm not meeting the specified
string so let's go back and let's check
out our options here we have set the min
letters to one and the mid numbers to
two so I only had one number inside so
i'm going to put another number right
there and there we go it is good to go
so now you can see how those sites use
form validation to make sure that the
user is creating password of the
specified string and you can do all of
that right instead dreamweaver without
even doing or writing any code yourself
you just have to fill in the correct the
correct form inside of your properties
panel and you're good to go and that's
it for this tutorial and we're about
finished with the spry validation series
we only have two more to go and after
that we will do a wrap up of everything
that has to do with forms and we'll sort
of bring it all together and then we'll
move on to more advanced spry techniques
that aren't a validation but more of
more of a user I guess like interactive
web pages using a spry assets so make
sure to continue watching hopefully you
guys are enjoying these tutorials and
learning new things we only have a few
left so make sure you finish out the
spry validation series and I will see
you in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
