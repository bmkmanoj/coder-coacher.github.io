second Premiere Pro tutorial and in this
tutorial what I'm going to be doing is
showing you guys how to set up or other
words how to customize your workspace
and when I say workspace I mean all this
area right here all these windows tabs
buttons gadgets it can be kind of
intimidating at first so let's go ahead
and start tackling this first of all let
me get my terminology straight because
all of the you know hardcore Premiere
Pro fanboys are going to kind of yell at
me if I don't tell you this I'm going to
give it to you in the terminology that
you probably understand first and then
tell you what Dobby calls it so each one
of these big squares which you may refer
to as a window is called a frame now
each one of these tabs for example there
are four different tabs in this frame
these are called panels so we may say
windows and tabs but Adobe and they're
technically called frames and what do
they call it panels there I forgot
already
so that's what they're technically
called but the reason I forgot is
because I always just say windows and
tabs so you know if you guys are going
to watch my tutorials get used to it I'm
sorry but if you're like in a premier
Pro class for college or high school or
something make sure that you call them
frame some panels and not windows and
tabs so anyways in order to show or hide
one of these tabs what you need to do is
this and you know what let me take a
step back and tell you why they have so
many tabs each of these tabs is
responsible for doing a different thing
to the video for example these are the
tools you use in the bottom right to
slice and dice your clips on this effect
tab you can apply special effects to
your video this audio mixer you can
manage the audio make it sound really
good and pretty um you know just a bunch
of different pieces are included other
than arranging your clips in order a lot
goes into making a movie than you might
think so each of these tabs is
responsible for that so the very first
thing I want to tell you guys is this if
you accidentally close one of these tabs
for example if I'm showing you guys
something about the tools too
AB and you accidentally hit close you go
ahead and hit window at the top this
window dropdownlist and this is your
master list of all your tabs or panels
just go ahead and hit tools and it pops
back up so if you go ahead and hit
window you see that some have checkboxes
next to them and some have no checkboxes
the one with checkboxes are the one that
are showing already and one without
checkboxes are the ones that are hidden
so if you accidentally close one ever
just go ahead and hit it and it'll pop
back up so with that being said let me
show you guys how to customize your
workspace for one I don't like my tool
tab over here I like it over here and I
think that this is kind of you know big
I really want to focus on this thing
called the timeline so I really just
don't like the layout so I'm going to
show you guys how to move things around
and just how you like it
the very first thing can do is you can
take these panels and you can move them
around to different frames so let's say
for example that I want this tools over
here go ahead and see these dots or you
can go ahead and click the name tools
just go ahead and drag it over and now
you can see it's highlighted wherever
you want to drop it so go ahead and
release your mouse and now your tools
panel is over here so that's pretty cool
how you can move all these around and
aside from that you can adjust the
overall size of these windows or frames
if you go ahead and you scroll in
between two windows or frames you see a
little parallel line with arrows on each
side go ahead and hit your mouse and if
you drag left to right you can go ahead
and adjust the size of these windows
pretty sweet huh
so I'm saying alright I want to make
sure I can read all those tabs so that
size looks pretty good to me now aside
from that what you can do is you're
saying all right I work with this audio
tab a lot and I want this front and
center Center what you can do is you can
go ahead and take this tab instead of
having it kind of stuck there you can
undock it so now it's kind of stuck in
place like a big puzzle go ahead and
right-click the title and hit
undock panel and what that is going to
do is take the entire panel and undock
it so pretty much you have a separate
window it you can work with so I really
don't like that so I'm going to go ahead
and cancel out of that I just want to
show you guys that it is indeed possible
and also you can go ahead and
right-click and undock the entire frame
which would undock all of these tabs
right here you can go ahead and hit X
and what that would do is say you never
even needed this info tab you can go
ahead and close that by hitting the X
right next to it and like through all
those things you can pretty much set up
your workspace any way you want
so say okay I'm going to go ahead and
adjust this like this I'm going to get
it rid of this metadata and move this
over a little bit and perfect I got my
workspace set up exactly how I want it
to but here's the thing every time I
open Premiere Pro I don't want to have
to do all that crap so what you can do
is if you want to save a workspace go to
window workspace new workspace and go
ahead and give it a name and as soon as
you name it it's going to go ahead and
save it and then it's going to pop up in
the presets right here and well I guess
I might as well mention the presets as
well they give you preset workspaces
depending on you know how people maybe
if you are the audio specialist on a
movie you're going to want to work with
the audio workspace but most of us are
just going to want to stick with the
editing because this is kind of the
general overall workspace so those are
kind of the default workspaces that you
can use and if you're saying this
alright Bucky I'm watching your tutorial
and ix some things out and I move this
around and okay I move this and this
okay I just messed everything up how do
I like refresh it and get it back to new
if you want to get it back to new
default style what you need to do is hit
window workspace reset current workspace
and what it does is it makes is like hey
dude are you sure you want to do this
because you know it's a big decision so
go ahead and hit yes and it's going to
rearrange everything like you never even
touched it before so I know you guys
don't even know what
a lot of this crap even does in organ
we're going to be getting to that in the
upcoming Sorrows but for now I just want
to give you guys a brief overview of how
to manage your screen and how to get it
looking exactly how you want it to so
now that you know how to do that we're
ready to move on to the next story
picking it apart and start editing some
video so we're going to be doing that
pretty soon but for now thank you guys
for watching don't forget to subscribe
and I will see you guys in the next
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
