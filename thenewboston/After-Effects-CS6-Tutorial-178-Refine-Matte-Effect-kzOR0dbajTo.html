Blackford here with another After
Effects cs6 tutorial and in this
tutorial I want to go over the effect
called refine mat and that is pretty
much a more advanced version of the mat
choker and it also kind of gives you
like a spill suppressor effect also so
let's start using it and see how it
effects our color key here let's go to
effect mat and then refine mat so we've
got a bunch of different options here
when you twirl them open their sliders
so you don't have to worry about
twirling too much open so well the
problems that we have on this are
obvious we've got the green edge which
needs to be suppressed and then we have
the probably need to choke it down a
little bit so we don't see as much of
these green edges being spilled on so
the first thing we want to check out is
the choke and we can use that to bring
stuff down bring down the edges and one
thing about this effect is it seems to
be pretty render intensive so when I try
to like move stuff and it previews it's
slow so just want to let you guys know
that there we go
well the choke was that 100% let's try a
99 suited does alright
I went way too high and it's slow damn
hole control and it'll go a little bit
slower for me instead of like going like
25 every time so that's probably
somewhat good and we've got our smooth
which smooths on the edges I'll just
Jack this up real high and so you can
see what it looks like
Wow
- hi but let's go to ten so what that
does well you can see it smooths out the
edges and kind of like just blurs them
so I put that to one and then we got our
feather here which kind of does the same
check that up well it's a lot less
intense there so I don't even want that
on I'm gonna put that as zero and you
can see how it makes it everything's all
jaggedy from the choker and everything
like that so we want to have this a
little bit higher or increase the smooth
a little bit to fix these jagged edges
so put that back at 20 maybe let's go
put this back up a little bit
so if we zoom out to a hundred percent
and look at what it looks like it looks
pretty decent so we'll keep it like that
the other thing we've got is this the
edge color green like blast and through
so they've got this Deakin amp
decontamination here and it's supposed
to work like the spill suppressor so
what you need to do is increase this
decontamination radius and with this at
a hundred percent here you can just
increase the radius and see how much it
starts like trying to get rid of the
colors the green color actually and now
a problem with it is when you start
getting up too high now you can look at
this gun right here it affected the edge
colors of this gun because it was too
close to the amount of green color there
so if I turn this effect off that's what
the gun is supposed to look like and it
kind of like blended it all in together
and doesn't look correct we turn on our
decontamination map we can see how much
of the radius is affected here so let's
go to like some one six and it should
cut that in half but that's what the map
looks like
and we can extend one smooth it's a not
as good as a spill suppressor in my
opinion so I mean we could still add
spill suppressor if we wanted to in
there I mean that looks 100 times better
so in my opinion that I don't use refine
Matt all that much because I can get
better results with the spill suppressor
and the and the Matt choker so it's up
to you whether one you like to use if
you can get away with just using the one
effect then that's great but if you have
something that has a lot a lot of extra
spill on it like this thing did you're
gonna you might have to use it this in
conjunction and everything like that so
that's going to be it for our refinement
tutorial you know how to use it and it's
it's a tip decent effect it I think and
should be used on less problematic green
screen shots where there's not a lot of
green spill coming on and everything so
thanks for watching this tutorial and I
hope you guys can use that Thanks bye
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
