had a fantastic Saturday off but today
is Sunday which means it's time to come
back to work in order to understand
biology you have to have a basic
knowledge of chemistry so in this video
I'm going to be doing a very very brief
introduction to some of the fundamental
concepts you're going to need to know I
can't explain everything that you need
to know about chemistry because I'm
doing biology tutorials right now but I
will try to cover the most important
things that you're gonna need to know
but let's get these are some definitions
you're going to need to know and
understand we start off with elements
elements are a substance consisting of
one or more of the same type of atom an
example of an element would be hydrogen
or oxygen sulfur iron I believe there
are 112 elements total atoms are the
smallest particle into which an element
can be divided and atoms can be further
subdivided into subatomic particles
there are many different types we're
just going to focus on three because
these are the only ones you really need
to know you have protons neutrons and
electrons protons and neutrons are
located inside the nucleus or the center
of an atom protons have a charge of plus
one neutrons have no charge electrons
are located outside the nucleus orbiting
around the nucleus and they have a
charge of negative one atoms can come
together to form what are called
molecules molecules consist of two or
more atoms these atoms can be the same
type of element or they can be different
elements an example of a molecule would
be water hydrochloric acid chlorine
molecular chlorine a list of elements
and all of their properties can be found
on what is called the periodic table
elements are going to be arranged by
their mass numbers and there are a
couple properties of the periodic table
we start off with the periodic law
properties of elements are periodic
functions of their atomic numbers and
I'll explain this in the next slide you
have the horizontal rows which are
called periods and the columns are
called groups or families periods begin
with an element that has one valence
electron and ends with a nonreactive
element and elements in the same family
have similar similar similar chemical
properties I was about to say cynical
that's not even a word
when you look at any app when you look
at a periodic table you're going to see
the elemental symbol the atomic number
which is the number of protons and the
mass number the atomic number is
normally in the top left the elemental
symbol is going to be in the middle and
the mass number right here is going to
be at the bottom the atomic number is
going to define the element an element
is defined by its note the number of
protons it has if you change the number
of protons you change the element if you
have the number of protons you can find
the number of electrons atoms with no
charge have the same number of electrons
and protons the mass number is the
number of protons and neutrons in an
atom and since you are given the number
of protons you can always find the
number of neutrons by using the mass
number and the atomic mass number is an
average mass of all naturally occurring
isotopes isotopes are atoms of the same
element that have a different number of
neutrons and here is an example of an
isotope what I've written here is called
chemical shorthand the top number is
going to be your atomic weight the
bottom number is going to be your atomic
number most people are going to leave
the atomic number off since you have
the elements the elements will simmer
right here you already know how many
protons you're gonna have but anyways
the symbol C stands for carbon carbon
has six protons and since the number of
protons can't change without changing
the elements the number of neutrons has
to change for example carbon-12 it's
going to have six protons and six
neutrons but carbon 13 has one extra
Neutron still gonna have six protons but
instead of six neutrons it's going to
have seven neutrons this is the basic
anatomy of an atom
you've got the nucleus which houses
protons and neutrons you've got energy
shells our electron shells energy levels
surrounding orbiting the nucleus and
then you've got electrons which are
located on these energy levels that are
orbiting the nucleus the first energy
level can hold two electrons the second
energy level can hold eight for our all
intents and purposes we are going to say
that all other energy levels can hold
eight electrons this is not exactly true
but don't worry about atoms want their
electron shells to be completely full or
completely empty this means they want to
in the first level or none in the first
level they're going to want eight in the
second level or none in the second level
valence electrons are electrons that are
available to form chemical bonds atoms
with a full valence shell are not
reactive for example helium has two
electrons in its first shell no
electrons in any other show helium is
not a chemically reactive atom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
