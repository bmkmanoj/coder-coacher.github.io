to your sixth C++ tutorial and I know I
have been gone for a while but I have
been busy I have been on vacation and I
have been working on my website which is
finally up for all of you guys who have
been telling me to make a website get
all my videos organized and so anyways
I've been listening to you guys I did it
all of my videos are organized on my
website the New Boston comm I'll tell
you about it later but for now we have
to make some C++ tutorials so if you've
been watching my last tutorials you're
noticed that a couple things are
different first of all we have a new
compiler I read the comments in my old
videos about me using an old compiler in
that it wasn't up to date and that's
just because that old compiler is the
one I grew up learning so I was familiar
with it I love that compiler but since
you guys want to up-to-date compiler I
downloaded code blocks so I think that's
the name of the compiler I'm using now
supposed to be up-to-date you know a
better C++ compiler another thing is I'm
now using CIN CIN get instead of system
pause and this pretty much does the same
thing it waits for user input so your
program just doesn't run it pauses it
and allows you to look at it so the
reason I was using system pause is
whenever I first started teaching guys
about C++
none of this stuff made sense to you in
system pause was the only thing you
could look at and understand and it said
this paused my system so instead of
throwing everything at you at once I
wanted to take everything in baby steps
and that's why if you guys say all right
why are you doing this instead of a
better way of doing this it's because I
just want to take everything in baby
steps one step at time so anyways that's
my excuses for doing that but everything
is fixed now so with that being said in
the last toriel we covered the basics of
functions in how to use the functions
that are built-in to C++ already and we
pretty much cover one type of function
and this was a function that took one
parameter or needed one piece of
information in order to work
but not all functions are like that some
functions need more than one piece of
information in order to work and some
functions need no information at all
you're saying all right how the heck
does that work I'll show you in a second
for example let's go ahead and get
variable name X or as one guy left the
comment double rainbow
huh yeah I saw that joke from someone
else on my other videos so I can't take
credit for this but anyways we have this
variable named rainbow and we want to
use the power of function so let's go
ahead and set rainbow equal to P Oh W
and set it equal
well let me guys let me tell you guys
first what the power of function is
whenever you do like 5 to the third
power
um I can't it's like five with a little
three on the top right
this means five times five times five
five times itself three times so what is
5 times 5 times 5 well 5 times 5 that's
2 is 25 times the third one is 125
server sayin all right
so in order for us to use this function
it obviously needs two numbers aka two
pieces of information the first one is
the base and the second one is the
exponent so how do we pass in two
different numbers using the parameters
well the first thing we do is type in
any old number in this like we saw in
the last or oh this is how you pass in
one piece of information but when you
have more than one piece of information
you need to pass in a function what you
need to do is separate it with a comma
and then add another number it doesn't
matter if there's a space in there or
not sometimes we'll tighten that up so
anyways if you have a function that
takes two integers in this instance just
go ahead and throw in your first one
like normal and then add a comma and
throw in your second one after that so
anyways what I'm trying to say is
anytime you need more than one piece of
information for your function you need
to separate them with commas and just to
prove to you guys that this works let's
go ahead and see out
rainbow is go ahead and end that line
and yep looks pretty good so let's go
ahead and build and run this and so we
get 125 and that's because 5 times 5
times 5 is 125 so that's how the power
function works or you know using
exponents so let's go ahead and delete
this actually let's just go ahead and
delete this and remember at the
beginning torial I was telling you guys
some functions don't need any
information at all and you guys are
scratching your head like what's the use
of a function it doesn't need any
information well I'll show you guys
right here let's go ahead and make
another function or another variable
right now called Y and set this equal to
y equals R and and just put empty
parentheses this function is not going
to take any parameters and by the way
Rand comes from C standard a library
it's a C function so make sure you have
this include or else it won't work serve
saying all right what is Rand and why
the heck does it not need any parameters
at all Randa is the function to generate
a random number it's going to generate
it in the scope of well we won't cover
that now but just listen this is going
to generate a random number so why would
you pass it in a piece of information
like 5 or 81 it doesn't need that
information that would just be you
generating your own random number that
pops in your head we want the computer
to generate it for us so therefore we
don't give any information at all the
computer is going to take care of
everything for us so let's go ahead and
run this and go ahead leave a comment
see what number you think this is go
ahead don't cheat don't cheat all right
now go ahead and run it and see if
you're right 41 so if any of you mofos
guess 41 congratulations you are the
winner and give me call I think I'm
going to have you pick my Powerball
tickets next time so anyways random or
excuse me
functions sometimes take one parameter
they sometimes take multiple parameters
in that case you separate them with
commas
and sometimes they don't take any
parameter at all they just pretty much
do something and don't need any
information from the user or from the
programmer or for anyone they just do it
it's done with forget about it
so anyways now that we have all of the
functions covered and we understand how
built-in functions work in the next
tutorial I'm going to be teaching you
guys how to build your own custom
functions so it's going to be awesome we
are done with built-in functions for now
it's definitely a lot cooler and more
useful building our own custom functions
because then instead of you know using
random numbers and powers we can make
these new functions do whatever the heck
we want them to so I'm super excited but
for now I'm going to go check a bay
because I'm selling something on there
and I want to you know see if I got any
questions or anything thing but um
alright I lied I'm just going to pound a
few beers and then probably make another
tutorial but thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
