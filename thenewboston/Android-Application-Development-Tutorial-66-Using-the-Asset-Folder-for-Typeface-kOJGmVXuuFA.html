tutorial for the new boss and again with
me Travis and this is kind of gonna be
the end result
I was just testing this out because I
wasn't sure if the tight well I'll get
into it I wasn't sure if it'd work out
or not but this isn't gonna be the end
result we just put a new text in there
with our custom font so that's what
we're gonna do so first thing that you
guys want to do is download some kind of
a text or a font I'm sorry from the
internet
I'd only one called g-unit the extension
is TTF or OTF I believe it is so just
make sure you download some kind of font
you guys want to work with you don't
have to but if you want like some font
that you know is customized you're gonna
want to download that font and then put
it in your assets folder I trying to
think of something that we can do with
the assets folder just simply within our
drawable or within this graphics
activity so figured you know fonts a
good way to go so download that put it
again in your assets folder which is not
in your resource folder but there we go
once you have that done what we want to
do is that's basically going to be
called something something called a
typeface so we need to do a typeface
variable and we're going to call this
variable font and now we can set up
after we import our typeface we can set
up that reference to our assets folder
within the constructor again so we're
gonna say font is equal to typeface
referring to the typeface class dot
create from assets or from asset and
then it takes in the asset manager and a
string path so we're gonna click this
one create from asset and basically this
asset manager what it's looking for is
basically the context which again is
being passed into the constructor so
we're gonna grab that context and then
we're just going to hit dot and we're
gonna say get assets
so we're basically getting the assets
from that context it's not not a huge
deal right there and then we need to
give it a string name which is basically
exactly what our font is called so we do
this in quotations just like any other
time we deal with strings we're gonna
say g-unit download that font cuz it's
just gangsta and you know we are all
gangster yourself there we go we set up
our font and now now we can use this
font so let's go into our on draw method
here and let's do this below or before
our ball our green ball is drawn so just
give some space right here after the
canvas itself has been colored white
this is where we're gonna set up our
font so the first thing we need to do is
let's get some basic basically some more
customization going on so we're gonna
set up a new paint variable and we're
gonna call this text paint and we're
gonna set this equal to new paint just
like we've done before and now let's
kind of define what we want this text
paint to do so first thing let's say
text paint dot set color and you can
either do this standard color or again
we can do something like the you know
the Alpha level let's do that one this
first argument is the alpha level so
let's do 50% basically that's going to
make or that's gonna be 50 I kind of a
transparency is what the a stands for
the R is the amount of red we want so
let's say we want a lot of red I believe
it goes up to like 265 or no 255 not
quite sure we're gonna do 254 just to be
safe as you guys probably know by now
I'm not huge graphics guy so don't
really deal with all the colors and all
that stuff and then here's the green so
let's say you know you want a little bit
of green in there like 10 or something
it's probably gonna be the worst color
in the world in 50 blue I have no idea
what color that is but that's what we're
setting this text paint to be
let's make this text paint what else can
we do let's say set alignment
no no what am i what am I thinking
do set what else we got
text text alignment that's what it is
and then what we can do is we can refer
to the alignment class and then hit dot
Center so it's gonna have Center
alignment and then what else we can set
the text size so we're gonna say text
paint dot text size or set text size
it's like 50 and one other thing you
could do well no that's that's good for
now I don't know how much time we have
and kind of babbling it seems now what
what to do is basically add this new
font to our you know our background or a
canvas so that's what we're gonna do
here we're gonna say just canvas dot
draw text and you want to take the one
that's a string two floats in a paint
variable so for a string this is what we
actually want it to say so we're gonna
say my bring back something like that
for the x value again it's since it's
Center alignment we just kind of want to
in the center of our canvas so we're
gonna say canvas dot get width divided
by two so that's gonna give us the
Center for the Y let's do something like
two hundred and for the paint this is
gonna be what we just set up here so
text paint and that will give us all
that other customization that we just
added so let's save that and we're
basically done with this tutorial
hopefully it's not too difficult I mean
I just want to show you the asset folder
how you can kind of define the the paint
and then you know add it to the canvas
you know we kind of worked with that are
ready with the paint variable or the
paint class well it's a pink yeah that's
what I
pink pink and blue and green this is
just amazing
oh wait what what is going on oh we
forgot to uh forgot to use our font so
one other thing we need to do to the
text tux paint we're gonna say dot set
typeface that's other thing we forgot
and since we set up our typeface in our
constructor we're gonna put font here
because again that's what we enable
named our typeface so now everything
should be working just you know that's
uh it's just another example of how we
can just add some customization to a
paint and then throw the paint in when
we're actually drawing to the canvas so
there we go we got our font now so I'll
get I'll catch you guys in the next
tutorial and have a good one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
