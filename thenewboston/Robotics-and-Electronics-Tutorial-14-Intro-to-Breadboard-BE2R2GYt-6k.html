tutorial in electronics and robotics and
this tutorial is going to be on
something called breadboards now as you
guys can probably tell from our last
couple stories when I built even simple
circuits all those alligator clips are
kind of getting in the way and they're
kind of getting tangled up and they
became a little bit excessive
so clearly when we build huge circuits
with like hundreds of connections these
alligator clips aren't going to work
because they're just too big they are
won't stay on you can't trust them so we
need when we're testing something better
to use for our tests and that's why we
got a breadboard now I'm going to zoom
in I'm going to show you guys exactly
what this is and how it works so here is
my breadboard right here in why this is
easy is because instead of connecting
wire to wire due to or from alligator
clips or soldering or anything like that
what you have to do to use this is
simply push one wire and one of these
holes and another wire into another one
in these holes and they connect so how
this works is that each of these little
lines of holes right here it has a
little wire strip underneath it so in
the wire strips are in groups of five so
anytime you connect a wire in one of
these holes any hole alongside of it is
already connected to that wire so all
you have to do is push in the lawyer and
it automatically connects now I told you
that these are in groups of five so that
means that anything five or more away
from it isn't going to connect and I'll
show you guys some examples later but
the only exception to this are these
long lines up here with red and blue
stripes on them these are called buses
now what a bus is is pretty much a long
or an extra long wire instead of five in
a row so these are pretty much for your
main power so and it just makes it
easier to make a long strip so you don't
have to keep connecting it since you're
going to see you later
it's going to run across the entire
length of the breadboard so whenever we
power this whole strip we're going to be
able to more easily reach different
parts of our breadboard so another thing
that you guys might notice is these
things right here these are binding
posts in the main use for these is when
you have your main power source in your
wires hooked up to that it just helps
stabilize the wires in there of course
the red one will go in the red binding
post and the black one will go in the
black binding post another cool thing
about these little things called binding
posts is that they actually have little
eyelets on top of them or at least most
bread boards do where you can take a
banana clip and plug it right into the
top of your binding post and this helps
test and other things like that so there
are different types of wire you can plug
in to these little holes on your
breadboard the first thing you can do is
order a jumper kit like this and this is
pretty much all different sized wire
that's custom-made to fit into your
breadboard just like that different
sizes different colors or you can get 22
gauge wire just like this and make sure
it's solid and not stranded and with 22
gauge wire all you have to do is strip
the ends of it with a wire stripper and
you'll be good to go so now I'm going to
zoom in and show you guys the
combinations that work and what doesn't
on a breadboard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
