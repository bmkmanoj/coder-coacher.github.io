thirty second job a game development
tutorial and I just got back from school
and you know what I am ready to make
tutorials tonight I'm gonna make at
least 500 tutorials tonight I'm just in
a good mood for some reason probably
because uh we got let out early and
probably because I keep getting these
comments from this hot girl on YouTube
dope fiend she left me a couple cool
comments about my tutorials and then I
clicked on her channel she's actually
really hot so you know I'm a little
giddy about there right now but anyways
let's get back to uh you know away from
my personal life this is about you guys
learning this stuff so before you start
in this tutorial we need to change one
thing in the last tutorial we passed in
a graphics object I mean actually
changed at the graphics 2d so it's
compatible with our superclass and now
we're good to go
so unless toriel we covered all the
methods from the mouse a listener
interface and now we got to go over the
mouse motion interface now the mouse
motion interface is when you click and
drag which is pretty much dragged or
move the mouse and moving the mouse is
just moving it around without dragging
so there is only a holding down the
button difference but let's go ahead and
make a little comment and put mouse
motion interface just like that and now
let's implement the first method we need
it's going to be public void Mouse
dragged so if you thought it was drug it
actually not it's not drug like I drug
the mouse is direct seeing this little
bit of information as well so mouse
event name II and how do we handle this
baby well if you couldn't guess we're
just going to change the message and
it's going to be you are dragging the
mouse so whenever the user drags your
mouse it looks at this method in
implements this bit of code in what's
the code we just changed a little
message on the screen so now we need to
have implement the one other method in
this interface and that's public void
and that's Mouse
moved now mousemove is just like a mouse
drag but this is without holding down
button see I'm moving it right now and
if I click now I'm dragging it you see
pretty simple stuff here pretty
self-explanatory get my way house now
this is also going to take a mouse event
II even though we never use that
I object just past then and this change
message to equal you are moving the
mouse so now we already implemented all
the methods from to interface the mouse
listener and the mouse motion now
there's one other interface that we I
think we did yep mouse wheel listener
and this is if you have a wheel in the
middle of your mouse to like scroll up
and down like I'm doing right now then
we can also get um events from there so
let's go ahead and add a little comment
wheel interface who I spelled them
around cool and now let's go ahead and
the method in this is public void mouse
wheel move and we're just going to go
ahead and take a seam Mouse event Mouse
back mouse wheel event so it's a little
different and this is going to be e so
now what we want to do is change your
message to something whenever they
scroll the wheel in any kind of way we
want to change your message moving mouse
wheel simple enough so now there's only
one or actually one other interface but
three methods that we need to implement
this key listener and remember this key
listener had three methods in it but we
already handled those in this so all we
have to do is aside from it in it excuse
me get key pressed what happens if you
press down the key on your keyboard key
released and key typed and let's just go
ahead and copy those from oh no it's
probably like tutorials go copy and
we'll paste it in this new one right
here so now when you want to stop
running our program remember all we have
to do is hit escape and if you don't
know what the where these are coming
from you have to watch the tutorials
from like five tutorials grow or
something so now pretty much anything
they do with the mouse or keyboard we're
going to be able to capture that data
and respond to it accordingly and
whenever we want to exit whenever we hit
the egg escape key it's going to stop
our program so I'm going to go ahead and
run this see if I got in hairs which I
don't and I know you guys can't see but
I'll tell you guys what happens right
now it says you are moving the mouse and
I'm moving the mouse around the screen
right now now let me hold down my mouse
button and now move it and now that's
dragging the mouse so now it says on my
screen you're dragging the mouse so what
else did we do oh it said I release the
mouse and when I press it it says you
press down the actually it says OSU
whyyy because I spelled it wrong you
release the mouse press released you are
moving the mouse and I guess that's it I
still have my keyboard press released FD
and of course escape ends the program so
another guys couldn't see any of that
but that's pretty much what did if you
run this program yourself then you're
going to get to see it but that is how
you capture data from the user via the
keyboard or the mouse and of course this
is very important and when we're doing
game development because if you made a
game that didn't involve the user or the
keyboard or the mouse at all it would
pretty much be a boring game you might
as well just make Sudoku where you can't
even look into anything it's like giving
some guy a crossword puzzle without pen
I mean how fun is that seriously but for
now I just want to thank you guys for
watching hopefully you're going to stick
with me on my next tutorials and we are
one step closer to making awesome
computer games and Java programming
language so again thank you that's all I
can say don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
