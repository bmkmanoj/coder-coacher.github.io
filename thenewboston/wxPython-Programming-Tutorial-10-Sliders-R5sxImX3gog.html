WX python tutorial and today I'm going
to be teaching you guys how to use
something called a slider now what a
slider is is pretty much whenever you
see those little um like gauges that you
grab and you slide it long in the number
changes um that's what it is so I'm
gonna show you guys how to do that let
me actually first tighten this up a
little bit but there we go right there
so the first thing we need to do is
create a slider object I'm just gonna
name my slider you can create or you can
name whatever you want
and next we need to set equal to WX
period slider this is gonna create our
slider for us now this takes actually a
bunch of parameters so listen up the
first parameter it takes is the parent
and ID we already knew that that was
coming the next thing it takes is a
couple numbers the first number it's
gonna take is the default value so I'm
gonna make this slider 1 to 100 so I'm
gonna set default at 50 the next thing
it takes is the minimum amount on the
slider so let's go 1 and after that of
course the maximum amount so default
don't get this ID confused default
minimum maximum so then we have a slider
the next thing we need is the parameter
is to position it somewhere in our panel
sorry I pierced that POS stands for a
piece of I'm just going to say it's for
position 1010 you can position yours
anywhere you want next we need to do the
size I'm gonna put the size equal to
something like 250 and better put those
in parameters 250 and negative 1 we'll
give it a default height and next we
need to do let me move this over a
little bit and after this we just need
to give it some styles so let's go ahead
and put style and there's a bunch of
different styles for this I'm gonna put
the first style I want is WX
SL underscore actually I think that this
might be yeah I'm pretty sure that
horizontal is default so let's go ahead
and just add SL let's see WX SL and I'll
show you guys what I was talking about
back then and a little bit a uto ticks
come on it's filler a house you know
it's kind of hard to uh tell you guys
what tics are but whenever I run my
program I'll show you guys what they are
and make your pipeline two separate
styles and put WX SLE labels so we have
two styles Auto ticks and labels and
I'll show you guys what those are um
after so we move this over so you guys
can see and good enough even better so
let's after this we need to set the
ticker frequency and I'm just gonna go
ahead and do this since you guys don't
know what tickers are are yet without
seeing it so let's go ahead and put
slider let me get this nice and
correctly positioned sliders it in
here's how you do this set ticker or
tick fr EQ essential frequency next you
want to put how far apart you want them
and then always put one I don't know why
they make you put that one it's for
positioning but just do it now you guys
can finally figure out what a slider it
looks like in what tickers art this is a
slider right here and actually I just
talked to you guys through it right now
we went and created our slider right
here we put it in the panel negative 1 4
I d50 see how it's set at 50 I didn't
touch anything but if we slide this we
can change the numbers
the default is just when as soon as you
run the program what it's set it on
default it can go from one to the
minimum to 100 the maximum if you guys
can see minimum maximum the position is
10 10 sighs 251 now let me talk to you
guys what these styles mean
right there now I didn't put horizontal
because as you can see it's horizontal
and by default there is a vertical style
its SL underscore vertical that can make
this go up and down um Auto tix what
this means is it'll display these tick
marks these little grey marks under here
those are called ticks in again how far
apart those ticks are that's what we did
right here
let me see if I can get it set tick
frequency this means there are five
ticks apart and don't mind this one
that's positioning I don't even know why
they had to do that in our last style
what was that actually oh yeah labels
what this label does is it gave the
label for the minimum and maximum value
if you don't want this then you don't
include this at all but again Auto ticks
give you these ticks and labels include
these labels or numerical values at the
top so this is your basic on how to
create a simple slider again if you want
great someone texted me thank God I'm
done with this tutorial so again here's
your code right here do exactly as I do
and play around with those Styles a
little bit depending on how you want
your style or a slider to appear so
thank you guys for watching in the next
story I'm gonna be showing you guys how
to do I don't know it's gonna be awesome
guaranteed so just don't forget to
subscribe and check out my next tutorial
so thank you and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
