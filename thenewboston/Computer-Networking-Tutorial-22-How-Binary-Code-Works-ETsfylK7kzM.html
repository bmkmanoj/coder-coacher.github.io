tutorial I'm going to be showing you
guys how binary code works now in case
you don't know what binary code is is
pretty much all those zeros and ones
that the computer understands what you
can't and with these zeros and ones it
could translate that to make any number
in the world and I know you guys are
asking how can you make any number using
just zeros and ones well I promise you
by the end of this tutorial you were to
learn that now in case you ever heard
someone talking about bits and bytes
probably if you've ever been around a
computer if they say my RAM has 512
megabytes in it or I have a 32-bit
processor or like Nintendo 64 and stuff
that 64 is based on bits and bytes in
binary code so by the end of this
tutorial you're going to understand all
of that but before we understand bits
and bytes we need to first understand
how our number system works our number
system is a base 10 number system that
means we got 10 numbers to work with 0
through 9
unlike binary which is a base to
computer system which means it only has
two numbers ones and zeros and um let me
show you guys a number real quick well
this pretty much represents is that any
number can root can be represented by
combining any other number in our system
so if we want to make the number 463 we
need to use the for the 6 into 3 now the
3 represents the 1 spot the 6 represents
the 10 spots in the 4 represents the
hundreds spots and as you can see as I'm
talking those are all 110 100 a thousand
million those are all factors of 10 so
that's pretty much how our number system
works on base 10 but the computer number
system it works a little bit different
it only has two numbers and this this is
just a little tidbit of information the
word bit comes from binary digit C bull
it bit and for example if you wanted a
4-bit system that means
you're going to have four numbers one
zero zero one or it could be 1 1 1 1 or
0 0 0 however many numbers you have
that's how many bits are in your system
now let's just get down to it and let me
explain to you guys how binary code
works now as you can see instead of 1 10
100 1000 we increment in factors by 2
and that is 1 2 4 8 and the next number
you can just go along with by timesing
the previous number by 2 in by using
these numbers we can come up with any
number from 0 to 128 now as you can see
this is a basic 8-bit system but if you
want to use a bigger range of number say
you want to go to like 6 billion then
you might use something like a 64-bit
system but this is pretty much an 8-bit
system and by the time I'm done showing
you guys how this works you're going to
be understand you're going to understand
how a 64 256-bit system works so we're
saying all right what if I want to get
the number of 19 now if I had a 10 based
system I'll just write 1 and 9 but we
don't we have this 8-bit system so what
the heck are we supposed to do what you
have to do is look at all of your bits
128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1 and there's only
one way that you can add these numbers
to create the number 19 so you start
with the biggest number and that's 128
if you can use 128 in 19.1 if you can't
put 0 so can 128 go into 19 no it can't
0 can 64 nope still bigger 32
nope still bigger can 16 go into 19 yes
it can go in once now what you have to
add to 16 to get 19 do you add 8 nope to
add 4 nope that will give you 20 do you
add 2 yeah but that will give you 18 do
you add 1 yep that gives you 19 right
there so an 8-bit
system the binary code for 1900
0 1 0 0 1 1 and the computer understands
this and it's just job to take all this
code and interpret it into the number 19
so let's do another 1 or 2 say you um
say you want the number uh 64 let me
just write there write it right there
can 128 go into 64 nope can 64 go into
64 yep and there is no need since we
already have it we just fill in all the
rest for zeros right here right there so
the binary code in an 8-bit system and
remember 8-bit system means there 8
numbers 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 and that means
64 and as you can see by using this we
can get any number from 0 to 128 and if
you're saying alright how do I get 0 if
there's no 0 that's easy just plus 0 for
everything 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 and no matter
how many bit systems you're running all
zeros mean is 0 and of course the
maximum that you can have actually I
lied this is a 255 so this has a range
from 0 to 255 and if you're wondering
alright how do I get the number 255 128
plus 64 plus 32 plus 16 plus 8 plus 4
plus 2 plus 1 equals 255 and if you
don't believe me then you can check it
and if you want 254 just change this one
to 0 128 plus 64 plus 32 plus 16 plus 8
plus 4 plus 2 equals 254 so those are
the basics on how binary code works and
how you can use ones and zeros to
combine these and I use this to get any
number you ever dream them your only
limitations is how many bits are on your
system and that's what scientists in
whatever the engineers are trying to
develop to get the biggest bass bit
system so we can transfer more data and
have a bigger range of numbers so the
that is your simple tutorial on how
binary works so now that you understand
how you can use ones and zeros to get
any number on the computer I hope you
learn something thank you guys for
watching make sure if you have any
questions to check out my website - New
Boston comm and I'll answer any
questions you have there so again thanks
for watching make sure to subscribe and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
