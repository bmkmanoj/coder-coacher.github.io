whenever I'm putting the Experian is I
like to get everything positioned pretty
much laid out so we go ahead a general
location right on them now we went to
about the steering wheel first because
it's pretty easy
so go ahead okay take a bracket that's
really that's your steering wheel and
line it up to where it goes in the frame
now go ahead and I take your bolts screw
in this steering wheel what right here
is held on through two bolts right on
top so we're going to go a hand tighten
those person and I'm going to use my
registered attending down a little bit
now what you want to do is connect the
bolt that is attached to your ball joint
through your steering knuckle right like
that and how these I don't know if
you can see it but now I don't think you
guys got a good angle but there's a hole
through these bolts so what you do is
you stick the bolt down and you screw
this none and as you can see this cut is
kind of a weird looking screw or excuse
me we're looking not so what you're
going to do is you're going to screw
this on and then once it's on there the
pin goes through the hole on your bolt
so let me go ahead and show you guys get
it through your known I can get it now
what you need to do is take your pin get
some players and needle nose pliers
would probably be the best and sift it
through see if I can get it
oh halfway there
come on there we go now just open your
pen up on the other side and bam look at
that now do the exact same thing to the
other side and once you do you're ready
to move on to the rack you can clamp the
rack on the frame and I'll show you guys
how to do that all right so now all you
have to do is finish bolting leave your
clamps on going to hold the rack and
then your steering column is going to be
complete now if I can get a good angle
of the rotor keep an eye on this right
down there and also the steering wheel
whenever I turn left we're going to go
left
whenever I turn right we're going to go
right so there you have it that is how
you hook up a steering system steering
column so uh congratulations you now did
that and I guess oh oh yeah
don't forget to subscribe add me on
Twitter add me on Google+ send me
$10,000 in the mail and uh I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
