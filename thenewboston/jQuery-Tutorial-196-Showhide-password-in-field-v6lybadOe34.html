field that exists with the type password
and then we'll go ahead and start the
actual process of replacing this data so
it's not really a complex piece of code
but it's slightly longer than you might
expect so obviously follow it through
carefully
and take a look at what we're actually
doing and it should make sense so the
first thing we want to go ahead and do
is wait for our document to be ready so
wait for the Dom to be loaded and
everything and inside here we create a
function so when document is ready we
have this function everything inside
here is we want what we want to run when
the document is loaded this is just
really standard jQuery notation that we
would use when we write you know pieces
of code and other belong to jQuery okay
so the first thing we want to do is go
ahead and place this checkbox after
every password field or every instant of
every instance sorry of a password field
that's on our page so over to our ext
dot J's file again we're going to need
to use a selector and that's this
selector is going to select all types or
all inputs with the type password so we
use a selector input which on its own
would select all input fields but we can
go ahead and use square brackets and
inside specify which type we want to
select and in this case we're selecting
all fields with a type password so quite
straightforward in terms of selectors
what we then want to go and do is use
the after function to place and code
after each field and what this will do
is it will just literally put it next to
the field so this is perfect that in the
sense that what we want to do is just
add an input type of the check over the
checkbox or an input with a checkbox
type okay so in here we're going to
write some sort of HTML we're going to
put this input field in so we go ahead
and use input type equals something and
this is obviously checkbox so now you'll
notice that when we refresh you see this
checkbox appears after the
password field if we were to duplicate
this password field in our index dot PHP
file it would work the same way and and
this would be appended after it will
just go take a look at that now we'll go
and copy this and just put a break
afterwards and paste that in and when we
refresh you see it's done exactly the
same for this however if I was to say
change the third one or change the
second one we'll just change to a type
text you can see that it doesn't adhere
or this checkbox isn't is an output
after the text field so this is
obviously compatible with all password
fields so it's like cross-compatible
ok so we need to assign an ID to this
checkbox to be able to assign an event
handler to it so I'm going to go ahead
and give this an ID of SP underscore
checkbox SP just stands for show
password and after this we want to just
give the user's and text to know what
the checkbox actually does which is
obviously show the password so when we
refresh now we've got the check box and
show password so now the process of
actually showing this text or this
checkbox after the text field or the
password field we need to assign an
event handler for when this tick is
ticked or untaped so the event handler
we need to use is change so we come down
to the next line and we want to go ahead
and select dot SP underscore checkbox so
now we're selecting all or all elements
on a page with the class SP checkbox and
that should only be the one here that
we've generated for every password input
type so we want to go ahead and assign
the change event handler to this
checkbox or this this particular class
and we want to go ahead and create a
function inside of here that will run
when this changes so let's go ahead and
just alert something out so
changed for example now when we refresh
and we check this box oh it should have
worked but it hasn't okay so let's go
and take a look at why that might be
so it's dot oh sorry yeah I've given
this an ID and I meant to give it a
class so we I mean it doesn't really
matter what you do you could assign an
ID but obviously you would use a hash
here but I'm gonna keep it as a class
for now so let's go ahead and type class
then it's gonna be a lot easier to
modify this in CSS if you require so now
that we check it that value has changed
all that checked value has changed so we
get this changed box or alert box when
we uncheck it we also get changed so now
when this changes we can go ahead and
start the process of showing the text
inside of here so let's go ahead back
over to our text editor obviously get
rid of that alert because we don't want
to be doing that okay so we're gonna go
through and create six different
variables so we're gonna we're going to
assign values to six different variables
the first variable is going to represent
the object that's in front of this
checkbox or the object that's before
this checkbox and obviously the object
that's before every checkbox with the
class espy checkbox will always be this
field here because we assigned this
straight afterwards remember we used
after two to pop this checkbox after the
password field so I'm gonna give I'm
gonna create a variable called pre-prep
or previa shot for previous and this is
going to be equal to this dot preb which
again stands for previous</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
