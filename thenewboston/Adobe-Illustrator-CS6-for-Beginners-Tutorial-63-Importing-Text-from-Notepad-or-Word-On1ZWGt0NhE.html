illustration to toriel and in this one
we're going to learn how to import text
so say your boss gave you a Microsoft
Word document and he wants you to
include it into your illustrator file
and you're thinking to yourself oh crap
I'm gonna have to type this in all into
the thing by hand well you actually
don't have to do that you can just
import it and it's really easy so the
first thing you want to do is have a txt
file if you have a text document you can
import something from notepad it can be
from Microsoft Word so the format files
that it takes are text which is txt and
that's plain text rich text format which
is RTF and these are going to be the end
things where it's going to say dot txt
or RTF you're going to get a microsoft
word which is a docx do C or D ocx the
do CX is Microsoft Word 2007 and later
on so keep those in mind so remember
it's a text like something from notepad
Microsoft Word from 2003 up and rich
text formats which you can pretty much
save anything into rich text format all
right so let's open up notepad and we'll
start writing something out down reading
down the work and I'm just going to add
a couple different things within here
I'm going to add a tab right here and
see what's going on all right so I'll
show you what's going on with that I'm
just writing random things that are come
to my head I don't know why some of this
stuff is it coming to my head so please
don't judge me
I've been one a ps4 so I'll put that in
there well along with Final Fantasy 15 I
don't know if everybody likes that game
it's not out yet but alright so there's
some things and I'm just going to hit
save as and I'm going to save it in a
folder that I know
add we'll just say this is you Boston
import text so I know what it is and
just save it and I'm just going to exit
out of my notepad now I'll delete all
this stuff that I made and we're going
to go to file and illustrator and then
we're going to go to place and I'm going
to find what I just made so if I can
find this new Boston there it is click
on your text here you want to make sure
this says all formats that way
everything you'll you'll be able to see
the text and then click on place and
then we get these text import options
now this is going to be different um for
the different types of files that you
import so if you imported a Microsoft
Word one then it's going to have
different stuff than this but they're
not for the most part you don't have to
worry about um what's going on here if
you know what extra carriage returns are
then you'll know whether or not you need
to check these off but if you don't know
it there then you don't really need to
know so hit OK and there we go now we've
got all our text imported already easy
as pie I wanted to show you that about a
little bit about carriage turns you can
find it on Wikipedia and pretty much
it's just a mechanism that brings the
cursor back to the beginning of the text
or something around there it's used in
programming in the C programming
language and in the Unicode so if you
guys know what it is then you if you
don't know what it is you might want to
check that out and give it a read but
it's really not that important only read
it if you have it like a lot of extra
time or something like that so let's go
on and see what else we got so it looks
like that's all there really is to
importing text I don't see anything new
in my notes or anything like that so
we're good to go
you can see that the tabs have been
added
and if you had it checked if you had
just had three spaces like if you press
the space bar down three times let me
just show you what I'm talking about
extra spaces here says replace three or
more spaces with a tab so if you have
you can update that but if you have a
couple spaces it will change it into the
amount of space the tab button would put
down instead so there you go then some
all for importing text and it's fairly
easy and use it when you need to when
you don't feel like write down a ton of
stuff that your boss makes it right down
in Illustrator so I have a good one
everybody hope you learn something</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
