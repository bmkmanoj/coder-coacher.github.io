tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
teach you about variables so all you're
going to need for this tutorial is a
button and once you've been on your form
just go ahead and double click on it
alright so I'm sure you've heard about
variables before and a variable is
basically just a placeholder it
basically just holds the value of
something and you can access it by
simply typing the name of the variable
so the first step in creating a variable
is typing a type or variable which
you're going to create and the first
variable type that we're going to be
looking at in this tutorial is a string
so we're going to go ahead right here
and strength now a string is basically
just text so we could set our string
equal to like Adam or really any text so
now we have to give a name to our
variable you can name your variable
anything you would like but in like math
or something like that I usually just
call it X or Y or or something like that
but usually in programming you're going
to want to give you your variable and
name something you can remember so you
can name it something like name and I'm
just going to have this string hold my
name so we're just going to want to set
this equal to text so I'm just going to
want to put the equal sign and then to
represent text and c-sharp you're just
going to want to put two quotes and then
inside of these quotes you can put the
text that you want your name variable to
hold but now my name is Adam so I'm
going to put Adam right in here so every
time we want to access Adam instead of
typing out Adam we can just write name
and since name holds Adam whenever we
access name it'll be like we're directly
access an Adam Ari and of course you
have to end the line here with a
semicolon alright so we were to just
type out message box show here and put
name and suits we just put main and side
right there you get a message box saying
Adam and that's because this name
variable and it's a string holds the
value of Adam so we get a message box
saying Adam and you wouldn't get a nice
a box saying name inside of it alright
so let's just make sure that this works
here
bug and click this button yep we get
Adam alright
and if we were to set this name variable
equal to something different then we get
a message box saying that person's name
so if we just got set name equal to Joe
then this name variable will represent
Joe right here so every time we access
name now represents Joe so now we'll get
a message box saying Joe yep Joe all
right so that's really all there is to a
string variable the next variable type
that we're going to be looking at is
called an int so we're just going to
type out right here in and an int is
basically just numbers so an integer and
following the name of the type of
variable that you're creating here in
want to give a name to your variable so
I'm just going to call it number cents
an integer is basically just a number
and I'm sure you've learned that in math
integer can only be or it has to be a
whole number so it has to be like like 1
or 2 3 or negative 5 or something like
that so now we're just going to want to
set it equal to a number I'm just going
to say equal to 5 since 5 is my favorite
number and now every time we want to
access 5 instead of having to type out 5
you can just type out number right here
so we can just say number and we'll have
a message box display number now since
number is not a string or text and this
message box calls for us to pass through
a string we're going to have to use the
to string so we're still on type right
here to strength and to string well
basically this convert this number right
here or this int into a string so that
we can access it or have it be displayed
inside of a message box so now inside of
our message box we're not going to get
number dot to string we're going to get
a message box saying $0.05 number
represents 5 and we're converting that
number variable into a string yep 5
perfectly alright and obviously if we
were to set this number equal to
something different we would get that
message box so we got like 66 is set
number equal to 66 now this number
variable represents 66 so we're getting
message box tank 66 yep
all right and the next variable type
that we're going to be looking at is
something called AB rule and you
probably really haven't heard of a rule
before but Google can just hold the
value of either true or false
so if we just type out dual right there
now we're going to want to give a name
to our rural variable again you can call
it anything you would like it's your
variable I'm just going to call it red
and compare and I don't have red hair so
I'm going to set this equal to plus and
again since this is a pool you can study
equal to either true or false nothing
different so we're just going to type
out false right there since I don't have
red hair now to display this red hair
variable side of a message box we're
just going to want to type out red hair
and then dot two strings so again we're
just going to want to convert it into a
string we're going to do dot two string
and now it'll just convert this red hair
variable into a string and again we're
not going to get a message box saying
red hair to string we're going to get a
message box saying false because we're
converting this red hair variable into a
string and red hair represents false so
now it's going to get a message box
saying false yep you can also set a rule
equal to true so if we're going to say
right here true now this red hair
variable holds the value of true so now
we should just get a message box saying
true yep all right
so the last variable that I'm going to
be showing you is something called an
object and you can set an object equal
to anything so an object and hold the
value of literally anything so we can
just type object right here and now
we're going to want to give a name to
our object or to our variable and I'm
just going to call it my object or you
can call it anything you would like and
again we're just going to want to set it
equal to something so it's going to put
an equal sign right there and now we're
going to want to have this object hold
the value of something and again we can
turn a knob jecht equal to anything so
if we wanted to set equal to true we
could do that so now in order to square
object inside of a message box we're
going to have to do dot to string again
because an object obviously is a master
so we're just going to say my object dot
to string and it will just convert this
object into a string so we should should
get a message box saying true since my
object represents true yep and you can
send an object equal to anything like
I've said so if you want to have it pull
the value of a string you can do that so
we want to set it equal to Adam then we
can do that so now we should get a
message box saying Adam since our object
holds the value of Adam so we should now
get a message box saying Adam yep you
can set it equal to an integer as well
so if we wanted to set it equal to the
number like five now my object right
here or this object variable represents
five so when we convert this object into
a string we're just going to get a
message box saying five all right yeah
perfect all right so that's pretty much
it for this tutorial on using variables
so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
