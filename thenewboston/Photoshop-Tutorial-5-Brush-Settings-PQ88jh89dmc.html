tutorial in Photoshop last time we
talked about colors and this time we're
going to be going into painting the
brushes now as you see say left hand
side this is your brush menu bar you
have three basic choices here the brush
which allows you to paint smooth lines
the pencil which allows you to paint
more jagged and hard lines and the color
replacement tool which we'll be talking
about later will mostly be working with
a brush tool but one other thing that I
want to talk to you guys about the brush
tool is that you also have an airbrush
option as well if you go click on this
symbol right here at the top and scroll
down you can see this kind of faded
brush looks and if you click on one of
them you can see that this provides kind
of an airbrush look at the brush now
this is useful when you want to not
paint hard lines and go from gradually
from colored color so just keep that in
mind so I'm going to switch back to my
basic brushes and one thing people ask
me all the time is how do I paint a
straight line say you wanted to paint a
straight line and you were doing the
freehand I think the lines sometimes
aren't always that straight so if you
wanted to paint an exact straight line
this is what you do click anywhere where
you want to begin your point with your
brush now say you wanted to paint a
straight line from here to here all you
would do before you click down your
second point is hold down the shift key
and click with your mouse as you can see
I painted a perfectly straight line from
point A to point B and you can keep
holding down your Shift key and painting
straight lines to get the desired shape
you want
you can always go back to freehand just
by letting go of the shift key and say
you want to paint a perfectly straight
line either perpendicular or parallel to
the screen what you do instead of
clicking the shift key you would just
hold it down the entire time when you're
painting so just press the shift key and
as you paint from left to right it gives
you a perfectly in line with edge of the
image and this works up and down as well
as you can see is my mouse cursor goes
from left to right it doesn't vary just
gives you a perfectly straight lines
though
so those click and shift up in options
and shift and drag options are two ways
to paint a perfectly straight line now
the last tool wanna talk about is the
color replacement tool now what this
does is your face is replace a common
color in an image so it's going to
select our color replacement tool and
say we wanted to change this guy's shirt
to green what we do is go to our colors
palette and pick whatever color we want
and you'll just simply paint over the
image this is useful when you watching
them on shirt color or eye color or
something like that as you can see just
painting this real quick that his shirt
has now changed to a shade of green
there are also some better ways of doing
this which we'll talk about later but
here's one basic way to replace color in
your image now next I want to talk to
you about basic brush settings so let's
go to our basic brush again and talk
about the settings there are two ways
you can adjust your settings one is a
toolbar at the top of your screen right
here and the other is just by
right-clicking anywhere on the image and
it'll bring up all your settings these
are the exact same as you can see the
toolbar gives you a list of brush tips
you can use and if you click this little
right arrow right here you can select a
different drop-down list of different
types of brushes
this will give you some custom brushes
that Photoshop has preset and you can
always change the diameter by using this
slider up here as you can see it gives
you a wide variety of brushes some
useful some not so useful the mode we'll
be talking about in the next tutorial
the opacity is just the transparency you
can set that from anywhere from 1 to 100
and the flow is just the pressure of
your brush so as you can see Photoshop
gives you a wide variety of brushes that
you can use already built into Photoshop
but let's say you didn't want to use any
of those brush presets and none of them
were quite right for you if you want to
create your own brush tip you can always
go over here and click this little panel
called brushes this will bring up a wide
variety of options for you to create a
custom brush tip including width of the
brush direction of the brush and angle
and all of these options are pretty
self-explanatory all you have to do is
select what you want and simply begin
painting
and say you got the brush you made and
you want to save it because you know
you're gonna be using it for a while
once you got the brush just how you want
it click the drop down menu at the
beginning of the screen at the top click
this right arrow and click a new brush
preset as you can see the brush room we
made is already set in there you can
name anything you want and click OK to
save it now
say you've been painting for a while and
you move to some different tools to get
the brush back that you saved simply
just click on the brush icon again go to
the drop down list click the little
right arrow and click load brushes these
will give you all the brushes that you
saved but for the most part
RORO be working with the basic brushes
and that's what I'm going to talk them
out in my tutorials so now that we
covered brushes in the next tutorial
we're going to be covering the basic
modes of the brushes and finding out
what all of these mean and if you missed
anything I went over today you can
always check out my website the new
Boston comm I'll give you a step-by-step
tutorial of everything that we learned
