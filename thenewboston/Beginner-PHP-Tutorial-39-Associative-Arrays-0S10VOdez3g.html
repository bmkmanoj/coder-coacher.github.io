with another video for the new Boston
now in the last video we talked about
arrays in this video we're going to be
looking at associative arrays now
associative arrays store data in the
same way but allow you to change the key
from 0 1 2 3 4 however many keys you
have to a name of your choice so first
of all and this is from the prior
example I'm just going to do this now as
it stands we've got an array set up with
four different types of food in so we've
got pasta pizza salad and vegetable
which turns out to vegetables so at the
moment this is key 0 this is key 1 this
is key to and this is key 3 now I want
to store some useful information about
this at the moment we've just stored
like this ok it's not very useful and as
it stands and obviously if we want to
list this food then it is useful however
I want to add some elements to this
array that are could be used in say a
specific in real-life environment now
what I want to do is I want to rather
than have this as the value I want to
assign a value to pasta of the amount of
calories that you might find in it the
same with pizza the same with salad and
then lastly the same with vegetables so
I want to assign a value and to assign a
value to this key remember this isn't a
value anymore I'm going to say equals
and then a greater than sign and I'm
going to add a certain amount of
calories that this can be equal to so
pasta we might say and 300 calories
Pizza we're going to say equals and
greater than might be a thousand
calories salad we might say is equal to
let's say 50 calories in fact now that's
not really realistic 150 calories and
then vegetables I'll say you equal to 50
now if you carefully watch remember
using our commas after this we're
assigning this all in one and then it's
separated by commas if you watch
carefully and how this will change and
I'll tell you how this will change
before
it does now this zero is going to change
to pasta and then this equals and grater
and sign is going to tell us how many
calories here and the same with the
pizza salad and the vegetables so if i
refresh you can now see that pasta is
equal to 300 Pizza is equal to a
thousand salad is equal to 150 and
vegetables is equal to fifty so our key
of pasta is holding a value of 300 our
key of Pizza is holding a value of a
thousand our key of salad is holding a
value of 150 and our key of vegetables
is holding a value of 50 so now what we
can do is instead of accessing let's
just comment this out as before we
accessed array element like this we used
0 1 2 so if you imagine this would be 0
this will be 1 this would be 2 this
would be 3 now if I was to try and
access say element 0 that's past of 300
calories and when you refresh the page
you can see nothing's happened
now why is nothing happened because the
key of 0 doesn't technically exist
anymore at least well view in actual
fact this has now become an associative
array because we're associating pasta
with a value of 300 so now if we echo
out the food the contents of pasta with
in this food array will now retrieve the
value 300 the same as if we were to echo
out the calories in pizza this will then
equal 1,000 so you can see that we've
now created an associative array we're
associating values to different
different keys and it's by Association
so you can understand now why it's
called an associative array so this is a
best way in PHP especially when you deal
with databases later on these if you've
worked with databases before and you
know what fields are or column column
names are sorry you'll have you'll have
the option to use an associative array
when you gain data from a database so
associative arrays are really really
good to use especially when you don't
want to remember you know 0 1 2 3
because that can be a bit annoying but
yeah that's basically associative arrays
