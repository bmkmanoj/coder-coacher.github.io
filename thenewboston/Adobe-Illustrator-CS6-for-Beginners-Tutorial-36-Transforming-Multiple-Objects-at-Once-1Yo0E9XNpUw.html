cool Illustrator cs6 tutorial where
we're gonna learn how to apply multiple
transformations and the transformation
command we're gonna use is called
transform each and that's what this is
pretty much about using the transform
each command it allows you to transform
such as rotate reflects scale and shear
multiple objects relative to their own
reference points instead of to a single
reference point and I'll explain that to
you so what I'm talking about is when
you go ahead and select two objects and
you do something like rotate it's gonna
rotate by its own reference point which
is probably right here in the center and
then when you rotate these they're gonna
rotate over long the whole entire page
but if you want to rotate along both of
their own centers you're gonna have to
use the transform each command so you go
to object you go to transform they come
here to transform each and say I want to
do something like rotate these 23
degrees each and I hit ok you can see
that these change rotated 23 degrees
each also I had on scale 50% so they
went down 50% let me go back and then
I'll take that off because I forgot that
I actually had that on let's put this
back to a hundred so that it doesn't do
anything and we'll do this 223 and I'll
hit OK and you can see that these scales
along each other if I go up to object
and go to transform and hit reset
bounding box it's going to reset the
bounding box to the same and now we've
got this new looking shape which is
basically the same shape that we had
before just rotated 23 degrees and that
rotated both on itself instead of
rotating along the whole entire page so
that's something you might want to use
so let's go check out some of the other
options that we have
select but one or more of your objects
go to object transform transform each
now the hotkey is alt shift ctrl D but
that seems like a lot to remember and
you don't need to remember it at first
just remember to go up here and once you
start getting other hotkeys memorized
then you can start doing that so we've
got scale and we scale by percentage
here we can move everything so it's
pretty much the same as just moving them
up and down together is there's not too
much of a difference let's check it try
it let's move these both with 50 pixels
to the right and that's what it did it
moved them to the right and I also left
the angle on which I forgot about so if
I hit OK again now it's only going to
move these 50 pixels to the right again
and there we go and you can pretty much
do that any way by just moving them like
this go to object reset bounding box it
won't be slanted anymore I'll transform
each let's look at what else we have put
this back to zero as you can see they
don't reset every time they always have
the same thing we've got other options
reflect on though x-axis reflect on the
Y we've got a random we've got a scale
strokes and effects and transform
objects selected and scale strokes and
effects stroke when you scale your
object the stroke is going to scale
along with it as well as any other
effects you may have on it and that's
good for keeping your your stroke
proportional to your object transform
objects here it transforms only objects
so if you have like a pattern then it's
not gonna transform patterns if you
don't have transform patterns selected
we have a bowl selected it's gonna
transform both I don't have any patterns
on there so it doesn't really matter too
much
next thing down here this is your
reference point and this means it's in
the center you can click on these other
ones to change where your reference
point is and if you want it to be in the
bottom right corner then that's it for
each of your objects and so on but
that's what we've got we've got a
preview here where we can actually
preview what we're gonna do before it
happens so if I go fifty here and I hit
my preview you can check it you can see
the different angle that it can take and
if I have zero out there it's not gonna
do anything
so the defaults are 100% for scales zero
pixels for move zero degrees for angle
in case you ever get messed up with
those so that's that now I'm going to
show you some cool after this in the
next tutorial called the transform
effect so stay tuned for that give this
video a thumbs up if you liked it and be
sure to subscribe to check out more new
boston tutorials when they come out so
thanks a lot for watching this one
hopefully you guys have a great day
today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
