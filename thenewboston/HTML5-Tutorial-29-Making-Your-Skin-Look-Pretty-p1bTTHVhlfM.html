tutorial and in this tutorial what we're
going to be doing is we're going to be
styling through CSS the look of the
video player so we're not going to be
making it work or anything like that but
we're going to be making it look awfully
pretty so the very first thing we need
to do is since we said okay we're
linking to a CSS file we probably should
go ahead and make that file right now so
go ahead and hit file new and save this
as main I think I called it main dot CSS
oh where are your buddy cascading style
sheet and save that baby so now the very
first thing we want to do is we need to
use those skills this dumb stupid cord
for my headphones keeps getting in the
way so go ahead and hit body and we want
to Center this bad boy so text align
center and that's just going to center
our video player now I know that I don't
have you know a header a footer article
or any of that crap but what I like to
do whenever I'm working with anything
html5 tags like section or nav I like to
go ahead and just include everything
because then if I add anything later on
then I'll be good to go so header let's
see if I can remember them all section
footer aside oh that's he is in F what
are they
article and H group I got a feeling I'm
forgetting like two of them but that'll
be good for now so what I want to do is
I want to take all of these in this
flame is a block because remember some
things are not blocked by default so I
just want to get everything on the same
page um I've got an itch on my head
embarrassing so now what do we have next
now that we got all our housekeeping
stuff done we can go ahead and start
styling this baby now remember our video
in our nav player pretty much make up
our entire movie player and that's why I
surrounded everything in something
called a skin now if you've ever
downloaded like a bunch of a legal arm
you know like Kaza Napster they have
these a lot different skins are like
different fields or like different
layouts you can
like a forest theme or like a Barbie
theme which I tend to prefer but a skin
is pretty much the overall look of your
video player so remember this entire
thing was surrounded in a section called
skin an idee skin so let's go ahead and
style that baby now so skin anytime we
have something in the skin let's go
ahead and first thing we need to do is
set the width of the layout so remember
our video is 640 pixels wide so of
course our skin it needs to be a little
bit wider than that since our video is
going to fit inside it so I'm just going
to go ahead and hit 700 pixels whatever
your video is make it like 50 pixels
wider or somewhere around then it
doesn't it can be like 50-100 whatever
you want just make sure it's wider than
your video next I'm going to give it a
margin because by default this is
pressed right up against the top of the
screen and I want to but it down about
10 pixels just so you know it looks a
little prettier so 10 pixels Auto is
going to move it down 10 pixels from the
top of our website and after this I want
to give it a padding now if you put your
video right in your skin then there's
going to be no space between your video
in the background so what we want is a
padding so you know we want a little bit
of separation or else oh it's going to
look funny
so padding of about 5 pixels is going to
give us a nice border around our video
and we also want the background to be
red
now I typically don't like your red
because it's a really weird color but
whenever you're teaching these things on
YouTube it's going to be really easy to
see a nice bright red background so
after this we need a border and this is
going to be the border around the skin
or around the video player and I'm just
going to put my like 4 pics solid black
and you typically only want it one or
two pixels bug in for demonstration
purposes I want a nice thick black
border so the very next thing I want to
add is I want to give this thing rounded
corners now actually I'm not sure if you
need the WebKit for this if I just put
border-radius I think that
that is standard right now so this
should go ahead and give it rounded
corners without adding WebKit actually
let me go ahead and refresh this and see
yup there you go so by the way there's a
little tip anytime you use border-radius
you can just use that you don't need
WebKit or anything and like I said we
have a width of 700 pixels a margin of
10 what that does is it just moves it 10
pixels from this line to this line and
let's see what else the padding is
pretty much the space between the video
in the border this nice little red line
because I didn't want it to butt up
right against there on the background of
red the border is of course solid black
and the border radius just gives it nice
round corners so now that are pretty
much overall skin is taken care of we
can go ahead and move on to the next
section now under our skin we have our
video which we don't need to take care
of because you know that's just their
video we can't really change it and lets
me film a new video and we have our
navigation bar
now the navigation bar has our play
button in it which is right there and it
also has our progress bar which isn't
shown up because we didn't make one yet
so let's go ahead and the very first
thing we need to do is make some overall
settings for this navigation so I'm
going to go ahead and hit nav and I'm
going to give it an overall margin just
because I want this nav to kind of
separate from the video I don't want to
bunched up I'm going to give it a margin
of 5 pixels zero pixels and this is just
going to you know give it a little bit
of spacing on top and bottom so after
this what do we have after this the
buttons now I have a div tag right here
and I called it buttons but the truth is
there's only one button inside here I
just named it buttons because if I ever
decide to make more buttons later on
maybe I want stop on or forward rewind
button I can add those buttons but now I
only have one button so you know I
didn't want to mislead you guys so let's
go ahead and style those buttons section
right now so I'm going to make an ID and
I'm going to call it buttons and in here
the first rule I want to make is
float:left now on all the video players
you too
boob I'm just going to use YouTube is my
standard the play button and pause
button they're all on the left hand side
and this is how they achieve that
float:left now after this I need to give
a set width for those buttons or for the
buttons section and that's because I'm
going to give a set width for the
progress bar and you need to define
widths because when you're making
calculations later on you need to know
the width of these things so with I'm
just going to make it like 70 pixels
anything from like 5200 should be fine
and I'm going to go ahead and give it a
default height too so I'm going to give
it a height of 20 to pixels and that
should be pretty good so now let's go
ahead and save this in refresh it and
see what it looks like we got our play
button which has a little bit of spacing
on the top and bottom
it's floated to the left and even though
you can't see it has a width of 70 and
the height of 22 and right here on this
section right here is where our progress
bars are going to go or whenever the
video plays you can see a little thing
that's going to move as the video starts
and stops and you can also are going to
be able to click that and move the video
around but we have to program all that
but before we get to the programming we
actually have to make it in CSS and I'm
going to be showing you guys how to make
that and it's going to be absolutely
amazing and then I'm going to show you
guys how to program it so anyways enough
of me talking about what I'm going to do
I'm just going to end the video and then
the next video you guys can follow along
with me so thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe and I'll see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
