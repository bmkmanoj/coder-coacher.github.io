and in this video what I want to do is
eventually we're gonna be adding some
more animations to this guy so he can
jump and run and do a bunch of cool
stuff like that but right now check it
out his world is pretty small I think he
needs a little more area than this
stupid platform to walk around so what I
want to do first of all just scroll out
a little bit and select all of these
tiles just by holding shift on your
keyboard and once you have them selected
hold ctrl to make another instance like
this and I would just want to give them
like a little um well probably just one
just the hop on and actually if I hit
view make sure you have snap to grid so
he's going to start right here and then
I'm gonna have once we have the jump
command the user can jump down and then
this is gonna be the ground so hold down
control
and just go ahead and build it a little
ground for him and this is probably
enough so now if I scroll out you guys
can see that we now have a very simple
and basic world he's gonna start right
here and actually if I run this okay so
he can like slide down but eventually
he's gonna be jumping and running and
ice hitting his head on that thing
that's a little bit of problem and also
if we look at the screen the screen is
kind of a you know crappy resolution we
want to give this a little bit better
resolution allow the user to see more of
the gaming area so once you have a
little world made remember this dotted
line right here this is the window this
is pretty much the user's view of how
big they can see now in order to expand
this if you go to your projects tab
right here right next to your layers tab
and you select the word new project
these pretty much give you the
properties for your entire project your
entire game so to speak so right now the
window size is 854 by 480 which to make
it like hi-def which is 1280 720 hi-def
and this is gonna watch this dotted line
whenever I press enter that's gonna make
the window a little bigger and of course
the bigger the window size the better
the resolution so now when I run it
check it out or dude much better view
and well he is good to go basically so
the reason that I made this tutorial
real quick is because in the next
tutorial we're gonna be doing is we're
gonna be adding the rest of the
animations pretty much to get them
running jumping and a whole bunch of
stuff so it's gonna be kind of long so
um that's what you have to look forward
to in the next oreal but for now as
always thank you guys for watching don't
forget to subscribe and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
