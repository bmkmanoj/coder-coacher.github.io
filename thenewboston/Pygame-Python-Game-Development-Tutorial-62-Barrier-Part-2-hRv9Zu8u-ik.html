another PI game tutorial video is video
we're actually going to be visualizing
and drawing up our barrier to our game
so what do we need change here basically
we want we only thing we actually have
to add to this function at this point
before it gets called is we're gonna go
ahead and do my game draw dot Rex
where do we want to draw the rect game
display what color do we want it we're
just gonna make it black for now and
then we specify the actual location and
all that so this is going to be we want
the X the Y and then we've got like
width and all that that we want to add
to this function so the first thing that
we want to add is you've got the X X
location and then you've got basically
display underscore hi - random height
now why are we doing that for the y keep
in mind that the height of y even though
it feels to you because of math class in
high school that Y as you add 1 to Y it
goes up but that's not the case in PI
game in really computer graphics ever
it's actually y is 0 at the top and then
goes down so you have to keep this in
mind so this is the display height is
actually gonna be display height minus
the random height and then that will be
how tall you want Y to be anyway that's
the y and then you've got width for now
we're just gonna throw in 50 that makes
the barrier 50 pixels wide and then how
tall is that well it's rent its caps on
random height tall so the starting point
is that Y that's above and actually
let's well we have to bring this up but
the starting point is you know in the
middle of the screen which really it
starts at the top of our
our barrier and then we add to it moving
down but anyway you'll see what I mean
in a minute if you don't already follow
anyway so that's our barrier now we need
to stop calling barrier here otherwise
we're gonna get twenty barriers that
would look actually kind of interesting
I kind of want go ahead and leave that
we'll never see it though because it
will clear but just for kicks and laughs
and everything well cut that and then we
go down to the game loop and basically
so we're in our game loop and then
before we actually draw everything so
we've got the tank now we can draw the
barrier I'm just gonna paste this for
loop in there just to get a good idea of
our barriers first let's go ahead and
just do one not my good zero one but
anyway to play oh right okay so that's
already doing it for us that's cool now
I really want to do 4x and range 25 so
it'll probably look like music or
something so anyway it's running through
this loop part of the problem is we
don't have a constant variable so we're
getting basically this I am really
curious because 4x and range let's do
you okay play nice
does you know it looks like some crazy
music nothing too sexy or anything but
good so anyway there's that we can move
our tanker on our tank is like uh what
do I do
I'm just not sure how to navigate this
so we can see that basically this is
pretty good I'm not sure or you can
shoot an art click over this point maybe
we could with enough power we'll see
about that one but the other tank could
like hide right here but then again you
would never be able to make the shot
either anyway that's pretty good we'll
go ahead and we'll keep that for now
that looks pretty cool too so now what
we want to do is we need to slow this
down obviously and we want to just
basically we don't have like
/ rendering of the game loop so you
basically you're gonna have the tank
game and then obviously you're gonna
shoot each other until one person blows
up and then that's game over or you win
right either you blow up in it's game
over or you beat them and you've won and
then you want a new barrier right you
don't want the same barrier every time
and you also can't really have this
although this adds a degree of
interestingness to your game but
basically this barrier is like one big
giant barrier because you're probably
not gonna make the shot any other way
but anyway so let's close out of this so
the next thing for us to cover is
actually putting that barrier in a
position that isn't going to just like
refresh every time so that's what we're
gonna be doing in the next video and
give you a hand we're probably gonna
have to modify some of this stuff and
then only modify this every time
so basically be moving the function down
to game loop and then barrier just draws
a barrier but we'll save that for the
next video so anyways hopefully you guys
enjoyed as always thanks for watching
and stay tuned to the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
