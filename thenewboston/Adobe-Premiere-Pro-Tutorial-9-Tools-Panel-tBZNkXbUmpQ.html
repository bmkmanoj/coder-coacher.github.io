to your ninth Premiere Pro tutorial and
in this tutorial I'm going to be going
over one of the most important panels
and probably the last main panel
tutorial I'm going to do and that's the
tools panel now that's all of this crap
right here but first of all it bugs me
that it's over on the bottom right
because on all of the other Adobe
products it's over here on the left so
what I like to do is I like to drag this
over all the way until it's placed right
here and again this is just wasted space
so I'm going to drag it just like this
and that's how I have my interface set
up all the time I just didn't want to
drag it over there because you know for
everyone out there watching it's
probably over here and I didn't want to
get you guys confused but this is how I
always have my interface set up so
that's how I'm going to stick with this
tutorial so now let's go ahead and go
through all of these tools I'll go ahead
and tell you what each one of them does
it and also tell you the hotkey forum
now the hotkey is if you're too lazy to
go and click on the tool you can just
use a keyboard shortcut and see how the
tools are switching back and forth so
the very first tool is the selection
tool and the hotkey for this is V now
the selection tool is the tool that
you're going to use 90% of the time it's
your main tool you go ahead and use it
to select clips um you can go ahead and
move clips and you can go ahead and
actually if you go to the end of a clip
for example this title is 5 seconds long
and you want to make it longer just go
ahead and go to the end of the clip and
then it's going to change into two
little arrows with a bracket
pull this out so now your title is 10
seconds long instead and this works the
same with a video clip again you can't
make it any longer because hey you only
filmed for like 11 minutes you can't say
oh what would happen if I saw the
feature so you can make it shorter by
doing that but again you can't make it
longer than you were originally filmed
for because you know it has no way of
knowing what you filmed in the future so
pretty much the selection tool is for
selecting Clips moving stuff around and
changing the length the other tool we
have right underneath is
tract select tool and that's a now let
me go ahead and show you guys an example
of when this would be handy whenever you
have multiple things on the same track
you can select them individually by
using the selection tool or if you want
to select them all at once you can go
ahead and hit the track select tool and
now once you select it it selects the
entire track so for example if you had a
title a video and the ending title you
can just go ahead and hit this real
quick and it's going to select
everything on video one and also audio
one since they are linked together now a
ripple edit tool in the hotkey for this
is B what this does is it change here
let me go ahead and demonstrate this so
now we have a title that's about 10
seconds long and I'm just I know you
don't know how to cut but now we have a
video that's 10 seconds long so if we
put them side-by-side just like this
using the selection tool we see that our
a this is 10 seconds long this is 10
seconds long basically our entire movie
is 20 seconds long so what the ripple
edit tool is going to do is if we go
ahead and select it or hit B it's going
to change a length of a clip but the
other clips on the track adjust
accordingly so pretty much they don't
change any other clips in any other way
so in order to use this say you wanted
to change the length of this title from
10 seconds down to 5 seconds so go ahead
and put your current time indicator of 5
seconds and now slide this right to 5
seconds and now check it out your title
is now 5 seconds long but the rest of
your movie it doesn't change so it
pretty much changes the duration of one
clip or one image but it leaves
everything else the same
however this next tool under it the
rolling Edit tool is a little bit
different it pretty much does the exact
opposite of the ripple edit tool it
keeps the total length of your entire
movie but it changes both of these
durations for example you know whenever
we slid this it didn't change this one
at all well check it out now now
whenever we slide this for instance we
want to make this
fifteen seconds long it's going to go
ahead and bump that video so it shortens
this so pretty much here's what I'm
saying whenever you use the ripple edit
tool it doesn't mess with the other
clips at all it doesn't alter 36
whenever you're using the rolling it
does change the clips it does alter
other clips so again I really don't like
to use those tools because I really just
like to do it with the selection tool
and I really only use the selection tool
in the cut tool to be honest because
everything else is kind of advanced and
it's really easy to see whenever you use
these two basic tools so anyways aside
from that I can go ahead and talk about
another tool now and that's the rate
stretch tool and that's this thing right
here what the rate stretch tool does is
it pretty much takes a clip and let me
go ahead and hide this temporarily so
we're only looking at video 1 it takes a
clip and it pretty much changes the I
want to say changes the speed of it so
you see how this clip starts out with me
looking down and it kind of ends with me
with my eyes closed
well that total length of time that that
takes to happen is 10 seconds however
with the rate stretch tool we can do it
in 20 seconds and now that entire motion
is going to go twice as slow so it's
pretty much if we play it now
everything's going to be in slow motion
your no I'm more talking like this
however if we take that entire clip and
make it only half the time now
everything is going to be super speed
and we'll be talking I'm like the second
random fast part so that's what that
does it pretty much unlike you know just
the selection tool whenever you're
taking a piece off the end or you know
you want to start at a different time it
slows the clip down or speeds the clip
up now the last tool I want to talk to
you guys about well not the last tool
but the last really important one is the
razor tool it's probably my second most
used tool after the selection tool what
it pretty much does is
takes a clip and it splits it into so
for example I want to take this clip and
I want to add a title in between so I'll
go ahead and get rid of my title first
and now it's split this in two with a
razor tool and with a selection tool
I'll move it apart and my title in
between and now move it back together so
pretty much the movie stops and then you
can see the title and it picks up right
where it light leaves off so that's what
the razor tool does and since the hockey
is si I call it the cut tool but it
really isn't called the cut tool but if
I call it that you know don't hate so
that's what that does in these other
tools I'm really not a big fan of them
but I guess since you guys are probably
going to yell at me if I don't cover
them I'll tell you guys about to slip in
the slide tool I never use the slip'n
slide tool because I absolutely hate
them but the slip tool it pretty much
changes the duration whenever you have
three clips in a row you know I changed
my mind I'm not even going to talk about
them because they're really advanced
kind of technique for editing and we're
just here to cover the basics but
whenever you have three clips in the row
then this these things do some really
weird things
now the pen tool let's just go ahead and
skip down to this the pen tool lets you
add keyframes for example you know
before when I told you guys that you can
change the opacity by selecting a clip
and going under here and making
keyframes with this or you can go ahead
and just change it right here in it add
a keyframe well you can also add it
right on the timeline by using the pen
tool say you wanted to add a keyframe
right here and maybe right here and
right here then you can go ahead in your
effects controls and switch from
keyframe to keyframe and maybe fade this
one out and fade this one out too and
now you have really weird-looking clip
so it's pretty much all the pen tool is
is an alternative way to make keyframes
that's it now the rest of these tools
are really simple so if you guys feel
like you're getting overwhelmed then
trust me I'm about to dump things down
all
all the hand tool does is it's basically
the same as this thing right here you
can go ahead and drag on your timeline
and move it around really simple really
boring I never use it I just go ahead
and use this all the time now the zoom
tool is even more simple say you're
zoomed out and you're like alright I
want to work on this piece specifically
just go ahead and maximize over there oh
I had to hiccup and let go and there you
go it just zooms in say alright I'm
going to work on these two keyframes
zoom in and there you go so again I like
to use this zoom tool instead so
basically there are three different ways
you can zoom on this thing right here
which I never use because it's annoying
this little bar at the bottom which I
use a hundred percent of the time or
this tool which I guess if you like
using the tools there you go so that's
basically all I have to cover on the
tools again slip-and-slide are really
some weird editing techniques and you're
never really going to use them unless
you're like making a full motion picture
movie but for now we're discovering the
basics so don't really worry about that
so thank you guys for watching this
tutorial and in the next tutorial I'm
probably just going to go over the rest
these panels real quick because yes
they're useful but we really don't need
to concentrate on them as much as you
know to go over every single thing like
we did with the effects controls or the
tools so the rest of the panels are
probably just going to take one soro
and then we're going to get to the
really cool stuff and showing you some
really cool tricks so again you started
out as a newb and hopefully you got a
better understanding of Premiere Pro
right now some upcoming tours I'm going
to take you to intermediate Premiere Pro
user to total professional so that's
what you have to look forward to thank
you guys for watching don't forget
subscribe and I'll see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
