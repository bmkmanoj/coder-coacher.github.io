tutorial and in this story I'm going to
be teaching you guys how to draw lines
now in order to draw a line you need a
couple different parameters you need a
position of the first point position of
the second point and there's also an
optional width parameter that you can
have if you want so let's go ahead and
make those as variables right now so
let's go ahead and work with the color
first so sell a color variable and you
could equal do like 200 by 255 by 64 mmm
sounds pretty random so now we need to
have position points so position one
will set it equal to 20 20 have a 20
over and 20 down position to make a
variable for that I'll set it equal to
like 151 43 whatever so now we have two
positions this is gonna be a starting
point on line and this is gonna be the
ending point of the line so we have a
color and two positions so let's go
ahead and draw this so let's go ahead
and pygame draw the line is the function
name and of course we want our basic
screen our color and now you need to put
the first position first probably gonna
figure that out in your second position
second now by default it draws a line
that's one pixel wide as you can see
here's my first position right here and
here's my second position right here but
if you want what you can go ahead and do
is add a let's say 1 2 3 4 you can add a
fifth optional parameter and this is the
width of your line so if we went ahead
and type something like 8 when you went
ahead and did this and saved it we now
get a line that's 8 pixels wide so as
you can see that's how you can use that
optional fifth parameter to change the
width of your line so that's your whip
real quick tutorial on how to draw a
line again the parameters for this our
screen color first position second
and this last one is optional width
parameter you don't need it but you
probably can use it a lot so I thought I
tell you guys so again that's your
tutorial now that you know how to draw
lines you're ready to move on in my next
tutorial so thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe and I will see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
