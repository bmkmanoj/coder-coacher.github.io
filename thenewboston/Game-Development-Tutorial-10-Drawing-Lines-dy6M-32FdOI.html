tutorial and in this story i'm going to
be teaching you guys how to draw lines
now in order to draw a line you need a
couple different parameters you need a
position of the first point position of
the second point and there's also an
optional width parameter that you can
have if you want so let's go ahead and
make those as variables right now so
let's go ahead and work with the color
first so sell a color variable and you
could equal do like 200 x 2 55 x 64mm
sounds pretty random so now we need to
have a position points so position 1 i
will set it equal to 20 20 have it 20 /
and 20 down position to a variable for
that well set it equal to like 150 143
whatever so now we have two positions
this is going to be a starting point of
line and this is going to be the ending
point of the line so we have a color and
two positions so let's go ahead and draw
this so let's go ahead and pygame draw
the line is the function name and of
course we want our basic screen our
color and now you need to put the first
position first probably going to figure
that out in your second position second
now by default it draws the line that's
one pixel wide as you can see here's my
first position right here and here's my
second position right here but if you
want what you can go ahead and do is add
a let's say one two three four you can
add a fifth optional parameter and this
is the width of your line so if we went
ahead and type something like eight when
you went ahead and did this and saved it
we now get a line that's eight pixels
wide so as you can see that's how you
can use that optional fifth parameter to
change the width of your line so that's
your whip real quick tutorial on how to
draw on again the parameters for this
our screen color first position second
position
this last one is optional width
parameter you don't need it but you
probably can use a lot so I thought I
tell you guys so again that's your
tutorial now that you know how to draw
lines you're ready to move on in my next
tutorial so thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe and I will see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
