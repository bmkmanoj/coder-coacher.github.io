video I'm going to show you how to
perform calculations on dictionary
values rather than the keys if you guys
are like wow that sounds incredibly
boring I am probably never going to need
this check this out
let's say that you just out of this
awesome formula - I don't know like
predict the prices of stocks so you have
all these stocks and the first thing
that you gotta figure out is just what
is I don't know like the cheapest stock
so you try to do something like this
using your programming skills alright
I'm just going to print min it gives me
the minimum value of some sets some data
set or iterable so I'll just write
stocks right there and it should give me
the cheapest one wait a minute it said a
APL hmm let's look at this right here
that's not right see Apple is 325 bucks
and the cheapest one looks like Ford so
why the heck isn't this working
well it actually did work just not in
the way that you thought see by default
whenever you're running these
calculations on a dictionary it's going
to look at the key rather than the value
so this is the key and this is the value
so it did give you the minimum one it's
just that the minimum one in
alphabetical order was Apple but that's
not what we want we want the cheapest
one which is Ford so how the heck do we
get that long stocks no not let's figure
this out all right so we can't just sort
it the default way or else we don't get
what we want what we actually need to do
is we actually need to create a new list
and we do that by using zip now whenever
you use it what this is going to do is
it's going to return a list of tuples so
what we can essentially do is anytime
you have two lists we can essentially
zip them together so what we're going to
do is we're going to get a list of these
values and a list of these values and
we're going to tie them together so the
value is first so essentially what we
end up is with is something like this
instead of goob
four three four we end up with four
three four gook and then we end up with
three to five AAPL there we go so again
this isn't valid Python but I just want
to demonstrate what we're essentially
doing let me just go ahead and comment
that so you guys can see all right so
let me just say mint price holy min rice
the minimum amount of rice that I can
eat in one day is one pound no less what
am I talking about all right let's go
ahead and keep going art so we're
getting the minimum still we're going to
get the minimum value but instead of
just throwing our dictionary in there
before because that's just going to sort
by the keys what we're going to do is
this we're going to zip two values
together now what values do you want is
it together or the first one is just
going to be the values so how do we get
that we just read stocks values easiest
thing ever
now the second one is going to give us
stocks keys so all we're doing right
here is instead of having the keys first
in the value second all we're saying is
put the values first in the key second
easiest thing you've probably ever done
in your life and now let me just print
out what we found so print out mint
price and there you go all right so what
we did is we now reorganize that
essentially that's all we did and we
print out the minimum which is indeed
forward so there you go that ladies and
gentlemen is how you perform custom
dictionary calculations on the values
rather than the keys you can go make
millions with your incredible awesome
stock formula now I'm going to keep
making videos so I'll see you guys next
