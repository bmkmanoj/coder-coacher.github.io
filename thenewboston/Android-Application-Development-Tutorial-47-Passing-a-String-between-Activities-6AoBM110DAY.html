we scroll through 47th Android tutorial
we're going to do in this tutorials
basically start passing data by opening
an activity so we set up this uncheck
change listener last tutorial I was
going to define some stuff but basically
we haven't oh we have no way to access
this class because we haven't set up an
intent and started an activity yet so
we're going to basically be done with
this open clasp right now so just save
that and then go into your data class
right here and we're going to do is
basically we have this all set up as
well within this within this method
right here where we say button start
activity this is where we're going to
pass some data so what we want to do
first is set up basically a string that
we're going to pass some data that
because we're going to pass a string
over to that other class for the most
part that open class so we're going to
set up the string within here so it's
going to be kind of a local variable
we're going to call this string bread
which is kind of a confusing thing but
it'll kind of make sense here in a
second second so we're going to let this
string equal is basically whatever edit
text whatever edit text has typed in so
we're going to say our edit text was
called send et so we're going to say
send et dot get string I'm sorry get
text it's kind of good review and then
dot to string because it needs to be a
string basically we set up a bread
variable to equal whatever edit text is
and then that's what we're going to send
so basically how you send stuff is you
send it through a bundle you guys you
guys have seen bundle a few times when
we've been working with data for the
most part with a camera application so
we're going to set up and basically you
can think of a bundle as kind of a
basket so we're gonna say basket and
we're gonna just say new bundle
and there we go now we just need to put
this string variable in our batter I'm
sorry this bread in our basket for the
most part because we're going on a
picnic so what to do that all we have to
do is say basket dot put string and as
you can see there's a ton of different
things if you guys are trying to you
know put some other type of data in
there or like a integer you'd say put
int since we're passing a string we're
going to say put string and you have a
few different choices we're going to use
this one where because we aren't working
with a string array and we aren't
working with a string array list we're
working with just a string so I guess
there's just only just one choice here
basically what a key is this is kind of
the reference this is kind of giving
this kind of the file name for the most
part store next activity can look for
that file name that's basically what a
key is and then our value is going to be
basically what we're passing which is
going to be bread so we're going to say
bread right here again referring to that
string we set up which will be whatever
our edit text is and now we just need to
label this key so we're gonna say I know
I'm hungry now I'm just gonna say dang I
don't know I can't think of anything
clever we're going to say key is that
clever enough so ho ah there we go
we basically labeled this string file
key so when you can access that in the
next next are basically in our next
activity that starts up so basically
we've set our bread in our basket by
saying put string and we just gave that
string variable a key called key and
then all we have to do is set up an
intent because we want to open an an
intent we're going to call this just a
pretty basic and then you have to import
intent maybe I already have and as
always we say new intent but this is
going to be a little bit different
parameters for the most part so instead
we're going to say basically we got to
give the context and then we got to say
what class we want to open
so we're going to say basically the
context of this class which is called
data so we're going to say data dot this
comma and then we're going to say the
class name that we want to open and so
we're going to say open class dot class
and basically that makes this reference
a class reference so just referring to
the class name and it's going to open
that class for the most part and then
all we have to do is say start activity
and we're going to hit a because that's
the intent we set up so again basically
there we go we have we set up a bundle
that's going to be passed through this
intent for the most part but let me just
talk through this again because it might
be kind of confusing we set up a string
called bread and it's just basically
going to be equal to the text of our
edit text and then convert that to
string then we need to set up a basket
for the most part or a bundle and that
bundle is just going to be a new bundle
object and then we can put some stuff in
that basket or in that bundle if you
guys want to think of it the correct
correct way and we're going to put a
string in there we label the string key
that's basically the file name that's
that it's going to refer to and then the
value of it is equal to this bread that
we set up right here which is our edit
text then we set up an intent and this
intent kind of holds the data this class
and then or the context of this class
and it's going to open the class called
open class now we have to do one other
thing sorry I kind of got ahead of
myself here all we have to do is set up
this basket within our intent so we're
going to let hit our intent which is
called a and dot put extras and as you
can see it takes a bundle within its
parameters so we're going to click that
and then type or bundle which is called
basket sorry I forgot like the most
important part
so hopefully that take confuse you guys
too much but yeah basically we set up
our basket here then we're setting up
the context of whatever class we're
going
the data is coming from and then what
class its opening to and then all we
have to do is set up the intent and say
hey we're putting some extras carry this
basket with you as you go and then it's
good like alright and then you're going
to start that activity sorry if I kinda
went out order there but hopefully you
guys get the concept because we did have
put extra before and this is just adding
to the intent for the most part which is
our bundle so the command is just put
extras I don't know that's about all I
can explain hopefully you guys kind of
get that idea if not that's ok I'll see
you guys in the next tutorial where
we're going to basically open that
basket and eat the bread so have a good
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
