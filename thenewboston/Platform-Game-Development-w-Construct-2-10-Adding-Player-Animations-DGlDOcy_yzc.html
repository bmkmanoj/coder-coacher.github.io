sweet tutorial and in this video we're
gonna be importing different animations
for this player so right now check it
out he just like he can go left and
right but it looks like he's just
sliding on glass or something not very
cool looking and obviously we want him
to do things like look like he's running
and actually jumping instead of just
like immediately just increasing his uh
you know how your it ever looks kind of
weird right now so that's what we're
gonna be doing importing different
animation and it's gonna be kind of
repetitive but after you watch this
video you guys are gonna be pros at
learning how to import animations and
use different animations on the same
player so the first thing that I want to
do is actually just double click this
guy and of course whenever you do we
have all these windows pop up and right
now you guys can see that we have one
animation right here so in order to add
another animation what you can do is you
can right click this and hit add
animation so the first thing I want to
do is rename this to idle to run and
what this animation is going to be is
basically an animation of him going from
standing to running because if we just
put arm whenever you press right just
start running it's gonna look weird like
he just immediately got shot out of the
cannon so that's why we need a
transition from idle and full out
running so that's what this is right
here so the next thing we need to do is
make sure that you have it selected of
course and then right click in this
animation frames window and press import
sprite strip now this one is in sprites
jungle performer player and idle to run
this is also called tween and of course
we want to choose the sprite sure of
itself and press open and this is
actually always gonna guess the proper
amount and press ok now delete this
first one because that was the default
one and the first thing that you should
always do is crop it so hold down shift
on your keyboard hit crop and remember
it corrupts every single image and then
once your origin tool is selected then
you can just go ahead and hit the number
two on your keypad and then right click
the origin and press apply to whole
animation so if that was too fast then
you are in luck because we got to do it
a couple other actually the one other
thing that I want to do before this is
make sure that you have um I told or
unselected and for the speed we're gonna
be tweaking the speed and also the Lew
for each one able to run we're gonna set
the speed at 15 and also know because
once he's standing and starts running
you know you don't want them do it over
and over again it's just going to
transition from one to another so
fifteen no and then it's good to go so
the next one we want to add is just the
full-on running so once that selected of
course what we want to do is just right
click import sprites trip sprite strip
so this one is flare run and as you can
see this is pretty much just a em
running obviously now open this okay
delete the first one and first thing we
want to do is shift and crop and as you
guys can see just an animation of him
running
so now let's select the origin tool hit
to and apply it to the whole animation
and for this I can make sure you have
this run animation selected and once
your origins are in place for the run
set this at fifteen and we actually want
to set this loop - yes because basically
when this animation gets done and he
gets done with one loop of running as
long as you're still running just keep
looping the animation over and over
because he's not stopping so if he did
if you had not loop then he would run
and then his foot what's then
we'll place into a slide obviously not
the effect that we're going for it so
another thing that I want to do is add
jump from run and what this is gonna do
is we're gonna have them jump in two
different situations the first one is as
he's running if you jump it's obviously
gonna look a little bit different than
when you're standing still and then you
jump so this is obviously the run with
or excuse me the jump to do Wow he's
running so what we wanted to do is
import straight strip cannot say that
word
oh well player jump from run select jump
and run open delete the first one and
crap soak up all of those and as you can
see here he is getting ready to jump and
that's pretty much it obviously so the
next thing I want to do is set the
origin to two looks good okay or good
point cool to where you're supposed to
go where's the to apply to the whole
animation and for the jump from run the
only other settings that I want to do is
hit the speed at 15 and of course we
don't want to loop this one either
because we don't want to him like
crouching and jumping over and over
it'll look weird now the last animation
that we have to import add animation is
jump from stand so of course this is
gonna be the one where he jumps from
standing still so import sprite strip
and I got it right that time jump from
stand jump from stand delete the default
one drop all of them
change your origin point and apply to
whole animation and for the settings for
jump from stand the speed of this is
actually going to be twenty two and it
just looks better that way and for the
loop of course we are gonna put no
because we don't want to doing that
animation over and over and over again
so now just go ahead and make sure that
everything is good to go all right it
looks pretty freakin good and make sure
your properties are proper which they
are and once you're good to go
that's it so again I know the process
was kind of repetitive but again the
process well I'm not even gonna explain
you saw four different times well five
now including all the toriel's so I
think you guys for watching you can now
close out of this and in the next
Sorrell well obviously we're gonna be
working on the game some more so I'll
see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
