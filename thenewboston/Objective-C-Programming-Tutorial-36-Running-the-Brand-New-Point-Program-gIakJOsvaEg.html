tutorial in this little mini series of
how to build a origin for your rectangle
and the first thing we're going to want
to do is go ahead and import your XY
point header so it knows what we're
working on so XY points the header it
looks good so now again you see I get
got rid of everything except the stuff
we always have and that's kind of a lot
of stuff they shouldn't make like one
little keyword for that but anyways
moving on more we need is a rectangle
object for a rectangle class and we need
a separate point object and later we're
gonna be well you'll see rectangle not
rectangle rectangle there we go that's a
little bit better we'll name this object
R and we'll set this equal to rectangle
Alec in it and we'll make another object
and this is going to be the point object
XY point and we'll just name it star P
give it a nice short name XY points Alex
some space for it and initialize the
object so now we have two objects you
have rectangle and a point the first
thing we want to do is take that point
and set the X&amp;amp;Y hold on a sec I have an
itch in my ear oh yeah right there
I'm good to go now anyways what we want
to do is take that P object and this is
remember whenever working with point
object we're working from within the XY
point class and remember we have a set
XY method to set the X&amp;amp;Y points so if
you see right here what it does is we
pass it the first number and it sets it
to X and you pass it the second number
and it sets it to Y and then it has an x
and a y value so let's go ahead and just
do that right now that kind of looks
like sexy
cool and let's go ahead and pass it 100
and 300 so now our origin is just a
blank origin flow in the space is one
hundred over one two three hundred up so
somewhere around right here actually
how convenient so now what we want to do
is make our rectangle a rectangle set
width and height and we made this pretty
much the same way so let's make ours six
by eight again doesn't really matter
what you make it for this tutorial so
now we have just an origin chillin and a
rectangle chillin not related at all so
what we want to do is go ahead and
actually relate those and check this out
our rectangle has a property named
origin right here but nothing is
assigned to it yet
so what we want to do is take our
rectangle object take the origin
property and we want to set it equal to
that P object which is that point or
origin so now our rectangle has an
origin of 100 300 so not only does it
have a width and a height right now it
also has an origin pretty cool
so now let's not do that so now our
rectangle is good go let's just go ahead
and print out everything I mean I can
print out the width and height I guess
and that's log I and I is percent I
percent I nothing too fancy here so
let's just go ahead and put our width
and this is going to be the width
property of the right thing when our
duct height there we go what the H is is
that's pretty cool way to write it
actually but you know I'll get air but
an s log at and let's just go ahead and
pry out the origin now so origin is at
percent I percent I so what the heck am
i typing and now to in order to get the
origin check this out
our rectangle has an origin object
right but that origin object has
properties X&amp;amp;Y so in order to do that we
call our the origin and then X so now we
need to call for Y rectangle has the
origin in that origin has x and y value
we've got specify what one we want so
that should be good right there if my
math is correct and that's what math
you're talking about I don't know
so NS log less we want logged the Arian
parameter or perimeter
what is parameter oh yeah I always
forget that area and perimeter are not
is our percent I and percent I
respectively but we want slept
respectfully because I'm not spell it JK
our area and our perimeter see I think
we should be good right now you know
we'll see when you get 800 errors but
anyways once we're done with all our
objects we're done with a rectangle we
can release that and I am done with this
point so you can go ahead and release
that so now let's run this baby and see
how many errors we get no not enough bad
so let's go ahead and check this out
make sure it works the width and height
is 6 for width a for height
just like we passed it the origin is a
100 300 of the rectangle good so far and
the area and perimeter methods still
work so one last time what we did is we
made a rectangle object so we can pretty
much make a rectangle we made a point
object named P I mean and this was
pretty much the origin or point I use
those terms interchangeably by the way
will late to tell you now so we made a
random point on the screen and we made a
random rectangle and then we took and
assigned that point to the rectangle and
then we just printed out everything to
make sure it works and don't forget the
rectangle has an origin object and that
origin has properties X and
why so that's how you get those right
there and then the rest of the stuff was
from the last tutorial
it still works we're just making sure we
didn't mess up anything in the class so
that's all the time I have for you for
this tutorial I'm thinking yes for
watching this little miniseries don't
forget to check out the next tutorial
