your 14th objective-c tutorial and in
this tutorial we're going to be talking
about something called a nested for loop
now you already know what a for loop is
and what a nested for loop is is a for
loop inside of another for loop so why
would you want this
well we already made a program with a
for loop no big deal but what if we
wanted to run that entire program let's
say three times well what we need to do
is put it inside another for loop with a
loop count of three and then able to run
that entire program three times so let's
go ahead and demonstrate this and I'm
also going to be teaching you guys a
couple other cool tricks as well or
maybe I'm not I guess you guys are going
to have to wait and see
we first need that int variable called
user num and this is going to store the
variable that the user enters of course
and now let's go ahead and make our
outside for loop so we want this entire
program to run three times so what we
would do is put in a and set this equal
to one and now what we need to do is put
a is less than or equal to 3 and a plus
plus so now whatever we put inside this
loop is going to run three times you can
put an entire program inside here and
that's what we're going to be doing so
and don't forget I don't know if I told
you this or not maybe this is one of
those cool tricks you can declare a
variable which means give a datatype
right inside the loop the declaration so
you don't have to put in a up here and
then a equals one you can do it all
inside the for loop and now with that
being said inside this for loop whatever
we put in here is going to run three
times so let's go ahead and put our
program NS log and inside a put will
make this program a little bit different
but enter a number and we will print it
that number of times so for example
let's say that explanation point if they
enter 5 it's going to print out 5 5 5 5
5 if the N or 3 is going to print out 3
3 3 not only print that number but
that many number of times pretty cool
huh and now after this we need to give
them a way to enter the number so we
know that awesome scanf function from
last time and they are going to be enter
integers and of course put enter or
ampersand sorry and then put user num so
whatever number they enter is going to
be stored in the variable user num and
remember these two things are going to
be repeated three times so far so now
after this we can go ahead and make a
for loop so go ahead and put forward int
will name another variable B so we
really have three variables in this
program user num the counter for the
outside for loop in the counter for the
inside for loop a and B respectively
so now we'll set this equal to one to
begin with because you pretty much do it
every time and you put B is less than or
equal to user num and this is going to
allow it to print it out this many
number of times so now after this go
ahead and put B plus plus and now since
we don't have multiple lines of code we
only have one line we don't need curly
braces curly braces are only needed when
you have a block of code and a block of
code means more lines than one when you
don't have a block of code and you only
have one instruction then you don't need
um curly braces around it but you can
it's optional so let's go ahead and put
um let's just go ahead and print out the
number NS log and put a @ sign and put %
i and user come on off user num and I
blow my nose one thing and I'm not going
to pause it either
where's my hanky where's my hanky
you
here's my hankie yet it's gross I know
you guys are like Bucky are you going to
edit that out well obviously not because
I'm really lazy and I have a running of
Oh
all right game time all right so now I
mean our program should work fine let's
go ahead and run this and see how it
does save it and let's see enter a
number and we will print it out that
number of times so let's go ahead and
under four and it says four four four
four
it runs the entire program again enter a
number and we will print it out that
many number of times six six six six six
six six enter number and rerun in that
many number of times 2 2 2 and now our
program the entire program exited with
status of zero which means everything
went well so let's review one last time
with this did we have this inner program
here that is really simple it says enter
a number we enter a number and it stores
it in the variable user num and then
what it does is it loops through that
many number of times printing that
number each time so if we entered 5 I
print 5 5 5 5 5 pretty boring but it's a
core concept it's a small program and
what we did is we took that small
program and we encapsulated it in a
bigger program that ran a set number of
3 times so now if you have like three
different users they can each do the
program once or if you have one user
wants to do 3 times this is how you do
it so again this isn't really a useful
program that you would use anytime but
it demonstrates the possibilities of a
for loop check this out a for loop
inside of another for loop and why it
can be useful so later on we'll be using
this and it will actually be useful in
bigger more complex programs but for
right now I just want to demonstrate the
concept to you guys so thank you guys
