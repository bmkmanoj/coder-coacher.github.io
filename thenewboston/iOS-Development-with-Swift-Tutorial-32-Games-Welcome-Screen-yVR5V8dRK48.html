this tutorial what I'm gonna do before I
start typing a whole bunch of code is I
want to kind of take a step back and
explain you guys real quick exactly how
your game is gonna be structured and set
up and it's not only this game it's any
game that you make with spray kit this
is how its kind of all put together so
whenever you're making a game it's gonna
be broken up into a bunch of different
screens for example you're gonna have
your welcome screen you might have a
jungle level you might have a space
level you might have I don't know like
the ending credits whenever the user
beats the game now each of these screens
is technically called a seam in sprite
kit it's pretty easy to follow along if
you did any app development before so of
course each screen or scene is broken up
into two parts your user interface and
in sprite kit these are called the sks
files they stand for sprite kit scene so
this is pretty much what the user sees
and if you scroll out and you can zoom
out by clicking this button and bottom
right you see now that the welcome
screen that we have is now just plain
empty blank grey so eventually we're
gonna add some buttons on here that are
like hey welcome maybe another one that
says view high scores whatever but this
is pretty much one scene the interface
and the brains behind it now I'm gonna
show you guys in just a second how to
create another scene and this is
actually just gonna be the first level
and then I'll show you guys how to
transition from the welcome screen to
the level that we create so the user can
start playing the game so again real
quick one last time each level or each
screen that we create is going to
consist of a user interface called SKS
file and the brains behind it so simple
enough let's go ahead and get started
well there's one other thing that I want
to do before I actually start creating
everything and that is this if you hop
over to the game view controller 99% of
the time I'm gonna say stay out of this
file this is a lot of the background
stuff that you really don't need to
worry about however there is
one method in here called support
supported interface orientations and
these are pretty much the rules of what
orientation the user can hold the device
whenever they're playing your game now
most of the time and my default it's set
up as either just portrait or landscape
so it doesn't matter if they turn their
phone on or not but for this game I only
want to allow them to play the game in a
landscape mode so if I delete this and
delete that I'm gonna return and it
actually takes an integer believe it or
not this is kind of just bonus
information but you know might as well
learn it there are different integer
values for the different positions the
user can hold their phone so there's one
integer value for you know just holding
it normal like a portrait there's
another one for a landscape on the left
hand side so that's why it takes an
integer and you don't have to worry
about what the integers are because what
we can do is you type UI interface
orientation and we're looking for masks
right there and what you can call is a
landscape of left which pretty much if
the user tilts it 90 degrees so it's
widescreen to the left and we can just
get the raw value of this so again the
integer value is at 6 is it 1 as a zero
it really doesn't matter we just have to
return whatever this value is and what
we're pretty much saying right here is
the user can only play this game when
they're holding their device like
landscape mode widescreen mode once that
is taken care of if we can go ahead and
start setting up the welcome screen now
let's hop over to game scene SKS this is
the welcome screen the very first scene
that the user sees and right now it's
just gray boring and to be honest we're
not going to be spending a whole bunch
of time here because all this welcome
screen is going to say is pretty much
like welcome to the game tap to play and
whenever they tap it it's going to take
them to the actual game that's what
we're gonna be doing most of the work
but for right now again select this SKS
file and zoom out and first thing
changes is gray because I really hate
this boring gray color and to change it
click somewhere in here and select this
little icon this is the SK node
inspector and it's the one with a circle
and then four little circles around it
and in the main scene color is just the
background color so if you click the
color then that doesn't really look that
good if this blue oh it's kind of weird
too
alright let's go with uh alright let's
go with this orange why the heck not and
let me close out of there now after that
what I want to do is I just want to add
a label to the screen so if you select
this little icon this is the object
library and again like I said most of
the time whenever we're making an actual
level we're gonna be adding all of the
objects which are like our characters
the enemies the explosions we're gonna
be adding all of those to code but since
this is just a really simple welcome
screen we can just do this with the
interface builder I'm just gonna take a
label right here drag it out stick it in
the middle and for the text I'll just
say like a Bucky blaster and I'll say
tap to play so cap those tap two in hit
enter alright so that is the hardest
text to read in the world so the first
thing I want to do is change change the
color to black so again select this node
and by the way a node is pretty much any
object on your screen it can be a label
it can be your main character it can be
the bullets the enemies the blocks that
they're shooting at whenever I say note
I pretty much mean just an object on
your screen anyway select this label and
for the color just change it to black
now to style the font if you go up to
font and you click this little T icon to
the right then it can allow you to
customize it and it pretty much doesn't
matter how you style it I'm just making
it a little bit easier to read
so the first thing I want to do is
change it from ultralight to uh may be
bold looks pretty good not that bold
maybe just um regular alright that's a
little bit better and maybe 48 no no no
no no let's go with uh let's go with 36
36 was alright alright so this is our
welcome screen we pretty much have a
label pretty cool now the last thing I
actually want to do is I want to change
the name of this so again click your
label again make sure it's selected and
for the name of it I would just want to
change it to intro label and hit enter
now if we save this and run it we can
make sure that everything looks good
alright and you saw that by default
remember whenever we first loaded that
plain template project that we can click
and it made spaceships it was in
portrait mode but now since we said it
only to return landscape mode that's why
I automatically popped a landscape
orientation pretty cool and by the way
it doesn't always do that sometimes your
simulator is going to mess up and
accidentally put it in portrait mode but
you can just twist it like I showed you
before but right now looks pretty good
this is pretty much the dumbest welcome
screen ever but whatever and of course
whenever we tap nothing happens because
we didn't go in the brains and add any
functionality yet so in the next
tutorial what I'm going to show you guys
how to do is make that brand new level
that we're actually going to be playing
the game at and I'll show you guys that
you can actually add functionality to
tap this and it'll add a cool transition
and take you to that level it's gonna be
awesome
so I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
