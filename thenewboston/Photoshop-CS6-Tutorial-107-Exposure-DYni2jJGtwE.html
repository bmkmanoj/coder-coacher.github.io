is buddy Blackford and today we're gonna
go over using the exposure adjustment
command in Photoshop and well what
exposure is is the amount of light that
gets exposed to an image so what we're
gonna do is either line up or darken up
the image pretty much and change the
luminance values and color values on an
image and it's gonna be in a little bit
of a different way than we would get
from using something like levels or
curves so photoshop's exposure
adjustment is designed for performing
adjustments to 32-bit HDR images but it
also works with 8-bit and 16-bit images
as well so you can use it on pretty much
any image you want so the exposure
adjustment changes the image by using a
what's called a linear color space and
that's called gamma 1.0 and it doesn't
use the actual images color space so it
uses his own color space which is the
game on 1.0 and when used with HDR
images it gives you the ability to draw
like some nice details that might be
lost within your highlights or shadows
so if you'd like to take a take a
picture of something and the sun's
blowing out some of the details then you
want to adjust the exposure so you can
bring those details back in so let's
start from the beginning by going to
image and we're gonna go to our
adjustments options and we're gonna come
here to exposure now you can see that
this image has been exposed to extra
light to get in it gives it like a
little blown out look here and in the
background now something like this may
be a little hard to recover but maybe we
can try to recover it with some of the
exposure options I'm gonna put
this over here on the side so it's not
in the image but we can use it here so
let's go over what we see here in the
image in the exposure options first we
have exposure obviously and then adjust
the highlight end of the images tonal
scale with a little effect in the
extreme shadows we can go next to offset
that darkens the shadows and the
mid-tones and doesn't have as much of an
effect on the highlights so exposure
highlights and offset is shadows and
mid-tones so just remember that we've
got our gamma correction here and it
adjusts the images gamma just using a
simple slider here so remember want to
remember when I said it uses the gamma
1.0 linear scale well this is it here
and you can adjust that with this linear
slider here to adjust your midpoints or
like the brightness and things like that
so we've got our what start we'll just
start messing with these real quick
exposure remember that that is the
highlights and it doesn't affect shadows
very much
so let's bring the exposure down because
we know we already have a decent amount
of highlights so we can bring that down
and we're you don't want to make
extremely large adjustments with most of
your images however sometimes you may so
the next thing we're gonna do is up the
offset looks like we'll go the other way
there we go you can see it's starting to
get a little too crazy when I went with
offset there so let's try it yeah let's
go back offset we I'm gonna go to point
0.025 see how that looks there we go
I accidentally clicked 102.5 control Z
because I accidentally clicked because I
have this I had accidentally clicked on
the eyedropper and then clicked off on
to something else so make sure that when
you're doing this you don't accidentally
click with the eyedropper it'll adjust
your exposure by setting points so I
might as well go over those real quick
we have the eye draw bridge here that
will set the black point the mid gray
point and the white point and that'll
adjust the overall values for your
exposure so gamma correction I'm not
gonna do too much with that I'll just
move it either way so we can see how
this image is being adjusted by gamma
correction here so you can see to the
left makes it brighter and when you
start getting these like broken looking
edges here it means it went too far you
can see it definitely see it over here
it looks like it's been spray painted on
that's not good
so that means you that means you
definitely start going too far so pretty
much I wanted to go to the right on this
and now I have a different image so if
you click on preview you can sample and
see what's going on here so I used the
exposure and I took out some of the
light and made it a little bit of a
darker image now let's go ahead and set
this back to our default here using the
preset and that sets everything back to
nothing our back to zero to what the
image normally is and I'll show you that
we have a couple presets and now these
presents aren't anything too big all
they do is minus the exposure minus one
minus two plus one plus two nothing that
great you can adjust your exposure and
adjust your images or a correction and
offset and stuff like that and you can
save these for use
at another time by clicking on these
options here and hitting save preset and
if you do it goes to your exposure
folder on inside extra dark for this one
and I can go back to my default and I
can always go back and pick up my preset
later and I see how the exposure worked
out here so you can pick your presets
and create your own presets using this
options here now the last thing I wanted
to go over was the midpoint and dark
points here if you click on one of the
points here and select your dark point
it's going to change the overall look of
the image and you can see it changes the
offset as well so you can mess with
these and see if you can get something
that you really like so this is a gray
area here and that adjusted that a
little bit and if you want to go
upstream pick something that's not
that's great and let's looks like there
we go so I picked something that was
yellow and you get a whole different
like feel go to way and I'll pick
something that's fairly white there's
not too much that's really white here
you can see that brightened up the image
when I pick something that was pretty
white and if I pick something that's
darker it's gonna really really brighten
up the image so this just sets your
white point so you can experiment with
those and use those to your advantage or
as like starting points and things like
that so that's all I wanted to go over
with the exposure adjustment remember
that exposure is means that it's the
amount of light that is getting into
your image
so you're basically adjusting the amount
of light that's going on so that's all
thanks for watching this one check out
bookies room not work for more tutorials
on photoshop and other things like
programming and After Effects tutorials
and everything awesome hopefully
hopefully I see you guys there have a
good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
