and seventy 50 inch wigs toriel for the
new boss and we're gonna be doing in
this tutorial is basically getting
everything set up to actually draw a
triangle onto our emulator finally it
might take one more tutorial before we
actually can see it but we're at least
gonna draw to it so and that line the
code that I wanted to show you guys are
why I didn't type in the last tutorial
because I wanted to try and find some
pictures of how it would connect our
vertices using these different modes for
the most part but I couldn't actually
find any pictures online so we're just
gonna wing it and I'll try and explain
it to the best of my ability but all
we're gonna do is again within our
enabled client state we're just gonna
relate to the GL object being passed and
again and we're just gonna say GL draw
and we have two draw methods arrays and
elements and we're going to use the
elements because we have it basically a
index buffer set up again that short
buffer and that's what we're gonna
relate to with the drawl elements with
the draw arrays you don't actually need
a buffer as you can see within the
parameters but you know we want to get a
little bit more specific to draw the way
that we'd like so we're gonna use the
draw element and the mode is what I
wanted to show you guys basically it's
going to connect our points or vertices
and different or indexes I should say
because again we created these three
points out of the coordinates for the
most part and it's gonna connect those
points different ways so again we're
gonna clock again we're going clockwise
I'm starting at zero one two and we can
connect those either by it like creating
a line we can connect those with like a
line where it connects the last and the
first point that we started with we can
connect it with actually just building a
triangle which we're gonna use and
there's also other ones like triangle
fan and some other other options that
you guys can use but again I couldn't
find any pictures on that so sorry about
that but again what we're going to do is
we're going to relate to our GL 10
object or class and now we're just gonna
say GL underscore triangle and yeah we
have a triangle
strip triangle fan but we're just gonna
create one triangle you guys if you can
find it you know like leave a comment in
the video or something to help other
people see what these actually do
basically a strip is if we had like 10
points it just like start at this point
strip it or you know go like a zigzag
down all those points and create
triangles that way into a strip a fan if
we had like a point here like this is
our point zero then we have a point 1 2
3 4 or 5 all around it it create
triangles based off that centre point
but since we're just creating one
triangle we're just gonna say we want to
just build a triangle out of it and then
what we want to do is we want us to tell
them how many points or indexes we have
again our index array up here has 3
points so we're just gonna say 3 or just
to be a little more program cautious we
can just say P index dot length and for
the type again we have to define what
type our buffer is and again it's the
short type that we have up here and just
like the last time we set this pointer
we referred to that as a float so we
have to tell that you know the straw
elements method that we're working with
shorts so what we're gonna do is just
say our GL 10/10 object or class why do
I keep saying object dot GL underscore
unassigned short or unsigned short sorry
and we're just gonna click that and
that's gonna define what type we're
working with and then lastly we need to
set up our buffer which we call P buff
and there we go we're pretty much done
with that line and all again all that's
doing is gonna say hey we're working
with three points or three indexes and
we're working with a short and this is
basically the order that I want and I
want you get to draw a triangle again
going counterclockwise all that good
