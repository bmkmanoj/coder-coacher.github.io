this video I want to talk to you about
how to make another kind of layout and
this is called a list box now a list box
this type of layout is really good for
forms because it's kind of like a list
in the sense that you can put things
kind of like rows one on top of each
other
and the reason that it's a little better
than a list is first of all whenever you
think of like a grocery list you think
of one item on each thing you can
actually have multiple items on each row
so it's good so you can have a label and
then an input and then like maybe a
label and a submit button and another
thing is that you can navigate it with a
keyboard you can sort it so in this
demonstration I'm gonna be showing you
guys how to make a simple form but the
possibilities are endless
dunt data it sound like inspiring so I'm
just gonna write like a cheeseburger
machine because that's what's popping in
my head right now we'll say that this is
a form you're the owner of a restaurant
and up you have to for some reason
submit a form to turn your cheeseburger
no this is the dumbest example ever but
whatever alright so one of the first
things I always like to do is I like to
set a border around my entire layout and
if you don't do this then everything
inside your layout it's gonna look like
it's bunch right up against the edge of
you know all the borders and stuff so I
just type itself and whenever you refer
to self remember this is essentially
like your main window so for the main
window the overall window I'm just gonna
set a border width of 10 or so and
that'll be pretty good if it's still
kind of close to the edges we can bump
it up a little bit but whatevs
and now just for my list box I'm just
gonna call it list box and set this
equal to gtk dots list box too lazy to
type that alright so we'll just set it
equal to a blank list box and again just
think of this like a list for now that
we can stick items inside so for the
list box one thing I want to do is I
want to set
the selection mode to gtk selection mode
and set this equal to none alright so
you know I said this is essentially a
list and sometimes you're going to want
to make a list where the users can like
select the items and navigate it around
look uh with our keyboard maybe if
you're making something like an Excel
spreadsheet kind of program however this
is just a form and we don't want them to
be able to like select the entire form
elements like the label and everything
so that's what I'm going to hit a
selection mode none and of course we
need to add this to the window so self
add list box
alright so now we have our list box
added to the window a blank list pretty
boring so what we're gonna do from here
is we're just going to start adding
items or form elements to it so if it
was a login form you would want to have
a label that says email and then input
area and then maybe their password in
another input area but I'm just gonna
make some stupid range stuff so right
like um I just make a check box first
you're gonna use this a lot alright so
there's one more thing I'm gonna explain
before we start you know really pounding
into the code now we can't just add
items into these rows and that's fine we
can do that if we want however what I'm
gonna do is instead of adding the items
directly in to the rows what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna stick them inside a box
so in each row we're gonna have a box
and the items are gonna go inside that
why the heck am i doing that well if we
have a box we have a lot more
flexibility of how we want to lay the
items out so boxes just give you a lot
more options than the list box rows so
there you go you guys are going to see
in a second so Row 1 equals gtk this is
just gonna be the list box row
and we'll just keep that for now and
under that we're just going to make a
box one and set this equal to GT k box
Wow can type a one letter and I'll do
this the orientation equals g TK
orientation there we go and horizontal
and another one is that spacing equals
100 so this is the main attribute that I
was going after right now
so like I said we can just stick our
label and our check box right in the row
but if we do they're gonna be clumped up
right tight against each other it's
gonna look really weird with a box we
can actually give it some spacing just
like that so now your labels nice on the
Left you have a little bit of space and
then your check box is gonna be on the
right it's gonna look freaking beautiful
trust me guys so Row 1 what we want to
do is we want to add box 1 and then
let's just make a label so label equals
just K label and what text we want to
appear on this label let's write check
it
check if you love cheeseburgers so
that's why this checkbox is gonna be and
now let's make the checkbox so checks
equals okay check button alright so we
have a label and a check button and now
we pretty much just have to add it to
the box so box one remember we'll just
say pack start will add them in order
and then add the label to the box
true true zero and I'm gonna do the
exact same thing with the checks so
might as well just copy that to insure
my laziness level is staying high and
now check it out we have two items which
is the label on the left and check box
we added them both to the box and now
the only thing we have to do is add the
box to the list rope so list box add row
one boom roasted and now if you want to
even get even more lazy or you can copy
this entire thing and do the same but I
don't want to keep the check box because
I don't know we already did one of those
I'll show you guys how to do a toggle
switch those are another thing that come
in handy quite a bit and for my label
will say that this is the switch to turn
your machine on so it's very like a
burger making machine and the stalks the
toggle switch by default it says on and
off it's just a regular toggle switch so
you know the label it would be good for
that and let me just change these to row
to row to row to box to box to box to
dunt dunt dunt and that's what we're
gonna do check it out now
alright so of course I don't want to
check box so instead I'm gonna make a
toggle switch it's gonna be awesome
let me scroll down so you guys can see
alright so I'll just name a switch and
set this equal to GT okay switch and
alright looking good night and of course
got to put my switch right there let me
just make sure does everything look good
hopefully or else this is gonna be super
embarrassing alright so yeah I think
we're good to go so let's run this bad
boy and see what's up alright so check
it out
our title cheeseburger machine check a
few love cheeseburgers
check that burger making machine looking
good and again even though the user
can't see it this entire thing is a list
box in the inside of these our list box
rows and instead of just sticking these
labels and all these widgets inside what
we did is we added an invisible box
because that way we can have the spacing
right here and real quick let me show
you guys what it would look like if you
didn't have the spacing so let me
actually change the spacing to zero so I
can represent that and check it out so
this is what I was talking about how
everything is all clumped together and I
don't know if that's the effect you're
going for the incredible ugly effect
then go ahead and do that but I like it
better with tidbit of spacing so play
around of that and yeah ladies and
gentlemen you just got yourself a nice
brand-new piece of software for a
cheeseburger machine go ahead go out
sell it to McDonald's make millions but
don't forget to watch the next video I
will smell you guys there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
