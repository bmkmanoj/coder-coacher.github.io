seventh tutorial on XHTML last time we
learned a tab do a couple things with
font and how to make non-breaking spaces
and copyright symbols and today we're
really going to get into some deep
website development and we're going to
begin making links now what links are if
you don't know it's what you click and
it takes you to another website so it's
what everyone uses the navigate around
the internet so let's just begin making
one the tag to make a link is a and the
ending tag is typical ending a and
anything in between it this is my link
is going to become a link but right now
we have a link and it's not taking us
anywhere so if we saved it and took a
look at it right now what we'd see is
just a link that we can't click and if
we click it then we don't go anywhere so
to make it go to another website you
need the H ref attribute that's h r e f
and you type in the title of the website
that you want the link to go to in
between the code quotation marks so
let's say we want this link take us to
google with type HTTP
WWD cool calm and end it with the
quotation marks and now if we saved it
and we looked at it in Internet Explorer
you could see that's now underlined and
when we hover over it the finger pops up
and if we actually clicked on it it
would take us the Google now this is
useful when you want to create a link
that's taking you away from your site
but let's say you have a site with a
couple pages on it and you wanted to
navigate from one page to another well
the first thing we would need to do is
actually make another website so right
in notepad file new and again we need
the doctype so let's paste in our new
website and of course we need the HTML
tags to let the browser know that
actually is a website
a number when we save it we need to save
as we'll save this is new and we have to
make sure to save it as HTML file so now
we have our first website right here in
our second website right here so how
would you let me just on our second
website let me just add this is our
second website so we can distinguish the
first one from the second one and we'll
type this is my first website and the
first one so how do you add a link to go
from our first website to our second one
well actually when you make a link from
your own website to another page in your
own website you don't need to http the
only thing you need is to type the name
of your website followed by HTML so our
name is new dot HTML and for the link
will put this goes to the new website so
now if we save that and we have to save
this only did it internet explorer then
we could see that this link when we
click it it's taking us to our second
page in our website
and to create a link to go back we would
all we would have to do is type in a for
the opening link tag href equals and in
quotation marks type test because that
was the name of our first website dot
HTML and knit with quotation marks
bracket go back to main page and end it
with the a so now if we save that when
we viewed it in Internet Explorer you
could see that this is our first website
and this is the link that's taking us to
the new webpage and this is the second
web page and if we want to go back we
just simply cook click that but let's
say instead of just keeping it in the
same window that we actually wanted to
open up a second window well to do this
you need another attribute and this is
called the target attribute any time you
want to open up a web page in a new
window you have to type in your opening
the link tag type target equals
underscore blank
and end up with the quotation marks now
if you save that and looked at in
Internet Explorer you can see that
whenever we click on this link a whole
new website opens in a new will so this
is useful if you want to keep visitors
to your site but offer them a link to go
to another site as well so that's out of
time we have for right now in our next
tutorial we're going to be talking more
about links and also about email links
and if you're not already there you can
go to WWE new boss tink com for a
step-by-step tutorial on everything we
went over today thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
