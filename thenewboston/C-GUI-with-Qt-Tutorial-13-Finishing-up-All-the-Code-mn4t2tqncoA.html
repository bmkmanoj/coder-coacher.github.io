now that we are finally done finishing
coding this get text file function what
we actually need to do is include a
couple things I probably should have
done this first but in order to use your
files in queue and also your text stream
you need to go ahead and include move my
cursor cute core / cue file and just go
ahead and copy this and paste it right
down below so we need to include cue
file which allows us to work with files
obviously and cue text stream because
remember whenever we use a stream down
here of course that's in this so we need
to include it so now after this let's go
ahead and take a look at all of this
other code step-by-step and see what we
need to do so of course here is the
constructor right here and I'm just
going to go ahead and move this it's
bugging me all right so basically the
first thing we did in the constructor is
this was already pre-built by cue
whenever we set up our project it pretty
much sets up the user interface as you
can tell by the function name so after
this what we wanted to do once the
interface is done setting up basically
so the user can see it is we want to go
ahead and call this get text file
function so in order to do that just go
ahead and write get text file there you
go
so basically it's going to set up the
user interface and start reading the
text file but we aren't done yet the
only other thing that we need to do is
on go by and click basically whenever
they hit that search button or the Go
button remember that we created in like
the second video what we want to do what
the first thing what we want to do is we
want to find what term they're searching
for and we want to store in variable so
store in a string cue string and I'm
just going to name my variable word and
set this equal to user interface line
edit
texts so this is going to basically do
is this text function right here takes
the piece of text from your line or
wherever you typed in and it stores it
in the variable word so if we go over to
our design mode we can see whatever the
user types in here that text function is
going to grab it and it's now stored in
the variable word so now if I hop over
to my CPP now you know what that does so
now of course since we stored that
variable or the term that the user
searching for might as well go ahead and
do something with it
now the cool thing is queue already
built in a function called fine which
pretty much finds the next occurrence of
the word based on where your cursor is
so in order to do that of course you use
your interface and what we wanted to do
is text edit because that's pretty much
the area that we're looking for and we
want to use the function called find now
this takes a bunch of parameters and
it's kind of annoying but basically what
term do you want to find or look for
word whatever they search for and the
only other parameter is Q text woah
shan'er hit capsule up hold on and can't
figure out my freaking caps locks on
nope
all right q text document : : find whole
words pretty obviously what that does
alright so I think that's pretty much it
no need all right looks pretty good so
one more time let me go ahead and talk
you guys through what each piece of this
file means before I go ahead and start
with the other part of this tutorial so
basically we included everything that we
need to include self explanatory in the
constructor the only thing we need to do
to the start the program is set up the
user interface so the user you know has
all their buttons and widgets and stuff
and also get the text file so it knows
what file we want to search for and it
loads it into that little area so this
is the constructor right here just clean
up all the memory delete the user
interface already billing for us now on
Go button clicked basically whenever you
hit that button to search for a term the
first thing that's going to do is take
that term that the user is searching for
and store it in the variable word
and then it's going to go ahead and find
the next occurrence of that basically
take your cursor and move it to the word
if it occurs in the text so this last
function right here um I don't even
think we need to go over this because I
coded this line by line and I described
everything in the last tutorial but
there you go there is the last actually
good news that's the last bit of coding
that we need to do for the entire
program however we can't just go ahead
and build and run it yet because I
didn't even make this text file so if we
go ahead and build and run it we may get
an error well let's just see what
happens going to run this it's building
and yep check it out it runs but since
we don't have a text file nothing even
happens nothing's loaded in so in the
next story what I'm going to do is I'm
going to show you guys how to create a
text file and also how to load it in so
your program can use it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
