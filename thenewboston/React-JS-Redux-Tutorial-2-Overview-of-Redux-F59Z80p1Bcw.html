want to do is I want to give you guys a
really brief overview of redux and also
talk to you guys about some of the
challenges that it solves so let's first
talk about a traditional react
application now we already know that
it's broken up into components which are
just different parts of your website and
then these components each one it comes
with a bit of memory called state now
the state is essentially responsible for
deciding how that component is going to
display for example the state of this
playlist would just be a list of videos
so it knew what list the put in here now
maybe for this video player the state or
the JavaScript object would just be like
the YouTube code for the video and maybe
the title of the video so wouldn't take
up that much memory now maybe this
button component where you go to the
next and the previous one this state
would be an ID for the next and the
previous videos so you pretty much had
these different components with
different JavaScript objects associated
with them and they were all kind of
separate so this is where things kind of
got complicated so say that whenever you
were developing this application and you
wanted to go to the next video you need
to click Next and then you need to take
this information and pass it to the
playlist so it highlighted the right
video and then what this playlist needed
to do is somehow communicate with this
video player so this video player could
change the proper video wait a minute
maybe it was the button that changed a
video and that change of playlist or
maybe this playlist just took care of
everything and you know what it's kind
of a pain in the butt when everything is
separate in all these different little
objects are just floating around and you
need to figure out how to connect them
well what if instead of having all these
components different states that we can
combine all of them into one so instead
of a bunch of separate JavaScript
objects what if we took them all all the
states for your entire application and
combined it into one
big JavaScript object wouldn't that be a
lot easier well it turns out it is and
that's what we did with Redux and by we
I mean someone else so I'm not trying to
take the credit but that's kind of how
Redux works now if you're thinking all
right so you're going to take all the
data from your application and stick it
into one big JavaScript object pretty
much just like one big JSON file well
yes that's what we're doing and if you
think re that's going to take up a lot
of memory well not really because it
doesn't take up any more than before
because let's say it takes up three
kilobytes well if this took up one and
this look at one and this took one one
plus one plus one still equals three so
it takes up the same amount of memory
we're just kind of managing it in a
better way
so that's really cool so of course we
have all of our states in one place and
again that is called the store that's
all store is all of your state's
combined so of course we still have
these components the playlists the video
the buttons and they need access to that
data right because that data in the
store is going to tell the playlist what
videos to kind of display is going to
say what the active video is so we still
need to be able to get this data to the
individual components so how do we do
that if we kind of took all of their
states and put them in a one big file
well we do so using first of all a
provider now again this is probably
going to be kind of confusing and I'm
not saying you need to memorize this
right now because later on I'm going to
show you how to do this through code and
it's going to make a lot more sense I
just want to give you guys like the real
quick overview right now so anyways what
a provider does is it is pretty much
part of the puzzle that takes your store
which is all your applications data and
it essentially needs to pipe them down
to the components the buttons the forms
the sliders the playlists so on and so
forth now you don't just pump them
directly into your components what you
do is you actually have to pass it
through a container
so this container if you're wondering
why you need to do that this is actually
the glue that connects your react
components with your Redux store so this
top right here this is kind of the Redux
part in this bottom component this is
kind of like what we learned before with
the react in this container is kind of
where you make react connect with redux
so all containers do is they go fetch
your applications data and they pretty
much say alright this is the part of
data that I want and this is the
component that I need to send it to to
say how to display so again we have this
big cloud of data floating in your
container would say okay give me just
the playlist information and I'm going
to render or use it to display this
playlist that's all a container is
nothing confusing or anything like that
now the cool thing one of the coolest
things that we're going to see is
anytime your store or state application
changes any time that data gets altered
then your components are automatically
going to be rear-ended or redrawn so
that's awesome we just have to change
this data in your display or components
change to reflect that perfectly it's
awesome
alright so that's kind of the overview
the really non-technical overview of how
we get to components so now we have all
these components sitting on the screen
alright so now the user has something to
look at so then the user of course is
going to be doing stuff clicking these
buttons performing actions clicking on
this playlist playing the video a bunch
of different things so whenever they do
one of these things like click a button
it emits something called inaction and
by the way just the heads-up in action
it usually is just a user generated
event but it doesn't always have to be
you can have other actions like when um
like when our request comes back from
API call or when something finishes in
the background but like 90 percent of
time there
just user events whenever they click a
binds submit a form tomato tomahto
so again an action is just something
that happens now whenever something
happens of course eventually what we
need to say is how is that event going
to change your applications data for
example if they hit next video then you
would want to change the active video if
they clicked a new user button then of
course you would want to add a new piece
of data to the store if they hit delete
my favorite movie or whatever then you
would want to delete an item from the
store
so that is an action and it causes a
change in your store but how exactly do
you decide how that change occurs what
you need to do well you have to go
through something called a reducer so
this is kind of a last confusing part
but once you see it in code it's really
easy to understand so all a reducer does
is it takes an action and they're just
functions that's all they are in the
parameter that you pass in is in action
and then it needs to decide what part of
the store to change so for example if
they wanted to delete one of their
movies you would make a function called
a movie reducer and then they said okay
I'm going to listen for the action
delete movie and we'll say it's a button
that got clicked and whenever that
occurs I'm just going to delete all you
know a certain JavaScript object or a
user reducer where whenever they added a
friend or something maybe it was called
a friend reducer then we just added an
object to the store so again that's kind
of the entire architecture now again the
reason that this works so well is
instead of having this tree architecture
or this hierarchy that we need to figure
out how to pipe data up to the top and
then how do we pipe it to other
components and everything kind of like
spaghetti and kind of figuring out how
to get from A to B we now have all of
our data in one place kind of like a
main brain for your application and then
we have all these different components
but all they do
is they just actions they just do things
that's it and then we have another
section that says all right whenever
something happens it doesn't really
matter where it came from but I'm going
to be listening for certain actions and
whenever one of these things occurs then
I'm going to change the store in that
appropriate way and then of course your
view or components get altered perfectly
and everything works out beautifully so
look at this girl she looks like she
she's about to cry I used her in one of
my other tutorials and she has like the
saddest face what all right look this
guy he looks like a Harry Potter
nonetheless I'm getting kind of
off-track now but that's the basics of
Redux and again if everything was kind
of overwhelming and your guys were like
providers and reducers oh my god tomato
tomahto I'm not gonna remember this
trust me once we go through and we start
coding this bad boy is going to make so
much sense and it's going to kind of
stick in your brain so think guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
also if you want to donate to my patreon
account I am saving up for a huffy
mudslinger so yeah if you want to do
that feel free but anyways I will see
you guys next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
