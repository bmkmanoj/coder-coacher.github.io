Bucky yada-yada
welcome to her 37 PHP tutorial yeah yeah
anyways in the last story what we did is
we created a class called people and in
that class we created a name variable
and a function called set name and all
this function did is it took this name
and it changed it to you know whatever
we want to we'll learn that later on
so anyways in this tutorial what we're
gonna be doing is we're gonna be dealing
with something called objects so go
ahead and in your body throw some PHP
tags in there and here's what you need
to do an object is pretty much a
representation or it's pretty much this
it's a way to access all those variables
and functions in that class so say for
this say we made this huge program and
not only did it have this people class
in it but it also had an animal's class
a cars class a places class a computers
class we need an object that's only
gonna access the things in this pupil
class we don't need the rest of that
crap right now we only want to work with
this class right here so let's go ahead
and create an object right now go ahead
and it's just like any other variable
I'm gonna name my person one go ahead
and set it equal to the keyword new and
then type the name of the class you want
to use in our class is called people
people looks kind of weird once you look
at it like I'm a pineapple in a way but
anyways go ahead and type the name of
your class and then go ahead and type
empty braces and I'll be covering again
like I said these dumb keywords and
these other signs these braces and stuff
I'll be covering those later on
Banny ways in order to create an object
you go ahead and just make any variable
and set it equal to the keyword new and
then the name of your class with empty
parenthesis and now this person one
variable can access any of these
variables in any of these functions in
this class so like I said if you had
another class called animals and another
one called cars
you knew that this variable was gonna
access the one the people class so
that's why we need create objects to ask
access little access to things in that
class so now we have a key to access
anything in this pupil class through the
variable person one so let's go ahead
and do that right now
let's go ahead and echo something out on
the screen in order to access anything
in that class go ahead and type the name
of your object which is person 1 and
then go ahead and put that little dumb
operator - greater than sign and now go
ahead and type the name of the variable
you want to access so let's go ahead and
type name and what's this gonna do right
here well it's gonna say all right what
object are using person 1 which is
pretty much your people class so pretty
much an object is basically the same
thing as the class so when we use person
1 we say alright we want to work with
the people class now what do we want to
echo inside of it and that's just this
named variable but check this out
whenever we created this class we didn't
set the name equal to anything the name
isn't equal to anything until we call
this function so whenever we call this
right here nothing is going to display
and actually here's what we're going to
do whoa definitely messed that up break
and just like that so now what this echo
is gonna do is it's gonna echo nothing
at all because our name is equal to
anything at all so now what we have to
do is use this person one variable to
which is pretty much an object to call
the set name function and set this name
equal to something so again any time you
want to access anything in this class
you have to use this object this object
is like a key for that class so now we
use the object instead of access
a variable we want to access this
function called set name so set name and
what do you want it again
this function takes one parameter and
sets it equal to the name variable so
I'm gonna go ahead and pass in Bucky and
it looks pretty good right there so
anyways this is gonna echo a blank line
this is gonna say alright in our class
people we want to use them to function
set name and we want to pass in the
value Bucky so it's gonna go up to the
class people it's gonna grab the
function set name and it's going to pass
it in Bucky and it's gonna say all right
now the name variable is equal to Bucky
which is my name so now once we echo
this again it's now gonna echo Bucky so
at first your name was equal to anything
at all and then we called the function
set name and passed in Bucky and now
once we echo that it's gonna be equal to
the value Bucky so let me go ahead and
refresh this one on the second and just
copy all those yes and refresh it
alright here we go
so anyways yeah I don't like to use a
like XA MPP or W a MPP anymore I just
use it straight from you know one of the
little websites I bought so that's what
I was doing right there so anyway as you
can see right now here's my website at
first it echoed out nothing a blank line
right here because the name wasn't equal
to anything at all and then we call it
the function set name and then check it
out
Bucky because then the name variable was
equal to Bucky so let's take a step back
and recap one last time and cover
everything we just learned because I
know it can be really confusing a class
is pretty much a way to organize data
and buy data I mean your functions and
your variables so we made a class called
people and inside of that class called
people we made two things one was a
variable called name and one was a
function that changed that name
so in order to access that class you
need to make something called an object
and an object is pretty much a way to
access all the stuff inside of a class
so we made an object called person one
which gave us access to everything
inside of the class people now now that
we had access to that class the first
thing we decided to do with our object
was echo out the variable name however
right now that name wasn't equal to
anything it was just a plain old
variable so that's why it echoed out a
blank line but then we said all right
now that we can do something with this
class let's go ahead and call that set
name function and set that variable
equal to the word Bucky so now the
variable name is equal to the word Bucky
and now when we echo it out again it's
gonna echo the word Bucky so anyways the
basic thing they had to take away from
this story is a class is a way to
organize your variables in your
functions anytime you want to use any of
this crap you name you need to make
something called an object and with this
object you can use any of this stuff in
here
so that's the basics of object-oriented
PHP arm the basics of you know classes
fields objects in in the next couple of
Sorrows
I'm gonna be covering all these dumb
little keywords and maybe throw in some
more variables may make some more
functions who knows I don't even know
what I'm gonna be doing so anyways it's
gonna be sweet and you're gonna learn
more about object-oriented PHP and
definitely if you want to get a job
using PHP this is what everyone uses now
classes and objects and object-oriented
coding and you're gonna see why it's
useful later on but for now I guess you
guys you're just gonna have to wait so
thank you guys for watching don't forget
to subscribe and now see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
