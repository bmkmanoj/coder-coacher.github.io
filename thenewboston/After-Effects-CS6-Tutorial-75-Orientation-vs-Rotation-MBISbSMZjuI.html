After Effects cs6 tutorial this is buddy
blackford today I'm going to be talking
to you about orientation versus rotation
in 3d camera views so so when you open
up your rotation panel if I press if I
twirl down on my object here and I go to
transform you can see that there is now
orientation x y&amp;amp;z rotation now they both
pretty much do the same thing but they
are used differently and they are
independent of each other if you come up
to your rotation tool and click on it
you can see up here that there is a drop
down menu now for 3d layers set
orientation or rotation now if I move
this right now and just rotate it
orientation allows you to go all all
over and not just on an axis if I if I
hold my mouse over an axis and it has
the letter there and I move it it will
constrain it to that axis so orientation
values move separately than rotation
values so if I put this over the Y and
move on the y axis and rotate it you can
see that none of the rotation values
moved at all so I'm going to go back to
zero
and switch to rotation and just show you
that the orientation doesn't move when I
move the other rotation values as you
can see there
so why would you have two separate
things here going on here well since
we're in 3d space you don't want to have
to mess with your orientation while
you're doing a rotation so think of
orientation as setting up your positions
pose then think of rotation as using to
using rotation to animate so I'm going
to use my orientation to set up the way
I want this guy to start out so like
that now I don't have to mess with a
keyframing rotation at all
he's already oriented the way I want him
to now if I want to start moving him
around
OOP sorry let me go back to all the
options so it's easier to see now if I
want to start doing key framing and and
moving this guy around while rotating
him so we got that let's add us let's
add a let's do a Z rotation just for fun
one time
I just typed in one in the in the time
section so that we got that going on
there I look at this and the client is
like I don't really like the way this
guy's facing in the beginning now you
don't have to mess with this rotation
that you just made you can just change
his orientation all right you want them
looking like this okay good there you go
client now I don't have to mess with a
bunch of keyframes anymore he's already
oriented the way I wanted to be so thank
After Effects were separating these guys
so we don't have to go through
everything and fix keyframes all the
time those are the differences between
orientation and rotation just remember
orientation is setting up your pose
rotation is for animating and key
framing so that's the end of this
tutorial
remember those when you're using when
you're using After Effects and you're on
a project you don't want to be the guy
who animates your orientation and then
when you pass off your project to the
next person and they got to fix it
they're going to be really mad at you so
make sure you follow those rules and
have a good one see you guys in the next
tutorial I'll be around see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
