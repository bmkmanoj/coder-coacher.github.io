about how to multiply fractions so the
first thing you want to do when you
multiply your fractions is if you have
two fractions that can be reduced in any
way you want to go ahead and do that so
instead of negative 22
since it's a monomial divided by an um
monomial we can divide 2 into that which
is 1 and we can divide 2 into 22 and get
11 so now what we can do is reduce
across so oh we we can reduce these
Seventeen's 2 because 17 over 17 is just
1 so now we can reduce across so d if I
were to multiply these two because we
multiply top over to top times top and
bottom times bottom then this D and this
D would cancel out just like when we
multiply normal fractions and we get 9
over to this 2 we divide by 2 divide by
2 divide by 3 divide by 3 and we just
get 6 so it's the same kind of thing and
then this D would cross out with one of
these DS because d squared is really
just D times D so then on top we have CD
over 1 times C squared so now we
multiply across and we get C cubed D
over 1 which is just the same thing as C
cubed times D so we're just gonna do
some examples practicing for this so
when it's just monomials like this you
can cancel diagonally so this C is gonna
cross out with one of these Z's this X
with one of these X's and this Y with
this Y so then we get x over Z and
that's all that's left but when we get
to well actually this one's not a very
good example because you see how we're
multiplying by a minus 1 over a minus 1
well that's the same thing as
multiplying by 3 over
three three over three you just equals
one so when we multiply these two we're
really just multiplying by one so we
still get a squared minus four over a
squared minus one now we're going to
factor the top and bottom and see if any
of these factors cancel because whenever
we multiply two fractions or divide
fractions we want to leave them in the
most simplified form possible so these
are both difference of squares this is X
minus 2 or a plus 2 over a minus 1 a
plus 1 now none of these factors will
cancel so we're just gonna leave it like
this and that's our final answer
so when we get an example like this
where we multiplying fractions that have
polynomials we're gonna divide first or
I'm sorry we're going to factor our
fractions first so if we factor this we
can factor a 3 out we get X minus 2 over
and we factor 6 out of the bottom X plus
1 times and we're going to factor the
top and we're going to get an x times
and x2 is divisible only by itself in
one so that so we know that this has to
be 2 here and a 1 here since the middle
term is positive and the last term is
positive these are both gonna be pluses
now this is since this is a negative 3x
is gonna have the exact same factors but
they're gonna have different signs so
now we look on top and bottom and see if
any of these factors will cancel since
they won't we can we can what we can
cancel this 3 because 3 divided by 3 is
1 3 divided by 6 is 2 now we can cancel
diagonally so this X plus 1 will cancel
with this X plus 1 this X minus 2 will
cancel with this X minus 2 and we'll be
left with X plus 2 over 2x minus 1 now
when you wanna when you want to leave
your answers in the most simplified
version you're going to want to fact
or you're gonna want to distribute this
to and right this is 2x plus 2 over 2x
minus 2 and that's actually all we're
going to do with multiplying fractions
but make sure you come back and watch
other next lesson which is going to be
dividing fractions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
