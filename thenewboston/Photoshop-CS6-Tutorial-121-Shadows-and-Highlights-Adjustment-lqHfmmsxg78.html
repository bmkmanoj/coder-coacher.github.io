buddy Blackford here with another
Photoshop cs6 tutorial today we're going
to learn about using the shadows and
highlighted justment and what the
shadows and highlights adjustment lets
you do is quickly correct the problems
associated with underexposed and
overexposed areas of the image such as
shadows and highlights obviously so if
you have really really deep shadows or
really bright highlights you can mess
with the our mess with the shadows and
highlights adjustment to help you out
there and make it look nice and what's
good about it is that you can adjust the
shadows and the highlights without
changing the mid-tones in the image so
that'll help you out and one thing you
need to know about the shadows and
highlights adjustment is that it does
not work in a CMYK color mode so make
sure an RGB alright so one thing I
learned when I've been using the shadow
and highlights is that to make it a
non-destructive adjustment want we want
to apply it to a smart object so we're
going to convert our background to a
smart object and what destructive means
is that it's not there when you apply an
adjustment right to the background or to
a layer without like having like an
adjustment layer or something it pretty
much gets embedded into that picture or
that photos like pixels and everything
like that and then you can't go back and
change it so you use the layers so you
can go back and adjust things and move
them back and forth alright so let's
convert this into a smart object so just
right click on it in the layers panel
over here convert to smart object we're
going to go to image adjustments and
then shadows and highlights and you can
see this has already been brightened up
by the defaults so when you start out
it's going to look like this probably
there is a button here called show more
options we're going to click on that and
then I'll give us some more options here
now we've got the amount which is pretty
much the volume so if I go to the right
it's going to be brightened up a lot if
I go to left this is going to be have
more shadows so this
the shadow section going adding more
amount gives you less shadow going to
the left gives you more shadow now we
got the tone with here and this pretty
much asks you what is a shadow so if you
move it to the left you're going to get
more things that are shadows and if you
move it to the right you're going to get
more that are not shadows so move that
to some place where it looks pretty
decent for you and then we got the
radius here and that's how far out the
shadows are gonna let go so what you
want to look for when you're moving the
radius around is good smooth blending in
between your shadows and the mid-tones
and everything else so we want to make
sure it looks nice when it blends in
with each other and that looks good to
me 80 seems pretty good and let me check
the preview so this was a lot darker
before and now we have brightened it up
now same thing with the highlights and
you can see there's no mid-tone going on
here so we are saving out our mid-tones
just like I explained before so I go to
the right here it's going to give us
less highlight and you can see mainly um
in this light blue area is where a lot
of its a lot of the changes happening so
I like to have this color pop a bit so
I'm going to keep the highlights pretty
up pretty high and then let's check out
the tunnel with here so which way we
want to go so there's no like magic
numbers for this you need to adjust a
slider manually every time so that your
picture or your image looks good so we
have to pretty much go through this and
manually do some trial and error and
everything like that and so it looks
good so this isn't doing much so I'm not
too worried about it so I'm just going
to keep down probably because of the
amount is low now we've got our color
correction adjustments here in mid tone
contrast and you can move those sliders
to decrease or increase the color
saturation values of
the areas of the image that were
adjusted so if I start moving this
around let's see how it's getting more
saturated you move it to a lot I move it
onto it way to the left is not as
saturated let's see what this looks like
compared to the other one it kind of
saturated the walls out a little sued
else we got this is all the way you're
gonna see how the walls I got a lot more
color in them and everything like that
so that's just that what's going on
there i think i'm going to keep it up so
my probably around 30 and then let's
move the mid-tone contrast here so we
really like so when i moved to the left
um you can see that if you take a look
in this area right here with us oranges
you can see it's all like blurred and
blended in if I move this to the right
it's going to be a little bit more sharp
not so blended it and everything like
that has some nice contrast so I'm just
clicking on the preview to go back and
forth to check my image every once in a
while to see how progress is going on it
all right well we got our black and
white clip here you can enter values
from zero to fifty percent in the boxes
there to indicate how much shadow and
highlight values are going to be clipped
in your image so the greater values that
you put in it's going to put in more
contrast so if i put in like twenty five
percent here or something like that you
can see what happened i go to fifty and
obviously 50 is way too much because we
get in some breakage here and all that
stuff and artifacting that we don't want
so just move that to whatever you
whatever you think is nice we got our
white clip I'll bring that to like 25 so
you can see what's going on there you
can see this is getting blasted out so
we don't want that much we want this
probably be as low we can point on one
probably good if I can do that
that's bad zero there we go so that's
what I'm looking for in my image this is
what it is now I'm going to hit okay and
you noticed that when i hit okay we've
got some new stuff going on over here
where you got a smart filter which is a
filter on a on a smart object and in all
honesty it's not really a filter the
filters are found in this filter section
here but we added an adjustment and
that's just how Photoshop handles that
when you add some of these adjustments
to a smart object and you can see that
shadows highlights HD are toning and
variations are the ones that you can do
this with so most of the other ones
because you can't find you can't find a
black and white up here in any of these
filters or any of these adjustment and
layers that we've been going over so i
won't just went through all of them and
black and white not on there so this is
the way that you would want to add the
black and white adjustment I remember
converting to a smart object then adding
the black and white adjustment and then
or its shadows and highlights my bed I
kept on saying black and white men
shadows and highlights and adding it as
a smart filter so that's all I wanted to
show you how I'll show you guys and
thank you for watching and you now know
how to use the shadows and highlights
adjustment so have a good one everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
