tutorial is going to be about the
dreamweaver document window as you can
see here i have some HTML code and i
have a lot of other HTML documents that
are open right here we have our insert
tab our CSS Styles tab our files in our
asset if you don't like this this view
of how all this stuff set up you can go
down here to workspace layout underneath
the window and you have the app
developer you have the app developer
plus see it moves the files over here
and keeps the insert and the CSS styles
over here it also adds this database
which we will talk about later
it has server bindings server behaviors
which we don't need to worry about need
that stuff right now but just to see how
all this stuff is arranged as you select
these different workspace layouts
there's the classic workspace layout and
the coder code applies all this really
depends on you know how you want to look
at all of your different options I
honestly like the designer so we'll go
with our so up here we have all of our
files right here we have
code split design here we have the title
of age here we have server interactions
which you use once you set up a site
which we just talked about here you can
preview that's what it looks like inside
Firefox and this is what it looks like a
Saturday night Explorer
here's our options just have a grid it's
pretty cool yeah we can pull down guides
let's see rulers see I measure with a
guy - I think the guides are these
little lines of here on the side I think
there's a way - there we go we can pull
them out which is pretty nice when
you're setting up you know you want to
know exactly where it's going to be on
the page so let's pull down some guys
all right and then we have caller icons
which are these guys over here
you sure to those off they turned gray
over here we have the insert you'll
probably be using these a lot if you if
you don't know HTML my hand the insert
tab that's all of well pretty much every
tag you need inside your document for
you that's very handy if you're trying
to create things quickly so it was
simple hyperlink some text just a link
to say Google here we have target blank
which I like to use it takes the person
away from the page they're currently on
that way it keeps the the page that
they're currently on open and opens up a
new tab or new window
I think and Internet Lord opens a new
window
but in Firefox it opens a new tab and
you give it a title this link Google and
know what we're about the other two
things here we go I also get inside of
Firefox of course I'm gonna save oh I
think we have an error problem there is
that this doesn't have HTTP in front of
it so it's gonna try to open it up on
the local server or in the current file
structure because you didn't specify it
to be an absolute link so I write again
we save it now she got straight to
Google I really like the Olympic
backgrounds the Google doesn't have
anything very cool
so let's go back to Dreamweaver know it
since there are some other things the
table which I like to use div tags but
it's always nice to know how to use
tables so a different different
applications different pages call for
different things
I still use tables laden HTML email so
let's give it a width of let's say a
hundred I'm gonna turn these grits off I
just showed you guys that earlier don't
really need that you are I'm also gonna
take this link and put it inside the
first cell the first column the first
row there we go take this out type in
tables now if you want you can wrap this
tag I wrap this in a safety or finer
text
mm nope
well let's go to this
let's give it a detector there's a way
to actually wrap that around but I don't
have that window open right now
find it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
