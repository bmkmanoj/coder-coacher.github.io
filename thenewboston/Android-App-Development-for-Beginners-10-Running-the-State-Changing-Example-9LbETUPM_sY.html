your Android studio development process
a little bit easier is this thing called
code completion and I'll show you guys
how it works right now so under this
method right here click where you would
first start writing your method and then
hold down the Alt key on your keyboard
and hit insert so right here it's going
to pop up a bunch of different things
what we want to choose is override
methods because remember we're pretty
much inheriting all these methods from
the activity class however we just want
to customize them to add our own custom
log message just so we can see what's
going on
so click override methods and then it's
going to give us a bunch of different
options to override so these are saying
okay what method do you want to use
pretty much do you want us to UM fill in
for you well there's actually this
method called onstart so if you scroll
down a little bit right here on Start
and hit OK there we go
saves us some time again it took a
little bit it took a while for me to
just explain it but if you're just doing
it to yourself it takes like five
seconds so pretty sweet but anyways now
that we have this onstart method what I
want to do is actually just copy this to
add another log that's going to print
out on our screen and I'm just going to
add on start now instead of me doing the
exact same thing over and over and over
again what I actually did is I took all
of the methods that I want to overwrite
and I actually put it on my forum so if
you go to my forum again this is the URL
I'll put this below the video if you
guys just want to click on it but check
this out I put all the source code right
there so go ahead and copy this
and hop over back to Android studio and
paste it back in and I actually um can
delete this because I copied that too
but now it saves you a bunch of typing
pretty sweet
so all this program is going to do is
it's going to print out a little message
on the screen every time your activity
changes States again you would never
want to do this in the actual app this
is just to demonstrate when each of
these stages are going to happen but for
this example it's actually pretty useful
so like I said before whenever we use
this little log program right here by
default it's going to be printing out a
bunch of random log messages pretty much
everything that's going on in your phone
or your little emulator is going to try
to print out but what we are only
interested in are these log messages
that we created right here so we need to
build a real quick filter so to do that
head over to your Android tablet here
click on it and alright so those are a
bunch of see these are all the ones we
don't want to see and this is just
because my emulator is running right now
so obviously we want to make a filter
and this is how you do this in another
thing I want to point out is this is
just a nice little easter egg if you
look at this log cat symbol you're going
to see that it's actually the Android
head and this is actually none I don't
even know how to pronounce it but you
know that YouTube video or it's like
that cat that looks like he's attached
to a pop-tart or something with a
rainbow Kamau's but that's a little
symbol for that so um I don't know I
just thought that was a cool little
easter egg alright so anyways back to
building our filter what we're going to
say is any log message that has this tag
attached
Bucky's message only show those so make
sure whatever you whatever string you
have here copy this now in the drop down
right here select edit filter
configuration this allows us to build a
filter right here now I actually already
did this but my microphone was off so
that's why this is filled in right here
I have a weird microphone and when you
put it up it mutes itself and uh so yeah
I just filmed for about five minutes and
then I was trying to edit the video and
I'm like Oh can't hear anything because
I'm a moron so so again you're going to
have to call yours anything you want I'm
just going to call mine Bucky filter and
the only other thing you have to add is
by log tag reg X just stick this right
in here so it's going to say okay filter
equals built so now instead of no
filters which show everything we can
only show log messages with this
attached pretty sweet so now just go
ahead up to here and run your app now
keep your eye on this little section
right here because whenever our app
actually builds itself and pops up its
going to start displaying those state
messages so of course choose okay and
check it out alright so our app is
loading in a switch back to this thing
you sob so I'm going to switch it back
to Bucky's filter but check this out we
position this so you guys can see it
alright so the first thing it printed
out was on curry now I already told you
guys and you know you obviously know
what that method does it pretty much
just sets up the interface now after
that on start this method always gets
called right after either on create or
on restart
so what onstart means is pretty much
your app is about to start up there
that's the most simple I can explain it
now on resume what this means is it's a
method that always gets called whenever
your activity is the one that the user
currently has open so remember anytime
you want to add code that says okay the
user is now looking at this screen this
is the activity that they have open you
can stick that in on or resume now just
to show you guys some cool stuff
whenever you actually close out of your
app hit the home button right here look
what happens the first thing it does is
it calls on pause
and then it says on save instant state
and then on stop now on pause what this
means is the user is no longer seeing
your activity
so whenever of course I was looking at
that screen no I'm now I'm no longer
looking at it then on pause gets caught
now another reason on pause may get
called is maybe I just switched screens
and I'm now looking at a new one so
again those are two different times when
your app is going to call on pause
pretty much when your user is looking at
the screen and they're not looking at
anymore now instead of talking to you
guys about on say Vince's state and
detail and on stop there's actually a
lot more different states than this what
you guys can do is I found this image
online that is absolutely awesome and I
stuck it in that same URL so what you
can see here is a pretty awesome
visualization of every single state in
your activity now again I wanted to show
you guys this because right now if I
talk about every single one of these
things in detail it's probably going to
be a little overwhelming and kind of
pointless right now so instead what I'm
going to do is this I'm just going to
talk about these now that we understand
what they are and that they do exist
I'm going to talk about each state as we
need them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
