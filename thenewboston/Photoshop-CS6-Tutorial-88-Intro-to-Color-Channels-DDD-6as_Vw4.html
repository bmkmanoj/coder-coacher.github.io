you guys doing today my name is buddy
Blackford and it looks like we're going
to be going over colors in color
channels and in the next few tutorials
we're gonna go about understanding how
those work in Photoshop and why they're
important and everything like that
now color channels are located to the
right of your layers panel on a tab that
just says channels and there's a couple
different kinds of color channels you
there's a RGB which stands for red green
and blue not to be confused with our g3
the quarterback of the washy Washington
Redskins at this time so don't get that
confused now what these channels do is
they can contain information in
different shades of the colors here and
when they're all added together they
create a composite image that shows all
the true colors here now we've got red
channel if we just take a look at it you
can see the different shades of red here
and then if we look at just the green
and then the blue and if we start adding
these together you can see more color is
coming into the image and eventually if
we add them all together we get a
composite image with all our colors that
we would like now there's also another
type of set of color channels and that
is make sure I get it CMYK and CMYK is
used for printing and most printing
presses that that people use to print
out really really nice images and
professional images are for color
printing presses that use cyan magenta
yellow and and black so RGB is used for
like computer screens and monitors and
basically their web colors and CMYK is
for using the for printing so that's the
basic under
standing of the channels in each Channel
there is going to be 256 radiations of
the color where 0 is going to be black
and a 255 value is going to be white and
anything in between is going to be
another shade of that color so for
example the cyan here has 200 and or has
up to 256 values here now I don't really
see any black on here so it might not
have values up to 0 or anything like
that in it now if I use my pointer here
and start clicking around you can look
up here in the color to see the
different variations up here of the of
the color and what's what we're looking
at now open it up and then you can see
how the different color swatches up here
are changing let me go up here to this
one and I'll show you the exact same
thing we'll go into the blue here so we
just have well we'll just have red
showing and you can see that this is a
value of red of 251 and then if I come
down here it's a value of 7 because it's
darker it's almost black so there's 19
and then this is lighter so it's gonna
be up higher so hopefully that makes
sense so this red value is close to 255
now if you want to see the different or
if you want to experiment and check out
the different color channels on your own
when you import an image sometimes it's
just gonna or most of the time it's just
going to import into RGB now what you
need to do is come up into image and
then we'll go to mode and then you can
change it to CMYK there and it'll change
color channels so can okay so it can uh
apply to a smart object so we're gonna
need to rasterize this so just hit
rasterize and
we can not merge don't merge and I think
it was gonna do all these different
things but this one you just hit okay
and now we have changed it to CMYK so
we've got the different channels here so
there's a white this is like a grayscale
basically it's called black and then we
got our yellow magenta so that's how
that works out and then we start adding
these together and you start getting
more color and then finally our black
and then we get everything in there so
that's how the color channels work and
having a good understanding of how these
channels work is key to being a pro in
Photoshop it's not and I'm gonna teach
you this kind of stuff in the next
several tutorials that we're going over
so you can start being able to use
Photoshop in a more air and understand
Photoshop at a better way and so you can
use it more professionally I guess so
that's it for this tutorial thanks for
watching and see you in the next series
so have a good one everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
