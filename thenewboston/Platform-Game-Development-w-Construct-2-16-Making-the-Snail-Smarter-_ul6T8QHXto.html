sweet tutorial and in this video we're
gonna be adding some actual intelligence
to our enemy so right now remember in
the last tutorial we added a variable to
this enemy
we're said ok action can equal right and
we're also going to have it so action
can equal left but those words need mean
nothing to the game so what does it mean
when right well it doesn't mean go right
doesn't mean you know jump up and down
is this now supposed to eat a potato
whenever its action equals right even
though what we know what rate means and
obviously we want to snap a curl right
we need to tell the game that's what it
means so in order to do that hop over to
your event XI and we're gonna add some
events the first one is at event and
also since there's no bounding box first
now we can just work directly on the
snow object which is makes it a lot
easier to explain so the snail enemy and
what I want to set now is actually since
we're working with an instance variable
we want to put compare instance variable
so the variable that we just made in the
only one we can select which makes it
even easier is action so when action is
equal to and use a quotations right here
or quotes when action is equal to right
what do I want to do well we just want
to have the snail crawl right in other
words move right and also use the same
animation as he's using right now
because it's hilarious
alright so the action that we want to
occur whenever this variable equals
right is snail enemy and if you scroll
down to platform behavior you're gonna
find one that says simulate control
right here and we'll just simulate right
so basically whenever this variable is
right and this is what's going to happen
right now off the bat by default the
snail is gonna act like someone was
pressing right for him in other words
he's gonna crawl right now the only
other thing we have to do is make sure
that the and
mission is we go snail set animation and
actually did sent me right here not
mirrored so just like before the not
mirrored one is basically the default
animation of him looking to the right
and humping the ground so right now
whenever um the game starts
since this is the default value for the
variable he's going to crawl right and
use that same animation of him humping
the ground so now of course we need to
do the same thing for left so I had a
whole nother event snail enemy where my
instance variable is compare instance
variables now when the action is equal
to left it's now enemy simulate control
left right there and also at the action
of snail enemy works in the animation
set animation messed that up again
Meishan snow and we where the heck is it
am I just an idiot right now all right
now appearance why is that under
appearance it should not be I guess I
should I'm I guess I haven't hit hit
alright and mirrored so basically right
now he's gonna be crawling all right and
using the same animation and whenever
but we changed the variable the instance
variable he's gonna be crawling left and
he's gonna be facing the opposite way so
his eyes are gonna be it's gonna look
like he's looking left but right now
you're thinking okay this looks good the
events look good the animations look
good however how is that variable
actually changed because right now we
just put two invisible blocks on the
screen we didn't tell the game that one
this now actually comes in contact with
this edge marker that's when we want you
to change the variable
and remember the only other thing that
we have to do to get them to turn around
is change this action to left once he
does that the events will take it from
there
so how do we do that well we need to add
another event of course and the event
for this is and we're gonna be doing a
couple sub events the first thing that
we want to add is the snail Menna me
did I say snail man me what the heck is
a snow man me so when the snail collides
with another object do something well
what do you want to check if the snail
collides with well it's this edge marker
object right here
so whenever the snail collides with one
of these edge markers this is what we do
we want to click it and hit sub event
and the only other thing we want to do
is pretty much change his action and
this is actually really easy
so snail enemy not gonna be able to find
this again I'm just going to punch my
computer screen compare instance
variable is action equal to right I'm
just gonna coat this all and then we're
gonna talk because it's kind of making
me confuse have not typing all this
logic just now enemy this is variable
action equal to and then we need to add
an else add actions now enemy cool you
guys can probably see what's going on
already the value of this equal to right
all right
so hopefully this works basically um
we're telling our game whenever the
snail collides with an edge marker see
what their instance variable is if it's
equal to right then change it to left
else in week we could have add is
actually equal to left but this else is
just a whole lot easier oh if it's not
equal to right then it must be
two left so change it three and of
course whenever their action is equal to
left or right it's going to make the
enemy behave in the proper way as we
told it right here and right here
so now let's test this out and check it
out
so the snail starts out going right and
hopefully once he gets right here it
says okay I collided with that now
change my action to right go this way
collided with this change it back to
left go this way back and forth and back
and forth he goes so now of course we
can still run into him and get hurt and
also kill him if I can land on them just
like before so again like I said this
isn't the smartest snail in the world
but that is your very basics to
artificial intelligence and that's
pretty much like how they made the game
like Sonic and Super Mario Brothers of a
large majority of the game that's just
how they I mean they didn't use the
software but that's pretty much the
logic behind it so for now now that we
got our snail working perfectly we're
ready to move on to the next tutorial
it's gonna be awesome so I'll see you
guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
