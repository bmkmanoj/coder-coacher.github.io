tutorial and in this tutorial we are
going to be testing a database and
making sure it can connect to the
internet so before we get started one
other thing if you've been following
along when whenever you added that colon
right there it was supposed to go in
here so make sure it goes in the
quotation marks since it's not actually
part of PHP code it's actually just a
string of text so once you corrected
that and make sure you do it or else
you're going to get an error we can
finally start testing our database now
what we're going to do right here isn't
actually part of the computer game we're
making it's just a way to test our
database real quick to make sure
everything gets updated
now if you don't know our database right
here remember you filled in I changed my
email already but we're going to be
changing that again this is what we're
going to be updating now I showed you
one way to do it but we're going to be
updating it right from the browser so go
ahead and follow along with me and I'm
going to be going over some stuff that's
kind of advanced but this is just for
testing I'll explain it all later
first of all I'll make a comment just it
says test so we don't actually forget
that this is not actually part of the
code and after our test is done we're
just going to be deleting all this so
you don't have to worry about what your
 says there anything like that go
ahead and might make a variable called
query and what query is is pretty much
in action but again you don't really
have to learn anything in this tutorial
I know that sounds kind of stupid it's
just a test so after we do this we're
going to be deleting oh and then we get
back to learning but still a very
important part the next thing we want to
be typing in these quotation marks is
actually my SQL code in my SQL code is
pretty much straightforward like there
aren't any
key variables you pretty much type what
you want it to do with some keywords so
that's very update game let me just type
this on I'll tell you guys what it means
later
I'll take game set email equal to hope
this works
and I spelled around but so good where
username equals Bucky 20 now what this
means is all right what action do we
want you to perform we want you to
update the table game and remember
already knows with database we're taking
about talking about update the table
game alright how do you want us to
update it we want you to set the email
which is right now yay we want you to
change that to hope this works where
username equals Bucky 20 now why do you
have to say where because if there are a
bunch of users and they all had emails
it wouldn't know about one update so now
we want to say update email where
username equals Bucky 20 and it says all
right anytime there's a user name called
Bucky 20 I'm going to put the email
equal to hope this works
spelled wrong but that's alright the
next variable we want to write is result
and this pretty much means the result of
our action again
you don't really have to remember that
I'm going to be going over the later
MySQL underscore query and this means
what action the variable we just did so
again if you don't understand that it's
fine just go right ahead and save it let
me check real quick make sure I don't
have any errors that I can see at least
then go down to your host panel
unlimited FTP
connecting expand that real quick go
down to where my file is located in my
desktop I called a connection file drag
it over a public HTML yes I do want to
overwrite it now in order to run this
script we actually have to go to the
website so where my files are located
yours is going to be different but go to
the new boston.com slash connection file
dot PHP there it is right there and if
it runs good
then you shouldn't see anything on the
screen at all if you have an error error
will pop up but since we then output any
text on the screen
we just want a blank message so now go
to your database and as you see email is
yay and we change that so we're going to
want to go ahead and refresh it and as
you see if everything worked out like it
did your email is going to change too
hope this works now this is how you can
change elements in your database
directly from a connection file as you
can see our email is now changed to hope
this works and this is how when we're
working with our game the user is going
to be able to update their information
by themselves so this was just a test
that wasn't part of game l but do
exactly as i did with your own
information in it you can update your
email anything you want and if it works
exactly like that it means your database
is working perfectly
and if you got any errors or anything
like that just go ahead and send me the
error message and send me your PHP code
either to just message me on youtube and
send it to me and I'll show you what you
did wrong and I'll send it back to you
and once everything is good to go then
move on to my next tutorial so do
exactly as I did test your dad base and
make sure you can connect and I hope to
see you next tutorial Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
