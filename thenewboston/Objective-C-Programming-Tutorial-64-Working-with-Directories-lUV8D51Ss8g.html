objective-c tutorial and in this
tutorial we're going to begin working
with directories now if you're familiar
with windows only a directory is the
same thing as a folder it's where you
store all your files and you know help
you navigate around your computer so
let's just go ahead and begin getting
right in the code so NS the first thing
we need to do is create that file
manager and you can go ahead and a
manager like before not manger manager
that's a bit better and let's go ahead
and make it an S file manager and
default manager you can go ahead and put
this all in one line I didn't know why I
wasn't in the LES Soros and go ahead and
NS string make an empty string called
path or actually whatever you want I'm
going to name my path and this is going
to store the path well we just need it
for an example that we're going to be
teaching me right now so the first thing
I want you to do is how to get current
directory and what you need to do is go
ahead and take that path string variable
that you have that's empty right now and
we want to set it equal to manager
current directory path just like this
now what this current directory path
method does is it takes your path as a
string and it stores it in your path
variable pretty cool huh
so now anytime we want the name of our
path you just have to NMS log it out we
won't do anything fancy just bring that
like that and go ahead and build and run
this and check out what we got so this
is our directory right here where we're
working where our programs are running
from lucky tests build the bug and if
you look visually in our build the bug
you can see our program right here so
that verifies that this is indeed where
our program is running from chef say
alright big wall we can see what
directory our programs are running from
what else cool things can we do well we
check this out
we have one program in here nothing much
in this file go ahead and I'm going to
show you how to add another directory
right
inside of here pretty cool be able to
create new directory so let's go ahead
and create a new directory and make sure
you spell directory wrong and go ahead
and add it if statement might as well
get rid of our errors right here and
that's log am but could not create a new
directory and if we get that then just
return one or anything you want so go
ahead and inside your if statement
what you want to do is you want to get
that manager and you want to call a
method called create directory at path
in the past is what you want the new
directory to be named I want mine to be
named a new der yeah just new dirt won't
do anything too fancy
so as attributes here's where it can get
kind of a actually I think this is a
this is the old let's see create
directory or path we need to do is
that's the old method that's is
deprecated now so with intermediate
directories and just put no for this and
this means no intermediate directories
of course and then after this attributes
set this equal to nil because we don't
want any attributes and for our air if
we get any just put no this is the new
method that other one that popped up
automatically was an old way of doing
things and we don't want that so if this
entire thing it's a boolean method
either returns yes or no if it returns
to know that it means something went
wrong and very well coded because that
was a lot of words I had to type I
probably misspelled something so let's
go ahead and make sure we created yep so
check this out a new directory was just
created so what we want to do is go
ahead and move that to trash because
when we run this program again it's
going to try to create one on top of
that so we want to make sure
nothing's there so the last thing I'm
going to teach you to do is rename that
the directory that we just created so we
want to compile all the if statements
and stuff for this what we're going to
do is just call that manager object and
we'll call move item at path there we go
and as a first parameter it takes is
what item do you want to move and we
want to move that new Durr because it's
going to be created and after this
you're right to path where do we want to
move it remember that old trick in the
last tutorial you move it in the same
directory just give it a new name so
name it
bacon eater or something like something
totally different so you can see and of
course the last one is err no and I mean
that looks pretty good
so hopefully what this is gonna do is is
gonna create a new directory called
neuter and then it's going to take that
and rename it to bacon eater so uh yeah
let's see what we get
build and run this Oh nice bacon eater
right there so what this did pretty much
is got the current directory easy enough
created a new directory named neuter and
it took that directory picked it up
renamed it and popped it back down
exactly in the same spot so I mean it
kind of moved it somewhere else with a
new name give the appearance that others
renaming it since there's no really
method just to rename a directory that's
what you need to do so that's that for
this story I hope you guys enjoyed and
that's all we're gonna be covering over
the directories there's a lot more
methods but you know when we're writing
programs if we need any more methods
we'll just I'll just teach them to you
guys as we go along
so thank you for watching don't forget

to be in the link below so thanks for
watching I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
