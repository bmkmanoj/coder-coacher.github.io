story I'm going to start talking to you
about core animation how to apply simple
animations to objects on your screen and
eventually whenever we make games we're
going to be using animation a lot of
course you probably already knew that
but for right now I just want to teach
you guys the basics of animation and by
animation I just mean really simple
stuff like rotating objects or I don't
know like making them grow or just like
moving them to a different point so for
right now you know since we don't have
any like game characters or anything
like that I'm just going to add a button
to the screen and show you guys a really
simple animation on that just to show
you guys the basics so let's go ahead
and hop over to the storyboard and the
first by the way all I did so far is I
created a brand new single view
application um you know bulk project
nothing new and what I want to do here
is uncheck use size classes so we got
something that resembles the iPhone
alright looking good so now let me go
ahead and just add a simple button type
in butt and drag that bad boy out too
might as well just stick it in the dead
center looks good we can it doesn't
matter what text you have on it actually
and now of course what we need to do is
if we're going to be adding code to
animate this we need to get a reference
to it so get rid of this panel
temporarily go to your split view and
let me clean this up a little bit delete
this comment and you can actually delete
this entire did receive memory warning
method we don't need that one at all
alright so let me give myself some space
above the viewdidload method and if you
hold down control of course drag you're
going to make a little outlet and I'll
just name mine Bucky's button connect
and we now have reference to this button
so let me open up my view controller
since we don't need that storyboard
anymore alright so here we go done
setting everything up so now that we
have a reference to it
how do we animate this button well in
your viewdidload method this is a pretty
good place to put it what we need to do
is we need to create something called an
animation block and this is actually
really easy what you do is you give it
two settings one how long do you want
the animation to be for example if
you're moving something on the screen
from point A to point B do you want it
to be one second do you want to be slow
like 10 seconds um so that's the first
thing how long you want it to be and
second is the animation and by that I
mean do you want it to rotate do you
want it to stretch do you want it to
fade out what are you trying to do here
so to create an animation block let me
add a comment but great animation a lot
to fade out so we'll just fade out this
button right now and there are a couple
different parameters that you can add to
this animation but for example um you
can say there's like different speeds of
animation different types and again
emmissions can get pretty complex but
for right now I'm just teaching you guys
the basics so you know I just wanted to
warn you that there's more if you guys
actually want to dive into it so UI view
since indeed what we're doing is we're
applying an animation to a view object
pretty much any object that the user can
interact with or look at is view object
and the animate with duration right
there all right
so animate with duration is the method
and the first one of course is the
duration how many seconds I'll just
write three seconds
now this animations right here this is
where you put or in other words build
that animation so if you use curly
brackets the most common way to do this
is just to add curly brackets and write
all of your animation functionality in
here so all we're doing is just going to
take one line of code we're going to say
okay on this button Bucky's button
trained up I was going to say trains
trains change the Alpha in other words
the transparency so self in this class
Bucky's button get the Alpha Al PHA
which is the transparency and set it
equal to zero so now what this is going
to do and that's it whenever we run it
it's going to say okay I'm going to take
three seconds and from whatever the
button is now whatever alpha I'm going
to change it to zero and that's it so
now if I run this check it out alright
so notice as soon as this loads the
button is at 100% alpha and it fades out
over three seconds I know it's kind of
hard to tell since it happens as soon as
we love and that's another thing if
you're like alright I don't want that to
happen as soon is my view loads there's
another delay that you can add so I
don't know maybe it waits five seconds
before the animation starts but again
that's all in detail stuff I'll talk
about that in detail later on so for now
if I just run that one more time just so
you guys can see button fades out over
three seconds so now that we got the
basics and we know how it's done I'll
show you guys what I mean by you can
actually build multiple animations in
here so let's say that we wanted to do
something like we want it to I don't
know don't fade it out anymore we'll say
that we wanted to grow this button and
also rotate it so you can actually just
build constants in here so whenever we
want to combine transformations like
this we can actually use a new method
but it's really easy but first we need
to give it all the parameters in other
words how much do you want to grow and
what angle do you want to rotate it by
so let grow equals CG affine
transformation and the two parameters
this takes we'll just say like four by
four that'll just mean grow to four
times your normal size in both width and
height and again these are just settings
right now just variables we'll plug them
into the main animation later
next we'll say let angle
now the angle we need to give it has to
be a CG float and we'll just say 40 pick
any angle you want it doesn't really
matter and if we say let's rotate this
is the actual animation itself so CG
affine transform make rotation and if we
toss an angle right here that'll be good
so right now we have two transformations
belt one is right here it's rotate and
this just spins it and another one is
transform and this just grows it and
this one is just kind of a parameter to
say how much do you want to rotate it by
but we didn't apply them to the button
so whenever we want to apply multiple
transformations to a single object this
is what we do it's really simple one
line of code again you get a reference
to that object the view object in the
transform property right here set this
equal to CG affine transform if you can
see it concat to where yeah where yeah
okay a phone right there concat so can
Kat essentially means take two things
and stick them together in other words
make them happen at once
so what do we want to stick together
well this grow which enlarges it and
also rotate which spins it so going to
right here we're setting up the
transformations right here we're
sticking them together and applying them
to the object so I have an error in here
because what I actually need to call is
transform make scale and okay messed up
my parameter so let's fix that and we
can delete these Wow do this third way
all right so there we go now if I run
this check it out so again look at that
it grows it by four by four in other
words and larger by four multitudes or
four scale four scales in every
direction and also forty degrees you can
see right here that's the ending of it
and well that's it simple enough so now
you know how to apply single animations
and also if you ever have multiple
animations that you want to apply to
simple view objects well you can do that
in in the next tutorial we're going to
be jumping into more game related um
development and coding it's going to be
pretty cool so well I'll shut up now and
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
