this video I need your opinion on
something
my sister is in ninth grade she's a
freshman in high school and she just got
her very first boyfriend now her
boyfriend is a senior he's a lot older
than her now I told my sister that
listen you shouldn't be dating I really
don't even want her dating anyone but I
said listen you shouldn't be dating
someone who's that much older than you
and I told my friend about this and he
said you know what Bucky as long as the
guy is nice to her then age shouldn't
really be an issue so I know that I'm
biased because you know it is my sister
I don't even want her dating anyone at
all ever
but um give me your opinion and tell me
am i right and is this guy just too much
older than her especially for a first
boyfriend and she really shouldn't be
dating him or is my friend right and I'm
just the idiot and being stupid because
she's my sister so with that being said
now that I got that off my frickin chest
let's go ahead and start styling you
know what are we working on oh yeah CSS
all right so the first thing I want to
do is I want to style the images in the
footer now by default some browsers and
also whenever you take an image and turn
it into a link Internet Explorer is a
pain in the butt with this but it puts a
border around the image so I want to
just go ahead and take all the images in
the footer if I can get my freaking
cursor in the right place and set the
border equal to none and if we didn't
have this then there would be a border
around these images and of course that
would look kind of stupid and we're
actually going to be putting a border
around other images that are in the drop
menus but we'll do that later on we want
to you know we want to control that we
don't want to let the browser control
that now after this what we need to do
is we need to work on the unordered list
within the list elements now I want to
go ahead and explain something whenever
you guys think of an unordered list you
probably think of something like this or
at least I do pretty much a list of that
like you would have in Microsoft Word
or you know any general web development
but you can actually take your list
items and they don't have to be vertical
like this or like this you can actually
take those list items and stack them
horizontally so believe it or not this
toolbar or this footer is an unordered
list
it's just horizontal now this account
button this profile this two column
program button all these buttons are
list items so isn't that you know this
obviously is a lot cooler way that we
can tweak unordered lists kind of you
know heck the functionality of HTML
rather than making this boring you know
one then the next line put another thing
you know anyways oh excuse me got
whooping cough removing all day all
right so with that being said what are
we saying in this attribute well first
of all we're working in the footer
now I already told you guys that each of
these buttons account profile two column
programs is a list item now within those
buttons we are styling the unordered
list now believe it or not this is
actually not an unordered list right
here but this is now I say this isn't
actually could have made it but it's
easier if we develop it another way now
this right here calculator group chat
image editor all of these items are part
of an unordered list so that's what I'm
styling basically my programs right here
now later on this is a really cool
feature I want to talk to you guys about
you see that we have four buttons or a
clock see five we have the home button
account profile two columns and programs
bun my website is actually developed
where whenever you click like calculator
it opens it up in a new tab or a new
button so then you can close it and open
it back up and your footer is dynamic
just like a Windows you know operating
system or just like your computer pretty
freakin sweet but for now let's just go
ahead and style all the elements in this
programs by doing this so the first
thing I want to do is set list style
equal to nine
because by default as you know unordered
lists have a bullet point and if there
was a bullet point or anything any
symbol before these it'll look pretty
freaking dumb the next thing I want to
do is just so it looks a little better
put padding equal to zero pixels and if
I put that any bigger then the text
would be way too far apart from the
border and if you guys are saying okay
if padding's is zero pixels right now
how come this text isn't butted up
against the border well whenever we make
this entire drop up menu we're gonna
give it a default padding so it we have
more control that way but for right now
it's just easier if we set this to zero
pixels and also a margin bottom to 12
pixels so there you go
and again what this is styling right
here is basically your programs menu in
this menu people love this whenever I
teach them how to make this you know
little footer you're gonna have this a
lot whenever you implement it in your
website so just remember that for now
alright so in the next sorrow I actually
want to go over a very important concept
it's clear and it's gonna take me a
couple minutes to explain but for now I
think you guys for watching and don't
forget to answer my question about my
sister I want to know if I'm just being
a complete idiot or you know maybe my
friend is right maybe I have a valid
point let me know thank you guys for
watching and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
