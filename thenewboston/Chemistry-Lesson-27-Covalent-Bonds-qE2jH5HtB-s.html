amazing chemistry tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm gonna be talking about
covalent bonds sounds exciting right so
covalent bonds are the other main type
of chemical bonding aside from ionic
bonds and actually unlike ionic bonds no
electrons are transferred between atoms
so the goal of all atoms whether they're
about to bond ionically or covalently is
basically they want to complete their
valence energy level they want to fill
it up
that's when atoms are satisfied and
happy and stable so that's the goal of
all atoms however a covalent bond is
instead of giving away or taking an
electron like an ionic bond they decide
to share their electrons pretty weird
huh so let me go ahead and draw a
diagram so say we have hydrogen right
here now hydrogen as you may know it has
one valence electron on the outermost
energy level so basically it has one
valence electron
however the outermost energy level can
hold two electrons so that's what all
hydrogen's are looking for two electrons
to satisfy it so say it runs into
another hydrogen now this hydrogen is
gonna be in the same boat he's gonna say
okay I have my energy level right here
and I have one electron well what's
gonna happen is basically this whenever
hydrogen I'll just name this one
hydrogen number one finds another
hydrogen it's gonna ask it for its
electron it's gonna say hey dude you see
this electron over here that's looking
pretty good you mind if I take it
because then I can use that to fill me
up
well this electron electron excuse me
this hydrogen hydrogen number two is not
going to give up its electron because if
it does then it's gonna have no
electrons and it's going to become even
less stable so that's just not going to
happen so what happens is the hydrogen's
bicker back and forth and back and forth
the same who's going to take what until
they finally agree that okay you
well why don't we just share our
electrons so the final graph or diagram
or example whatever you want to call it
it basically ends up looking like this
you have two hydrogen's and instead of
one having both of them they decide to
share their electrons just like that and
that kind of looks like something
perverted I'm not going to get into that
right now but this really is what ends
up happening so that way whenever they
share their electrons the electrons are
going to orbit around both the first and
the second hydrogen and that way both of
the hydrogens think that they have their
energy levels filled and they both are
satisfied now this is pretty much the
basic speed behind a covalent bond
instead of transferring electrons from
one place to another you basically share
the electrons instead it's a much more
nice theory once you think about it so
instead of drawing all these perverted
looking diagrams chemists actually came
up with a better way to write this using
something called the electron dot
formula or I call it the electron dot
technique but it's probably called the
electron dot formula so I'll just go
ahead and try stick with that so instead
of drawing the Bohr model that looks
like a pair of boobs over and over again
valence electrons are represented with
dots so oh that's kind of embarrassing
so say you would have a hydrogen you
just put one dot right there
and say you would have another hydrogen
you would put another dot right there so
basically one dot means one valence
electron so if you would combine this
hydrogen with this hydrogen you would
end up with something looking like this
hydrogen hydrogen and the two dots are
shared between them and we call that the
electron dot technique where any of the
dots that are shared we just assume that
that is a covalent bond because you know
it's a whole lot easier than drawing the
huge Bohr model however chemists came up
with the even
easier way to represent this and that's
with it's pretty much the same thing but
it's a modified version where instead of
two dots representing a covalent bond
you pretty much use a dash instead so
the basic is is pretty much like this
you have two hydrogen's and instead of
drawing two dots you have a - so that's
what most chemists use although if you
use two dots like this they're probably
still going to understand what you mean
but more commonly you use a dash instead
of two dots makes sense and I think this
is called whenever you use the dash it's
called the Lewis dot formula instead of
the electron dot formula but I'm not
positive on that so don't quote me on
that so aside from all that let me go
ahead and give you one more example
because hydrogen is really simple to see
but sometimes you need something a
little more complex to really get the
point across so say you have something
like chlorine now chlorine has seven
valence electrons now you draw those
like this one two three four five six
seven now if it wants to bond with
another chlorine you would draw the
other chlorine so one two three four
five six seven so each of these chlorine
atoms has seven valence electrons and
that's how you would draw it however if
you wanted to draw it in a proper Lewis
dot formula you need to draw it like
this
chlorine bonded with chlorine and then
you start drawn the valence electrons
one two three four five six and then one
two three four five six and then you
would draw the electrons that they share
one for this one and the other for this
one so now you can see each of these
chlorine atoms has a full valence energy
level they're both happy they're both
bonded into this what's it called
covalent bond however more typically
people use instead of those two dots
they typically use
if I can undo those oh I keep writing
crap all over they typically use a dash
instead so this is actually a whole lot
easier than drawing that bore model with
a chlorine then energy levels energy
levels - this is a whole lot easier this
Lewis dot formula so that's what I'm
gonna be using from now on so that's
basically it that's basics behind a
covalent bond and the electron dot
formula and the Lewis dot formula so
hopefully you guys brains are about to
explode and once you understand this
you're ready to move on to my next
tutorial
but for now thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
