coming back to another tutorial on
photoshop cs6
I'm buddy Blackbird today we're gonna go
over using Auto contrast and auto color
and Auto tone
they're up here in the image panel or
image options up here or my mouses and
auto tone contrast and color so when I
was taught in college about these I was
told to never use them but they had do
have some uses that I've found since
working with Photoshop often and they
speed things up every once in a while
but also they kind of sometimes I suck
and don't do what you want them to do or
make like a crappy looking product so
open up any image that you want I've got
this one right here because this is a
good example of one that gets when you
add like auto color or something like
that it looks like crap so I'm gonna
show you how it looks good and how it
can look bad so let's go to image and
let's go to Auto tone and we'll see what
that does real quick you can see that
the tone is different
oops I already had some things on there
I take that off and redo it image Auto
tone there we go and then if we go back
and forth you can see that the tone here
is if you check out like the shirt you
can see the different colors there's a
more of a green color throughout the
image here and you can definitely tell
it on the shirt especially this one
right here in the middle so now it's off
I want to go to Auto contrast and you
can and you'll see that nothing really
happens so this is an example of when
the auto are when Auto contrast or one
of the autos doesn't do anything no I
don't see any changes to you didn't
think so so let's try out something else
let's go to auto color and you can see
how
color made everything more green and
unless you're going for like a military
kind of look making like a green a green
overlay color isn't good it just makes
things look crappy so just keep an eye
on what you're doing when you use the
auto color and auto contrast they pretty
much are good starting points but some
but I wouldn't just end my project with
just using an auto contrast or an auto
color or something like that
because you really don't know how it's
actually gonna turn out that well so you
might want to follow up after this with
like a levels or contrast or a curves or
something like that now when you use
let's go actually let's go to the next
picture and then we can see how
something like this looks pretty good so
we're gonna start here and we're gonna
go to image we'll go to auto tone and
you can see how the auto tone made the
darks a little darker and richer and I
think it made the photo look a little
better so you can see the photo had a
lot of blue in it and purple and then
when I go to Auto tone it made it a
little darker not so much purple and all
that stuff throughout so that's like an
example of when things are going well
when you use the auto tone now I just
want to go over what these do really
quick for the auto contrast and auto
color so the auto contrast adjusts the
tone of the image without impacting the
color the auto color adjust the tone and
color of the image by ignoring its
channels except for the composite
channel so it's just gonna look at the
composite Channel
so it would be like taking out these RGB
and just looking at the composite
channel which is a combination of RGB
our red green blue so that's how that
works
now one thing about using Auto contrast
and auto color is going to take all the
different
parts of your image and like if I go
ahead and like start painting white
stuff all over the image it's gonna take
that stuff into effect okay let's go to
an auto tone here image Auto tone and
it's not going to affect the error it's
going to affect the image differently
it's going to take it into consideration
these different parts so if I had like a
lot of pink in here and it would make
the image a little more pink so let's
try it out and see if that actually
works so let's go to Auto tone that one
so it's a little darker and then let's
try to add some like pinks or something
like that see if this actually will do
it I didn't test this beforehand and
then let's go to image like something
like auto color so this was before this
is after not not as good how much is
going on and it's taking some of these
pink colors and everything and putting
it into into the image so that's uh
basically I'm going to talk about about
the auto contrast and auto commands and
hopefully you guys learned some things
about it and learn not to use it just on
its own make sure you are going in and
adjusting and making the picture look
even better with other things like
curves and levels contrast hue and
saturation and stuff like that if you're
color correcting so thanks a lot for
watching and I appreciate you guys
