video and now that we got the project
set up exactly how we needed to in
Eclipse now what we need to do is we
need to download the libraries from the
slick website and also the lightweight
Java game library website so let's go
ahead and download the slick library
first so go ahead and go to slicks
website which is this right here
maybe they change it but at the time of
this tutorial that's what it is and on
the right hand side you can see a link
that says download full distribution now
as soon as you click that something's
going to start downloading go ahead and
wait for it to download then once it's
done downloading go ahead and navigate
to it which mine is under Bucky and
download now you're going to get a file
that looks like this slick with a little
zipper on it this is a zip file
I'm guessing 99% you guys know what this
is but if you don't know what to do for
the noobs go ahead and right click it
and press send to or excuse me
right-click it and press extract all
right here now once you extract it then
you're going to get a regular file so
the regular file is going to look it's
going to be named the exact same thing
except it's not going to have a zipper
you can go ahead and see all the files
in it so go ahead and click your
extracted slick file and now in here you
see a bunch of other stuff
what we're looking for is Lib L I B so
go ahead and double click that now
inside here we're going to want to steal
a couple files the first one is this one
l w JGL so go ahead and click that now
go ahead and hold ctrl on your keyboard
and also click slick so now that we have
two files that we need selected go ahead
and right click those and copy so what
we want to do once we copy those is we
want to open eclipse back up and we want
to paste them inside this jars file so
you can either right click and hit paste
or just hit control V on your keyboard
and now if you expand this jars file you
can see that
two files that we stole from that slick
website that we downloaded LW jgl jar
and slick dot jar we're good to go so
now with those files now what we need to
do is something a little bit confusing
so make sure you pay attention go ahead
and click on the name of your project
which is hand blaster and you actually
want to right-click it and select
properties which is all the way down at
the bottom now on the left hand side
you're going to see an option that says
Java build path go ahead and click Java
build path and it takes you to a window
with four different tabs by default it's
the order and export tab but we are
actually looking for the libraries tab
so go ahead and click libraries and now
what we want to do is select add jars so
go ahead and select add jars and it's
going to say okay what jars do you want
to add well the jars that we want ahead
add are the ones that we just added so
those are under your hand blaster and
you can probably see this if you look on
the left hand side but go ahead and
expand lib then jars and now select both
your jars by selecting one hitting
select and selecting both of them and
make sure you have both of them selected
and once you do you can go ahead and hit
OK so now both of those jars are going
to be a parent or viewable right in this
section right here if you didn't if you
can't see both of them in this window
right here then go ahead and hit add
jars and make sure you add the other one
and now once you're done with this just
go ahead and hit OK so now that we took
care of that well okay I might as well
doing this tutorial since we have time
now what we need to do is we need to
download the crap from the other website
which is the lightweight Java gaming
library website so whenever you go to
this website which is LW jgo org on the
left-hand side you're going to see a
link that says download go ahead and
click that
and it's going to say latest stable
releases two point eight point three if
there's a newer version just go ahead
and download the newer version this
tutorial is going to work but go ahead
and click this now once you click that
you're going to be taken to a web page
with a bunch of different options the
source the docks the zip or the applet
which you want is the main file LW jgl
not the DUP not the docs not the source
not the applet the main file and you can
see that this is the one that most
people are downloading because this
little chart on the right hand side has
the popularity and you know evidently
this one is has the biggest graph it's
the most popular so go ahead and click
this and it's going to download that zip
file for you I of course downloaded
already at the same time you don't want
to you know sit here and watch me
download files all day so once you
download it go ahead and navigate to it
and mine is of course in Buckey
downloads and you're going to get a zip
file so go ahead and right click extract
all and once windows is done extracting
your file you're going to get a regular
file that's l.w jgl 283 or whatever
version you have so now what you want to
do is you want to open up this file open
up this one and you want to open up the
folder that says jar so go ahead and
select jar and now what we want to do is
we want to steal one of these files as
well the file that we want to steal is
l-w j GL so go ahead and right click
right click this one hit copy and then
go ahead back inside eclipse now where
you want to put this is inside your jar
you see that you already have a file l w
j GL well go ahead and just highlight
the folder jars and paste it and it's
going to say well you already have a
file called this do you want to
overwrite it just go ahead and say yes
to all or yes and it's going to
overwrite that with the proper um jar
file that we want so now the last
thing that we need to do is back in your
extracted file let me minimize this so
it's easier to see back in your
extracted file LW JGL the one that you
download it and extract it go ahead and
click this again
now instead of jar what we want to do is
we want to open native now once you open
native you're going to see all of the
folders that say linux mac solaris
solaris whatever the heck that is and
windows go ahead and select all of those
folders right click and copy now the
last thing that we're going to be doing
in this tutorial is pasting these back
in the section and eclipse what section
you ask the native section so go ahead
in your eclipse project where it says
natives select this and paste it and now
once you expand natives check it out it
says linux mac solaris and windows all
of the operating systems that our game
is going to be able to run on is now
properly set up in eclipse so guys i
know this is a lot of setup and the good
news is we only have to set this up once
and once we do we're going to be you
know jumping into programming and gaming
all the good stuff but i got bad news in
the next tutorial i probably have two
more minutes of setup to go through and
then guys i promise i'm going to show
you guys how to make the best games you
can ever dream of so you know thank you

tutorial if you don't then just go ahead
