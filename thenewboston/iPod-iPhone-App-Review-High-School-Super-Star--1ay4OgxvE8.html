welcome to another one my app reviews
and this is for a game called high
school superstar so let me go ahead and
open this and you can see that it starts
the load high school super Stop go
seniors connecting all right now this
game is pretty much a game that
simulates high school and you have a
bunch of different tasks that you need
to do in order to accomplish different
things now I pretty much i'm going to go
over every button here and it's pretty
much going to tell you what happens this
first button right here is the to do
list so if you click the to do list you
see a bunch of things that you can do
now these things help you get popular
and if you can see up here on your
popularity you got one out of 80 now
once you get 80 out of 80 you go to the
next level which is a nine for me I'm
already on level eight because I spend
all my time playing this so let's go
ahead and do to do right now and it says
re get rid of that so go ahead and click
to do and do something like this and
then once you complete it check it out
you're now two out of 80 so that's
pretty much what popularity does along
with some other things so anyways let's
go to something else now you see the
next thing is your locker now sometimes
you need to buy stuff to complete two
dues like pencils notebooks and stuff
and this is where you would get that and
just keep everything in your locker now
this next thing I want to talk about is
jobs right here now in order to earn
money you go ahead and you can do a job
but you can only have two jobs at a time
so choose them wisely more on that later
maybe now the molesting and one of the
most important things I want to talk to
you guys about is fighting now you can
get popular by doing two dues or you can
also fight which one do you think is
funner yes I'm talking about fighting
now these are all different people that
you can fight with now fighting gets you
popular and if you win you get money but
if you lose they take your money so you
can either talk smack or fight on
one but the thing is every time you
fight it costs some health now in order
to be a good fighter you need to have a
bit click which is if you see my clique
I only have two people in my clique
right now me and my sister Hannah but we
can get more in let me go back to the
fight screen and any time like I said
fighting takes health let me go ahead
and fight someone right now like this
yeah you get them you say all right I
lost 21 health and then if I go close
and look at my health meter right now I
have 79 left since I lost 21 now this
he'll throw generates one every certain
amount of time but if you ever need to
get more health than what you need to do
is go to your home screen and go the
nurse and she'll give me more health for
a fee but we don't want to do that right
now I mean look at her look that poor
old lady is going to take your money oh
how sweet well whatever but anyways like
I said on the click the bigger click you
have which pretty much means your group
the better chances you have to win so
let's see in order to be a good fighter
you need a bit click ambition and also
charisma and every time you level up you
see every time you level up complete
more to do's and one more fights you get
more ambition and charisma and stuff
like that and that's what this little
thing is this is a charisma I think this
is energy and these are how many people
are in your clique so that's what all
the buttons mean and now Oh another
thing whenever you fight um you lose
money if you lose so if you like log off
and you don't want people to take your
money go to savings and deposit some
money in your savings account because
they can only take the money from you
they can't touch some money in your
savings account bad thing about this is
it takes ten percent whenever you
deposit so let's go ahead and click back
to home and the last thing I want to
tell you guys how to do is join my
clique now as you can see this clique is
going to enhance your chance of winning
the fight so anyone who's Washington's
tutorial I recommending do this here is
my student ID write it down right now
for 2 to 1 2 4 7 8 28 so now any time
you want to add me as a friend go ahead
and my clique and they'll go ahead and
click recruit and then go ahead and
click add your friend using their
student ID and then go ahead and click
ok and my student idea right here and
click Add and then you will be friends
with me Bucky and hopefully if enough
people do this then we're going to start
winning some fights and will pretty much
be in unbeatable will pretty much be
like the Mean Girls of you know of high
school superstar and that's what I'm
going for but in this there's no happy
ending we just dominate the whole game
so that's what I'm hoping for that's
where everything does and this last
thing the counselor every time you level
up you get an extra point and these
points can be used by other stuff or you
can buy them with like actual money but
you usually just uh get them from
leveling up so anyways that's enough for
this tutorial thank you guys for
watching don't forget to add me as a
friend and we will dominate this game
together so thank you guys for watching
and don't forget subscribing if you have
any more apps that you want me to review
that just let me know in our our review
for you so thank you guys for watching
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
