slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
continuing creating our calculator now
if you don't know what I'm talking about
then you may want to move back a couple
to couple tutorials and catch up to what
we're doing now you can see here that we
added the two numbers num1 and num2 by
using our add function that we created
and we just converted the text from
those text boxes to a double now what we
want to do is we want to put answer in
the answer box so we're going to do this
by typing text answer dot text equals
answer and then we'll just leave it like
that we're not going to convert it to a
string because we may use that answer
later on so let's go ahead and run our
program and see what happens so we've
got first number through 23 second
number 45 and when we add them we get 68
now what if the user forgot to enter a
value in for one of the boxes well what
we're going to do is we're going to
enclose all of this and an if statement
so we're going to go ahead and type if
text number one dot text dot length
equals zero or does not equal zero and
text number two dot text dot length
there's not equal zero either then go
ahead and do this so we'll just add an
ENDIF right here
and we're going to we're going to add an
else statement so else and so if one of
the boxes is empty if the length does
equal zero on one of the boxes then
we're going to go ahead and type message
box dot show please fill all fields
and then we'll just set the title to
error and we'll type message box buttons
dot okay and we will set the icon just
to a warning because an error didn't
really happen so message box icon
message box icons dot warning
okay message box icon dot warning not
icons and now let's go ahead and run
this and see what happens if they leave
a field empty
so here's first number so if we type
this in click add it says please fill
all fields and you can see it gives them
the warning icon and then if we fill
this with something and click Add it
will give us an answer let's go ahead
and close this out now what if the user
wants to continue adding numbers to the
answer so what we're going to do is
after we set text answer text equal to
answer we will just type text num2 dot
read-only equals true so what this does
is we can access the properties of text
someone while we're programming and
change them on the fly so assets
read-only equal to true now if we run
this you can see that if we type some
numbers in here and click Add it will
set this one equal to read-only now we
need to do text txt num to not text num
one so let's just do that one more time
so you can see that it sets it to
read-only and we can't do anything to it
so before we set it to read-only we're
going to have to clear it so text num2
dot clear so this will let them keep
adding numbers to the answer and what we
need to do because we're allowing them
to do this we need to add a Clear button
so we'll just come over here to our
toolbox we'll add a button down here and
we will set the name to button clear so
we'll come up here and change it to
button clear and then we will set the
text to clear
now if we go ahead and double double
click on this it opens up the event for
this and what we want to do is when they
click clear then we'll just set text
num2 dot read-only equals false so that
they can read from it and we'll just
clear each one of those text boxes all
right let's just do text answer clear
and text num2 dot clear so now if we run
this you can see we have first number
and second number and if we type some
values in an atom you can see that it
gives us the option to press clear and
when we do it resets it now let's come
up here and instead of setting this
instead of clearing text up to we'll
just leave it to set the same to see
what they added but it will not
continually add numbers to the it won't
continually add first number and second
numbers of the answer now we'll be
covering this in the next tutorial so
I'm look at this code you can modify it
if you want play around with it test see
what you can do with it and once you
know what it does go ahead and move on
to the next tutorial and thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
