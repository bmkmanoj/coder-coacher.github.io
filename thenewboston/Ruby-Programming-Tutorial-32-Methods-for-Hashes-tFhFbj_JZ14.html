second tutorial in Ruby and in this
tutorial now that we know how to make a
hash I'm going to show you guys some
cool methods that we can use when
working with hashes so if you missed the
last tutorial what we did is we pretty
much created a quick hash let me just go
ahead and put this out on the screen and
it pretty much says Bucky's the coolest
guy ever Emma is a very nice gal Emma
Roberts that is and peter is some guy
from Family Guy simple enough but what
if we want to loop through the entire
list of hashes and we wanted to do
something cool with it well we can use
that loop that we kind of learned before
that each loop where we can store each
of the keys and values and variables and
then do something with them so let me go
ahead and show you guys example each now
as a parameter for this what we're going
to do is we're going to store the keys
and the values in separate variables and
in order to do that put them in between
pipe symbols what I say symbols yeah
that's hurt isn't it signal symbols
tomato tomato
put them in between the pipe signs and
go ahead and hit a comma B now you can
name your variable as anything you want
but a and B is pretty self-explanatory
so now after that what it's going to do
is it's going to loop through your hash
and every time it gets to a key and a
value it's going to store the key in a
which would be Bucky in the first case
and a cool guy ever and B in the first
instance and then it's going to run your
code so what do we want to do for the
code well if we're running through like
a numerical list we can add them
together if we were added running
through a text list I don't know let's
just go ahead and print it on the screen
so puts a plus B what this is going to
do is pretty much print out the stuff on
the screen each one on a new line let's
go ahead and hit enter and check it out
Bucky coolest guy ever and it prints
them out touching because if you notice
whenever I graded in my hash there was
no space between the first key and the
value so that's why I puts them together
but anyways it doesn't matter
Bucky coolest guy ever then it puts Emma
very nice scale then
Peter FAMILY GUY dude so basically what
this does is it loops through your list
and it prints out both the key and value
right after each other so that's one way
that you can pretty much loop through
your list or if hashes and do whatever
you want another cool thing I want to
show you guys is what if you want to
look at all the keys without the values
well we already know how to look at the
values when you go ahead and footprint
example Emma what this does is it prints
out the value of Emma very nice cow but
what if we only want to look at the keys
in our hash so let's go ahead and show
you how to do that puts example which is
the name of the hash and keys now go
ahead and hit enter and check it out
Bucky Emma and Peter that is how you
only get the key word or the first term
of your hash now the last thing I want
to show you guys is this we already know
how to create in a hash but what if we
want to go back in delete something from
this hash for example if we go ahead and
puts example right now we prints out our
hash in our hash has Bucky Emma and
Peter in it but then our boss comes in
and he's like you know what this is
looking like a pretty sweet I don't know
what the heck this program is up people
identifiers maybe but Emma she needs to
go she no longer works for this company
delete her from the hash so how do we do
that go ahead and type the name of your
hash which is example delete and you
have to spell it right de L ete that's
how you spell delete opal and in between
parenthesis go ahead and type that you
get that right there you go go ahead and
type the key of your hash which is in
this case Emma so this pretty much means
we want to delete Emma from this hash go
ahead and hit enter and it gives us this
little prompt very nice gal but we don't
believe it we want to make sure that
it's deleted so in order to make sure
it's deleted go ahead and puts example
hit enter and we now see that our new
hash new-and-improved without Emma Bucky
and Peter the tulitt to
coolest guys in the world not the to
Tullius guys in the world
so anyways there you go there is how you
work with hashes in the next tutorial
I'm going to show you guys well you know
I'm not going to spoil it but it's going
to be awesome so thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and I'll
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
