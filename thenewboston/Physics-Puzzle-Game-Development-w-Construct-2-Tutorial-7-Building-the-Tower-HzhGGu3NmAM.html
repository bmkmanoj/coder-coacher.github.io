sweet video and in this one let's go
ahead and start building our tower now
what we can actually do is make sure
that we have this exactly where you want
it and I'm gonna go ahead and change the
opacity to zero for this because I know
it's just bothering me to have that
light blue right there I'm also gonna
take this meatball and move it down here
because I don't know if we're gonna need
it later on but once we have that taken
care of can actually scroll in and let's
build the Tower right by this tree right
here so the first thing I want to do is
you need different objects for vertical
blocks and horizontal blocks so this can
be our horizontal one we can make a
bunch of instances of this now if you
right-click this and put clone object
type and click anywhere to the right of
it then what we can do is we can double
click this and once it's double clicked
we have this low editor hit one of these
buttons and it rotates it 90 degrees and
the reason that we needed to make a new
object type or clone it is because if we
just copy this check this out and make a
bunch of new instances and I'm doing
that by holding ctrl on my keyboard and
dragging and then if we try to say okay
I'll just make this one vertical and you
rotate it they all rotate so hit ctrl Z
to undo that and that's why you have to
clone it so basically we have two
different styles of blocks that we can
work with the vertical ones and also the
horizontal ones and also it's probably a
good idea right now to um should we do
this right now yeah might as well so
let's go ahead and add the physics to
these blocks right now let me delete one
of these so click it and add behaviors
add physics for that one up and down and
also this one too
and what I also want to do is I want to
change the density of these blocks
because right now whenever that we hit a
meatball fling a meatball atom they're
gonna be kind of hard to move so click
one of them and change the density to
0.3 and on the other one as well you're
gonna have to experiment of course the
higher the density the more solid or the
more mass its gonna have so basically
when you have the density at like 0.1
they're gonna be like really light and
you're really easy to knock down so you
know that's another thing you want to
keep track of you can also raise the
density the higher the level you get
that's another idea maybe so now let's
just go ahead and start building this
tau where and we'll just build a really
simple one at first so again hold ctrl
and drag right there and another thing
that I want to mention is make sure that
you do have a small gap between you see
I have a small gap between those and the
reason for that is because if you sort
your game and they're touching then your
collision detection on these is gonna be
messed up so always make sure that
whenever you're building a tower like
this especially with physics objects to
make sure that you have a small gap it's
not gonna affect anything
and so my tower is gonna look something
like this and whenever I run this game
check it out let me just run this bad
boy again you see the tower falls into
place and I'll go ahead and shoot a
meatball at it and it tumbles down
pretty freakin sweet let me just do that
one more time because it was kind of fun
right like that and now what I want to
do is I want to say okay whenever my
meatball comes to a complete stop
that's when I want to be able to reload
the cannon so pretty much as soon as
this meatball stops dish
the meatball and remember in the less
sorrow we learned how to reload the
cannon but for now um that's pretty good
for the store oh I'm actually gonna
build a little bit bigger Tower because
that was kind of easy so let me build a
tower like this
let me see if this one's incredibly easy
to knock down that's good so run this
bad boy and all right so that tower is a
little bit harder and knock down we can
get a couple shots pretty frickin sweet
and the reason that I had another
meatball there to shoot is because that
first one it rolled off the screen and
whenever it rolls off its destroyed so
in the next tutorial I'm gonna be
showing you guys the logic of how to
tell your game when this meatball comes
to a complete stop to be able to reload
your cannon and shoot it again
but for now then guys for watching and
I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
