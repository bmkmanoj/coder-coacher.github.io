seventh Android tutorial for the new
boss in what we're going to get into is
working with the HTTP client to get some
information from the internet and kind
of process out information parse it and
use it to our own benefit so what we're
going to do is we're going to go back to
our new boston project that we've been
working in and we're just going to right
click and create a new class you know
just the standard stuff you guys are
experts at right now we're going to call
this class HTTP example and just get a
class set up we also want to set up a
layout so we're going to just do a real
quick layout nothing new
again just right-click new Android XML
file and we're going to call this HTTP
example or e^x something like that hit
finish what we're going to have in this
layout is just one text view we're going
to kind of retrieve some information
from the internet so just go into your
your code your XML and just type loading
data and we're going to give this a
reference of TV HTTP something like that
hit save we also might want to put a
scrollview in there I think about it so
we're just going to go above our text
view and put in a scroll view and give
it the reference Android layout height
is equal to fill parent and also Andrew
Android layout width is equal to fill
parent as well and then we're just going
to wrap our text view so we're just
going to cut that in pasted below
reformat make sure you guys have the
same kind of look here
so there we go we have our XML layout
setup pretty basic stuff now what we're
going to do for this example is we're
just going to have this one our class
HTTP example Extender activity import
and setup or oncreate method again the
boring setup I've done is I just set up
our class with oncreate method set
content view to that XML layout we just
set up and we also defined or text view
which I made that reference bridge
within our on create method again
nothing new but uh this is going to be
our main class where we're eventually
going to receive a Twitter message like
your last Twitter post something like
that but as for now I just want to get
you guys familiar with the HTTP client
that's kind of difficult to say so you
guys try and see that 10 times fast
I mean what happens but what we're going
to do is we're going to hit right-click
create a new class which is going to
handle our get method from our HTTP
client so we're just going to call this
get method something like that example
e^x maybe hit finish and this is a class
that we're going to use to get the
information from the internet so what
we're going to do is we're actually
going to set up a method within this
class that's going to return a string
which we're going to change or textview
to refer to that string so we're just
going to say public string because again
we're returning a string and we're going
to say we're going to call this get
Internet data and this is going to throw
an exception so now that we have our
method set up called get Internet data
and this supposed to be throws all right
we're just getting an error because we
have to return a string which we'll get
to later but what we want to do in this
class is or this method is create a
bufferedreader which I'll explain in a
second we're just going to set this
equal to be null and we're going to call
that buffer reader in and we're also
going to create a string and we're going
to say this is our data we're going to
set this equal to null as well
control-shift Oh dad or imports which is
our bufferedreader and then what we're
going to do is we're going to try to
connect to the HTTP client I always
wonder if I stay in that right or not so
let's set up our HTTP client and we're
going to call this just like client
something like that pretty standard I'm
going to set this equal to new default
HTTP client just the default HTTP client
and we're going to allow what this is
going to allow us to do and just make
sure you spell that right and what this
is going to allow us to do is allow our
application to process information
that's not built internally so we can
rely more on the website and just get
some information from the website and
try instead of trying to handle all of
the data all the information within our
app so that's what a HTT P client will
allow us to do basically reference the
Internet
so that's the basic setup for this
tutorial obviously we still have quite a
bit to go but I'll catch you guys in the
next tutorial and I'll see you guys then
have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
