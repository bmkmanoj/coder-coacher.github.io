tutorial and this story i'ma teach you
guys how to use multiple tests in the
Java program now in the last tutorial I
showed you guys how to test the one
thing such as if um let's say apples was
less than 3 then do something well
there's actually a way to in your if
condition test many tests in the same
condition so let me go ahead and
demonstrate there to do demonstrate this
point let's go ahead and make a simple
dating website so we need two variables
and boy and Inc girl and let's go ahead
boy set them to 18 nice young book as
myself and drill setter equaled a 68
shipped me an old cougar so let's go
ahead and make a simple um if statement
and in the test condition as I told you
guys before we learned how to test one
thing
so if boy is greater than 10 we would
execute a certain block of code so let's
go ahead and do that
system.out.print line and if he's older
than 10 wilbur i you can enter since we
can grant information else if he's less
than 10 then what do we want to do um
let's just copy this save us some time
copy and paste there we go um you are
too young so let's go ahead and run this
real quick make sure everything is
working and since boy is greater than 10
it says you can enter so that's what I
taught you guys last time how to do one
test in an if statement but there's a
way where you can do multiple tests in
the same condition now say you wanted to
make sure that the boy is greater than
10 and the girl is less than um 60 since
we don't want any senior citizens on our
site no offense but this this is a site
for younger people only so what we would
do is use something called the double
ampersand in this stands for
and and whenever you use this that means
that either test on either side of this
has to be true for this to be true so
for example if boy is greater than 10
and girl is less than 60 which is false
you want to print you can enter else
print you are young and again here's
what and means whenever you have this
little double ampersand and that's a
little symbol above the 7 on your
keyboard this test has to be true and
this test has to be true for this piece
of code to execute if either one of
these are false or if they're both false
then this code is never going to execute
so let's go ahead and change this to you
can not enter so if the boy is greater
than 10 which is true and the girl is
less than 60 which is false
68 print this you can enter so it's not
going to print that it's going to print
this you cannot enter so let's go ahead
and run this and as you can see you
cannot enter so let's go ahead and what
if we changes to the girl was within the
age limits 40 and we ran that baby again
it would now say you can enter so that
is how you use something called multiple
test in the and sign to make sure that
two tests are true so you can execute a
certain block of code but there's also
another neat thing besides the and and
that's called the or and to do that you
use two little pipe signs and that's the
key above your Enter when you press
shift it's a I think it's called a pipes
like a pipe or pipe line or something
but here's what this means to little
pipes this means or in what or means is
either this has to be true or this has
to be true only one of these have to be
true to execute this first statement if
they're both false then it's going to
just skip that and go to this so let's
go ahead and in another point in an or
statement this one has to be true or
this one has to be true or they both can
be true such as right now
so let's go ahead and change this to
girl equals 99 so only this one is true
but this one is false using the or thing
you can enter such show up should show
up so let's go ahead and we ran it and
it said you can enter and let me show
you guys what happens if both of them
are true um it should do the same thing
girl he goes forty-four run it again it
says you can enter but again the only
way that this is not going to work is if
both of them are false so let's say if
the boy was eight and the girl was 99 it
would say you cannot enter so again to
recap one last time if you want to do
multiple tests in Java there's two
things you can use in and sign and what
this does is make sure both the tests on
either side are true and if it's not
true it does the else and you can also
use the or sign and unlike the and where
both of them has to be true the or sign
make sure only one of them has to be
true but if both of them are true then
oh well it still works so that is how
you can use a multiple test in your java
program using the double ampersand in
double double pipes to test either an
and or so if you have any questions or
if this is confusing at all then I you
can just send me a message and hopefully
I can clear things up for you but I try
to make it real self-explanatory for
area so that's all for this tutorial I
hope you learned how to do multiple
tests and make a simple dating program
so thank you guys for watching and don't
forget to subscribe to my channel and I
will see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
