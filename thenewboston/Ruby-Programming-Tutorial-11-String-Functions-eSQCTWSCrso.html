through beats tomorrow and in this
lesson I want to talk to you guys about
string functions and actually come to
think of it before I get started I want
to mention this I often say methods
instead of functions and functions a set
a method that's because all programming
languages they call them something
different but whenever I say functions I
usually mean methods and I know that
might confuse you guys but it's a bad
habit I got from programming in a lot of
different languages so I guess you guys
have just got to kind of get used to it
so you know how I said a couple
tutorials ago that all numbers are
actually objects in these objects belong
to the fixed number well I want to
mention this in this tutorial strings
are actually objects too now whenever I
say string I just mean a string of text
a bunch of letters put together like
bacon this would be an example of a
string just a bunch of text so if we go
ahead and run the class method on this
we can see that all strings belong to
the Kyle's they say callus class string
not the baking class which you may think
baking class is not an actual class the
string class now classes are made to
have attributes and also methods so
let's go ahead and run some methods on
some strings now the first method I want
to talk to you guys about is something
called the length now if we go ahead and
type a string like mm pam slammers it's
my favorite type of slammers we can use
a dot length and whenever we hit enter
what this is going to give us is the
length of the string so if we count up
all the characters in ham slammers it
ends up that we have 18 characters so
that's what dot length returns to us so
now let me go ahead and show you guys
another one if we type in something
classy like slam Wow definitely mess
that up
slam jelly pockets and we go ahead and
write up case what this is going to do
is it's going to take this string and
change it all into uppercase check it
out slime jelly pockets turn into
slam jelly pockets pretty cool huh so
let me go ahead and show you guys a
couple more methods before I let you
guys go just like addition remember in
whenever I was talking about numbers
being object the plus sign pretty much
added two numbers together well whenever
we use the plus sign with strings such
as hello and something like my fair if I
can type fair lady what this does is it
pretty much ties two strings together so
now you have hello my fair lady and one
big string so that's what the plus sign
does whenever you're working with
strings another cool thing is what's a
cool word that we can reverse evil check
this out whenever you use the reverse
method and that's just using a string
the dot separator than typing reverse it
takes your string and if you guys can't
guess what this is going to do reverses
it so evil turns in to live and by the
way in the comment section below tell me
guys some cool words that we can reverse
and they turn into other words I want to
you know see who comes up with the best
one and the one who does gets a I don't
know I'll give them like a slam jelly
pocket or something so the last thing I
want to mention is that you can also
chain string methods together so we
already know that you can type something
like Evo dot reverse and whenever you
hit Enter it prints out their verse of
evil which is Li ve live or live
depending on how you say it but you can
also write dot up case something like
this and now what this is going to do is
this going to run multiple methods on
this string so not only is it going to
reverse it but it's also going to
uppercase it as well is that even a verb
upper case it hey it's a verb in my
vocabulary so go ahead and hit enter and
it now reversed it Li ve and also
changed it all to uppercase L iv'e live
live tomato tomahto so anyways that's
all you guys get for this toriel in the
next tutorial I want to teach you guys
how you can create a method
that doesn't belong to any class it's
going to be mystifying amazing and
awesome so thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
