19th chemistry tutorial I cannot believe
you guys are still watching these
tutorials suckers anyways welcome to
your 19th chemistry tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm going to be talking about
gamma emission my favorite type of
emission
now gamma emission is actually really
weird and I'm going to start off this
tutorial with an example because if I
start trying to explain what gamma
emission is without you guys seeing
anything I'm going to sound like a crazy
person
so gamma radiation happens a lot with
element cobalt-60
now in order to write this it's 60 27
cobalt and the process it undergoes
turns it into 60 27 cobalt + 0 0 why now
we're going to be talking about what the
heck the 0 0 y is in detail a little bit
later on but for now just think of it as
a burst of energy so you're saying okay
you're telling me that I can literally
have the same exact element convert it
into the same exact element plus energy
where the heck is this extra energy
coming from well first let's go ahead
and I want to take note of this first of
all yes you do have the exam exact
element because if you take a look at
the mass number and also the atomic
number on each side you see that it is
exactly equal so the element itself is
not changing in any way so how can we
end up with this extra energy it's
pretty weird but let me go ahead and try
to explain I'm going to take things way
back to the Bohr model now we have a
nucleus of atom with all the protons and
neutrons and we also have those energy
levels now the first energy level let me
go ahead and draw both now so say we
have two energy levels the first in the
second energy level now on the first
energy level we could have let's say an
electron and let me go ahead and change
my color it might be kind of hard to see
we can have an electron now this
electron is pretty much as
around the very first energy level mine
in some business however sometimes what
can happen is this electron can absorb
energy from light so let me go ahead and
make some light here beam beam beam beam
beam so here's my beautiful light over
here and what happens is this electron
absorbs that energy from the light now
whenever an electron absorbs energy from
light it hops up to this next energy
level so no longer is this electron on
the first energy level it is actually on
the second energy level so again one
more time
electrons can absorb energy from light
and energy from light is called photons
so just remember that I'm going to be
calling them photons from now on so
whenever an electron absorbs all these
photons it sorry well I got like hair in
my mouth or something it hops up to the
second energy level so that's where it's
chilling right now with all this energy
absorbed now in order to get back down
what it needs to do is it needs to
release this energy so in order to get
back down to the ground state or the
first energy level it's going to release
these photons and these are called gamma
emissions and that's basically what this
is right here
it's the releasing of photons whenever
electrons step down an energy level so
to recap one last time whenever you have
an atom electrons can absorb energy and
hop up to higher energy levels and they
do this through light or photons now
whenever they want to get back down they
need to give back this energy so this is
the process of releasing the energy or
gamma emission and that's what this
thing symbolizes right here it's the
releasing of energy so there you go
that's what photons are and that's what
gamma missions basically is so another
thing that you may want to take note of
is this type of radiation is actually
very dangerous and it can basically mess
up a lot of crap in your body if you're
exposed to it a lot
so if anyone's like hey I just bought
some new gamma missions want to come
over and eat them but no dude that's
dangerous so you know just some tidbit
of information it actually you can't buy
gamma emissions but they actually are
really dangerous but anyways that's all
I have for you guys for this story thank
you guys for watching and in the next
story we still have more types of
radiation to cover so be prepared to get
your brain prepared and once it is I
will see you guys in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
