twenty-third tutorial and PHP and in
this tutorial I am going to be adding a
table to the database we just made so
hopefully you're watching right from 22
and you already made your database so go
ahead and go up to your main panel and
scroll down to this thing called PHP
myadmin
what this does is allow you to add
tables to your database so on the left
side of your screen you will see all the
databases that you made in this little
number in parentheses that's how many
tables are in your database
right now we have game with 0 tables in
it so go ahead and give that a click and
let's go ahead and make our first table
as you can see it says no tables found
in this database and the first thing
it's going to ask you for is to name
your your table I'm going to go ahead
and name and name my game and another
thing is going to ask for is the number
of fields you want now field is just a
piece of information that's in your
table so since we're going to be adding
ID for organizing our table we're going
to be one of getting the users username
we're going to want to be storing their
email and storing your password form so
we want ID username email password so
let's go ahead and click for for four
pieces of data go ahead and click go and
you are ready to begin making your table
now what a field is is like I said is
just the basic label of data and since
this is ID now let me explain you guys
what ID means ID is what 99% of people
who are making these kind of tables use
just to organize your data I personally
don't use it and I don't like it but
just for the sake of learning it I'm
going to start out with the guys ID they
also call it primary ID sometimes this
type right here is what data type you
want varchar' is pretty much like
characters and stuff
you're going to be working with a
probably int 4 integers or date a lot
there are other different kinds of ones
like small integers or small numbers big
for big floating for floating decimal
points and all these other ones but
let's go ahead and just click I'm going
to click big integer for big numbers and
the length of values is how much maximum
data you can store in this field so I'm
going to say all right no more than 100
numbers collation you want to leave that
default attributes both of these you
want to leave default not know you want
to always put it not null that means you
need something in here why anyone would
make an empty a field I have no idea if
you do please let me know because I'm
interested in extra you're going to want
to go ahead and auto increment only your
ID field
now what auto increment is it's going to
automatically increase each input by one
so the first person who registers is
going to get the ID one the next person
to the next person three and it's going
to keep going on like that and it's
going to work out just fine for you
another thing you want to do is go ahead
and check primary key and what this does
is tell MySQL alright this is the main
way we're going to organize data from
the ID this is the most important field
so that's why it's primary you need to
have a primary ID so this is the only
field really that's a messed up like we
have to do a bunch of different stuff to
the other ones our piece of cake so just
bear with me um let's see we wanted a
username a varchar' what just means a
characters let's uh give that a max of
20 we're also going to want an email
let's give that a max of 50 cents uh
some people have some pretty lengthy
emails and give password which has a max
of 20 now once we have all that filled
out go ahead and click
save and again we don't have to change
the extra or a primary key for any of
these only the ID so go ahead and save
that and as you can see it says table
has been created if you get any errors
right here then you did something wrong
but as long as you did what I did you'll
be just fine
so now we can go ahead and add stuff to
our table as you can see we have a table
right now but we have nothing in it at
all so let's go ahead and add some data
let's go ahead and click one for the
primary diet ID since it starts at one
user name is going to be Bucky 20 there
we go the email is testing at e-mail
comm and my password is just going to be
password for right now go ahead and
click go and this will automatically
insert data into your table now we're
only I'm only doing this to show you
guys that there is data in the table and
if you see this then it means it worked
just fine insert it into row one but
most of the time we're going to be
letting the user insert the own dead end
table which I'm going to be teaching in
next couple tutorials we're going to be
from a website having them insert their
email username and all that good stuff
in the form submitting it and it will
automatically store that information on
our website and anytime you want to look
at all your table all your tables with
all the data in it go ahead up here to
your little browse button and click that
and as you can see we got our username
email and password all labeled for us in
our table so remember browse watches
everything insert inserts data and
besides that um that's pretty much all
you need to know so study this tutorial
make sure you know how to make a table
and insert that in the
and pay attention
another thing make sure please that
you're watching this tutorial and hi-def
so study this tutorial I hope you
learned something and in the next
tutorial we're going to be creating our
first computer game or at least the
registration form thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
