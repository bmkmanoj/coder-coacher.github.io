video I'm going to show you how you can
use pirate for faster password cracking
or password recovery whatever you want
to call it so this is program and by the
way it comes pre-installed in Callie
just like air crack another reason I
love Callie and what it does is it
actually uses all of the cores in your
system to help speed up this process so
let's say you're cracking like a few
million passwords that's how many you
want to try with air crack is only going
to use one core and it's going to take
quite some time with pirate you can
either choose to use your CPU so if you
have a multi-core processor or you can
actually use your GPU or your graphics
card because your graphics card has a
bunch of cores in it like hundreds and
hundreds so I'm only going to be showing
you guys how to use the CPU but the
concept is the same and by the way
before we start there's another program
called hash cat which is I don't know
kind of like the most popular one for
cracking passwords with your graphics
card because you can actually do with
multiple graphics cards so we're going
to be learning about that later on which
is kind of like the cream of the crop
for password cracking but for right now
let's go ahead and get started with
pirate so to use it you just use pirate
and if you just want to see how many
cores you have you can use a straight
list underscore cores so like I said in
this video I'm going to be using my CPU
and I have eight cores available so this
means essentially I'm going to be able
to crack these passwords eight times as
fast so just clear out of there
so you basically need to give it two
things the first one is your capture
file and the second one is a password
list so just like air crack now I'm
gonna warn you guys that I moved to a
different computer and I just made a
real quick capture file because I
changed my password on my router because
what was the other one like bacon one
two three so I changed my password so
this capture file doesn't actually have
my password so I'm just going to show
you guys how to use a button my password
is really long and confusing so it's
clearly not in this dictionary
so anyways pirate - are and - in desktop
captures WPA capture zero one dot cap
and then you're right
analyze boom roasted so got your capture
file and remember these capture files
they need to have a valid handshake in
them and if you guys don't know what I'm
talking about watch my tutorial like two
videos ago and once you analyze it it's
going to say boom roasted we indeed did
get a valid handshake and if you ever
want to just check like get a overview
of everything
pirate eval what this is going to do is
it's going to say okay yeah you got your
captured file but you don't have any
passwords yet so what we're going to do
is we're just going to have our list of
passwords and we're going to actually
add it to the pirate database so should
eyes have to do that well right now
so any time you have a list of passwords
and you want to import them into pirate
then just write pirates - aye and then
wherever your passwords are so security
lists passwords I think mine is called
like top 1 million dot txt and then this
last command is just import underscore
passwords so what this is going to do is
it's going to go through this file and
it's going to import all of those into
the pirate database now I'll show you
guys a cool thing about this in just a
second but what we basically did is now
that we have the passwords taken care of
we just need to add the Wi-Fi target so
that's another piece of the puzzle
another whenever it calculates that
formula for the pre shared key and this
is basically the last thing that you
really need to do so pirate minus e and
then the name of my Wi-Fi is Bucky's
Wi-Fi and now you can just write great
on our score ESS ID hit enter now it has
passwords it has the capture file it has
my wife eyes name it's good to go so I'm
just going to show you guys this if you
write
pirate ie balligan remember this just
evaluates everything give you an
overview of it and it says RA we got
your guess s ID we're aware of that and
we also get out all those passwords you
imported and remember I imported 1
million passwords but it says passwords
available for a a 132 not even half a
million so why the heck did an import
amount this is one thing that throws a
lot of people so basically what it's
going to do is it automatically filters
passwords that aren't suitable for WPA
or wpa2 password cracking and that means
WPA only allows you to use passwords of
a certain length and what it's going to
do is if it's if a password is below
that link like ABC then it's not even
going to add it to the database so why
waste time trying that also if you ever
try to import a bunch of passwords in
there are duplicates then pirate
automatically removes duplicates for you
so you don't have to try the same
password twice so all of this is going
on behind the scenes um but that's why
you know our password that are available
all those aren't as big as the file that
we imported pretty cool so the last
thing that we need to do I said I think
I said that before but this is um two
other commands pirates batch and
whenever you hit enter on this what it's
going to do is it's going to start
processing those passwords or
calculating um the formulas that you
need in order to start cracking alright
so once it's done batch processing our
files then we can finally launch our
attack so just call pirate and you just
need to say where your capture file is
so - art and mine is in desktop captures
in WPA dot cap and we just write a tech
underscore dB so hit enter and watch how
long this takes and by the way I
actually timed this with air crack it
takes two and a half minutes
whenever I'm just running an air crack
so I'm about to hit enter and look at
that like I don't even know if it took a
second for 1 million password
1 million it's actually about half
million but still check that out and of
course it says password not found
because remember the key to a dictionary
attack is having the password in that
dictionary but now we have to ask
ourselves you know some places some
people and some organizations they're
going to have really long passwords that
just aren't practical to crack with a
dictionary attack so what other
solutions that we have are ridges
screwed well we aren't and in the next
tutorial I'm going to show you guys even
when someone has an incredibly long and
incredibly complex password that will
take years and years to crack with a
dictionary attack there is an awesome
method that we can use to get around
that in some cases in a lot of cases and
I'll be showing you guys that but before
I let you guys go just remember that
that first command I showed you that
analyzed that was just to see if you had
a valid handshake you don't actually
need that in your attack if you know
that there's a handshake just remember
to add your password file to the
database add your Wi-Fi or SSID and then
you can launch your attack so um I'll
just show you guys how to delete your
SSID and delete your passwords from your
database if you ever want to this is
just kind of bonus information so if you
want to delete your SSID maybe we're
done attacking my Wi-Fi you don't want
any evidence on our computer just right
- II Lucky's Wi-Fi delete ESS ID so this
is the exact same command for adding
your Wi-Fi but instead of create ESS ID
we were just running delete the SSID and
are you sure you want to delete this yes
and there you go now to delete all those
passwords let's say actually I did this
before
I was testing and I actually added in my
real password to the database and I'm
like probably shouldn't have
in there so you actually need to delete
the entire database then you can just re
import everything if you just write RM
minus RF dot pirates and this is just
the path where it's a blob space
password there you go so you're going to
remove everything and this removes
everything in the directories it's
recursive and hit enter so pirate eval
we can analyze everything we now have
zero passwords we now have zero networks
we want to target we're pretty much back
to basics now the last thing I want to
say is whenever you import passwords
into your database you don't have to do
all at once you can you know import a
huge file of passwords that you found
online and then if you find another one
you don't have to choose between them
you can just run that same command again
and it's going to import password by
password it's automatically going to
check to make sure that they're the
right length and also that there are no
duplicates so just import every single
password you know file you can have and
is going to do the rest for you so
pirate is pretty awesome also going to
be showing you guys how to use hash ket
in the future which is even faster than
this so yeah that's what we have to look
forward to I will see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
