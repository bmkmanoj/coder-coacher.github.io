tutorial that I'm making for the New
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to encrypt data so in
the previous tutorial we looked at
hashing and the key difference between
hashing and encrypting is you can't undo
a hash or you can decrypt something so
for this tutorial you're going to need
to have a button to encrypt the data on
a key text box a text box to store the
data that you want to encrypt and a text
box that will show the data encrypted so
just go ahead and double click on your
encrypt button you're also going to need
to be using a system dot security doctor
probably namespace because all the
methods that were going to begin they
are in there first thing that we're
going to want to do is create a new
instance of the Triple DES crypto
service provider and Triple DES is
basically just a type of encryption so
type out here Triple DES crypto service
writer I'm going all to DES and set it
equal to a new Triple DES crypto service
provider now the first thing that we're
going to set is the key and the key is
basically what it uses to encrypt with
so we don't have the key then we won't
be able to decrypt it and Triple DES
there are only a handful of sizes of
cheese you can use and one valid size is
16 bytes long and the length of an md5
hash is also 16 bytes long we're
basically just going to be getting the
md5 of whatever key the user provides
and then use the hash of the key for the
Triple DES key so we're just going to
create a new m5 crypto service Rider
let's call it n 5 equal
new and five credible service provider
we're all sort of have to create a new
instance of utf-8 encoding class so we
can convert the key into a byte array so
it's on a new instance of utf-8 coding
class
alright so now we're going to want to do
is we're just going to say and 5.2 cube
path and we're going to be computing a
cache of the bytes that the utf-8
encoding gets from our string which is
textbox wrong stuff all right
so this is just setting the key for our
Triple DES crypto service provider and
there are a couple more properties we're
going to have to be setting here on the
first one is going to be the mode and
where's going to set this equal to
so I promote values V and we're also
going to have to set the padding equal
to pkcs7 and if we don't set these two
properties right here then we won't be
able to decrypt the data so make sure
that you set these properties right here
and finally we have to create a new
instance of the cipher finally we have
to create a new instance of crypto
transform interface almost call this
trends and we'll set it equal to T and s
dot create encrypted and now we can use
this crypto transform interface to
encrypt our data so let's go trans dot
transform final block and this method
will do the actual encrypted
and the first parameter that it calls
for is a byte array of data that we want
to encrypt and so we're just going to
say tf8 get bite out of and then in this
text box is we're going to want to put
whatever text we want to incorrect so
this you just put text box text right
here
and the next parameter is the offset
that we want to start at in the byte
array and we want to encrypt the entire
byte array so we're going to start at
the first element and a count or how
many bytes inside of the byte array that
we want to encrypt and that would be all
of them so we're just going to get the
length of that byte array so boys text
box text and then suit the length
properly to get a length of byte array
or how many bytes are actually in the
byte array and finding that we're going
to set text box threes text equal to be
encrypted data so we'll say text box
threes text equals and then we can
convert this into a string services the
fit converter class to convert this byte
array into a string so now you'll be bug
here type in our team like an atom I'll
encrypt I am Adam and click encrypt and
there it's encrypted
I am Adam and this is the encrypted
representation of Adam using the atom
key so if we were to change this key
right here to something else like hello
then it would change the encrypted data
so without the key you cannot decrypt it
and it's very important that you set the
key equal to something that's hard to
get so that someone wouldn't be able to
group force it very easily and my group
Horsa I mean this like continually
guessing until they actually did it so
you probably want to said you look like
a password or something harder to get so
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
on encrypting data in the next tutorial
we are getting
in data so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
