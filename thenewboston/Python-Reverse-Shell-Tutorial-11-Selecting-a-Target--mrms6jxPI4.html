selecting the target what I want to do
is I want to run this program real quick
and I'll show you guys pretty much what
we did so far and what we're gonna have
to do next so what we did is let me just
start this right here is whenever we run
the script the first thing that's going
to pop up is this right here just this
interactive prompt so then whenever a
client's start connecting let me run
this real quick we're gonna see a little
indicator that says connection has been
established and whatever their IP
addresses so this is my IP address I
just connected to it so now that we're
in turtle remember we gave it two
prompts custom prompts you can type in
list and then what it does whenever you
do that is we built this in the last
video or area all right so what does is
it goes through and it lists all of the
computers that are currently connected
to your server so it just gives them an
ID number which is pretty much the list
number and then their IP address and
then their port so then later on you're
gonna be able to say select 0 and you
know eventually we're gonna have more 1
2 3 4 5 or whatever and whenever we
select it it says you are now connected
to that computer and from here you can
just very like whatever you want so echo
hey and look on their machine it says
hey whatever and eventually also we're
gonna be able to type in quit and then
we're gonna get back to our main program
so list and I'll show you guys a bunch
of cool stuff that you can do that and
how to customize it hi everyone but just
to reiterate what we did so far is we
just listed the connections we're just
displaying them now in this tutorial
what I want to do is I want to show you
guys how to actually select a computer
so let me stop that and that's what
we're gonna do all right so
I'll say select target client and if you
guys really wait a minute I just try to
run this program and it doesn't work
like yours that that was another um I
have the completed program already and
you know that was from that so if you
try to run this right now it's gonna
give you a bunch of errors so you know
just a heads up in case you guys were
trying to figure that out all right
so define get target and we're gonna
pass in the command right here all right
so this function right here remember if
they typed in list then it's just going
to display all the computers that are
connected now once they review that list
and they find one that they want to
control they're gonna write select and
then their ID number so I wrote select
the zero and then I was connected now
what we also pass this in is the command
so the entire command so this isn't in
the actual code code so it's gonna be
like select zero select one select two
so eventually what we're going to do is
we're just gonna rip out this part of
the command so we only return the ID
number so it's gonna be pretty simple
but we need to do some weird things so
what I'm gonna do first is just make a
simple try I always call a try-catch try
accept whatever so this is the easy part
we're gonna command replace and what do
you want to replace we just want to
replace select and make sure you add a
space after this because it's gonna be
like select zero select 54 and if you
just try to replace select then it's
gonna return space like 64 or whatever
so you actually want to replace this and
what do you want to replace it with just
nothing so now this variable right here
should be equal to just the number now
another thing that we want to make sure
of is right now it's equal to a number
but it's in the string format since
that's what they typed in so what we
wanted to do is we need to convert it to
an integer and I'll just write target
right there and you can actually wrap
this all in one line but I want to keep
things simple
all right so now this variable is an
integer of whatever the computer they
want to connect to and now what we're
going to do is we're actually going to
get the connection object so from all
connections all the computers that are
connected we want to connect to target
so whatever connection was in that list
that's the one we're trying to connect
to and now we're just going to print out
a little indicator say you are now
connected to this computer or whatever
so I'll just write you are now connected
to all addresses what is the item in the
list well that's just target and zero
zero is their IP one is their port so
remember this connection object is what
we're going to return and that way they
can have a bunch of computers connected
but they can only pretty much be
interactive with one at a time it's
freaking beautiful so print after this
remember that I don't know if it's gonna
pop up but you remember as soon as you
became connected to another computer
what it did is it didn't say turtle
anymore it actually give you the IP
address of that computer and that was
the new input so then you know you're
not in the interactive prompt anymore
you're actually controlling their
machine so I actually need to convert it
to a string in well this right here so
now we'll just use the RP address and
give you that little greater than
indicator and I also want to write end
equals blank because if we just print
this out without this parameter right
here then it's going to print out your
prompt and then it's going to move your
cursor down to the next line however
whenever you have and interact the
prompt it prints it out in the cursors
right on the same line it's not on the
new line so that's why I need to say end
right there so it keeps your cursor on
the same line and now the last thing I
want to do
is I just want to add in accept so
basically what they're going to do is
they're going to try to connect to this
computer however if we ever get you know
an invalid connection we don't want to
continue on with the program we just
want to take care of it and let them
know that something went wrong and I'll
just say uh lots of valid selection so
maybe whenever they listed all computers
there are only five computers and lists
but they tried to select thirteen like
number thirteen and that's you know it's
not going to work so we're just gonna
say that and since we need to return
something then we're going to return
none and up here we actually need to
return the connection all right
so whenever they get the target in rake
select one or select three it's going to
go through connect to its and return our
connection object if we write select
tune-up or select 828 and it's not valid
then it's going to just print out not
valid selection yeah dummy and then it's
just going to return none so looking
good yeah in the next tutorial what
we're going to do is we're actually
going to start sending them commands
getting into the good stuff so I'll see
you guys that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
