learn all about action creators and
actions so now let's go back to our
trusty diagram and figure out what we
have to do next actions and then we need
to figure out reducers wait a minute
mate I thought we already learned about
reducers in like the first tutorial we
already took care of that and all
reducers are pretty much as part of your
application just anything that you have
to contain in memory so how the heck did
we get back to this oh wait a minute I
guess there's a little more to it than
just a piece of memory that your
application has to hold onto it also
says it takes in actions in updates part
of application state huh that's
interesting and that brings me to the
last point that I want to make you see
these actions right here these actions
they don't really do anything or
manipulate anything in a smart kind of
way all they are is just telling your
application hey something happened some
user event some action it occurred
that's all they just make an
announcement to the world and then
they're like ah right I did my thing now
it's actually up to the reducer to
determine how that action is going to
change your application so this reducer
is actually the smart part that says
okay whenever I hear this announcement
how is that going to change my data so
in this case we have one action whenever
the user clicks one of these names
that's the announcement that gets made
so then what we need to do is we need to
say okay whenever that happens display
their info under here now for this
application I'm just going to say that
the user that's currently selected which
is call that the active user all right
so last piece of the puzzle let's go to
our reducers and check this out so this
is the data that we have so far we have
three users stored in here now of course
eventually we're going to need to make
one of these the active user and that
user gets displayed on the bottom right
here
so let me start thinking about this I
mean we can have another one another
field called active and we can set equal
to true and false but we really don't
want to do this because we really don't
want to change this piece of data
because right now I mean later on we may
add a functionality to kind of add new
users and delete users but hey we're
just starting to learn react so we
really never want this user list to
change we're always going to have three
users no matter what one is the active
one so what I'm going to do is I'm
actually going to take this reducer this
piece of memory and I'm going to leave
it alone however we still need to decide
who the active user is so how do we do
that well I'm actually going to make a
brand new reducer and I'm just going to
name this reducer active user so again
all this piece of data is going to be
equal to is essentially whatever user
got selected so again we have two
reducers two pieces of memory that our
application needs to be aware of the
first one is a list of all the users and
the second little piece of memory is
what user is currently selected what one
is the active user and this is going to
change so we're going to set it up a
little bit differently than this right
here it's actually going to be really
cool so of course this is going to be
function and again its job is to listen
for this action so whenever here's the
announcement user selected it's going to
say oh alright what user will selected
and that's the active user that's all it
does and by the way one other thing that
I want to mention whenever any action
occurs no matter if it's in this file
another file anytime any action occurs
that action automatically gets sent to
all reducers all right that's important
concept to kind of remember so if you're
saying wait a minute so you're saying my
action is going to be sent to this
reducer even though it doesn't really
need it anyway well yes does it matter
no because this reducer is going to
return the same
that uh no matter what and the majority
of your time most of your reducers are
just going to ignore these announcements
these actions however what you can do in
some reducers is you can set it up to
respond to these actions appropriately
so how do you do that well let's finally
kind of get to it so I might as well put
this at the top so exports default
function and we'll just say state equals
null all right so let me show you guys
something else real quick let me delete
some this crap clean it up do I need my
diagram still I'll keep my action art so
you know that I said million times that
all reducer is is just a little chunk of
memory that your application needs
whether it's a list of users the
currently selected user or whatever so
whenever we create all these little bits
of memory we need to kind of put them
together into this thing all reducers
yeah we already learned that before why
am I saying it again I'm saying this
because even when your application first
boots up this little chunk of memory it
needs to be equal to something wait a
minute you don't have any user currently
selected yet well we still can't just
return undefined your else we're going
to get a bunch of errors so what people
usually do is they give this a default
value and the default value just has to
be anything it can be equal to you know
a blank object it can be equal to zero
it can be equal to anything just not
undefined or else you're going to
generate a bunch of errors
so with the new es6 syntax you can
actually just set a default parameter
right here or if you want then you can
just return um you know a blank object
or you can give it like a default user
like saying when you're at first boots
up just give it Bucky by default
whatever but that's an error that a lot
of people come across and they don't
know why so I just saved you guys the
trouble so there you go so again what
this is going to do is it's going to
take an action as well so right now we
only have one action right where's my
action so right now we only have one
action that can occur user select it
but eventually in a full-fledged app
we're going to have a bunch of actions
menu open button clicked user deleted
message sent a bunch of these little
announcements going off so what we do in
our reducer is we need to say okay well
announcements do we care about so you
pretty much say arm if it's user
selected then do this if it's message
sent do that and you have like a bunch
of different if statements if this if
this if this however whenever you have a
bunch of different if statements it's
better just to use a switch it's like a
more compact way of writing a whole
bunch of if statements so what we're
going to do is we're going to listen
listen to the action type so again
that's just the announcement that got
made and I can actually copy this so say
in the case that the announcement or
action was user selected what do we want
to do well all we want to do is we want
to return you remember we have to return
some piece of data that's what you
that's what excuse me a reducer is it's
just a little piece of data that you
want to return so this is the active
user reducer so what are we going to
return well we're just going to return
the payload because the payload is the
user that they clicked on and this is
the easiest thing ever so all we're
going to do is return the action dot I
say playlist how did my fingers do that
automatically
it's weird sometimes I just start typing
and I think I'm going to type like Bucky
and I type like ham sandwich I'm like
how did I do that all right let's get
back on track your Bucky and break and
it won't give a default and I'll say
return States alright so if there was no
announcement well I'll say this when
you're at first boots up then we're just
going to say state equals null so we can
say blank object but I'll show you guys
a cool little trick that you can do
later on whenever you hit No
so we'll say state equals now when
you're at first boots up it just
returned state now later on whenever
they click one of these users then it's
going to hear
this announcement it's going to hear
this action and it says alright what do
I want to return I need to return some
piece of data whenever they selected a
user well on going to do is return the
payload which is the user right there
easy enough
so this reducer is always going to
return the same list of users we're not
touching that everything's perfect there
and this one is always going to return
the user that was less selected this is
beautiful so now again all we have to do
is add it to the all reducers so
important I'm going to name this we'll
just say a active user reducer from
reducer active user and all right so
whenever I use this in my app I'll just
refer to it as active user and it is
equal to the active user reducer which
is essentially this function right there
