this tutorial I'm going to show you guys
how to use bitwise operators in Python
now just the heads-up it's probably
really useful if you guys already know
binary so if you guys don't then go
ahead and watch my networking tutorials
one of the videos in there I explained
how to interpret binary basically if you
have a value like 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 then
how to turn this value into an actual
number if you can do that then you're
ready to watch this video and if not
then I'll talk you guys through real
quick but you know just the heads up so
let's say that we have two different
values so we'll say we have a value a
and this is just equal to the regular
number 50 no binary or anything like
that and we have another number B and
this is equal to 25 well if you guys
remember the binary of 50 let's see if I
can get it it's a what is it 1 1 0 0 1 0
I think that's it art so the binary of
the value 50 is 1 1 0 0 1 0 now of
course this place is for the ones this
is for the 2 4 8 16 and 32
all right that's interesting but what do
we care well if we try to end it with
the value of 25 which is let's see 0 1 1
0 0 1 alright check it out so adding
these together in normal human language
would just give you 75 right well
whenever you do a binary and you don't
add them together in that kind of way so
whenever you have a binary and what
you're going to do is use the ampersand
operator so a and B so let me give
myself some more space
all right so what the binary and does
remember is it goes through and it puts
a zero unless the top in the bottom are
both ones so if one of these is a zero
or both of them is zero then it gets a
zero so zero for this one since this one
is a zero and one for this one basically
the only time you're going to get one is
when both of them are ones so this one's
a zero this one's definitely a zero this
one 0 and this one zero so that's what
it does it goes through and it adds them
together in other words it finds a
result and it only has a 1 when both of
those are ones so now what we can do is
we can print C and whenever we do that
it will give you 16 so we can verify
that by making sure so 1 2 4 8 16 and no
32 so that is indeed correct that's
what's going on now let me copy this
right there and all right so the next
thing I want to teach you guys is right
shift and by the way there's also or and
you know a bunch of other stuff but I
figured if you guys know how to do and
then you guys don't have to do or now
one kind of tricky thing is binary right
shift and I'll give you guys an
explanation of what the heck this is so
say that you have variable and it's just
equal to human readable 240 that's just
the value and 240 in binary is 1 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 so what we want to do is we
actually want to take 240 and right
shift it that means take all these bits
is shift them to the right now whenever
you do that the bits on your left are
just going to turn to 0 so what we're
basically doing is this we're going to
make a new variable called Y and this is
going to be equal to X
with every bit shifted two spots to the
right now if you ever want to do left
then just use less than less than but
let's take this and shift every bit two
spots to the right so instead of 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 we get 0 0 remember the first
one ROV zeros 1 1 1 1 0 0 so now you can
see that we're pretty much is taking
these bits and shifting them to the
right 2 spots so now what we can do is
you can actually print Y and check it
out so the original value was 240
however the value of 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0
that is indeed 60 and if you want to run
that through some online calculator then
you can validate that but trust me guys
it is I wouldn't lie to you actually I
would but but not about this alright so
there you go that is how you do binary
and in binary shift uh yeah that's all I
got to say alright see you guys next
