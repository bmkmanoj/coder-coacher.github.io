gonna focus on the surface area of a
right circular cone so a right circular
cone is a is a three-dimensional object
with a circular base just one base
circular base right here and the reason
it's a right circular cone is because
when we draw a line from the top of the
cone to the middle of the or the center
I should say of the circle it's gonna be
perpendicular and it's gonna form a
right triangle with the radius of the
cone and the side of the cone so to find
the surface area of a right circular
cone we have to take the area of the
bottom plus the area of the sides so the
area of the bottom is the area of a
normal circle so PI R squared now the
area of the cone part is PI R s so we
take s which is the slant height of the
cone which is this which is this height
right here normally we're going to use a
perpendicular height but for this we
don't use the perpendicular height we're
gonna use what's called the slant height
and of course R is the radius so this
part is how we find the area of the cone
shaped part so now that we know how to
find the surface area we're gonna do a
couple examples so first example
we have this cone right here and so that
we make sure that we're plugging in all
the right numbers we're gonna write a
little list over here so R equals and H
equals R or our radius equals three
because if you look this is the center
of the circle this line right here is
drawn to a point on the circle so that's
our radius so R equals three and our
height I should have wrote s I wrote H
by accident so s which is our slant
height is this height right here the
hypotenuse of this right triangle that's
formed when you drop altitude down so
our s equals five so to find the surface
area we're going to use our formula
which is high times R times our slant
height plus PI R squared so our slant
height or surface area is equal to PI
three times five plus PI three squared
so three times five is 15 15 PI plus
three squared is nine nine PI so our
surface area is equal to 15 plus nine
which is 24 pi and we're going to leave
it just like that so that we are giving
the exact value but we can't forget our
units so our units are inches squared
because area is always measured in units
squared so we're going to do one more
example
so our equals s equals so our R right
here is unknown so to solve for our R
we're gonna use our Pythagorean theorem
which says that a squared which is R
squared plus B squared equals C squared
so R squared plus 8 squared which is 64
is equal to 10 squared which is a
hundred if you minus the 64 over you get
R squared is equal to 36 take the square
root you get R is equal to 6 now you
remember when we take the square root we
always get a positive or a negative
square root but since we're talking
about the length of something we can't
have a negative length so we only take
the positive value so our R is 6
our s is 10 and now we can find our
surface area so the surface area is
equal to PI R s plus PI R squared now
you don't have to write the formula
every time you solve the problem but
when we're just starting to learn it
helps to write it out so you can
memorize it because these are all things
you'll need to have memorized so PI R
which is 6 times s which is 10 plus PI R
squared so surface area is equal to 6
times 10 which is 60 60 PI plus 6 times
6 squared is 36 so 36 PI so our final
answer is 96 hi centimeters squared so
like I said this is our last lesson for
intro to geometry but we're gonna start
our geometry series
soon so make sure you come back and
check that out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
