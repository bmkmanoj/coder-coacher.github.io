Android tutorial for the new boss and
we're almost done with our SQL database
but let's just check to make sure it's
working so what we're going to do is
we're going to go to our SQL Lite
example class here we're basically going
to surround this with a try and finally
bracket just to make sure you know
something's working here so let's just
give us some space to work and we're
just going to say try here and then
enter try statement down here for what
we're actually going to do is we're
going to have a catch exception here
exception and we'll call it E and then
what we're going to do is we're
basically going to set up a boolean
value right here we're going to call it
did it work and we're going to set it
equal to be true to start with and then
if we have this catch exception we're
going to set equal to false so did it
work is equal to false and then what
we're going to do is have a finally
bracket we're going to finally bracket
and if it works we're going to set up a
dialogue for the most part we're going
to do is we're in display dialogue so
what we're going to say is if did it
work which is basically and say if it's
true we're going to do whatever is
within here again and what we're going
to say is create a dialogue so we're
gonna say dialogue call it D something
like that or just say new dialogue and
pass in the context this class name and
we have to import dialogue I'm not sure
if we've done dialogues yet but it's
pretty simple we're going to set the
title to hekia
and there we go and then we also need to
set up a textview so we're going to say
textview TV equals new textview again
passing this for the context and we're
just going to set the text view text so
we're going to set it to success and
then what we're going to do is we're
going to set up our context and again
I'm sorry for the title it needs to be
in quotations for a dialogue and we just
need to set basically the dialogue
content view so I'm going to say D set
content view and we're going to set
equal to our text view so TV and then we
just got a display our dialog so I went
kind of quickly through that but I think
at this point you guys can kind of guess
or at least know what's going on for the
most part so let's just run our
application and check it make sure it
works
so let's just save everything and then
check our constructor oh and the other
thing that we need to do is since we're
trying to catch some sort of exception
what we're going to do is we're going to
go back into a hot or not class and
basically with this open we're going to
we're going to throw an exception like
an SQL exception and that way if there
is an exception then our you know we're
going to catch it and we're just going
to set this to false and we won't
display anything otherwise it's going to
still be equal to true and then we're
going to get this dialogue success so
let's save everything and run it and
just make sure it works
got Aires sweet oh I must have messed up
on this so set content view there if you
guys you guys probably already caught
that but that's for SQL view class so
we're just going to run it real quick
and make sure everything works here so
we got this coming up and then we're
just gonna say whoops all right Travis
and you know a string would work since
again we had this as a string value but
we're just going to say a thousand ten
thousand that's my hotness scale we're
just going to say update and it looks
like everything's good it looks like it
updated it so that's you know that's
good and the next few tutorials we're
going to work with receiving the data
and kind of a view type thing so
actually we're going to finish or we're
going to set up this intent real quick
for our view class open that up so what
you guys want to do real quickly is go
into the the manifest and set up a class
called SQL view and have a reference
again we we did this kind of intent
opening early on in the series but make
sure you have a reference like this and
again you want to copy your reference
for your action name and then we're
going to go into our SQL Lite example
we're just going to set up a new intent
I equals new intent and then within
quotations we put our action name and we
import intent and we also just say start
activity and that will they'll just open
up our SQL view or we're going to start
working with that pretty soon so that's
it for this tutorial guys we just
basically learned about the dialogue for
the most part but it looks like our
applications working and I'll catch you
guys in the next tutorial have a good
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
