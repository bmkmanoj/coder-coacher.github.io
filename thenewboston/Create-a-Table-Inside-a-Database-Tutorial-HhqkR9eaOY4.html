continuation from the last form a
handling tutorial we are going to create
a table inside of the database that we
just created so go over here and click
on the new boston or whatever the name
of the database you create it was and
we're going to create a table called
users and depending on how many things
you want to collect from your user
that's how many fields you're going to
interpret in this one we're just going
to we're going to have three fields so
the first one we're going to call ID and
it's going to have a type of int and
it's going to be our primary key it's
going to have auto increment the next
one when I say first name I'm going to
do it in all like first name just like
that then last name and for first name
we're going to give it a type of text
and the same thing for last name go
ahead and click go and there we go we
have created well maybe we haven't
created yet you click go one more time
all I know why it's because it said
let's add one just click Save there we
go perfect okay so now we have created
the ID the first name and the last name
fields of our the New Boston database
inside of the user table so click on
users we can see that we have those
three things so I'm going to go ahead
and click on insert so we can add
something I know that we're going to do
this with the form but for now I'm just
going to show you how to do it inside of
PHP my admin
and the next tutorial will actually
finally get to adding it using forms so
I'm just going to type and Cole is the
first name Gillespie is the last name
because that's my name so click go there
we go now I'm going to go into
Dreamweaver and you can see I've already
created some PHP here that stores am I
sequel query inside of this result
variable and it I've created a loop to
loop through that result variable and
grab the first name and the last name
and it's going to echo it for each one
that's in there and for now there's only
one which the one we just created so I'm
going to run this run this and you guys
can see that we now have a way to
display the data inside of our my sequel
database and that was done using this
sequel query if you do not know anything
about sequel I recommend going to
w3schools and checking that out I will
make some tutorials on sequel in the
following tutorials in this series but
it's going to be it's going to be
introductory I'm going to assume that
you already have some knowledge of
sequel so hopefully you guys got that up
and running and now you are ready for
some form handling using PHP so
everybody is looking forward to this
make sure you watch the next tutorial
because we are going to be actually
grabbing some data from some forms and
thrown into our newly created database
so i will see you guys in the next
tutorial
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
