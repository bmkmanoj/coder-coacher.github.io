17th physics lesson and in this lesson I
want to talk to you guys about Newton's
third law now before we get into the law
itself and I tell you guys what it is I
want to show you guys this equation F
equals MA or F MA now obviously what
this means is force equals mass times
acceleration basically if we wanted to
figure out the acceleration of something
and we had the force in the mass we
could do that easily by you know
plugging in the variables switching
things around calculate that rather easy
so let me go ahead and show you guys a
quick example that will help you
understand Newton's third law say you
were standing on the top of a building
and you had this big old pumpkin like
that now you drop that pumpkin
so it's falling freely through the air
now obviously the force in this case
pulling the pumpkin to the ground would
be gravity and we could of course
calculate the mass of the pumpkin to
figure out its acceleration now say
instead of standing on top of the
building now you are just standing on
top of the ground on top of earth so we
have no object it's just you now check
this out the force is still gravity the
force is pulling you down to the ground
we could of course calculate your mass
figure out whatever that is but let's go
ahead and take a look at the
acceleration the acceleration of you or
the object is zero you aren't moving
anywhere even though you have a force
and a mass your acceleration is zero
does that make sense
well if I just went ahead and I said you
know what why does that happen an easy
answer would be um well Bucky because
you're standing on the freaking ground
that's why you're not going anywhere
but Newton wasn't satisfied with this
answer so he needs to come up with this
law and what he said is the reason that
you are not accelerating is because when
you are standing on earth you do have a
force and a mass but the force of the
earth is pushing up with you pushing up
on you at
equal force now whenever this happens in
the force downward equals the force
upward and the object has no
acceleration this is called a force pair
not to be confused with a force pair
which is indeed my favorite fruit now
like I said a force pair happens when
two objects have equal force but
opposite directions
so let's just give this a fig force of
like 10 Newton's gravity and the earth
is pushing up anew with 10 new ends
upward whenever you have equal forces in
opposite directions then your object is
always going to have zero acceleration
aka it's not going to be moving anywhere
so usually whenever I teaches people it
confuses them how pretty much there is a
force keeping you from being sucked down
to the middle of the earth and I don't
know it's to be honest physics is kind
of confusing but I think I can help
clear things up by showing you guys an
easier example of course whenever you're
just standing walking around earth it
may be kind of hard to grasp the concept
of a force pair so let me show you guys
this say that we have a tree limb and on
the tree we have a watermelon now of
course I know watermelons don't grow on
trees
but for this example this is watermelon
tree don't watermelons have like some
stripes on them or something it's kind
of looks like that loaf of bread or a
shoe leg anyways I'm getting distracted
this is a watermelon tree now check it
out there are two forces working on this
watermelon first of all we have gravity
now gravity is trying to pull this
watermelon down make it fall on the
ground but why is it not falling on the
ground well that's because we have
another force that's the tree limb now
the tree limb is pushing or pulling
depending on you know whose standpoint
you're taking is has a force upward
now since the tree limb has a force
moving the watermelon upward and gravity
is trying to pull it down the watermelon
results in zero
acceleration so let's go ahead and give
these some fake values of 5 Newtons each
so gravity is pulling down on the
watermelon with the force of 5 Newtons
in the tree limb is holding up the
watermelon with the force of 5 Newtons
so then the end result Wow definitely
spelled that wrong okay slow down Bucky
result is zero acceleration aka this
watermelon here isn't moving at all so
again like Newton said a force pair what
you see right here is what happens when
two objects or an object has two forces
in opposite directions but of equal
magnitude causing zero acceleration so
of course if we wanted to get rid of
this force beer then what we do is we
will take pair of scissors and cut this
tree limb and then whenever we Det do
that the watermelon would of course
spring or fall to the ground so
basically like I said that's the concept
behind Newton's third law in you
probably more commonly heard it like I
said for every action there is an equal
and opposite reaction so that's the main
concept behind it so hopefully you guys
understand it a little bit better and
hopefully you guys understand what force
pair is and why you guys are not
sticking to the middle of the earth so
anyways thank you guys for watching
we're going to subscribe and I'll see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
