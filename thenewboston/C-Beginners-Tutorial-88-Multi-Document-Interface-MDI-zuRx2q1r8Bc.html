tutorial that I'm making forth of your
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to use multiple
document interface and that is also
called MDI so if you don't know what
multiple document interface is it
basically means that you can have forms
inside of forms for example we were to
show a form inside of hormone right here
then when we move it around we would
only be able to move it around inside of
this form if we try to like move it out
here or something then we wouldn't be
able to do that it would just stay
inside of this form and if you still
don't know what I mean
you'll see once we get there so once you
have your forms in your buttons just
double click on button one so to start
off we have to first tell on the
compiler that we want this form to be
able to hold forms inside of it
so in order to do that we're going to
have to tell it that we want form one to
be an MDI container that's it's called
so we can't do this because that will
access a form one class this keyword
will just access the class we we're
inside of and then we can just use this
dot is MDI container and we're just
going to set it equal to true and all
that means it kind of forms inside of it
now all right so now we want to have
forms be displayed inside of this ball
so in order to do that we're just going
to create a new form and show it like we
would normally do perform to call attack
study equal to a new form here now
before we show it though we have to tell
it that we want it to be inside of form
1 so in order to do that we're just
going to do F dot MDI parent equals this
and once again this the this keyword
will refer to the class that we are
inside of so form 1 so we're telling it
the parent or the container that it will
be inside of is form 1 and once you have
that you can now display the form so
let's do F dot show and you
cannot do show dialog for obvious
reasons like you wouldn't be able to
like click it and then not go back to
form one side of one so now when we eat
bug here and click button one you should
have a form that we can only move around
inside of this and form one will be a
container and you'll see a change
yep and as you can see this is like
greyish now and so they container and
now when you move this around we can
only move it around inside of here if we
move it outside of here we're going to
scroll bot no need to scroll over to it
and see the floor and like I said you
can't move it out like or amount we
can't even move our mouse outside of the
form all right so say you want to show
multiple forms I'll be inside of this
form well you can do that go ahead and
copy this code let's show the other form
will show three and four so let's do
four three and form for having all these
different names though alright so now
what this will do is it will show all
three forms inside of one one so now
when we put this button you should have
form two or three and one for all inside
of this one for the up to now form four
one three and form two they're all
inside of this quadrant can't move out
now there's one last thing that I'm
going to show you before end this
tutorial you can arrange these forms
that will be inside of this container
very easily so when we click button to
where we want it to arrange them so what
we're going to do is you're going to
save this because this is a container
and then we're going to do MDI layout
MDI and what this will do is it will
save or set all the children or all of
the forms inside of the MDI container
which is form one to like a specific
layout and the
say I'm going to show you is arrange
icons so now I'm gonna be bug here show
the forms and click this button nothing
really seems to be having happening it
doesn't really seem to be doing anything
well what um this arrange will do is it
will arrange them one that you have them
minimized
that's right you can minimize them
inside of it so if we minimize them you
can see they just go right down to the
bottom and we can move these minimized
forms around you can move them like up
here there and stuff and now I'm gonna
click this button it'll arrange all
these like down on the bottom yep so
it'll all stay there you cannot move
that but around now put this button
there anything perfectly the next one is
cascade and this is fairly similar to
what happens when you originally show
them so now we put this cascade button
it'll just arrange them yeah it just
makes them a little bit wider a little
bit taller but they're all a great on
top of each other as you can see and the
last two are pretty much the same it's
tile horizontal and it's just like what
it says it'll do it tiled them
horizontally yep
and tile vertical will do just tile them
vertically yep so that's pretty much it
for this tutorial on multiple document
interface so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
