video I am going to show you how to
verify the checksum of a file using a
hash if you guys are like mmm no idea
what any of that means don't care
probably don't need it going on to the
next video
well hold on let me explain exactly what
that means so what we're going to be
doing is whenever you go on the internet
and find some file that you want to
download you click download and then you
take whatever files on their server and
you're pretty much bringing it on to
your own personal local machine your own
computer so what we're going to do is
we're going to verify that the file that
we wanted was actually the file that we
got um that's not really makes sense I
mean you go get a file download it and
it's always the same one right well
there are a lot of attacks nowadays and
let's say that there was some kind of
hacker who was send in between the
server and your own computer well what
they could do is they could see that
you're downloading a file and instead of
giving you the file that you wanted
whether it was an mp3 a video a zip file
what they could do is they could send
you a malicious file with you know some
virus instead or let's say that someone
wanted to spy on you they could send you
you know a program just like it but it
could have a backdoor in it so they
could you know snoop on your traffic
whatever all right well that doesn't
sound good so how can we verify that
this file that we actually wanted in
this example I'm just using raspberry pi
and this is just because you know I just
wanted to find some small file that I
could download for this tutorial but you
guys notice these or you're going to
start noticing them now that you know
what they are on pretty much every you
know important file that you can
download off the internet alright so
that sounds pretty cool I want to verify
that I got the right file how do we do
it
well we're going to do it using this
thing and this is called a hash and
there are a bunch of different types of
hashes or hashing algorithms and I won't
get into the real specifics of how they
work because they all work a little bit
different but basically a hash or this
long number right here is a way that you
can take some data and turn it into
a specific number now this formula it
only works one way so whenever you take
this file for example and you run it
through this formula it's always going
to give you this number if you do it in
a year it's still going to give you this
number if you make any changes to this
file and run it through the same formula
this number is going to be completely
different so that way what we can do is
we can download this file run it through
the formula on our own computer and make
sure that we end up with this number
right here and if we do then we know
that this is the verified version of the
file
if anyone messed with it then like I
said we're going to get something else
so I already download this before this
tutorial so what I'm going to do is just
pop open my terminal and switch my
profile all right I also made my
background my terminal kind of
transparent so uh you know you guys can
kind of see the files and let me
actually change it so it's a little so
you guys can see the actual files behind
it I think it looks pretty cool too all
right
so what we want to do is this file that
we downloaded we want to check and make
sure that we end up with this number as
a result so what I can do is let me just
alright so right now I'm in my home and
I want to move to my downloads just
because that's where the file is and we
can see that this is the file that we
just downloaded is just a zip file but
it can be any type of file um you know
just so I so whatever so what we wanted
to do is you want to run it through some
kind of hashing algorithm and the
hashing algorithm in this case that
Raspberry Pi used is sha-1 so this is
like the easiest thing ever if you just
type sha-1 some that's what algorithm
you're going to use in after this just
type the name of the file in the name of
my file is n oo and if you just start
typing it and you hit tab then a Mbutu
is going to figure out what you're
trying to type and hit enter so when we
took this file on our own computer noobs
light and we were running it through
this algorithm this
formula we ended up with this value e140
five three all right let's look on the
website e one four zero five three all
right it looks it looks like it's the
right number but um and most of the time
you can just like look at this and maybe
write it down or compare it you know
read them one by one but if you guys
want a real quick way to um you know
just compare them if you're too lazy to
actually read the whole thing then what
you can do is you can just select this
and copy it so you know that this is the
verified hash and then whenever you type
your program again instead of just
running it and outputting it what you
can do is use the pipe symbol and if you
hold shift above enter on your keyboard
that little up-and-down thing that's the
pipe symbol and you can type gr e P and
then let me just do this visually so you
guys can see pasted in the hash from the
website now this is going to do is it's
going to run the same formula before on
our own local file but it's going to
compare this again grep means that you
can pattern match using regular
expressions so what you're pretty much
saying is does this match this from the
website hit enter and if it's red it
means that it does match pretty sweet
now I'll show you guys what happens when
it doesn't so I'm going to run this
again but let's say that the verified
arm hash we knew instead of this being
an a I'm going to change this to B so
now whenever you run this hashing
algorithm or the formula on our computer
it's going to end up different than the
verified version so I'm going to hit
enter and you see we didn't get that red
output so it's kind of you know
counterintuitive because red is actually
a good thing something that you want to
see so yeah there you go so whenever you
download a file from the internet if you
want to make sure it's valid then run
the hashing algorithm on it so she'll
want some and there's also like md5 some
sha-256 some you're going to tell you
what algorithm to use on the website
match them and as long as it red it's
red then you got the verified version
now the last thing i want to talk about
before i got let you guys go and
guys don't have to type anything else is
re how do I know that someone just
didn't hack this website and um you know
or maybe there's a virus on my computer
that whenever I go to this website it's
going to give me a fake hash and the
fake file
well then I'm kind of screwed because re
I'm checking it and it's saying it's
verified but you know maybe someone on
my computer is just tweaking with what I
see well for that what you can do is if
you want to be like extra safe then shut
off the Wi-Fi on your phone and just
connect to the 4G network and view the
same website so whenever I view this
from my phone using 4G opening an
entirely different device and network
then make sure it says the same thing
also um you know maybe go to one of your
friends house or ask them to go to this
website and read back the Elgar it or
excuse me read back the hash value and
once you do that then you can see that
okay this is the actual hash make sure
that you're on the right website of
course and it's good to go so you know
it sucks that I even have to teach you
guys this because you know it's kind of
crappy that people do this and put
backdoors and software and there are
people sitting in the middle you know
manipulating your fire your files but
now you guys will be knowledgeable good
to go safe thank you guys for watching
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
