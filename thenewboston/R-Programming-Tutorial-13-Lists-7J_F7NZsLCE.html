awesome art tutorial and in this video I
want to talk to you guys about lists now
what a list is is it's kind of similar
to a vector but in my opinion even
cooler because with vectors we can store
data of the same type so this is all
numerical data this is all numerical
data this vector has just all text in it
however with a list we can mix things up
a bit so we can create a list that
stores text and numbers and you want to
know something else
we can even store things like data
frames in the list and if you want to
get real crazy listen to this you can
even store another list inside another
list so this within a list list ception
as I call it but no no it's cause of
that so I don't do that so let's go
ahead and create one right now now
instead of naming X I'm going to go
ahead and name it
Bucky's list now how do you create a
list well the keyword to do that of
course is a list go figure who would
have thought so let's go ahead and throw
a bunch of things in here so maybe I
don't know a number 71 arm a word bacon
of course now we can even store vectors
inside here so let's store some stupid
vector one through five maybe we want to
throw another word in there to Anna and
as promised like I said we can actually
take an entire data frame and store
those inside a list as well pretty
freakin sweet and anytime you want to
see your list just type out the name of
it Bucky's list and actually what I'm
going to be doing a lot is if you hold
ctrl a on your keyboard then just hit
ctrl enter it runs the entire program so
if you guys don't see me hit this Run
button that's what I'm doing alright so
as you can see our buckey's list is made
up of five different elements a number a
word a vector another word and an entire
frickin data frame pretty freakin
awesome if yet
okay do not want to do that pretty
awesome if you ask me however whenever
you have a list sometimes it can be
confusing to access the individual
elements because of the fact that it can
store different types of data so I'm
going to show you guys some cool if you
ever want to name the different elements
in here so you can access them a little
bit easier what you can do is you can do
something like this use the names
function and this says okay what are you
naming well we're naming the elements in
Bucky's list so now what we have to do
is we need to give it a vector of names
so the first one we can say is my fav um
I don't know which is my fav num my
favorite number even though 71 is not my
favorite number on the second one would
be like my fav food which is bacon the
third one would be fav vector I guess
you know if some people prefer some
vectors over another one I don't
freaking know now this one tuna could be
like a good food and this last one could
be like my favorite data since you know
it's my favorite data frame I don't
freaking know but say you're making that
Basin you want to be able to access
these things easier that's what you can
do so now whenever you run this each of
these items in this list now has a
corresponding name that can make things
a lot easier
now of course to access an individual
item you type the name of your list
which is Bucky's list and any time
you're accessing an item from your list
or element what you can do is you use
the double brackets double square
brackets and then the name of that
element so we say in Bucky's list get
his fav food
okay let me just run this and as you can
see it makes everything and it says
Bucky's list his favorite food is bacon
which is true can't argue with that now
another cool thing I want to mention is
that whenever you return an item in your
list you can treat it just as that item
what the heck am I talking about
so say that you returned on this data
frame right here which is of course
actually let me change it to lowercase F
so what this does right here is it
returns this entire data frame up here
now once we return it we can treat it
just as any other data frame and that
includes things like getting one column
from it so we return this data frame and
then we say give me the age column so
whenever we do that run all this it says
this is that frame that you returned and
this is the age column right there
pretty stinkin awesome so actually I
think I got time to show you guys one
last thing keep that name clear
everything out turn this up a bit that's
what she said so let's say that we want
to add another element to our list well
we could just go ahead and do it right
here but I want to show you guys how to
do this programmatically so the first
thing I want to do is just to get the
length of this and of course this is
going to return one two three four five
so this is going to return five right
here so say that we wanted to add maybe
what piece of information do I want to
add maybe my sister's name or something
since it's my list well what we can do
is we can type
Bucky's list
and what we're going to do here is we're
going to add another piece of
information called sister's name now of
course we're going to set this equal to
my sister's name which is Hannah and now
what we can do is just actually let's
just go ahead and print this entire
thing out to make sure it worked and
then we'll return the length of it again
so let me go ahead and run this make
sure I didn't fudge anything up alright
looking good so basically what we did
let me scroll all the way to the top
they clear that all right so we created
our original buckey's list now the
original list had a length of five items
but then we decided that we wanted to
add another item so we did that through
here we pretty much say the item name
and the value of the item now when we
printed it out again we could see that
well we do have a item named sister's
name and the value of that is Hannah
which is my sister's name and the length
of your list is now six
so again if you ever want to add a new
item to your list and that's how you do
it so as you can see lists are pretty
freakin awesome and in the next video
we're probably going to be moving on
from lists because you covered all the
real essential basics right now and I'm
going to be showing you guys something
else awesome of course as always so
thank you guys for watching don't forget
