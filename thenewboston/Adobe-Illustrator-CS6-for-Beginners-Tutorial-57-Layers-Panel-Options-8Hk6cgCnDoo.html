to another Illustrator cs6 tutorial and
in this one we're gonna start messing
around with the layer panel options and
maybe we'll get to the layer options now
there's not a whole lot of layer panel
options and most of the things they the
layer panel options do is help your view
or change the way you want to look at
the layers panel so let's go ahead and
go to the options and here we go we've
got the options here and then we want to
find the panel options which is down
here at the bottom and here we go now
we've got the layers panel options we've
got show there's only if I click that
it's only gonna show me the actual
layers I'm gonna hit OK real quick and
now you don't see the paths or anymore
we've got layers and we've got sub
layers now if it doesn't if there is no
sub layer anymore there's not going to
be a little drop-down triangle so that's
what that one does and it will help you
by hiding stuff that you don't really
want to see we've got row size we can
make it large or you can specify a
certain amount or smaller I'm gonna hit
OK a large and you can see that it's a
lot bigger now personally it depending
it depends on really how much stuff you
have going on in your layers or how many
layers you got going on but I like to
have in larger layers it allows you to
see things better but if you've got like
a thousand layers or something like
there are a thousand paths or whatever
then as you might want to put it up to
medium or small and we've got here our
thumbnail options do we see want to see
the thumbnails for layers or just the
top level only do we want to see
thumbnails for groups and objects that's
up to you and I'm sure you guys can
figure out what happens if you uncheck
one of these one of the thumbnails for
the certain things that you're talking
about will go away I'm just gonna hit OK
and that's basically it for the layers
panel options so let's get on to
something else
let's get into layer options now if you
don't have any layers created you could
just click this button down here to
create a new layer and it'll make one
for you and then you could put something
in it if you want to now if you want to
check out the your layer options which
I'm gonna do with this layer 2 which has
the triangles in it you need to hold
down alt and then click on the layer
there you go double click on the icon
there and then now we've got our layer
options we can rename the layer and call
those triangles you can change your
color to anything you want click on this
button to change it to whatever you want
with the color picker and let's make it
something that's easily visible and then
you've got a bunch of other options here
template template you select it to make
a template layer uneditable and I don't
have a template layer and then we've got
a lock and that's gonna lock the layer
print is gonna it's gonna enable
printing for this layer so non-printable
layers are gonna appear in italics and
in your layer panel and I'll have to go
over that some time with you gosh oh and
that's just gonna basically show the
layer the layer panel preview is gonna
view let you select are gonna let you
see this in the preview view and that's
up I'll show you that and then you've
got dim images if you want to and that's
pretty much it I'm gonna hit OK and you
can see that I've changed to a different
color green and then the layer name has
changed now if I go to view we've got
our outline right now we're in preview
view if I click outline it's going to
show me that view if I go to view and I
go to preview
that's the preview view that it was
talking about now if you want to change
the name of your layer without having to
go into the layer options that's very
easy all you gotta do is double click on
the layer name and then I could change
this
two rectangles and text so now I know
what the lair is and I can rename them
really easy so that's all I want to show
you today about lair options you've got
the whole layer panel options and then I
also showed you individual layer options
so go ahead use those to your advantage
