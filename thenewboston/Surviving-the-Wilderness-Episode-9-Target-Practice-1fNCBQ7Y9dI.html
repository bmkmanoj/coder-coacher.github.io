now I couldn't turn on with my camera
gear at all because uh it rains a lot
last night and quite a bit this morning
just kind of stoking the fire trying to
keep it going and it actually almost
went out all the way last night at one
point so I didn't really even get any
sleep even when I had a fire
it was raining the whole time and I'm
really tired
it's really hungry right now and these
bugs will not leave me alone I'm getting
bit up all over really annoying on the
agenda for today I'm gonna keep this
fire going a little bit try and build it
up a little bit and I'm gonna go
exploring and I need to do something
about food because I am pretty hungry
now all I've had is nothing really just
frog legs
so I guess that's what I'm gonna plan on
doing another thing is I really wish I
could brush my teeth right now because
they feel the sting but uh I don't
really know who any plants I can use to
help with that but I'll find out when I
start sticking stuff in my mouth
all right instead of trying to set up
some sort of trap which I know I
probably can't do and even if I can
nothing good is going to come of it I
decided since I've seen a lot of
Chipmunks that I'm going to practice
throwing rocks at this little target I
made which is from the rope thing that I
had I tied it from this tree right here
so I'm just gonna throw rocks at this
because it's pretty small I already
tried throwing some rocks with some
Chipmunks and didn't pan out too well
wasn't even close so I figure if I
practice enough this should at least
give me a better chance to get in
something so uh that's what that's
what's on the agenda so far
maybe I should back up a little partners
because probably not gonna get that book
concussion on that one
moving target
this is gonna be too easy and I'll be
eating a squirrel
probably about tonight I haven't decided
yet all right I just found the best
thing ever
while I was exploring out oh so awesome
already through I had to go all the way
back to camp to get the camera and it's
it's not an easy walk really but um I'll
just uh well here we go give you a
little peek right here it's not a big
deal but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
