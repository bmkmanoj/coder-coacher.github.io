C++ tutorial and then this tutorial I'm
going to be talking about something
called the address operator and what the
address operator is is it shows you
where in your memory a variable is
stored so um it's just easier just to
show you guys so let's get to it
the first thing we're going to need to
do is make a couple variables let's make
a couple in variables stands for integer
I'm going to call mine int finger is
equal to 10 since I have 10 fingers and
in eyes is equal to 2 since I have 2
eyes I don't know why fingers singular
and eyes is plural but that's the way
it's going to be I'm probably going to
mess it up so just follow along the next
thing we're going to want to do or the
next thing I actually want to show you
is what this is it I'll put it on-screen
so let me just output this see out
finger and let me in that line and let
me see out and anytime you want to get
the address of a variable you have to
add the ampersand and then type in the
variable so for example since fingers
that variable it's going to have the
value of 10 and ampersand finger is the
address of where that variable is
located in the memory so I'm going to
add ampersand finger and go ahead and in
that line and let me just show you guys
right here
um what this is with eyes too so let's
eyes ampersand eyes so right now we're
going to output the variable finger and
it's going to have the value of 10 and
then we're going to output the location
and we're finger is stored on your
memory and this is going to be the
hexadecimal location that your computer
sees and again we're going to do that
with eyes and then we're going to find
the location of eyes that your computer
sees so if you're thinking if you don't
really
and why this is useful or what what it's
going to do you'll understand later when
we when we have to build programs and we
have to use something called pointers
and this is what a pointer actually
needs but for now let's just show you
guys what this is hopefully I didn't
mess anything up and if I compile it it
right there we go as you can see the
Vinc the excuse me finger value of your
variable is 10 but the location in your
memory it's stored is 0 x2 to FF 44 and
the variable of is what the user sees is
2 but with the computer sees is 0 x2 to
FF 40 and just a little side note this
kind of makes sense because in your
memory this is stored four bits away you
can tell by 44 and 40 and this makes
sense because um since we're using int
as our datatype it always uses 4 bytes
of data so that is why the variables are
4 bits away so again that is how you
find the address to any variable to find
its location in the memory and if you're
asking are a Bucky why the heck would
you even want the address at all is that
just a neat little trick you told me no
you actually need this why well you got
to stick around for my next tutorials to
find out so learn how to find the
address you don't really have to learn
anything it's one of the easiest things
I taught you guys so far but just study
this tutorial play around with it a
little bit and once you learn this
you're ready to move on next tutorial so
see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
