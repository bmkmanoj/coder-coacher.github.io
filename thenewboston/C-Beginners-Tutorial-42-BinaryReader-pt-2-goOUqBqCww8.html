c-sharp tutorial that I'm making before
than your Boston and in this tutorial
we're going to be looking at the binary
reader still and in last tutorial we
left off with if reading the bytes in
the wrong order so instead of it getting
one when you read an in sixteen right
here it was getting one zero zero so I
was reading this byte and then this way
well there's no real way to change what
order it reads the bytes it so what
we're going to have to do is we're going
to have to reverse it after it reads it
so what we're going to do right here is
we're just going to create a byte array
for it to read um or to read the value
into so we're going to call this buffer
and then we're going to set it equal to
what the reader gets and we're going to
do three bytes right here and we're
going to read two bytes send one again
in sixteen out of it or a 2 or 2 bytes
which is and then 16 32 bytes there so
now this buffer will have 2 bytes inside
for this byte array will have 2 bytes
inside of it however doing the read
bytes method it'll still read it the
wrong way they'll still read this bite
and then this byte so what we're going
to have to do is reverse this array or
yeah just reverse the array so in order
to do that we're just going to do array
is the array class and then do dot
reversed and this will reverse the array
so we put an array inside of here so
this byte array buffer and basically it
will just reverse the entire array so
now instead of the values being 0 1 0
it'll be 0 0 1 so it just reverses the
entire array and finally we need to get
on and 16 out of it or a 2 byte integer
so in order to do that we're going to do
well first of all we have a new text box
once tacked and in order to do that
we're just going to do the uz bit
converter class which we'll get to later
we're going to use this a little bit
more and we can do 2 and 16 and this
will convert on the byte array into n 16
so we just put the butter a in there
which is buffer and then following this
it calls for us
index meaning the element in the array
that it will start reading from or start
making it into an N 16 and since the
only two elements inside of this array
we're going to start at zero but it
could like an array with like let's say
40 elements and you want to start like
the 30th element then you can do that
you put 30 right there and since this is
a textbox that's to be represented as a
string so we're just going to do dot two
string and we're going to make it be in
hexadecimal so now when you click the
read button instead of it just getting
one zero zero we should get zero or we
should get one yep that's exactly what
we wanted so let's just go over our code
again just so you completely understand
it so first off it sets the position of
the binary reader to 1e and that's
exactly where you wanted to be one E and
since we're reading on for an N 16 or a
short we're going to read these two
bytes right here so we need to start
right there but however when it reads
these it reads it in the wrong order to
read this white and then this byte so
what we had to do is we had to reverse
this entire array and it reads those
bytes into this wider area here so then
we reverse that white array that we read
it into and then we use this bit
converter class to convert it into an N
16 or a short and then we just do dot to
string to convert it into a string so it
can be displayed in the message box or
mean in the text box now if you wanted
to let's say read an in 32 well then all
we have to do appear is change this to
four bytes since and n 32 is four bytes
long and we just changed this dot to
into 32 and then it will convert it into
nine 32 so let's say we want to have it
read we'll just have it read from here
let's have read all the whites and it
will be an in 32 so the offset is 11 or
well it's actually one one two one one
right there for the position read the
four bytes and then convert it into an
in 32
and read this textile right here click
read and those are the exact bikes we
wanted see if we go right here we see
six four yup
six one so next one six D yes and two E
and that's displaying it in hexadecimal
you wanted to display and just decimal
then you would do
oops you do yeah you still do back to
doing you just wouldn't have the X
inside of there so now it will be an
entire number and the difference here
between reading it just the bytes and
then having to display those in the
message box or in the text box is if we
were to have it be converted into
decimal then it would convert each value
into decimal and not convert the entire
number it wouldn't treat it this as an
entire number it would treat each byte
as an individual so and we're going to
want it to be a entire number so we're
going to look a little bit more at this
bit converter class and this bit
converter class is very useful for
example say we wanted to UM turn a
number into a byte array so in order to
do that we can use D get bytes method
let me just type a number inside of here
so if we wanted to get the lights out of
that then we could do that and it set
our lighter eight equal to that so now
it gets the bytes out of this number
right here and converts it into a byte
array and we'll be looking at that a
little bit later in the next tutorial
when we're going to be voiding
information so that's pretty much all
there is to reading integers using the
binary reader class so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
