your tenth JavaScript tutorial and I
hope that you guys are ready to have
your minds blown because that's what I'm
about to do in this story because in
this tutorial I'm going to teach you
guys how to call a function from another
function hmm interesting
so let's go ahead and start with two
functions function I'll just go ahead
and name the first one do first and it
won't take any parameters and for the
body let's just go ahead and you know
give it something simple we'll just
print something out on the screen
umm so right documents right and what's
something stupid we can put I am first
burro or Bo hey who the heck cares and
for our second function go ahead and
type function will name this do second
if you kind of guess that and we're just
going to write on this document right
and Rea just write like the bunch of
two's or something for a second I don't
know I'm not really creative tonight but
anyways so we have two functions do
first in do second and these are
functions that we're going to call from
another function so let's go ahead and
make that function right now we'll just
go ahead and name this function start
since this will be the starting point so
let's go ahead and this won't take any
parameters either all this function is
going to do is call other functions so
first it's going to call do first and
then it's going to call do second so now
if we go ahead and run this program
nothing is going to happen because we
just have three functions right here
pumped up and ready to go but we Det we
never even used any of them yet so go
ahead refresh and check it out I'm
refreshing nothing is happening and
that's like I said we have three
functions right here pumped up ready to
go but we didn't start it off we didn't
call them those functions first so go
ahead in your program and let's start it
off by saying start semicolon so now
it's going to say alright you got a
function you got function you got a
function and now the first thing I'm
going to do is call the starting
function right now so I go up to the
starting function what do you want me to
do
do first function so then I go up to the
do first function and print out I am
first bow so this is actually the first
thing it's going to print out right here
and it says alright I'm done with the
first function now what okay you told me
to go do the second function so I'll go
up here and print out two two two two
two okay so basically print out this and
print out this and then I'm done so
let's go ahead and save this and see
what we got I am first bow and two two
two two two so basically the only
function that ran is the starting
function and then all this one did is it
called the first one and called the
second one and then it quit and that's
our whole entire program so anyways what
I want to show you is you can use
functions like the starting function to
start it off and call other function and
you actually do that a lot of the time
so for example if you have a lot of code
you can organize summon the do first or
an i some in the do second and it makes
it a lot cleaner than having this huge
long list of code you can break it up
into nice little functions and then
later on when you see all right
something weird is going on with this
first function you know what bit of code
is messing up so anyways that's why
functions come in handy but now that I
have time and that saw really a little
quicker than I thought I get I bet you
guys are wondering this what would you
do if you had a function like first and
then it called the second and then that
one called the first which would call
the second and it was just like an
endless loop well I'm not sure but hey I
never did it before but let's go ahead
and find out my guess is that my
computer is going to blow up but you
guess in the comment box what you think
is going to happen below my computer is
just my freeze or something but well
I'll make soil again so function do
first
and I don't recommend doing this but
let's go ahead and just document dot
write something on the screen just very
first we'll make it simple and then what
we're going to do is call another do
second function from here and then do
second function function do second let's
just go ahead and have this one right
out on the screen on just right at
second and let's have some spaces
actually first in second so it is and
I'll jumbled together a defect if it
actually does print out and then this
one is going to call do first so
basically what's going to happen is
whenever we call one of these functions
is going to print something out call the
other function print something out call
the other function print call print call
print call print call I'm just going to
do that for like the next three minutes
until you get tired of me and go watch
another video but anyways it's just
going to go back and forth but if we run
it right now nothing is going to happen
because we just have two functions
waiting there we didn't call any of them
yet so now let's go ahead and start off
and call do first so the first thing
it's going to do is call this first
function and then from there it's just
going to be an endless circle so now
let's go ahead and save it and when i
refresh this I'm kind of scared to press
it all right I'll do it
whoa so then it just printed out an
endless list of first and second I
wonder if this even stopped printing out
yeah it finally just gave up so so
that's pretty cool actually that Mozilla
Firefox just give up after a certain
amount of time so yeah that's what I
would do too
that's why I had to drop out of college
just gave up after a certain amount of
time anyways there you have it how to
make an endless loop of functions again
I wouldn't recommend that in any of your
programming and if you were going to
interview for a job please do not
mention this and do not mention my name
or my reputation would be ruined but for
now thank you guys for watching my
tutorial I hope you guys enjoyed it and
I guess I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
