slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
looking more at properties and we're
going to be finishing our application
that we created in the last couple
tutorials now if you're unfamiliar with
what you see on the screen right now
then you might want to move back a
couple tutorials probably to the
enumerations video that's where we can
started on making this application so if
not then let's go ahead and get started
so if you remember last time we created
this property and what we did was we got
the current hour that is stored in this
date/time picker
now the hour is an integer because our
property is an integer we don't have to
specify the data type in here because we
already did it up in the top now we have
a set function and in the arguments we
have to give it a value and what this
does is it sets the value of day time
picker hour to the value that the user
passed so it sets the year month and day
all according to the current machine
that it's on then it sets the hour to
whatever the use the developer passes to
the to this function and then it sets
the minutes and the seconds to zero so
now let's go ahead and what we want to
do is we want to change this text label
based on what the person is doing so
before we get started doing that we need
to go ahead and create two events double
click on your form one and double click
on DTP hours so we're going to get
private sub DTP our value change and
we're going to get form one load so when
the form or modes we want to set our
date/time picker to the current time
that the program is running so what
we'll do is we'll just go ahead and type
me dot our so what this is going to do
is we're using the me keyword which is
referring to this class right here
and now in this class we have a property
called our so when we call me dot our it
refers to this hour right here so me dot
our equals now dot our so what this is
going to do is it's going to set our our
property to the current time by using
now dot our to get what the current time
is so it will update the daytime picker
so now what we want to do is whenever
the user changes a value in the daytime
picker we want to go ahead and update
our hour so this is very simple as well
so we'll use the me key word to refer to
this class and dot our now if you're a
little confused on the me keyword I'm
gonna have a whole nother tutorial
covering the me keyword more in depth
and now if you're coming from a
different language
the main keyword would be equivalent to
the this keyword so we'll type me dot
our equals DTP our dot value dot our so
it's going to get whatever they put in
and it's going to update our our
property so now what we need to do is we
need to set this label based on what the
user has picked so what we're going to
do is we're going to come down here and
we'll type label state dot text equals
at and now we'll just go ahead and add
the value or the hour so at value and
then we're just going to add zero zero
because the value is a single integer
ranging from one to twelve so add one
o'clock to twelve o'clock either a.m. or
p.m.
we'll just go ahead and type we'll just
use the name Richard is and then so what
this is going to do is going to say at
and then the hour that they selected
Richard is and it's going to we're going
to leave this blank right now and we're
going to create a whole nother thing
will determine what Richard is doing so
you can have as many things as you want
inside of a set a set block inside of
your property hour so if we go ahead and
run this you can see that it sets the
current time and the current time on my
computer right now you can't see it but
it is 6:14 and because we use the
current hour and then set the minutes
and the seconds to zero automatic I mean
by inputting ourselves it's going to get
the hour from the machine and then do
whatever we tell it to for this and it
says at 1800 Richard is so this uses
military time so we change this to 5 and
press Enter
ok sorry about that had a little trouble
there but so if we put 4 o'clock in here
it'll say at 16 Richard is and if we
type let's say 6 o'clock p.m. or let's
change it to a.m. so at 6 o'clock a.m.
Richard is so basically what we did is
we created this property and the
property value the property itself is
set to the hour so if we did a message
box I show and put our it would give us
the integer of the current hour and then
we use the set to change the date and
time of the day time picker so we set it
to we created a new date and we set it
to the mount year now that month now
that day and then the current value and
then we just set the label state to at
and in the current hour which is in
military time Richard is and it doesn't
display anything yet and then when the
when the form loads we just set the our
property to the current hour and then
when they change the date time picker
hour we set min dot our equal to date
time picker our value hour
now when we when we set me dot hour and
use equals what this is going to do is
it's going to call set for us so that
call set and value right here is equal
to whatever we put out to the equals so
we pretty much did meet our and when we
press D when we type equals it calls set
and the bivalve that is in here is going
to be equal to this value right here so
on go ahead and put this code in if you
haven't already if you don't understand
that you can go ahead and leave a
comment I'll try to answer any questions
that I can so thanks for watching and
stay tuned for the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
