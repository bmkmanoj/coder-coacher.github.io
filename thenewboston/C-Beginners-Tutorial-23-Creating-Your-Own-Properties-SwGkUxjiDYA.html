tutorial on making for learning Boston
and in this tutorial I'm going to be
showing you how to use properties so all
you're going to need for this tutorial
is a button a class that passes a string
to this constructor and under the button
one click you're going to want to have
you want to create a new instance of
your class and pass your name through it
for any name you want or any string for
that matter anyways to create a new
property you first don't want to type
the access modifier you want or your
property usually you're going to want to
have public but there are a few access
modifiers that we're going to learn
later on you may want to use instead but
for right now it sees public oops
for several private then you're going to
want to decide what sort of variable you
want your property to hold for example
you can put like string or integer bool
or something like that but right now
it's me strings because we're going to
set our property equal to the string
that passes through our constructor
right here and finally you're going to
want to give a name to your property I'm
just going to call it name because
that's what it's going to be set equal
to be set equal to my name which is what
we passed through here then you're gonna
want to put two curly braces down and
you don't need all parentheses right
here because it's not a nothing there
are two keywords that you're going to
want to know first is called get and
through detect get right here this will
allow the user to read from the property
the second is set so we type set down um
that will allow the user to write the
property or change the value of the
property and if we delete set right here
that will make it a read-only property
but you may want some cases
let's separate back there all right now
we're going to set on this property
equal to the string that it passes
through this class right here name and
then we're going to have it display that
property in a message box which box show
our class name dot name re and as you
can see right there that that little
hand pointing to the notepad that is the
icon for property and I'm sure you've
seen that before like kind of properties
panel right there all right and we don't
need a parenthesis right there like I
said before because it's not a method so
now when we debug we should get Adam in
the message box because we're passing
the string Adam through the class and in
the constructor right here we're setting
our our name property equal to the
string that passes through which is Adam
and then we're displaying that property
in a message box yep Adam all right so
that you can put access modifiers on
these properties or on this getting
Sarah here so default Lee if they're
same as whatever you set the entire
property to so since it's public right
here these are both public but say we
want to make this set private so we're
just go private in front of it and what
this will do is it will only allow the
user to change the value of the property
inside of this class and this is fine
right here because it is inside of this
class but if we try to change it outside
of this class if you MC equals and well
anything we'll get an error and it says
the property or indexer my namespace my
class name cannot be used in this
context because the set accessor isn't
accessible and the accessor that is this
get and set here and specifically the
set because that is the one was talking
about
so I'm going to go ahead and delete that
right there now if you want to make your
property read-only you're probably like
well how do I set the value of it
initially well in order to do that
you're just going to want to go ahead
and put curly braces right after your
get keyword and inside of here you're
going to want to return the value that
you want your name to be equal to so in
order for it to be equal to this right
here we're going to create a new string
up here let's call it my strength I
guess and we'll set it equal to what we
pass through right here so this string
right here is now equal to what we
passed see is constructed so then we'll
just return that string and now this
name property is equal to whatever we
pass through the constructor right here
and it is read-only so we cannot change
the value of it at all so we try to be
like name equals the name they test you
right here will be an error and it says
property or index or my name space top
my class name cannot be assigned to and
then it says is read-only there's
nothing like that all right so now let
me do bug here we should get a message
box that says atom because we're
creating this new string here then we're
setting this string equal to the name
that it passes through the constructor
which is atom and then it is returning
that string to be equal to this name
property so should get a message box
this is Adam yep
and you can do things with the set
accessor as well say you want to check
to make sure that the value that the
user is trying to set equal to your name
property is like a empty string or
something like that well in order to do
that you're going to want to use a value
keyword and what the value keyword does
is that is that is whatever you try to
set your property equal to so if it like
MC name equals and then like I don't
know go right here well this Jo is the
keyword value or value is equal to this
Jo it is whatever you try to set the
property equal to so if we want to check
to see if the value that the user is
trying to study to the property is an
empty string we just do if value equals
and then an empty string right here
we'll just have a message box to display
to the user saying that the there is an
error and you cannot do that so we'll
just have a message box say you can't do
that all right so if we try to set this
equal to an equal string right here
empty string right here we should do
message box saying you can't do that yep
can't do that
stop all right so that's pretty much it
for this tutorial
that's pretty much all you can do with
properties so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
