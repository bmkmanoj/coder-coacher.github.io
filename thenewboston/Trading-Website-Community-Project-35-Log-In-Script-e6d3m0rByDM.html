and in this video we're going to be
working on the login page which is
obviously the page that the user goes to
whenever they have their account created
they first opened their browser get home
from school this is where to go to log
in and start using the website so if you
notice the first glance the login page
looks a lot like this register page in
terms of a styling there's pretty much
an image on the left and form on the
right the only little things that are
different is the image is different in
the form it's the same style but it has
some different fields just the username
and password so the cool thing about
this is we actually don't need to do any
new styling but what we do want to do is
copy the style from the register style
page style sheet whatever you want to
call it so this is what I want you to do
go ahead and open up register CSS and
instead of using register CSS this
styling on login dot PHP what I wanted
to do is save this file as login dot CSS
now I know a lot of the time I say don't
copy extra code when you don't need to
but the reason that I want the log in
CSS page to be different than the
register does CSS file is because later
on I have a strong feeling that we're
going to be changing up the CSS for
login and register so I don't want to go
I don't just want to have a single file
I want to have two different files that
we can alter even though you can
technically just use register CSS in
here so as you guys can obviously see I
saved you guys a little bit of time
because we already coded all this stuff
you guys already know what everything is
instead of me doing repetitive stuff
over and over and over on every page I
just went ahead and I coated this page
real quick two different things that you
need to know our instead of registered
at CSS I link to that new login des CSS
that we just created and it has a
different image on the left hand side
the other one was like register banner
paying this one is login bannered upping
and this image is this login image right
here so again i know that i coded all
this already with
out you guys without me filming it but
it's the exact same form that we already
created the only thing is it says login
for a header and these fields the
username and the password there are the
exact same fields as the register dot
PHP page so like I said I'm not going to
waste you guys it's time in my time by
you know recording stuff that you guys
are going back oh my god we did this
like 10 times already so let's go ahead
and hop into the good stuff now the
reason I have this register dot PHP page
open is because we're going to steal a
lot of the stuff from over here instead
of having to code it all again so the
first thing I wanted to do is of course
and again I probably shouldn't mention
this like at the very beginning but I'm
working on the new login dot PHP script
so yeah but I should mention that so go
ahead and put your PHP tags and now what
we need to do is code the actual PHP
code that allows the user to log into
the website essentially whenever user
wants to log into your website our goal
is to set a session variable for that
user now if you're not familiar with
session variables then I'm going to
suggest you watch my PHP tutorials or
the ones PHP academy' made for me but
what it is is it's pretty much a
variable that stays with you as long as
you have the browser open for example
all of these variables right here
username and email right here as soon as
the user goes to a different page or
goes to a different website those
variables are going to get destroyed but
a session variable they can go to
different sites on your same web page
and that session variable stays with
that one user it has its own unique set
of variables so that's what I'm talking
about real quick example if you still
don't know what I'm talking about then
on again watch my PHP tutorials but the
very first things that we need to do is
we need to go ahead and start the
session and we need to include these two
files so go ahead hop over to register
dot PHP no sense retyping all that when
we can just cheat a little bit there you
go now the next thing we want to do is
check this out i'm gonna explain to you
guys something
the only reason the user would go to
this login web page is if they aren't
already logged in so the first thing we
need to do is test if they are logged in
if they already are logged in then they
can't login again we can't allow it so
let's go ahead and test that the user is
logged in now you know how I said that
whenever user logs into your website
then we assign a special variable to
them called a session variable well all
we need to do to test their logged in is
test if that session variable is set so
use our very handy is set function and
the variable is I don't think I have it
over here nope is dollar undersigned
session and the name of it is user
underscore ID so by default as soon as
the user comes this page they aren't
going to be logged in and that's our
goal to set this variable or give them a
user ID however if for some reason you
know they went to the login page and
they already are logged in maybe they
were goofing around on the website or
something then all we want to do is
redirect them to the page that they
should be at which is pretty much their
account page and they're paying account
page in order to redirect is location
account and we didn't make this page yet
we're going to make it probably in about
10 tutorials items active PHP now just a
little preview of what's to come this is
pretty much their main account page it's
what they should go to whenever they
first login it pretty much takes them to
all their active items so they can see
all their trades pretty much like I said
their account page so that's what we're
going to do first we're going to test if
they are already logged in and if they
are take them to their account page BAM
how simple is that so what we need to do
after this is pretty much handle the
form so this is how the login page is
supposed to work a user opens this page
when they aren't logged in yet and they
want to log into their account and they
fill in the username which is Bucky and
they fill in their password which is
password in the
submit which basically submits the form
and if all their information is correct
it takes them to their account so form
handling is what we're going to be doing
in the next video but for this video
that's all I got for you guys so the
cool thing is that if you guys are
saying oh crap more of this crap well
the awesome thing is we can copy about
eighty percent of the stuff the only
thing we have to change is this message
stuff down here but I'm going to be
worrying about that in the next tutorial
something guys for watching I'll see you
then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
