you is called the 180 degree rule and
I'll go I made up a little thing on
Microsoft Paint here so I could draw it
out for you so say your computer bursts
sorry say your camera starts out over
here on the left side of these two guys
talking so these are supposed to be
cameras not like pigs or anything like
that so that's your camera and it's
looking at these two guys having a
conversation this line right here
represents the 180 degree angle that you
cannot or you're not supposed to go
across so you can put it you can put a
camera here or here oh man my cameras
are terrible well you cannot put a
camera over here so you can't you do not
want to switch your camera over here the
reason why is because this is switching
from the left over to 180 on the other
side or over top of this 180 degree line
is jarring to the viewer and it's just
bad camera work and it's one of the
rules that you you just never do kind of
like how now you don't want to use drop
shadow when you're using graphic design
anymore so this is just a general rule
to follow by out pretty much all the
time so I'm going to demonstrate the 180
degree rule and show you why it's pretty
jarring
in in After Effects here so I'm going to
duplicate one of my cameras here I'll go
to the top view so I can see it let's
duplicate this one which is number two
put it on top and move it to the end
here
now let's rotate this all the way around
and I think it will be the y
I'm just gonna have to move it and then
rotate it around move it to the other
side
rotate this around
and it's taking a little long but there
we go and I'm gonna look through that
camera and we can see it there we're
almost there
now let's render this out and see what
it looks like okay I switch the active
camera
here we go
and we're looking at this and then it
switches completely to the other side
now that is jarring for viewers and if
someone's watching a movie or a
commercial or something like that and it
keeps on switching back and forth
between a 180 rule it's going to be very
annoying and might even give some people
a headache and that is not what you want
to do you want to make things that are
visually appealing so I mean just listen
to the rule you can look up the rule
anywhere else if you don't believe me
that it's actually a rule I can type it
in in Google real quick 180 degree rule
and I got Wikipedia right here there's
the rule so it's just a basic guideline
now hopefully you guys learned something
about animating cameras it's very basic
it's easy to do and just helps give you
some different looking shots in there
follow the 180 degree rule and thanks
for watching see you guys in another
