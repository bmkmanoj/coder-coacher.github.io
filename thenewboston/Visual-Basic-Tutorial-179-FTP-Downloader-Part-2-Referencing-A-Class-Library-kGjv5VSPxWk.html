slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to
continue working on our FTP downloader
now FTP stands for File Transfer
Protocol if you didn't already know that
so here is my project directory for the
FTP downloader it's in documents Visual
Studio 2010 projects and then FTP
downloader YouTube now you will have all
of these files here except for FTP
client vb d ll now I haven't talked to
Bucky yet but I'm going to see if it
will put this DLL file in the download
now this is a class library that has a
bunch of stuff that we can use with FTP
now this was created by a guy named
Howard with Howard Richards he is a
programmer for the he posts at the code
project a lot and now I'm not
advertising for the code project I know
that I don't actually use it myself but
I just want to get full credit to Howard
Richard for creating this class library
that we can use so we'll go ahead and
make - out of that now here is ftp
client vb now at the moment we can't do
anything with this dll file so what we
can do is open up a program called il
spy now what I'll spy does is it lets us
decompile
dotnet programs and class libraries now
I'm not gonna give you guys a download
link for this one you can search for it
on Google yourself but what we're gonna
do is we're gonna file open and let's
just go ahead and go to documents Visual
Studio 2010 projects and we'll do FTP
download or YouTube and here's FTP
client VB DLL and
you can see we can open this and it
opens up this right here in our menu in
its art class library so you can see it
has references which we don't need to
look at it has resources which we
don't need to look at and then here is
where all the code is stored so let's go
to utilities dot FTP so here is FTP
client now we can go ahead and look and
see what he has created for us to use so
we've got FTP File exists now it's
abilene and it returns to check and see
if an ftp file exists and it takes the
string argument which is a file name now
you may be thinking what is all this
typed in right here this is not basic
this is some other language well this
was written in c-sharp and if you create
a craft class library in c-sharp because
c-sharp runs on the.net framework you
can also use that class library with
visual basic programs in the same issue
the other way around so if you create a
class I'm very individual basic I
believe you can go use it with c-sharp
so this has a whole bunch of stuff in it
it just checks to see if the FTP file
exists and if it does it's gonna return
it in a true and if it does it'll return
false we can rename FTP files and we can
delete directories we can do a whole
bunch of stuff that Howard Richards has
added for us which makes it very easy to
work with the file transfer protocol so
we'll go ahead and close out of that so
now what we need to do is we need to
come into our FTP downloader YouTube
project we need to come up here and we
need to add a reference so we need to go
to project add reference and let's just
browse so we've got FTP downloader
YouTube right here and if you just click
this button right here up one level you
can see we have FTP client V B dot DL
and you can see that this accepts dot
DLL files so we select FTP client VB DLL
go ahead and click OK
and you can see that it adds a reference
in our project now nothing really
changed so what we can do is come up
here and click show all files and we can
go up to references and you can see that
we have FTP client VB under our
references which is a class library now
let's just go ahead and get rid of show
all files so in this tutorial I walk you
guys through decompiling our class
library with il spy so we can see a
little bit about what it does and how it
helps us use File Transfer Protocol and
then we added a reference to that class
library so in the next tutorial we're
going to start using that class library
to do stuff like update our server open
folders and other stuff that we have
already added on our GUI so thanks for
watching and stay tuned for the next
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
