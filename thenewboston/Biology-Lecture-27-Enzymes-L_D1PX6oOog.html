biology video and in this video we're
going to be talking about and zaimes
pretty freakin fun word to say now what
happens in your cell is your cells need
new chemicals they need new molecules
all the time in order to do different
things now whenever a cell needs a
molecule it either a has to find it
floating around the cytoplasm somewhere
B has to break down a larger molecule
and then it might use that smaller piece
for something or C it puts together
smaller molecules to form a larger one
that it needs such as you know maybe
it's forming proteins or something now
since all of these chemical reactions
are taking place in your cell what needs
to happen is your cell just can't wait
around for these reactions to happen by
chance because you know whenever your
soul needs energy or it needs to form a
new molecule it can't just wait randomly
for it to happen it needs to happen
whenever it needs to happen so that's
why enzymes come in handy now well
enzymes pretty much do is they act as a
catalyst and we already know that a
catalyst is just something in chemistry
that speeds up a chemical reaction so
then your cells pretty much have more
control over the chemical reaction and
they can make them occur faster rather
than waiting around all day for these
chemical reactions to happen naturally
and randomly so what enzyme can actually
look like anything in your body let me
just go ahead and draw this as something
with a unique shape so this is your
enzyme right here just go ahead and
label it now on your enzymes they have
something called active sites now I know
if you were to look at it enzyme under a
microscope it would it wouldn't look
like this but let me just go ahead and
draw a unique shape in active site and
this is just to give you guys an example
of what an active site is of course if
you look at it under a microscope these
chemicals would look you know it would
pretty much look like a blob of
chemicals like in you know whatever but
for this tutorial I'm just going to draw
is these two little triangles
anyways I'm getting kind of sidetracked
here an active site is pretty much the
area where a molecule attaches to and
whatever molecule goes right here that's
going to be the molecules that are
involved in the chemical reaction and
the enzyme of course is responsible for
speeding up whatever molecules are
reacting in the active site so say that
we have a random molecule around here oh
how convenient it looks like it's going
to fit perfectly in the active site so
this is our molecule right here and I'm
actually going to write substrate
underneath it now why did I write
substrate instead of molecule well
actually whenever we're talking about
enzymes the molecule that fits in or
attaches to the active site is what we
call the substrate so let me go ahead
and draw step two of this enzyme process
which would look something like this
this is the same enzyme I'm drawing but
now instead of an empty active site like
right here what we have is this
substrate and we'll say that this
substrate is like a type of sugar or
something it doesn't really matter so
now this substrate or molecule attaches
to the active site right here drive my
arrow right there so now our substrate
binds to the active site and what's
going to happen in step three step one
step two and this will be I'm getting
kind of crooked here but nonetheless
this is step three right here so what's
going to happen is you know whatever
chemical reaction takes place and I say
whatever chemical reaction because there
are a ton of enzymes and they're
responsible for several different
chemical reaction there isn't just one
enzyme in your body that's responsible
for speeding up one chemical reaction
there's a bunch of different types of
enzymes going to be talking about that
later on but it pretty much takes
whatever molecule this is whatever the
substrate is and it makes it react in
its own way depending on if it's
creating a molecule or breaking it up
we'll say that this breaks apart the
sugar into smaller I don't know maybe
glucose molecules so that's basically
what it does what it does
instead of having this chemical process
happen naturally the enzyme is
responsible for speeding up or
catalyzing the reaction so step number
four of course would be this it would be
your enzyme and the enzyme and this is
another key thing that you want to take
away at the beginning at step number one
and the last step which is step number
four your enzyme is always the same so
remember that your enzyme is always the
same at the beginning and at the end of
your chemical reaction your enzyme
doesn't change at all not chemically so
it's free to do another you know
chemical process catalyze another
chemical reaction so just remember that
whatever enzyme you started with that's
what you have to end with and that is
pretty much the definition of an enzyme
if this enzyme were to change then it
wouldn't be an enzyme it would just be a
chemical in part of a chemical reaction
but that pretty much is what it does the
final product oh oh sorry I got some
hair in my throat the final product of
course would be different because if
it's the same thing then it wouldn't be
an enzyme at all because it didn't
catalyze any chemical reaction but
basically that's what happens in your
enzyme process it starts with an empty
active site right here and the active
site is just where the substrate
attaches to so it can you know pretty
much catalyze the reaction as you see
right here and then once your enzyme
speeds up the reaction or catalyzes it
your substrate is going to turn into two
different molecules so you have your
final product which is different than
the original substrate however your
enzyme right here is the exact same as
it was whenever it started now just as a
little fun fact and this is going to
help you guys a lot whenever you're
trying to remember it so say that this
example right here was maybe four
I don't know breaking up a complex sugar
like this we'll say that this is I'm
gonna lactose and what we ended up with
is two simple glucose molecules so with
that being said let me go ahead and show
you guys an exam
of this anything that ends in ace or any
enzyme that aims ends in a se usually
gives a clue as to what the function is
for example lipase this would be an
enzyme that breaks up lipids or fats so
ASE gives you clue that it's enzyme that
breaks up something with lip that's your
clue in this case it would be lipids
fats another thing would be like this
example right here would be lactase and
this would just be an enzyme that breaks
up of course lactose and we already know
what lactose is from the other tutorials
but basically just remember ASE whenever
you see that then you generally want to
think that it's an enzyme in the
beginning part of the word is going to
give you a clue as to what kind of
function the enzyme performs so there
you go there's your real quick tutorial
on enzymes just remember that they start
and end with the same exact enzyme so
then your enzyme is free to go and you
know catalyze another chemical reaction
the molecule that bonds or attaches to
the active site is called the substrate
in the substrate turns into the final
product which is of course different
than the original
substrate so hopefully I didn't confuse
you guys too bad then guys for watching
and we can subscribe and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
