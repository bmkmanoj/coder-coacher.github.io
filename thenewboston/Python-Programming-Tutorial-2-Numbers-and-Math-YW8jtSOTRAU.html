second Python tutorial and then this is
ro I'm going to be talking to you guys
about simple numbers and some simple
math calculations in Python now on
Python you do it a little bit
differently than regular program
languages and remember we're still
working in idle the Python GUI so open
that and once you got to open you're
ready to go
so less surah I told you guys how to
make a basic output on a screen print
and in this tutorial I'm going to be
showing you guys the basics of working
with simple numbers and expressions so
the first thing that you can do is you
can use the GUI or idle is a calculator
so do something like two plus two it
will give you an answer you can also
subtract six minus three it will give
you an answer now you can do all these
simple things and another thing that you
can do besides multiplication itself is
simple division so go ahead and you can
do integer division 18 divided by three
like that but what if you try integer
division with numbers that don't divide
evenly like 18 over seven now this is to
point something but once you do that it
just gives you two and this is because
python is looking at your question 18
divided by seven and it says all right
you're asking me what injure divided by
integer is so I'm going to give you an
integer is the answer but we all know
that 18/7 isn't two so how do we tell
python to give us the regular answer
well since that answer has decimal
points we need to ask Python in decimal
points in a desperate decimal point
number in computer language is called a
float and how you do this how you get an
answer in decimal points you have to
include a decimal point somewhere in
your division so 18 point zero divided
by seven that will give you your answer
you can also do 18 point zero divided by
seven point zero and that will give you
your answer or even 18 divided by 7 and
just put a point
and that tells python that you want a
decimal point is their answer and that
will give you your flow answer to now
besides addition multiplication
subtraction and division we got a fifth
operation that comes in handy a lot of
the time and that's your modulus
operator and that's just the percent
sign now when you're dividing or
dividing you have this number right here
and you have a decimal point but if you
want to integer the modulus is pretty
much the remainder that you learn in a
high school or elementary school
whenever you learn it so 9 divided by 4
is 2 with a remainder of 1
so once you do 9 modulus for it's going
to give you the remainder which is 1 so
the modulus whenever you do that it's
just the remainder so what if you got
the modulus of something like 8 divided
by 4
what's the remainder vet it's zero so
whenever you press Enter
voila it gives you zero who would have
thought so you can even do one extra
thing I just want to tell you about you
can even get modulus of a float like uh
there that'll give you remainder eight
point seven five what's the remainder
when you divide it by 0.5 you have 0.25
left over so that's how you use the
modulus and again the modulus is just
the remainder of whatever is left when
it divides it by the let's see
denominator so the last expression I
want to talk to you guys about is how to
do exponents in Python and how you do
this six whenever you want to do
something like 6 times 7 just put six
star 7 it will give you the answer but
whenever you want to do exponents and
remember like something like a exponent
3 is 8 times 8 times 8 8 3 times or 5
exponent 4 is 5 times 5 times 5 times 5
so how do you do this in Python you can
either do this
six times six times six and you can do
that as many times as you like but
there's a lot easier way
say you want eight to the third power
all you have to do is type eight two
stars and then type whatever you want
the exponent to be eight to the third
BAM wham bam thank you ma'am and you can
do this with any um exponent you want so
instead of typing five times five time
time time time I said that wrong but oh
well just type star star five times
twelve BAM
that'll give you your answer and you can
also do this when your number is
negative as well so negative five
exponent four BAM there you go
so in this tutorial we covered basic
math functions and I also tell you guys
how to do modulus and exponent and those
are the basic math functions but we're
going to be using them a lot in the
future so that's it for this tutorial
thank you guys for watching hopefully
you guys now have a better understanding
of how to do simple math functions in
Python so again thank you guys for
watching make sure to check out the next
tutorial and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
