we have this polygon right here named
polygon ABCDEF the opposite sides of
this polygon are a B and C D a B and D
for for this side it's bc e d and f e
opposite vertices are just that they're
exactly opposite one another so a is
opposite C D is opposite a being the
BNF and diagonals are the line that you
can draw across opposite vertices so our
first diagonal goes from A to C
connecting those vertices our second one
goes across the polygon to D and up to e
be and D be in the B in there
C and F C and E those are all diagonals
of the polygon which are formed by
connecting opposite vertices okay so we
have this polygon and we're gonna name
it two different ways
so first we're gonna go clockwise and
starting with G
we're gonna start g e d x-- em a th or
we can go the other way starting with G
H T a m XD e so those are two ways to
name that polygon and you couldn't you
can name a polygon starting with any
point so I could start with D or I could
start with and it doesn't matter so name
two consecutive sides to G H and if you
go back to our first page I'll show you
what consecutive sides are these two
sides are consecutive sides because they
fall right next to another each other
this one is consecutive sides with this
one consecutive first vertices are the
same thing where the vertices fall right
next to one another
all right or vertices okay so going back
to our example this side right here we
want two consecutive sides to it so this
side falls next to G H and this side
falls next to G H so named two
consecutive vertices - oh that should be
you know so this one is next to this one
but it's also next to this one so now
lists all out sides opposite G H so G H
is right here opposite sides are sides
that fall across from this side so e o
falls opposite it and that actually is
the only one that's opposite G H so fret
number two will just write none so list
all vertices opposite oh so right here
well a is opposite Oh and T is opposite
oh and M
and that's it so now that we know what
the parts of the polygons are make sure
you come back and watch the next lesson
where we talk about different kinds of
polygons and what their official names
are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
