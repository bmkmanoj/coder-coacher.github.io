thirty sixty short tutorial that I'm
making for with a new Boston and in this
tutorial we're going to continue working
on our button control now in the
previous tutorial we made it look as
though our button is like a glass effect
well the only problem is since we have a
label on there and like cuts out part of
that like darker gray rectangle at the
bottom so instead of using a label we're
going to actually draw the text on to
our form so let's just go back to our
button and delete this label they're not
going to be using anything alright so
what we're gonna do is basically just
draw it you can you draw a string method
so we're just going to have string up
here with the store the string on the
fuser sets as this property value so
it's gonna say string let's call it
touch nothing and then or turn that
variable and then when you set fun text
equal to something well I could be
setting just text the string text equal
to something or equal to that value
alright and then on the location that
we're going to join the string will
remain the same as for so let's a point
and in case you're wondering on the app
basically just stands for float and it's
just a different type of point where the
two coordinates are floats and we just
need that in order to draw string so now
we're just going to be easy to draw
string methods are gonna say G draw
string first in the calls for is the
string that we're going to draw we're
going to be drawing this text right up
here so it's gonna say X and then the
font well we're gonna have to create
Bhagavan then we need our family so I'm
going to go and three family in the name
of the font that we're going
Arielle you can obviously change that
anything you want but comes to these
Ariel right now and now they have our
farm family set up and pass stuff up
through here and then the size of the
font that we're going to be on the side
that we're going to have our font be
I'll just make it aid that's like the
standard size alright so now we have our
font all set up we can pass font to our
pot that we created if you are a
drawstring method so that we have a font
to write with and then the brush that
we're going to be using is fast and then
the point F and as you can see it says
point out right there so this does have
to keep going out then we'll just pass
through a point we created so absolutely
all right now the only thing we have to
do is change the color of this brush to
black so that we can actually see the
tax authorities say has color this
equals color black
alright and we also have to mess with
these values right here so where does it
make it text link and this isn't perfect
but now it'll be close enough you can
always mess with in the future so now
the Builder here you see yeah the text
is just a little off-center
you can obviously mess that if you want
so we like subtract a few things are
going to attract like like five and
attract like five or eight years it's
not a perfect system but I don't know
it's better than nothing you can
obviously mess with that on your own so
now me debug here and see yep sex is
good now if you haven't change the text
property to something different like
hedaan we should see that on the forum
state change build here yeah yep hello
I'm Adam so yeah that's pretty much it
for this tutorial
in the next tutorial we're gonna change
the color when I hover over it and stuff
like that so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
