show you how to sniff traffic from only
one specific access point but before we
do that I want to show you guys a better
tool for changing your MAC address in it
is called appropriately Mac changer so
it's just I don't know a little quicker
and more convenient method and actually
I went to you know I ate some dinner and
I came back so I'm logged out logged
back in so all my cards are out of
monitor mode um you know I'm pretty much
back to basic so we need to pretty much
start from scratch again so if you go to
I W config then we can see that this
card right here it's in managed mode and
let me just clear out there so before
you change your MAC address using Mac
changer it's always a good idea to bring
it down so I have config and W LAN 1
just bring that down so now my card is
down and now in one single line type Mac
changer and it has 2 C's in it so don't
forget about that and right minus R and
then you write what card do you want to
change the Mac on so W LAN 1 now this -
our flag right here is just going to say
give me any random MAC address so I'm
going to hit enter and it says ok this
was your current Mac before you ran this
tool this is your permanent MAC address
and now your new one is this right there
so that just helps us staying anonymous
a little bit better and also a cool
thing about this is the first part of
the MAC address is actually the
manufacturers ID so now let's say that a
systems administrator saw the traffic on
the network and was like hmmm
something's weird from this MAC address
let me look up the manufacturer ID and
see if I can you know find their device
whether it's a Android or a tablet or
whatever where they're going to look it
up and they're going to say they're
going to see that the manufacturer is
unknown so they can't even you know
start looking for us now after we change
that we need to bring our interface back
up
and if we run I have config we can
verify that yup that is our new MAC
address now again this isn't our
permanent MAC address we can never
really change our mac address
permanently since it's burnt into the
card but to every other network device
all the other computers and the router
it's going to look like this is our MAC
address so they're not going to know any
difference so remember that's just in a
regular managed mode now so I just need
to check kill kill any processes and
just bring that I cannot type today w
LAN one actually I have this microphone
it's between me and the laptop so I have
to like reach around it to like type in
I don't know if I feel weird like I'm
trying to hug like a grizzly bear or
something whenever I'm typing and it's
kind of a weird you know metaphor or
whatever but whatevs alright so now our
card is back in monitor mode and what I
wanted to show you guys is this so you
know like before if I just do like a
arrow dump ng WLAN one Mon then what I'm
going to do is I'm going to start
looking at all of the networks around me
so it's just going to wait and listen
it's not going to send out any requests
is just going to listen for these
networks now if I have a lot around me
then it's going to start gathering all
that traffic all of those packets now
the problem with this is you usually
just want to attack one access point
like if some company hires you to go in
and see if their network secure you
don't want to start attack in every
company within that office building so
that usually isn't a good idea so what
you can do is this copy the bssid which
is the MAC address of that access point
and if you just want to target one then
run that command again but we're going
to add an optional parameter that's - -
be SSID
and then paste the MAC address right in
there now this is going to say is okay
we're going to listen for traffic just
like we did before but we only are going
to listen to it from this access point
so every one else is you know networks
all the ones that you don't care about
they aren't going to be spied on
basically so now I'm just going to wait
for this and even though it's kind of
hard to demonstrate because I only have
like two wireless networks around me
small town I know but uh oh no where's
my trusty old tablet all right so let me
go to all right boom there we go all
right so you know that my neighbors
network that was popping up last time
we're not going to see it this time only
the devices and this network that we
specified are going to be listed so
there you go make sure to change your
MAC address make sure to target only the
specific networks that you want and then
you're ready to move on to the next
