of inequalities and then we're gonna
learn how to solve in graph inequalities
so I don't know how many of you have
ever seen an inequality before but the
chances are you have so this symbol
right here is the less than symbol and
it's saying that whatever that's this is
both of these signs are like equals but
instead of saying that this is equal to
this they're gonna say that either this
is less than blank or this is greater
than blank so when your little point is
facing that way it means that this is
less than this and that this is greater
than this so now that we know that I'm
going to show you what a basic
inequality looks like where s is greater
than 6 and we always look at this
inequality symbol from the variables
perspective because we could write this
as this which means that 6 is less than
s but it means that S is greater than 6
so S is greater than 6 or we could say
that T is less than 7 and those are what
basic inequalities look like so when we
solve our inequalities if we're gonna
graph them and you always graph the
solution to an inequality on a number
line so when you have an inequality that
has less than or equal I'm sorry if you
have an inequality that's less than or
greater than when you graph it you're
gonna use an open circle and that's not
going to really make sense to you right
now but it would
in a minute when we go onto graphing but
if you have less than or equal to or
greater than or equal to it's gonna be a
closed circle and the most important
thing to remember when solving
inequalities is that if you divide or
multiply your inequality by a negative
you must flip your inequality so if I
had negative X is less than 2 when I
divide by the negative 1 I'm gonna get X
is greater than negative 2 that
inequality sign has to flip otherwise
you're gonna get the wrong answer so now
let's do an example 9 is less than 3
times the quantity of 1 minus s and this
is an S if you couldn't tell sorry kind
of looks like a weird 5 so first thing
we do we're going to do is distribute
that 3 over 9 is less than 3 minus 3s
I'm going to subtract 3 from both sides
and I get 6 is less than negative 3s and
we divide by negative 3 and negative 3
and when you solve this this is what you
want to think if you divide by a
negative if you divide by a negative
then you flip your sign so negative 2
and we're going to flip it is greater
than s so that means s is less than
negative 2 either way is correct so when
I said when we graph it on a number line
we're gonna graph it on a number line
that looks like this so we're gonna find
negative 2 on the number line which it
will be right here and we're gonna put a
circle
over negative 2 now remember if it's
just less than or greater than it's
gonna have an open circle and if it's
less than or equal to or greater than or
equal to we're gonna have a closed
circle so since it's only less than
we're gonna have a open circle and we're
going to shade the direction of the
inequality so there's two ways you can
remember this you can remember that this
inequality points to the left so I'm
going to shade to the left or you can
think of it more map more mathematically
and we're gonna put an arrow right here
because remember lines go on forever or
you could plug in a number that's on the
left of your circle which would be like
negative 4 well is negative 4 less than
negative 2 yes because remember as we go
as we get more negative we're decreasing
in value and then you would pick a
number to your right to make sure that
it doesn't work to your right well is 2
less than negative 2
no it's greater than negative 2 so
that's how you know that you were
supposed to shade it this way so we have
one more example that we're gonna do so
negative 3 times the quantity of 2m
minus 8 is less than or equal to 2
quantity times the quantity of n plus 2
so first thing we're gonna do is
distribute on both sides of the equation
so we have negative 6m + 24 less than or
equal to 2m + 28 now some of you might
say that well didn't we didn't we
multiply by a negative yes we did but we
don't flip the sign yet because we only
multiplied one side by a negative
it only affects your inequality when you
have to multiply both sides or divide
both sides by a negative so then I'm
gonna move with two M this way and this
is gonna be I'm gonna subtract um from
both sides so this becomes negative 8m
plus 24 less than or equal 28 let's
subtract 24 from both sides and I get
negative 8m is less than or equal to 4
so I'm gonna divide by negative 8 and
divide by negative 8 so since I divided
both sides by a negative number I'm
going to flip my inequality and if I
reduce this this becomes negative 1/2 so
we're gonna find negative 1/2 on our
number line which is gonna be about
right there and we're gonna put a circle
on it okay
so if you remember your rules for
graphing since this is greater than or
equal to negative 1/2 we're gonna close
this circle and fill it in because if
you think about it negative 1/2 is less
than or equal to negative 1/2 yes that's
true so we can fill that in and so you
can think of it two ways you can say oh
look my inequality is pointing that way
so I'm gonna shade in this way
and we can check it mathematically by
saying that plugging in a number to the
left and to the right well if I plugged
in negative 2 is negative 2 greater than
or equal negative 1/2 no is 3 greater
than or equal to negative 1/2 yes so I
know I shaded it the right way so that's
all we're gonna do with inequalities
today but make sure you come back and
watch your next lesson where we're gonna
talk about compound inequalities that
have more than one answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
