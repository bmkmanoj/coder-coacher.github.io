the first thing I did was I tried to
make a spear and I touched them with it
but it wasn't sticking in they got away
even if I hit him with it and then I
just tried using my hands and I usually
can catch frogs with my hands I remember
when I was a kid at my grandpa's pond
and in my friend's Creek I can catch
them easy but here these are like a
different type of frogs I think those
frogs are more used to people this
whenever you get near them they hop away
the last thing I did was I just got a
big branch and I tried clubbing them but
you can't even get close before they
jump away with that so I think the
planner right now I made a little fire
pit right here so I think I'm just gonna
try to boil water
make a fire boil some water at least I
can drink tonight if nothing else and
then if there's any daylight left I'll
probably try to catching more frogs or a
frog freaking bugs are terrible here I'm
gonna have to end up spending the night
here anyways I guess that's what I'm
gonna do now try to make a fire
it'd be nice to use the backside of my
knife so I didn't dull the blade but in
order to light it you need big strips of
magnesium and you can't get that with
the back of the knife and also to make a
spark whenever you rub it against the
metal
it won't do it with the back end so even
though I don't like to use my blade I'm
just using the bottom edge of it right
here so that way the top stays sharp
whenever I need to hopefully clean an
animal or sharpen stick or something
oh yeah that should be good now find a
spark gotta be careful not to hit it
with my knife
you should be catching though oh no
what's wrong
are you Oh God
try that again that's really aggravating
when that happens so I got these
freaking flies on my head okay
out here
this hastily crapload of magnesium on
there
there we go
there we go now with the small sticks
come on go be careful nuts mother
looking good
now that's been looking fire
no matter where I put the camera the
smoke always blows towards it that's
pretty cool now let me go ahead and get
some water to boil boil
that was the most delicious part yeah I
really really needed that oh man oh so
good
I think that's what I'm gonna do for the
rest of the night I'm not even gonna try
to catch any more frogs but tomorrow I
need to eat some food
something berries frogs minnows fish I
need to eat something
so I'm gonna get hydrated tonight rest
up here hopefully I can get a little
sleep with a fire should keep some of
the bugs away
and tomorrow morning move out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
