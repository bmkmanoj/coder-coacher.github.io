video and in this video I want to talk
to you guys about something called the
mido Condry up now the mitochondria is
another organelle in the cell and the
job of this organelle is to take food
that you eat and convert it into energy
that the cell can use now we already
know that your cell needs energy for a
bunch of different things and these
energy to do things like a move to grow
and in addition to that um sounds like
your brain cell they differ from your
muscle cells and your muscles muscle
cells are different than your stomach
cells but every one of these cells has a
specific job in order to keep you alive
so in order to you know do that job it
needs energy as well so like I said we
already know that cells need energy to
do a variety of things but how it gets
to energy is kind of a mystery that I'm
going to start to clear up in this video
so whenever you eat a piece of food and
let me draw a molecule food I guess
guess this is what a molecule food would
look like it actually is labeled food if
you look at it under a microscope I'm
just kidding but whenever you eat some
food then what your body does is it
needs to convert this to energy and
that's the job of the mitochondria so
we'll talk about this chemical process
how it breaks down the food but for
right now just remember that the
mitochondria takes this food and
converts it to energy that your cells
can use now obviously you aren't eating
constantly so if that's the case then
your body must store the energy in some
kind of way well that's what happens
whenever the mitochondria is done
breaking up the food and converting it
to energy it actually gets stored in a
molecule called a T P so ATP is just a
energy storing molecule
and we'll talk more about ATP in the
process that food gets converted to
energy later on but for right now I just
want to give you guys a big overview of
mitochondria so that's basically what
mitochondria the does and that's why
people say that mitochondria is like the
power plant of your cells
why is that well it's because it
produces energy not energy to let your
house or you know make your light bulbs
and computers turn on but it produces
energy that is needed for the cell now
again like I said actually let me go
ahead and draw a diagram right here
because you guys are probably issued to
know what mitochondria looks like and of
course I can't draw any diagram without
a nucleus it just bothers me for some
reason and I'm just going to go ahead
and draw one mitochondria and it's going
to be a little bit bigger than usual
usual and this is just to point out the
different pieces of mitochondria but
typically this would be a lot smaller
than this of course this mitochondria is
this green thing right here and
sometimes there are thousands of
mitochondria in your body but for right
now like I said I just wanted to draw a
really big one just to point out to you
guys the different parts of the
mitochondria so the first part we have
right here is the outer membrane so just
like a cell just like anything else with
a membrane outer membrane and this gives
the mitochondria the overall entire
shape of it now inside we have something
that kind of looks like this kind of
looks like a space alien and let me just
go ahead and color this in okay this uh
tablet I'm writing on isn't isn't the
best for coloring well this fluid in
here is actually called the matrix not
the movie actually it's spelled the same
as the movie and this is pretty much
just just think of it like fluid right
now so there's fluid inside the
mitochondria called the matrix and of
course the matrix has to be surrounded
by its own membrane and some people call
this the matrix membrane other people
call it the inner membrane it's more
commonly called the inner
membrane so the main pieces of the
mitochondria or are the outer membrane
which pretty much surrounds the entire
mitochondria the matrix which is the
fluid inside and the inner membrane and
the inner membrane is this right here
pretty much the membrane that surrounds
the fluid might as well go ahead and
finish this right there that's a pretty
freakin sweet looking diagram actually
so like I said even though I drew this
really big it isn't really this big in
your so I just wanted to point out the
different pieces there are several
thousand of these in some cells some
cells don't have that many it depends on
how much energy your cell needs we were
saying you know what wouldn't every cell
in your body need the same amount of
energy well actually no something's like
your brain cells your nerve cells your
neurons they really don't need as much
energy as something like your muscle
cells because your muscle cells are
always moving burning energy so they
would have more mitochondria than your
neurons or the cells in your brain</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
