slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
looking more at using multiple forms now
if you remember from the previous
tutorial we created an object of form 1
which is the default form that is
created when you make a new project in
Visual Basic but what we can also do is
create objects of other forms that are
inside of our solution so we'll come
over here to the solution Explorer we
can right click multiple forms and we
can add a Windows form so we'll just
leave it at default to form 2 VB we'll
select Windows forms and we'll click Add
so here is our form - let's just go
ahead and add a label we'll come over to
our label properties and we will set the
font to something a little bit bigger
than 8.25 so we'll set it to about 22
and then we'll set the text value of it
so the we'll set the text to I am a new
form and we'll just enter that ok so now
we can go come back into our form 1vb
and we'll just comment out this code
right here and we will create an object
of our form - VB class so we'll type
declare or dimension my new form as new
form - so we created an object of form -
which is to store it in our solution now
what we can do is type my new form dot
show dialog let's go ahead and run this
and see what happens so if we click show
new form you can see that we get this
form right here that says I am a new
form now you can see that it won't let
us change back to the first form because
we use the method show dialog now we can
change that to show instead of show
dialog which will let us switch back
forth between each one of the forms so
that we can change stuff inside of it so
go ahead and and click show new form you
can see we get I am a new form right
here and you can see that we can switch
back to form number one and form two and
we can use both of them and we can close
out of that one and then close out of
this one
but here's something that I wanted to
point out to you guys and that will be
learning how to fix in other tutorials
later on so if you go ahead and run this
you can see that if you click show new
form right here it shows a new form but
if you close out of this one it's going
to close out of both of them for you
that's because both of these forms are
running on what's called the same thread
now all programs run on a thread and
programs can be created to run on
multiple threads so that if one thread
has been ended the other threads won't
be effective I mean affected so let's
say you place form one VB on a thread of
its own and then when you create my new
form you place that on the thread of its
own so that if anything happens to the
form one VB thread the form the my new
forum thread is going to still run like
normal it's not going to be affected by
for money be closing now what we can
also do is we can set some values of my
new form so my new form dot and whatever
you see inside the properties right here
you can set that using code so we'll
type my new form dot text equals hello
so let's go ahead and run this and you
can see that if we click show new form
the text is hello now we can also do
that by using the name so we'll just go
ahead and uncomment this right here or
we'll just highlight it and then click
uncomment so now that we have our new
name and its text new new form name text
let's go ahead and set the title of that
of our new form to the text that I typed
into the box so we'll just type new name
right there so let's go ahead and run
this so if we type in a name right here
and click show new form you can see that
the name of the form has the name that
we typed in on the first form and we can
switch back and forth between each of
them so go ahead make a couple forms you
can have them do actual computing like
math problems and such so and practice
opening different forms creating object
of multiple forms in your program and
then once you've done that go ahead and
move on to the next tutorial and thanks
