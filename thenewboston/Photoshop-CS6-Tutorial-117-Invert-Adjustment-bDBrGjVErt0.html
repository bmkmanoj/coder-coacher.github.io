Blackford here with another Photoshop
cs6 tutorial today we're gonna be going
over how to use the invert command the
invert command pretty much if you apply
it to just your image it creates a
negative and by itself sometimes you
might be able to use it but 95% of the
time you're not going to want to use it
so if I just add the invert here if I go
to image adjustments and then come to
invert this is what I'm gonna get and
most of the time this this type of thing
was overused back in like the 80s and
90s maybe the early two-thousands so
nobody thinks that this is really cool
anymore I mean sometimes you can get
around with like if we change like and
put this guy over top or something like
that and made it something cool but
there's a way to use this in for command
that makes it stuff look really cool and
I'm gonna show you that so right now all
the invert command does is reverses the
colors and tonal values to their
opposite values and what it does is it
creates a negative so we get this so
what I'm gonna do is I don't want this
on here so I'm gonna undo Daan vert now
what we're gonna make is something
that's gonna look pretty cool and it's
gonna look like this and you can see
that looks a lot better than what I had
last time so let's get on with it here
now we've got just an image here and the
easiest thing to follow around with is
probably just a picture of like a
background or something like that like a
nice landscape with like something in
front of it it doesn't have to be a
person but in this image I happen to
have a person in it what you're gonna do
is you're going to use your selection
tool and I'm gonna use the magic wand
tool in here because there's a lot of
contrast and just start selecting the
person or the image and make an outline
make a selection around the person so
here I'm gonna start selecting things
now that didn't work there but as you
can see I'm just adding to my selection
I'm using the magic wand tool and
to get the fine details I'm gonna use my
quick selection tool here and make sure
it's on the ad which you can make sure
it is up here and just add in the
different parts and smooth things out
that's a little too much there and when
you're doing this you want to go in like
little strokes and so you don't have to
undo all your things every time you mess
up so anyways you do this and you bring
everything in so that it looks all nice
or whatever and I already have this mint
person cut out so I'm gonna deselect
well I'll have the selection let me put
the selection back on there edit undo
deselect so once you have your person
all selected we're gonna do is right
click on your selection and create and
say layer via copy and you do that and
it cuts out your layer so that you just
have the person so this is what I could
just created and this is just the person
delete the other one and the second
thing you want to do is create a copy of
your background so what we're going to
do is drag this down here and create a
copy and what we're gonna do is apply
the invert to it image adjustments
invert and it's gonna come out like this
alright the next thing we're gonna do is
change our blending mode from normal to
color and now we've changed it to color
now we've got something that looks
halfway decent if I back up we get we're
able to keep some of the brightness and
some of the tones in there they're just
on the opposite color now the person
looks stupid in this because the skin
tone is blue and everything like that so
that's why we cut the person out I'll
lay this over top we can see that the
person is in the picture and looks a lot
better the things that we need to fix up
here are if I am about this far and you
can see you can see the different blue
highlights and everything like that and
we can attempt to fix him up by adding
in like orange or highlights and things
so let's go ahead
do that so what we're gonna do is create
a new layer so let's just create a new
layer on the top it's empty and what
we're gonna do is we're gonna end up
painting in orange over top of these and
replacing the the bluish hue to a
different color so as you can see on the
shoulders
there's definitely blue here and then
blue in this little white piece here and
around the head and stuff like that so
let's go ahead and take your brush tool
here it's just going to be the regular
brush tool go ahead and go to the color
picker and pick your foreground color
and take a color from the environment
and pretty much the color that is going
to be affecting your person so
everything is orange so I want to select
like an orange color which I have now
the next thing you're going to do is
just paint over top of the edges of the
person here so over top of the edges
like this it and over anything that
seems to be like pretty blue that
shouldn't be so the edges here and then
pretty much the edges of his face you
don't have to be super precise and
that's good for now now we're going to
take this layer and we're gonna change
the blending mode to hue it's gonna
change the hue on the edges now if you
look at it compared to before so this is
before you can definitely see how the
blue and everything this is after not
not bad so if you need to you can go in
and paint over top of this and you can
see the different changes that are
happening it paints out the blue I can
paint out down here on the shoes around
the edges here where and you can see
that it's getting changed and it's
pretty nice adds more to the image when
everything's not everything is the same
color and the edges are nice and
blending in with the background so just
keep on painting over things that you
see that might need to be touched up and
that's all you need to do so let's zoom
out and look at our final image here and
this is what we got now we have a
totally different image from this one
right here turn everything off there we
go but solo this image so we have this
and then and then we can change it back
to what we just saw before so and there
we go so that's what we've got so thanks
for watching this and now you know a
cool way to use the invert command and
not just a turning things over and
making them negative and and having it
look dumb so use this to your advantage
in some of your pictures and images you
want to change things up in it but do it
quickly this is how you do it so thanks
for watching everybody hopefully you
learned something and if you want to
post your own negative conversions into
the Bucky's room photo or Bucky's room
forum where we talk about different
stuff related to photoshop and
programming and things like that and
I'll bring it up

then we've got our Photoshop section
down here and we're looking for some
good discussion and some looking on
looking at different types of work that
everybody does for inspiration and if
