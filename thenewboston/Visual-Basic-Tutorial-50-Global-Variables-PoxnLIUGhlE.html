slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
taking a look and private fields or if
you are learning this after learning
another language you could call them
global variables so let's go ahead and
get started we'll create a new project
we will select windows forms application
and we'll go ahead and call it just
global variables now let's go ahead and
add a button to our form by using the
toolbox and we'll just make it a little
bit bigger we'll set the text value to
global demo and we'll go ahead and set
the name to button global variable okay
so now let's go ahead and right click
form 1vb and click view code you can
also just press f7 so here's our form 1
class you can see there are no event
handlers yet because we didn't click
double click on anything in here to open
up the code we just opened it straight
up from form 1vb now what we're going to
do is we're going to create a public
field or a private field so we can go
ahead I'll add a comment here so we will
declare a variable that can be used
throughout this entire class so we'll go
ahead and type the keyword private this
tells the compiler that we only want
this variable to be used in this class
so we'll call it my num as integer and
we'll set it equal to 10 now I'll just
create a public one so we can do this by
typing public instead of private we'll
do my public num
as integer now we'll go ahead and set
that one equal to 32 okay so so let's go
ahead and click on the global demo
button to create an event for it and
what we're going to do is whenever they
click on this we're going to go ahead
and type message box show and we will
just type my num now you can see that we
don't get an error error here because we
declare these variables outside of any
subs or function inside of our form 1
class and we use the private keyword so
that only subs and functions inside of
form one can use it and access it and
now if we create another sub let's just
do private sub my sub if we create it
and we can set my num equal to 10 or we
can set it to a different one and it's
going to change my num which is used
throughout the whole program so we can
just go ahead and call my sub right here
and then we can copy this and paste it
so what this is going to do is first
it's going to access our global variable
my num and global just means you can use
it throughout the whole class it's going
to access that and it's going to give us
10 let's go ahead and just convert that
to a string
and after we click okay it's going to
call my sub which sets my num equal to
14 and then it's going to display that
new value and this whole time we're
accessing this one variable that can be
used throughout our whole class so now
if we go ahead and run this you can see
that if we click on global demo it pops
up a message box that says 10 we click
OK and it pops up a message box that
says 14 let's go ahead and close out of
that now I'll just talk a little bit
about my public num now when we use the
keyword public if we create another
class let's say we create like a forum
to class or something we can create an
object of forum 1 and access this
variable now this may be a little
confusing to you but that's fine because
we're not going to get into making
classes for a while so I'll just keep
that in the back of your head and you'll
remember that later now you can also
just use the dim keyword and what this
is going to do is it's going to be
private and it's going to let you use it
throughout this whole class so we'll
just type my public num equals 23 and
then we can go ahead and we'll type
we'll copy this right here now we'll
just go ahead and change this to my
public num when really it's private so
we'll just change it to private ok so
it's going to
it's going to display private num and
then after this my sub is called it's
going to be equal to 23 so let's go
ahead and copy this again and we'll
display it after my sub is called so
let's go ahead and run this
we got global demo and this gives us the
value of mynum
then we click OK this gives us the value
of my private num then we click OK we
get the new value of my num which is 14
and then we get the new value of my
private number which is equal to 23 so
for now I would just suggest you guys
use the dim statement or the dim keyword
instead of private or public because
that will just confuse you a little bit
more but I wanted to throw that in there
because it's something you need to know
for later on tutorials so I'm go ahead
get some practice with global variables
just use the dim keyword for now and
it's a very easy concept to understand
and once you got it down go ahead and
move on to the next tutorial and thanks
