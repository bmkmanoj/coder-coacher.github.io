welcome to another After Effects cs6
tutorial
I'm your host a buddy blackford and
today I'm gonna teach you about what
parallel light is and how it works so
first of all I'm just gonna bring up the
light in here and we're just going to
bring up change the light type to
parallel and I'm just gonna change the
color back to what it was and remember
that the last settings that you used for
your last light are gonna be the new
settings that pop up and your new light
that you're using so I'd like to set
everything back to what it was and a
parallel light comes out like this if
you're looking at it it's got a
different looking different looking
whatever you call it simple I guess and
it's a bunch of arrows that point
somewhere now the reason why this is is
because a parallel light is pretty much
like a flat surface that shoots out
light rays in one direction but without
the constrictions of the cone light and
without like shooting it in every single
direction like the ambient light and I
made this mspaint drawing so I could
explain it a little better for you so
we've got an ambient light here our
ambient or I should have right also
point so we got the ambient and point
light here where it's just going to
shoot out from all directions and I
haven't gone over the ambient light yet
but I will in the next tutorial but all
directions you can't control what's
going on then you got this cone light
here you can control where the cone
light is pointing and it shoots out
directions but it's restricted to the
cone the parallel light think of it as
like a square here and other programs
use a square and think of that square as
having a bunch of lights in it
just shoot out in one direction and you
can aim it and it's not constricted by
any cone or anything like that so it's
like using a combination of a point line
and a cone light our spotlight actually
I don't know why I wrote cone there but
spotlight so that's the that's the
drawing there now we've got the light
here and it has a point of interest that
we can animate or move around if we
would like to and I'll go back to the
options here and the options are the
same as the point light so you've got
your intensity here that you can lower
or you can raise I guess same thing you
can change the colors so I mean green
maybe he's in like looking out there
because World War 1 is starting and
you've got the green mood set you've got
the fall-off that's gonna be just on the
edges here and then you got your fault
distance of course just the same thing
where the edges are going to fade out
kind of like a mask feather so put those
back you can also cast shadows and if
you have it and I'll just teach you how
to catch shadows again in case you
haven't seen the other two tutorials
about lights so in case you're just
coming to see what a parallel like it is
I'll show you how to catch shadows you
make sure this cast shadows is checked
and we'll hit okay now I'm gonna bring
up an object so that I can cast shadows
with and I've got that there make sure
that the object is in between the light
and and the thing that we're wanna cast
shadows onto and it is
so we want to twirl down to these
options of this is the thing this is the
picture that we want to have the shadows
cast on we want to make sure it accepts
shadows and lights and those and those
are on and onto the item that is casting
the shadow we want to make sure we have
cache shadows on which is up here at the
top</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
