talk to you about the break keyword now
the break keyword pretty much allows you
to end your loop early so why would you
ever want to end a loop early and I'll
give you guys a really simple example
even though you probably would never use
this in real life say you made a program
to guess a number from 1 200
so it started looping through 1 2 3
cowan and the number that it needs to
guess was 14 well once it got to 14 and
it got the right answer there's no need
to continue the loop because you already
achieved your mission guessing the
number 14 so it pretty much saves your
program time and resources by ending it
early so even though that loop was
capable of looping all the way to 100 we
stopped it early because we're good
programmers and it's actually really
easy to see if I just build a simple
program so let me go ahead and do that
so the first thing we need is couple
variables a that's just going to be the
counter and for this sample I'll make a
for loop you can actually use this break
statement with any kind of loop while do
well but a for loop is going to be
really easy to see what's going on so
next thing we need is a variable called
how many basically what we're going to
do is we're going to allow the user to
enter a number how many times we want
this loop to loop and that's what how
many is going to be and the less
variable is max amount and we'll set
this equal to 10 actually let's go ahead
yeah we'll set it equal 10 why not and
the max amount is how many times the
loop is going to loop by default so by
default it loops 10 times however if the
user enters something else it's going to
break early so now what we need to do is
give them a little prompt on the screen
so they know what the heck they're doing
so how many times do you want this loop
to loop
they probably know what we're talking
about even though loopty-loop they get
it you know
we'll say up to ten all right and
actually another thing I want to do is
this I don't even want to add a new line
because things will be cool if they
enter on their answer right to the right
of that so scanf and we need to scan it
in which is course percent d and where
we going to store that ampersand how
many so what they did right now is
you're going to type in a number and
it's going to be stored in this variable
how many so let's go ahead and build the
default loop which is this 4 and we
start at 1 and we'll set it less than or
equal to max amount so like I said by
default this loop is going to occur 10
times of course just incremented by one
not getting fancy here
and what's this loop going to do let's
just do some stupid like print it out on
the screen so we'll print out whatever
iteration is on percent D and might as
well bump it to a new line be a little
easier to see what's going on all right
so again by default it's going to loop
ten times let's see if it's working
right now how many times you want to
loop let's just say to enter it loops
ten times okay so we need to add
something into our program to say hey
you need to check this number right here
because I told you to loop two times and
you loop ten times stupid program so
let's go ahead and do that and in order
to do that you need to add this
statement right after the print so just
add an if conditional and say okay if
this number right here
whatever loop you're on is equal to
whatever number they entered which was
how many
then break the loop now we'll break the
loop is going to do is it pretty much
says okay what loop is occurring well
it's this over right here before loop so
I'm going to stop that and then just
continue on to the rest of the program
which is pretty much just end the
program return zero so now let me run
this and hello what are you doing
actually let me get myself a little more
space so how many times you want to loop
this loop well I only want to loop it
five times so hit enter and there we go
one two three four five so basically it
got to this loop and it says okay so I'm
running this loop ten times because a is
less than ten so I'm going to run one
two three four five but then it got to
that five and I said okay I have to
check this right now is five equal to
the amount they entered well yes it is
so I'm going to break out of this loop
and again what break means is pretty
much discontinue this loop stop it so
that's why it never hits six seven eight
nine or ten because we broke out of that
before it can continue with the rest of
the loop now another thing I want to
mention is this what if the user enters
a number above 10 like 26 well again
this only loops ten times because it
never hits this conditional right here
right here a is only equal to one
through ten so it's never equal to 26 so
this loop never gets broken so that's a
way that we can have the user enter a
number and of course they understood the
rules up to ten they didn't follow them
so they got all ten so hopefully you
guys understand the break statement
pretty much whenever you want to end a
loop early or discontinue it just give
it the break statement and well that
ends the loop simple stuff thank you
guys for watching I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
