JavaScript tutorial and in this tutorial
I'm going to be going over something
called arrays now what an array is is
pretty much a way to store a bunch of
information in a single variable so say
you had a bunch of names that you wanted
to list out all you don't have to do is
type in one variable you get store as
many other pieces of information inside
that as you want it's easier just the C
as always so I'm just gonna start doing
it walk you through the process now
there's two different ways that you can
write an array the first way is this
first you have to declare your variable
and we'll call ours actually we'll call
it names and then you have to type a new
array and the word array has to be
capitalized
now all the values that you want to
stick in your array have to go in the
parameters so say we want our first name
to be Toni in our second name to be Mike
and our third name to be dan so now this
value this variable name has three
values Toni Mike and Dan
now you're thinking all right so how do
I actually get to the arrays and spit
them out on the screen well to do this
you need different kind of syntax and
that's using the square brackets so let
me just alert this so it pops out on the
screen and anytime you want to recall an
array you type in first the name of the
variable which are Z's names and in
square brackets I mean and in square
brackets you type in whatever number you
want so this is gonna be the four
actually the second element in the array
and I'll tell you why it's a second
although we took the one the computer
doesn't count like I mean you counts it
starts with a number zero so it counts
Tony equals zero
mic equals one Dan equals two so
although we have three elements that are
labeled zero one two so right now this
is gonna output the word mic so let me
save this show you guys what it looks
like
as you see our JavaScript now outputted
the word Mike
so again anytime you want to make an
array and store a bunch of values in a
single variable say you had a bunch of
names you want to list your the type new
array and then you would type the word
whatever words you want separated by a
comma
remember text goes in quotation marks
numbers don't so as you can see we now
have this syntax to write an array so
that leads us into our second way that
we can write or arrays if you wanted
just to type them out hand by hand I'll
just start again to clarify things first
we would declare the variable again
we'll call ours names that's gonna be
alright alright I'll type in new array
and we'll leave our parameters empty now
anytime we start to type in our our
array we could just set it equal to
whatever we want the values to be so at
first we write names and a square
brackets remember you start with zero
and then you type in the value you want
I think we had Tony for zero and then
you just go down the line and this is
the exact same syntax I should I thought
I had Mike
and of course
for our last one we'll just have a last
one in we'll call it Greg and this right
here is the exact same syntax that we
did before and it's just better so you
can visualize it easier so again if we
went down here and said alert and then
we typed in names and then let's do two
and we outputted this on the screen as
you can see the outputted Greg now just
experiment with these and you can see
that there's two different ways of doing
the exact same thing some people prefer
the first over the second I prefer this
method because it's easier to see your
variables and your values and arrays are
very useful when you have a bunch of
similar values and you want to stick
them inside a like variable so study
this and watch my next tutorial thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
