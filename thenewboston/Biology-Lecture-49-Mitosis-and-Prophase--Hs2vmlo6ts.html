49th biology video and in this video
we're finally going to start talking
about mitosis which is one of the two
ways that cells divide in your body now
the entire process of mitosis can be
split up into a couple main phases and
the first phase is of course called
prophase I draw that a little bit neater
prophase there we go right there
now prophase has a couple of different
characteristics so let me go ahead and
get drawing right here so here is a cell
right here and the first main attribute
of prophase is that the chromosomes are
going to condense or pack themselves up
into little packages now during
interphase which is of course the
portion of the cell cycle where the cell
is just going about its daily routine if
you were to take that cell and look at
it under a microscope you couldn't see
the DNA because it's so spread out so
loose however during prophase what's
going to happen is these chromosomes are
going to condense or coil up and as they
coil up into tight little packages
they're going to become visible if we
were to look at this under a microscope
now another thing that happens during
prophase is that the nuclear membrane is
going to dissolve or in other words it's
going to break down now this happens
because in order for your cell to divide
it doesn't need your nuclear membrane so
it breaks it down gets rid of it or
makes it dissolve now the last main
characteristic of prophase is something
called mitotic spindles are going to
form now think of mitotic spindles as
little bugs with arms and these bugs
like to pull on things so what's going
to happen is these mitotic spindles are
going to attach to the chromosomes and
eventually they're going to start to tug
on them or pull them apart so we'll say
that this is the beginning of prophase
and at the end your cells going to look
something like this at the end of
prophase so of course we have your
chromosomes in the middle which are
visible under microscope and we have
your mitotic spindles which are little
bugs and they're going to reach out
their arms
and they're going to attach to the
chromosomes so by the end of prophase
this is basically what we have so just
to recap prophase one last time is the
first stage or phase of mitosis and it's
when your chromosomes are going to
condense or coil up into little packages
and whenever there this happens they
become visible under a microscope and I
keep saying they become visible under a
microscope not not just because it's a
fun fact
but because whenever you're taking a
biology test your teachers like to ask
you that question a lot so just remember
if they ask you the stage is prophase
and another thing is the nuclear
membrane is going to break down or
dissolve because we don't need it for
mitosis and the last main thing I talked
about is these mitotic spindles or bugs
with arms is there going to reach out
their arms and they're going to attach
to the chromosomes so that is the first
stage of mitosis which is prophase now
we can move on to the next stage which
is metaphase</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
