and this is a video tutorial for the new
Boston in the last part we looked at
jQuery fade in where we faded it in an
image on our web page and we used a
callback function to say when the the
effect had completed in this tutorial
we're gonna look similarly at fade-out
but essentially this is going to do the
same thing but backwards so we have our
our display:none on our image now let's
go ahead into effect and actually get
rid of the majority of about all of this
code actually okay so we've got our
image that is not displayed at the
moment and we have our feedback div here
let's go ahead and refresh the page and
you'll see that we've got nothing on at
the moment now what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to use some event handlers to
create this effect when two button two
different buttons are pressed so we're
gonna create a hide and a show button
let's go ahead and create an input type
button and the ID of this can be show
and it's copy and paste that and we'll
do exactly the same thing but hide
let's give both of these a value as well
so we know which ones which
so show and value equals hide okay so
let's go ahead and preview the page you
can see that we've got this show button
and it's hide button when I click on the
show button
I want the animation to fade in and tell
me underneath when it's loaded and the
same with hired I want to fade the image
in and tell me underneath when that has
been hidden as well so let's go ahead
and over to our effects jas file we need
to reference these buttons to be able to
create an event handler for both of them
so with show and the same with hide so
the first one I'm going to do is show so
I reference show and then I say dot
click
and inside of this I need to create a
function and the block of code that's
going to be run when we click this
button so function I'll bring the block
down so we can work inside of here and
now I'm going to reference the image
itself which i've given an image ID of
image so let's go ahead and say image
dot fade in now I'm going to give the
fade in function two parameters the
first one is going to be slow in fact
let's just do three seconds and the next
is the callback function to let me know
when this animation is complete so
function and then a block bring the
block down and in here I want to add
some text to this image feedback div so
let's say hash image feedback dot HTML
image has been loaded image has been
shown okay so now that we've done that
we can go ahead and test our show button
let's click show let's just create a
line break so that looks a bit nicer or
paragraph I guess okay and we'll go back
to our browser so man we click show the
image fades in and then we're showing
this image has been shown in the div
that we created below so now we're going
to do the same for hide let's go ahead
into effect is so we need to reference
the hide button to see if this has been
pressed so hide dot click and inside
here we need to create again a function
with the block bring the block down and
we need to do exactly the same thing but
this time we are hiding it so image dot
fade-out so we're using the fade-out
function now which works in exactly the
same way as the fade in function we give
it the same parameters as well so we're
going to fade out a speed of three
seconds
we're going to create a function which
is our callback function and this is
going to put some text into the image
feedback div image has been hidden so we
can against a dollar and in brackets
sorry
image feedback and then dot HTML and
inside here image has been hidden so now
that we've done this we can go into our
browser and refresh the page we can
click show which will fade in this image
and we have the callback function create
this text in that div for us image has
been shown and then when we press the
hide button it fades out and we have
image has been hidden so these fade in
and fade out effects are extremely
useful for things like galleries
displaying images however you can feel
free like I said in the last part of the
tutorial to use them on any particular
HTML element</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
