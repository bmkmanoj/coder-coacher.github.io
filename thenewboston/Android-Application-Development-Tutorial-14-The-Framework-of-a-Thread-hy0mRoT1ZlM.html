Android tutorial and what we're going to
do in this tutorials work within our
splash activity basically we want the
splash activity to sleep for 5 seconds
and then open up a new activity
basically our starting point activity
and we're going to accomplish this by
using a thread now I want to show you
guys threads because it's super
important especially for game
development and what threads allow you
to do is do multiple things pretty much
at the same time instead of waiting for
something to get done and then doing
something else so I'm just going to show
you the basic framework of the thread
and use the thread to execute what we
want to do for our splash activity set
of a thread it's just basically like
every other variable we've set up we
defined what type it is and it's going
to be of the type thread and we're going
to call this thread timer because
basically it's going to be timer that
counts for five seconds and then starts
an activity now how we're going to set
this thread up is basically create a new
thread so we're going to say new thread
I know this is kind of a you guys are
probably like what's this new thing all
about just don't worry about that for
now it's kind of a Java thing and we'll
get into it later for the most part I
don't want to explain what it's doing
basically is just creating a new thread
think of it like that
so just say a new thread with
parentheses and then we're going to hit
an open bracket and hit enter and before
our code gets too sloppy because we're
going to have a lot of different
brackets and a lot of different somewhat
methods within this thread we're going
to finish off our thread definition for
the most part with a semicolon just so
we don't forget later now what a thread
is looking for is a method called run so
we need to set up this run method within
our thread that we defined so we're
going to save public in public is
accessible to everyone for the most part
public void meaning it's a method and
run with parentheses and then we're
going to set up a new pair of brackets
as you can see the brackets already
getting kind of confusing so I'm going
to try and keep them all on the screen
so you guys can make sure you're doing
this right now basically within a run
method we want any time we do something
sketchy
like if you guys ever wanted to go
streaking across a football game and you
know you thought that'd be awesome
so you're gonna try to do it but you
know sometimes it wouldn't work because
you get arrested anytime you do
something sketchy and programming you
also have to use a try bracket so we're
going to try to let our program do
something for the most part and that's
what this is going to do and if it can't
do that we're going to catch the
exceptions or basically if we can't do
the action that we're trying to to
perform most likely there is some sort
of error or an exception so we're going
to try and catch those exceptions and
use them for debugging so we're going to
say catch exception and basically to
catch exceptions you tell the computer
what kind of exceptions you are looking
to catch and for this instance we're
going to say intercept earth I'm sorry
interrupted air I'm sorry interrupted
exception what I was doing that's the
type of exception we're going to try to
catch and it's called e now within this
basically this catch again is trying to
catch these type of exceptions if they
pop up you guys don't really know need
to know what what this exception is for
the most part right now is this is
mainly for debugging so again put a new
bracket right here and we have to import
interrupted exceptions or actually it's
giving us an error because we aren't
trying to do anything so there's no way
there's going to be any any exceptions
but that will go away in the next
tutorial and there's where we're going
to try and catch those exceptions and
the last thing we can do is do a finally
method
so there we go within our run class we
have a try we're going to try to do some
methods or try to do something if we
can't do those methods or something runs
if our applications running too slow for
some reason it's going to catch the
exceptions and we can use that for
debugging like write a note to ourself
within here so we know which thread is
going slow or not working properly and
then finally we can do this method after
we've done that after we've tried
something we can do something finally
and yeah I don't know it's pretty ok
basically basically yeah this is our
last little chunk of code that we can
use if we want to try one last method
after we've done whatever we tried in
these brackets so hopefully that's not
too confusing we're going to set up what
we want this thread to do in the next
tutorial but after we set up our thread
it's still not going to do anything so
what we're going to do is we're going to
use our thread variable called timer and
to start a thread you just use the
method called thread and this arm sorry
called the start this is from the thread
class so we can use this method because
again it's a thread variable so we're
just going to hit start and then
semicolon and that will start our thread
again we haven't defined it to do
anything I just wanted to show you the
framework of how you set up a thread and
some of these try catch and finally type
things so thanks again for watching guys
I'll catch you in the next tutorial so
I'm getting kind of tired so I wasn't
super enthusiastic apologize so have a
good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
