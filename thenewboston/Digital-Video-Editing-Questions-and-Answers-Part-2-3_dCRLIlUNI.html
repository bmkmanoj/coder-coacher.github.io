fix all problems in the past and
progressive scanning is what they use
now so whenever you see something when
you're working with video or buying
camcorder that says like 720p or 60 I
that little letter at the end either
stands for progressive or interlaced so
it's not going to really make a huge
different when you're working with huge
difference when you're working with
video but just let you guys know that
interlace is kind of old and then the
feature all camcorders are going to
eventually be progressive or something
else if they decide that something is
even better than progressive but uh
those are what video frame rate and the
difference between interlaced and
progressive scanning means so I hope you
learned something thanks for watching
and make sure if you have any more
questions 2.a submit them to my channel
or just message me and ask me and I'll
try to answer them the best I can so
again thanks for watching and I'll see
you next time sup guys welcome to
another video and this video is actually
a response to the one of the questions
from one of my subscribers they messaged
me and asked me to talk a little bit
about compression and what compression
is when working with editing video and
what compression is pretty much a way
that software engineers they wanted to
take the huge files that camcorders made
and they wanted a kind of compress them
make them smaller file size but they
didn't really want to lose a lot of the
quality of video so um since file sizes
are so huge for video such as they can
be over 10 gigabytes for only 5 minutes
video and even higher with high def they
needed to come up with a way to compress
video and um if you want to know why why
file sizes for video or so huge it's
pretty much picky because each single
pixel on your video needs its own place
to store data wherever you're storing it
at so every single little pixel needs to
take up a little bit
memory and it also needs to take up even
more bits depending on what your color
ranges Plus on top of that you have
audio plus with the new high def
camcorders and stuff you have a huge
frame size so that's why the file sizes
are so big so what software engineers
did is they kind of came up with a way
to take your file size and press it to
make it even smaller without losing a
lot of quality the first thing they did
is come up with a way called spatial
compression and what this pretty much is
is instead of looking at every single
pixel they kind of took the frame and
look at it is a pattern overall and this
helped them by doing this instead of
looking at every single pixel this
helped them get a better idea and it's a
gave him a more overall image in it made
less data and it also makes major
computer work a lot less in a lot easier
