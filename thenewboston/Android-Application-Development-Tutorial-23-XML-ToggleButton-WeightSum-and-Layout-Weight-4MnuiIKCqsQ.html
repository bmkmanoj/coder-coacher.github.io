Android tutorial for the new Boston
we're going to do in this tutorial some
more XML show you guys you know some
more cuts customized features that you
can use and methods and also some other
widgets that we can throw in there so
what we're going to do first is
basically go into your graphical layout
and use a toggle button I'm going to
show you guys how to use this we're
going to throw this in between our
textview and our button so right there
and then what we want to do is have this
toggle button on the same line this this
button is so now we're going to define
it in the in the Android XML here so I
realized the last tutorial I was saying
control shift format and it's actually
control shift F so that's what you guys
want to do or command shift F if you
guys are on a Mac so then just format it
and then what we want to do like I said
is get that toggle button on the same
line as our regular button so what we
can do is set up a new linear layout I'm
just going to kind of separate those two
so we have some working room and we're
going to set up a new linear layout
that's going to be horizontal so those
buttons are next to each other so what
we're going to do is a greater than sign
linear layout which you guys should be
pretty much familiar with then we're
going to use our closing statement cut
it and paste it below our button in our
toggle button so there we go now what we
need to do is set up kind of the linear
layout what we want it to be what we
want to cover so we're going to say
Android layout width and we're going to
set that equal to fill parent and
Android layout height is going to wrap
the content the only other thing we
really need to define right now is the
Android orientation we're going to set
that equal to again horizontal there you
go and now let's check it out looks
pretty good but what's happening is
again it's pushing that toggle button
off the screen because our button is
filling the parent now I'm going to
introduce you guys something called
weight sum and weight so what we need to
do first is make sure since this is a
horizontal view and that's what we're
going to work with is basically the
width of both objects so the first thing
we want to do is sit both the widths to
fill parent now it sounds kind of
strange because you know it's not really
going to change anything but we're going
to say fill parent and if we check it
out nothing really changed but now what
we can do is we can apply some like a
total weight value within this linear
layout we're going to hit control shift
F again kind of format okay that's that
didn't turn out the way I thought it was
but um basically we can add a weight sum
up here within this linear layout then
we can distribute some of the weight
within each item and it will take up
kind of a percentage of what's available
and since our the whole width is
available that's what it's going to
distribute so how we're going to set
that up is we're going to go into this
linear layout where we define some stuff
and we're going to set up the total
value so we're going to say Android
weight sum is the command and we're
going to set it to something like 100
because 100 is pretty easy to work with
then you can kind of give them
percentages now we're going to go into
our first item our button here and we're
going to give it a weight value so we're
going to say Android and it's actually a
layout weight value so that's why we had
our layout width fill the parent because
that's what that's what the percentage
is going to go
the layout so we're going to say layout
underscore weight we're going to set
this equal to 50 just to start with and
then we're also going to define 50
percent or you know 50 value for a
weight because we want our total weight
to equal 100 so 50 plus 50 is 100 again
free math lesson for you guys let's
check that out there we go we kind of
have them both set up for the most part
to get it to 50 percent of the whole
available width so they're there that's
kind of the introduction to the weight
value but and how weight sums work and
all that great stuff but the only other
thing is you'd assume like 75 percent or
if we put like 75 here and 25 here that
the 75 would have a greater distance but
it's actually the opposite so we're
going to say the button is going to have
like 20 and the button toggle button is
going to have 80 so if we check that out
that's what it's going to look like
basically this has 20% even though we
defined it as 80 having a weight of 80
and this is a we've set as 20 it's going
to have 80% of the whole width so there
we go one last thing I'm going to well I
might as well do that in the next
tutorial think I'm running out of time
here but cut you guys then and we're
going to work with some XML real quickly
in the next tutorial have a good one
