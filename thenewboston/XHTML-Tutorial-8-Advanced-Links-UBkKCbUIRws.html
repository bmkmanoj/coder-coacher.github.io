eighth tutorial on XHTML last time we
learn about making a basic link we
learned that all links begin with the
opening a tag and end with a closing a
tag we also learn that your website name
that you want to link two goes into H
ref attribute in between the quotation
marks and we also learn that one to
linking one of your pages to another
page on your same website that you don't
need to http www HDM l and the last
thing that we learn is when you want to
open a website in a new window that you
have to use the target attribute and set
the value to underscore blank and some
tips for links is always name your
websites in lowercase this will make it
a lot easier when you're drawing the
coat it into your text editor and it'll
save you a lot of confusion when you
don't have to remember what you put
uppercase and what you didn't and
another tip is to keep all of your web
sites in the same location don't put one
under your hard drive and one under your
desktop and one under your favorite
pictures folder keep them all in the
same folder or all in the same location
now let's get rid of that and start your
learning something new on some websites
you see a link that you click in your
email program automatically opens up and
wants to start writing an email so
here's how they make those links of
course like any other link you begin
with your a
h RF equals instead of typing and
address of a website type male 2 colon
and type the name or the address of
anyone's email address so i'll type
staff at the new boston calm because
that's my end it with quotation marks
and type e-mail me here and then you end
it with an end anchor tag so now if we
save that and take a look at it an
Internet Explorer you'll see that when
you click this that automatically your
email program see mine is my default is
Microsoft Outlook it automatically opens
and it wants to start writing an email
now this is how when people make the
links I'll just close out of this and
this is how when people make links that
you click on in your email program pops
up that's how you do that it's useful if
you want to include your email address
on any of your websites so let's apply
this the something that we would
actually make on a website let's say we
want it to make a section of our
favorite websites so we would first make
a heading called favorite sites
end it with a heading size 2 and under
it we might put a link to youtube it's
everyone's favorite site so type a href
equals quote in quotation marks HTTP
colon ww youtube com end it with
quotation marks and we'll type YouTube
right here and end it with an anchor tag
of course and say you wanted to make
another link to ebay so you type your
opening anger tag href equals and type
in ebays website in the quotation march
marks eBay
and you end up with quotation marks and
just type ebay right here and of course
you end it with the end anchor tag so
now we have a heading our favorite
websites and we have a link to youtube
and ebay underneath it and say we wanted
to make another link that has our email
so let's put another heading heading
number to close it put email and make a
closing heading tag and under it if you
want it to make an email so people could
click an email you you're right a h ref
equals in quotation marks male 2 colon
and then type your email address end it
with quotation marks and then you can
put email mean here that's what that's a
very common thing and you can end it
with your end anchor tag so now we have
a heading 2 links to our favorite
websites in a place where people can
email us so let's save it and take a
look
and as you can see we have our favorite
sites heading to links to some of our
favorite sites and under email people
can click on it and they can email us
easy with one click now this is a very
basic use of a very simple website if of
course you can format it to look a lot
better than this but this is a basic
idea and it will give you a basic
structure of how to include links on
your website and in the next tutorial
we're going to be introducing a very
important element of a web page design
called tables and if you're not already
there you can go to WWE new boston calm
and check out all the information i
talked about today thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
