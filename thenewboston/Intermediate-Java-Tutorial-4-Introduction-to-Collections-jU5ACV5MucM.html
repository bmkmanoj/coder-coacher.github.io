to your fourth I think intermediate Java
tutorial and in this tutorial we're
going to be going over collections and
if you are a fan on my channel you've
been keeping up then you notice that yes
I finally did get my screen recorder
back so I'm ready to begin making a
computer tutorials finally again after
like a month so anyways like I said in
this tutorial we're going to be going
over collections and what a collection
is is the best I can explain to you guys
is it's a lot like an array and that it
holds stuff and the actual definition is
it holds references to other objects but
anyways like an array it holds stuff but
unlike an array it's dynamic internal a
you have to give it or usually give a
number of how many items you want to
hold a list or a set in these are types
of collections you it's dynamic you
don't have to give it a number it can
just change by itself so that's cool
thing about a collection again like I
said there are different types of
collection there's in just one main
collection there's a set for instance
and what a set does is it's like a list
but it can contain dupe clips a list
obviously can contain duplicate items
and you know what I just figured this
out it's probably going to be a lot
easier just for me to demonstrate what
this is so let's go ahead and get
started on this program we're going to
be building an array of things so I'm
going to make um just type in like four
things strings eggs um lasers I'm just
typing the first four things popping in
my head hats and let me look around a
pie there's a pie sitting on my desk
right now believe it or not and by the
way about eggs well my girlfriend did
for me for Valentine's I early
Valentine's Day
I just bought a dozen eggs and the next
day I went to open them up open up the
egg container and there were worth 12
Cadbury eggs in there instead of regular
eggs and you know what I wasn't really
disappointed about that but I couldn't
make my omelet
so anyways now moving on let's go ahead
and put lists and here is our creation
of lists
what you need to do when you create a
list is you need to tell it what type of
data you're going to pretty much be
putting into a list and that's this is
just so you can allow Java to process
the data correctly so we're going to be
putting a string in oh by the way you
use this a little less than and greater
than signs this is actually casting to
the data but anyway it's not important
right now you'll figure it out
equals new array list and if and if you
see stuff like new ArrayList and stuff
like that I imported all that it's in
Java util so if you're saying all right
words this come from and it's into the
program don't forget to import it
obviously and go ahead and cast this
again because you know it likes do
everything twice and put your
parentheses so now you have an array of
string and I forgot to name it things
when I was thinking about my eggs and so
now we have an array of things and also
a list that's blank so what you want to
do is make a little comment add array
items to list and we'll do that with the
enhanced for-loop string name X and we
want to loop through the array things
and what we want to do is let's name is
the list one for list one we want to add
oh it already popped up for me X and
what this is going to do is it's going
to loop through this entire array again
this is just an enhanced for-loop
nothing we didn't learn before and for
each array item it's going to add that
item which is X to the list so now our
list has four strings in it eggs
lasers hats and pie so let's go ahead
and make another list real quick and
let's go ahead and put string and we'll
name this array more things and what
we're going to be doing is go ahead and
set this equal to the two things or any
two things inside here I'm going to set
mine equal to lasers and
hats and what we're going to be doing in
this program is saying we're going to be
running a check we're going to say
alright if this list contains anything
in this list then take it out I mean
just a real simple example demonstrating
the properties of lists and things you
can do with it so let's go ahead and
make another list just same as this one
actually we can just go ahead and copy
this because we're lazy and we go ahead
and change it to list number two
relative strength good so now that we
got that taken care of let's see what we
need to do we need to add array items to
list just like this wow this is a little
too easy I'm getting a little too lazy
right here so paste string change this
up don't want it same thing so for
string Y let make sure I got it right
and you want to look through more things
so what we're going to do this time is
loop through this array which is a short
little array lasers and hats and for
every item we come across we're going to
want to add it to list - good thing I
explained that or would have forgot it
so now just to make sure our lists are
right let's go ahead and let's go ahead
and print them all out and then I'll
probably end the tutorial so here's how
you print out wow that's embarrassing
for int I equals 0 and then just put
like I is less than list 1 dot size and
yes let's have properties just like a
race and then just go ahead until I plus
plus so now what we're doing is looping
through the entire list one manually
right here
system.out.print F so print format the
format is going to be percent string
with a space and that string is going to
be let's see do you want to loop through
one or two
let's do list one get I so now let me go
ahead and make sure this works and then
I will demonstrate it so list 1 is
populated with eggs
lasers hats and pie
and this to this to make sure that this
is a there we go
lasers and hats so what we did right
here is we set all right take the size
of whatever list and loop through it
just a basic for loop and for each item
you need to get the item that's
currently at according to the index and
by the way that's how you reference item
unlike arrays you just put get I and
then just print it out so in the next
tutorial we're going to be doing is
building a function to take what's in
list number two which is lasers hats and
delete it from list number one which is
eggs lasers hats and pie and I'm going
to probably eat another Cadbury egg so
thank you guys for watching don't forget
to subscribe and I will see you next
