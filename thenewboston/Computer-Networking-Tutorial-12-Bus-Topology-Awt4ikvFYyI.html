to another amazing computer networking
tutorial and in this video I want to
start talking to you guys about
topologies or some people just call it
the layout of your computer network now
of course by topology or layout I
basically mean how you're going to set
up your network how you're going to
connect are your computers how you're
going to you know lay them out connect
the wires to them because whenever you
first design a computer network there
are many different ways that you can lay
it out around your house or office you
just don't want to throw your computers
in any room start connecting everything
with the wires or else it's probably not
going to work now I'm going to be going
over some very common layouts or
topologies some of the most common ones
are what I'm going to be going over in
this video is called bus and you also
have ring a star mesh and there are
different common layouts and each one
has its benefits and they also have
their drawbacks mostly depending on how
much traffic you have and a couple
things that you want to take into
account whenever you first design a
computer network especially if you're in
the business of designing a computer
network is one major thing is cost how
much are these devices going to cost you
know arm how much is the setup fees so
on and so forth and another thing is the
ease of maintenance now as you're going
to see whenever I start drawing these
diagrams some are very simple like the
bus one I'm about to draw and some are
rather complicated and the more
complicated they are they're a lot more
difficult to maintain so again those are
just some very starting ideas if we
never laid out a computer network before
taking into account the cost in the ease
of maintenance so now let me go ahead
and show you guys a diagram I'll shut up
now and I'll talk about a very simple
bus topology now bus topology kind of
looks like that it has one main cable so
this is you know what to say it's the
Ethernet cable or something like that
and it's kind of like a long chain and
all of your devices are going to be
connected along the way so you might
have I don't know let's say you have
desktop or but you say you have a PC
II write here and we'll put another PC
over here and let's see limp ick a new
color um you know maybe we have a Mac
Mac book or you know iMac whatever and a
laptop over here so basically all of
these things are going to be connected
to the main backbone or the main chain
now of course since this is computer
networking we might as well throw in you
know a server will say that this is an
office or you know like a work I don't
know or a home or something like that
and we'll also put printer in here why
not all right so all of these devices
all of these computers are sharing the
same printer in the same server and as
you can see they're all connected the
same major backbone now another thing I
want to point out is whenever you have a
bus topology you need something special
and those are called terminators so I'll
just write T for terminators T T and
these are actual devices that you can
buy and you need to put them on the ends
of your cable now the reason that you
need these terminators right here is
because well I'll talk to you guys about
how these devices work so of course if
you guys know whenever you send out a
signal say the PC right here wants to I
don't know request something from the
server it sends it out along this cable
right here but since you know there
aren't any you know smart devices which
you're going to be talking about later
on this signal is going to go to every
single node or every single one of these
devices now of course if this computers
network is set up successfully due to
protocols and so on and so forth the
server is going to be the only device
that responds so that's what allows this
PC and this server to communicate
effectively with each other because even
though it's sending out the signal
everywhere only the server is going to
be aware that okay I'm actually the
device that it wants to talk to now I
can go ahead and transfer files back and
for
so on and so forth now that brings up my
next point that is why you need these
terminators right here a terminator is
basically a device that whenever you
have these signals going to the ends of
the cable you can actually have
something and I won't go into detail but
the electric signal can actually bounce
off the ends of the cable in mirror back
so let me go ahead and pick a color like
yellow
if this server right here was sending
out a signal if it didn't have this
terminator right here the signal could
actually go to the end of the wire
bounce back and be resent along the
cable again which is of course not a
good thing it would make it look like
there are many different messages being
sent at once so that's basically why you
need a terminator to absorb the signals
at the end so they don't get mirrored
back now let me go ahead and talk about
the good part of this network this is
very easy to set up it's good for small
home networks or offices and another
thing is it isn't very expensive it's
very cheap there isn't a whole lot of
cable that you need on one of the
drawbacks from a bus topology is that it
can break very easy for example if this
terminator right here if that breaks
then pretty much you're going to have a
lot of mirroring and your electric
signals are going to confuse all of your
devices and another thing is if you have
one split in the cable let's say right
here then of course this entire side is
not going to be able to talk to this
entire side and also you're not going to
have a terminator right here and you
have a whole bunch of problems with this
layout so even though it's really cheap
and I want to say it's decent for like a
small home or a small office
overall I would not recommend it because
this is a really old topology and if
this is your first network then go ahead
and set it up like this but overall I
wouldn't recommend it because it's old
outdated and you have better choices but
just to go over you know a very simple
topology this is probably the easiest
one so anyways I'll shut up now thank
you guys for watching in in the next
tutorials I'm going to be showing you
guys you know a ring a star a mesh
layout and you guys are going to see the
benefits of this in
me much better definitely more exciting
something guys for watching by the way
make sure to follow me on Facebook and
I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
