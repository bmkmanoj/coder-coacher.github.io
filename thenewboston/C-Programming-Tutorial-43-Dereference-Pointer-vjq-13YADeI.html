exactly what pointer is I'm going to go
ahead and show you a cool trick that you
can do with pointers and this program
right here is the same exact thing I
just deleted some extra lines and move
some things around but it's the same
thing I taught you guys in last Sorrell
what I did in this line is make a
variable then I made a pointer and then
I printed out the variables information
and then the pointers information so
again like I said I just cleaned it up a
little bit because the last program was
kind of messy but all that stuff right
there so what I wanted to teach you in
this tutorial is how to dereference a
pointer essentially it's actually
probably easier if I just uh print it
out and show you guys because you know
just me trying to talk talk to you about
memory addresses you're like what so
make a print statement and then type
this code so actually let me stick this
in between two new lines so right here
what I want to do is press ampersand P
tuna and that's just literally going to
print out this right here and after this
put a colon and press % D now that % D
value is what I'm trying to display in
this tutorial so again the new thing
that I'm going to be printing out is
this right here
ampersand P tuna and as you can see
whenever I print this out it prints out
the value of 19 pretty weird
so what ampersand does whenever you add
this special symbol before the pointer
variables name is it's called D
referencing a pointer now what it does
is it essentially says okay you want me
to dereference p tuna so I'm going to go
to the variable that I'm pointing to
which is this right here tuna or this is
the address and get the value of it so
again whenever you dereference a
variable it goes to the variable that
appoints to and it gets the value of it
so if this ampersand P tuna is equal to
19 does that mean this that ampersand P
tuna that equals 19 and also the regular
tuna variable up here we also saw that
that equals 19 does that mean that this
is essentially the same thing is this
well indeed yes it does so these are
pretty much two different ways that we
can access the value of the variable we
can dereference its pointer and access
it and we can also just use the regular
variable name and access it so with this
new information that we learned let's
set this equal to a new value 71 and
print it out again copy print this out
and we can actually just print out tuna
doesn't even matter
so tuna tuna let me run this and check
it out so this was all the old stuff and
this is when we just printed it out the
first time which I showed you guys and
last time we ran this and then after
this we took ampersand so I forgot to
get rid of this we took ampersand P tuna
which essentially dereferenced it and
set it equal to 71 so that's why this
ampersand P tuna which is dereferencing
the variable and tuna are both now equal
to 71
so again probably I'm going to delete
this line before I post the source code
on my forum but again the one last thing
you have to take away from this tutorial
is you can use this special ampersand
sign to dereference a pointer why they
named it dereference i don't know they
just want to be confusing but what the
references a pointer means is basically
go to that variable and get the value of
it so you can either get the value of
variable this way be it by dereferencing
a pointer or just using the
old-fashioned way which is using the
variables name so if we can just use the
variables name like before why wouldn't
we just always do that
why we need to do this new special dumb
symbol well in the next tutorial I'm
going to be showing you guys something
cool about arrays and after that I'm
going to shown you guys how you can
actually dereference pointers and do
something useful with them other than
just putting gram knowledge in your
brain so for now thank you guys for
watching if you have any questions ask
me on my forum and well stick around and
you guys are going to see what's up with
these cool things see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
