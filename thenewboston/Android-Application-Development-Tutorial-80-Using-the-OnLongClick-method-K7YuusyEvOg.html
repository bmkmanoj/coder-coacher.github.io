Android tutorial for the new Boston
we're doing this tutorials basically set
up a non long click listener I'm not
sure if we I don't think we've done that
before so that's what this tutorial is
going to do the on long click list
listener it can be used for buttons but
since this sound stuff class only has a
view we're just going to set the on long
click list interview to this as well so
we're gonna do is we're just gonna set
on long click listener and hit that and
then we're just gonna you know say this
as well and then we're gonna implement
or
basically let sound stuff our class
implement the on long click listener as
well so again just puts a comma on line
click listener and then we're just gonna
say add unimplemented methods and down
here is our online click listener now
what we're gonna do is we're going to
set up a media player variable or object
as well we're gonna call this MP and
then we're gonna set this equal to Media
Player dots create context this and
resources are dot ID dot I mean our dot
what what what's going on I'm sorry r
dot raw dot and then our background
music and again we're just gonna set
this variable so our whole class are all
of our methods can use it we're just
going to cut that and do NP here and
then setup our object above the oncreate
method so there we go we basically set
up a media player as well and now we're
gonna do is we're just gonna say MP dot
to start down here and we're basically
good to go I mean now when with
basically what this on long click is is
if we click and hold for like a second
or something I don't I don't know the
exact time it's gonna call this on long
click method instead of this on click
method in getting this complete be
applied to buttons and all that other
stuff as well
and again the difference between the
media player and soundpool is the sound
pool will allow it to basically be
loaded into memory whereas you know the
other way it's going to kind of stream
it's going to take a while so the again
the sound pool is your short clips that
can be played quickly and effectively
and that's what you're going to use
sample for whereas you want a longer
background sound you're gonna use the
media player so again nothing too new we
set up a media player and this online
click method for the most part and
that's all that's gonna happen all right
so we're just basically gonna start it
now again it's gonna kind of you know if
we do this click and hold a few times
it's gonna play over itself for the most
part but that's not really going to be a
problem we're gonna worry about
basically this tutorial just talking
about the online click method so yeah
it's not the most efficient little
application but that's fine you know
just to introduce this new method that
you guys can use for buttons or views or
whatever you guys want to use this on
long click for and let's get this
started up here the volume sound stuff
and if I just click quickly it's still
just playing our sound pool but if I
click and hold it starts our music and
then we can still click
and pleasure soundpool stuff as you can
see and then there we go I mean there we
go I mean that's pretty much all this
tutorial is is about the online click
method that you guys can use for buttons
views whatever you guys want to attach
that to so hopefully you like that
tutorial and I'll catch you guys in the
next tutorial peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
