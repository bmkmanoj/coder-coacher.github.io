slash on live gamer for the New Boston
in this tutorial we're gonna be working
more on the car program now if this
doesn't look familiar to you
this code right here you may want to go
ahead and move back to the beginning of
the car program series and if not then
let's go ahead and get started now if
you remember from the last tutorial we
created an ArrayList that stored all of
our cars that I added it added them to
this list box now you can see that if we
click on Honda CRV and click show info
we get Mustang GT now this has nothing
to do with the Honda CRV this is just
going to show the info of our default
sports car because we set it to do that
when the buttons show info is clicked as
you can see right here let's find it
right there so it's going to show the
car info of the default sports car so
all we need to do to show the info of
the selected in the car that's selected
inside of list cars we're going to have
to create a private variable up here so
we'll just call it selected car as all
cars dot car so you can see that we
didn't use the new keyword because we're
gonna be setting it equal to different
cars in here and when you use new it
creates an instance of that car and it
can't be set equal to any other types of
cars and now you may be wondering what
if this selected car is a truck or a
sports car well we can use what
polymorphism here if you remember from
the previous tutorials I think it was a
couple tutorials back but any any object
that inherits from the car class can be
treated as a car object which is the
concept of polymorphism so now that we
have our selected car what we need to do
is access the selected index changed
event of list cars so we can do that
just by double clicking and it will load
it up right here
so that what we need to do is set the
selected car to whatever car they have
selected in the list box so we'll just
go ahead and type selected car equals
and now what we're gonna do is we are
going to access our cars array list so
we'll just type cars and now we're going
to have to get use an index right here
so it gives our sets the element at the
specified index so we're just going to
be getting that element at the index now
if you remember when it adds these cars
to the list box it's going to add them
based on the index so the current index
of zero is added to the index of zero in
the list and the card the index of one
is added to the index of one in the list
so this is very useful to us in
accessing the cars so you can see when
we do add our cars for each car as all
cars car in our cars array list we're
going to add that to the list box and so
it adds it in numerical order according
to the cars array list so the way we can
set this selected car equal to the car
that the user wants to see we can just
type list cars dot selected index and
the selected index of list cars is going
to be equal to the index and cars that
the user wants to see this may be a
little bit confusing to you but if you
mess around with this code right here
this and your car array list you should
start to pick up what I'm saying if you
don't already know it so now that we've
set our selected car to the the car
that's been selected in the index of our
list box what we want to do is show the
car info so you can see here that we
show the car info of the default sports
car now all we have to do to show the
car info of the car that they've clicked
on is just change this to selected car
and so this makes it a whole but this
makes it a lot easier to change and
modify your code when you split stuff up
into different subs and you can see that
all we had to do was just change the
arguments in here because this already
does everything for us but it takes a
generic car right here and we can change
that to whatever we want instead of
having to rewrite all the code again so
we'll go ahead and run this and see what
kind of results we get so let's select
CRV if we show info we get Honda CRV the
color is red which is default it has
five doors and the speed is zero we'll
click Mustang GT will show the info the
car name is Mustang GT the color is red
as two doors and the speed is currently
zero now you can see that we didn't get
any errors there because of polymorphism
our sports car was treated as a car now
I know I repeat myself a lot of this but
this is a concept that is very helpful
and you guys should all understand it if
you want to progress in your programming
so we'll go ahead and close out of that
and let's add one more thing before
we're finished with this tutorial
whenever they say change the index of
our Wis cars what if the index is not a
valid index so in that case it would be
negative one so we can just add a simple
if statement here so if Lascars dot
selected index does not equal negative
one then we'll just go ahead and set
this value so this will prevent any
errors from happening in our program so
if they tried to select it next to
negative one it would try to do this in
our program would most likely crash so
go ahead and type this code and if you
have it i really suggest it'll help you
learn the concepts a lot better and you
could change it yourself and then once
you've done that go ahead and move on to
the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
