this video I'm going to show you how to
use variables and also data binding so
in other words I'm going to show you
guys how to have variables inside this
class and we can include them inside our
template and by the way just to give you
guys a little heads up since we kind of
need to be making some kind of sample
for this tutorial I'm just going to make
a basic video player application and
it's just going to have YouTube videos
so we're going to have a list of YouTube
videos on the right-hand side kind of
like a playlist and whenever you click
one it's going to display on the left so
a really you know simple component but
we'll learn a bunch of cool stuff about
angular so the first thing I want to do
is instead of just having plain old
static text in here I actually want to
change this up some time so what I'm
going to do is in my class I'm going to
make it a variable and you can name this
variable anything you want I'm just
going to name my main heading now I'm
going to set this equal to something
like my videos semicolon at the end and
boom look at that so right now our class
is no longer empty it's happy it has
this main heading variable but now we
have to think all right how do we
include this variable right here so it
displays well in order to do that we use
a concept called
data binding in other words we want to
include something from our class inside
our template so the syntax for this is
double squigglies so two left's
Quigley's and two right squigglies i am
positive that that's not the technical
technical name from but curly braces
whatever so inside here you just write
whatever variable so main heading and
check it out
so now let me go ahead and look that my
videos so again that's the very basics
of data binding in other words including
class variables inside your template now
just a heads up there are a lot of
different kinds of binding in angular so
if you're looking through the
documentation in you're like wait a
minute I'm looking at two-way binding
and the syntax is a little bit different
we're going to talk about how you can
buying things differently later on it's
pretty simple but we'll get to that
later for now I want to mention this the
number one rule at least my number one
rule of software design is never repeat
yourself if you are ever making
application or a piece of software and
you find yourself doing the same thing
over and over again then you're doing it
wrong so a lot of the times especially
when you're making a website you have
certain bits of code that you include
over and over and over again for example
the title of your web page now on my
website I have the New Boston in almost
every single title so instead of just
writing it on every single file and then
what if my website changed I would have
to go through and do it again instead
what I did is I made this one settings
file and it has a setting for the title
now if I ever wanted to update that I
would only have to update it in one
location and update through my entire
program now I'm going to show you guys
how to do that in this and since we
don't have really any important settings
right now I'm just going to do it with
the heading but later on let's say that
you're working with like the Twitter API
and they gave you an API key that you
needed to use all over or maybe like a
file path then you would have that in
your settings file but right now we'll
just put something stupid in here like
this right there so we're going to
actually make a new file and go ahead
and name it
config service TS so all of your
typescript files are going to named or
excuse me ñ in the TS file extension
and for here we're just going to export
a class in we're just going to have
variables in here so export class and
I'm just going to name it config
basically your configuration settings or
the overall settings for your website so
this is going to be variable called main
heading you can actually name it
whatever you want and since this is
going to be a constant in other words
it's not going to change before it use
the keyword static so this means that
this isn't just a normal variable this
is going to be a constant in other words
a static not changing so whenever you're
using typescript after you make your
variable you
: and then you write what type it is so
this is just a string just going to have
some text in it it's not a number or
anything like that and now you just set
equal to anything just like a regular
JavaScript variable and just so I can
show you guys that it's different let me
change this I'll put like my favorite
videos alright so that's it so now
whenever we include this in other files
we're pretty much just taking all the
variables in here and we can use it
somewhere else
so pop back over to app components the
TS and now we actually need to import
this file
so again import what is the class name
it was just config this name right here
and now we need to say what file it's
coming from so remember anytime we
include one of our files we have to use
the relative pad so dot forward and that
is just config dot service so config dot
service now remember don't add the file
extension and I explained in the last
video why you don't so now what we can
do instead of just setting this equal to
some chunk of text right here we can
actually use the variables from this
file so the variables name main heading
so just straight config main heading
pretty awesome name now if I look back
here my favorite videos check it out so
this is pretty cool because again not
very useful in this example but later on
if we include this all over we would
only have to go back here to this one
file and change the value of this
variable right here and it would be
updated in every single component where
we had this main heading pretty awesome
