video I'm going to be finishing up this
little mini series where we have a main
menu already and we have that toolbar
that would create it in the last video
so the only other thing that I want to
show you guys how to make is I can copy
and paste this the status bar at the
bottom so what this is like I said this
is basically just a little indicator and
it's going to change and I'll show you
guys how to change it through your
program later on but for right now I'll
just show you guys oh my Oh mad my
darling which imagine that alright so
right now what I'm going to do is just
create a basic label however this isn't
just going to be normal text on the
screen I'm going to show you guys how to
add some really cool properties to your
label to make it appear as a frame kind
of like hacking kinter so the first
thing is where do you want it to appear
in your route
alright simple enough now the next thing
is the text is basically the status it's
going to say something like arm file
saved a to items selected whatever your
status is and I'm going to show you guys
how to change the text on this later but
for right now we'll just say preparing
to do nothing just going to be status
static text that isn't going to change
so for this example it'll be fine
now what I would like to do now is show
you guys one other property in its BD
this stands for border so pretty much
whenever you have a label you can
actually have a border around it now
it's not going to look that weird
whenever I add two more properties to it
the first is relief now this I spell it
right I before E except after C relief
relief relief okay got it it's a song I
had to remember when I was a kid so this
actually takes a couple properties and
just think of it right now is how you
want your border or how you want this
item to appear well we
to appear like it's sunken in in other
words sunken in your screen that means
if we just had to label at the bottom
you're like what the heck is that text
doing on the bottom but once we have a
border and add a sunken relief it's
going to appear like it's pretty much
placed in your screen just like um I
don't know like a status bar usually is
now right now the only other thing we
have to do is we need to anchor it so
what we're going to do is we're going to
set anchor equal to W because remember
this means north east south west never
eat soggy waffles that's how I
remembered it so West means make sure
that your text appears on the left
so eventually whenever we pack this in
we're going to pack it on bottom but we
want the text or the label we don't want
like one in the middle or on the right
we want to make sure that check this out
what I just hover over you see how this
pops up whenever I hover over these
buttons you see how it always appears on
left that's what we're going for
so only other thing I have to do now is
status pack it in how do we want to pack
it in well of course we want to pack it
on the bottom and the only other thing
that we want to do is we actually want
to make sure that it takes up the entire
width of the window so check out this
one on PyCharm right here all status
bars they take up the entire bottom
actually there's one program that
doesn't and it kind of annoys me forget
what it is it might be Internet I mean
it might be on Google Chrome actually so
fill X of course that's going to make
sure just like the toolbar it takes up
the entire width so now let me run this
bad boy
and check this Shiite out so as you can
see it doesn't just look like normal
text on the screen right now even though
it's just the label it has a cool border
over the top it appears the width of
your whole window no matter how wide it
is and also the text appears to left and
sunken in so that's why the border kind
appears to be inset rather than I don't
know just like a normal line on the
screen so that is how you make a status
bar and of course like I said I'm going
to be showing you guys how to change the
text on this later depending on what you
hover over or what you do so that's
actually all I have for you guys for
this tutorial if you want to check out
the next soil feel free but uh if any of
you guys have some time then check out
these I actually made some t-shirts for
my website and I'm a really awful
graphic designer so this one is just a
basic one and I actually like this one
but this one I made for the trade
section and it seems to be like missing
something but I'm not sure what so if
you ever made like a sauce and you're
like needs one more ingredient but I
don't really know what that's what I I
get that feeling whenever I'm looking at
this t-shirt so if any of you guys have
any suggestions um I'm just going to be
giving this away to like my moderators
and some people who helped out with a
website and this one I'm going to be
putting in my trade section just off
some other than like video games and
crap like that to trade but tell me what
this needs because I can't figure it out
I need your help but anyways that's all
I thank you guys for watching don't
forget to subscribe and I will see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
