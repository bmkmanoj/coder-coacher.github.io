Roberts and welcome to your very first
tutorial and les le SS now my guess is
that if you're watching this video then
you probably heard of les before or
maybe read a few things online and
you're like okay apparently this is
something that's supposed to make
writing CSS a whole lot better a whole
lot easier but I'm not sure exactly what
it is or why it's useful at all well
I'll give you guys like the two second
introduction and talk to you guys about
couple features and I don't want to bet
on this too long because I actually want
to get in actually typing and showing
you guys a bunch of examples but one of
the really cool features about les is
this say that you're using this color
like I don't know maybe red color all
across your website in every CSS file
now if your boss comes in one day and
he's like Bucky while your name wouldn't
be Bucky but he would say to me he's
like Bucky you need to change his red
color to blue well I would have to go
through my entire file which could be
thousands of you know lines long
find all the instances of red and change
it to blue blue blue it's going to take
forever well with less one of the things
that you can do is make variables or in
other words placeholders so you can
change it in one location and updates
your entire file automatically it's
awesome and another thing that is useful
and I actually had this problem recently
is that say in your CSS files you had a
bunch of images I don't know maybe for
like backgrounds or icons whatever now
if you ever move that directory to let's
say I don't know like inside another
directory well then you would have to go
through your CSS file and for the file
path you would have to give it a new
updated location that's going to take
forever to well with less it takes care
of that problem
as we're going to see so you're like
alright you sold me on it
how do I you know start typing less
downloaded setting it up getting it
ready well the first thing that you need
to do is you need to install node J s
this is going to allow you to easily
install download in
all less and I'm not going to show you
how to download install node in this
tutorial because I already filmed it in
my no js' tutorial so if you don't know
or if you want to be walk through that
then just go ahead over to my nodejs
tutorial the first video and watch that
and then come back here I mean it's
pretty easy you just click this big
green button then press the next a whole
bunch of times but if you guys you know
want to see me doing it and make sure
you don't mess anything up then go watch
that video now once you have no js'
installed on your computer this is what
you do open up the command line and if
you go to your Start menu and press CMD
then it's going to open up on windows
I'm guessing you guys know how to open
this up already and from here minimize
this so not to distract you guys take
this NPM install - G less now whenever
we download a node we got this thing
called an NPM tool which is no package
manager it's pretty much a fancy tool
that lets us download and install stuff
from the internet really easily that's
all it is so what we're saying is hey
node install less so we can use it on
our computer now this - G right here
this is saying install it in global mode
in other words we want to be able to use
this less technology anywhere on our
computer and I'm not going to press
ENTER but um you guys press Enter I
already have installed so you know I
don't want to reinstall it mess
everything up but essentially the reason
we want to install it globally is
because if we don't then we're going to
have to stall it install it in each
individual project that we make and it's
kind of a pain but so just do it that
way it's the easiest way so now we
should have no js' and less installed on
our computer now here's the thing less
is a very specific syntax in browsers
they don't understand less the code I'm
going to be typing browsers don't
understand it
so like
and what's the point of these videos
well in order to use less what you need
to do is you actually need to translate
it in to CSS because browsers only
understand CSS so essentially what we're
going to be doing is writing less and
translating it into CSS and then our
browsers are going to be using that
sounds confusing but trust me it's not
it just to give you guys a real quick
example of this if you go to this
windless thought work online less
compiler this is just um an online tool
that lets you easily see what's going on
behind the scenes so basically we're
going to be writing syntax like this and
it looks confusing right now but trust
me you guys are going to see how awesome
this really is and this is what we're
going to be writing and behind the
scenes the tool that we're going to be
setting up is going to be taking this
code in translating it into standard CSS
so this is all CSS that you're familiar
with that's what your browser's going to
see and this is what we're going to be
writing all right simple enough so I
need a compiler or a translator tool to
convert less code that we write into CSS
where do I get one well there is
actually a bunch of different ones
online and depending on your operating
system whether you have Windows or Mac
or Linux then you want to download one
specific and you know that's actually
compatible with your system and the one
I'm going to be using in my tutorial is
actually built right in to uh jetbrains
or IntelliJ whatever IDE you're using so
instead of talking guys how to install
them all go ahead to the LES website in
there called compilers technically not
translators so search for a best like
the best less compiler for Mac or best
less compiler for Windows and download
whatever one you want to use but
essentially they're all the same they're
all going to translate less code to CSS
so once you have it downloaded and
installed whatever one you want then
you're ready to move on to the next
video and in the next video I am going
to be showing you guys how to set it up
if you're using a JetBrains IDE like me
and if you guys aren't using this IDE
then you can just skip to the third
video and we'll start actually getting
into the less syntax sounds awesome see
you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
