video I am going to show you how to use
properties in react now properties allow
you to basically customize your
components so say that you're making
this application kind of like Netflix
any application where you want it to
display movies well of course you didn't
want to make a component to display
movie and then when you want it to
display another movie you had to make a
whole different component that had a
different title and maybe like the main
image for it you would basically want to
make the blueprint or a template for one
component and customize it in a bunch of
different ways so that's what properties
allow you to do so let's actually go
ahead and do that example so I'm going
to make it called a movie and remember
anytime you make a component you just
write react crate class make sure you
get your semicolons in the right place
and all right
so we'll keep things real simple all I'm
going to do for this component is I'm
just going to display a heading 1 and
heading 2 and we'll say that the heading
1 is the main title of the movie and the
heading 2 can be like the genre or a
description of the movie or something so
render function and remember all this
does all components do is they
essentially just return some HTML so
inside here since we're going to want a
heading 1 and heading 2 then I'm going
to need to wrap those and then div and
now just put heading 1 and I'll say
movie name and again this is what we're
going to want to replace this is going
to be equal to something like Avatar
Good Will Hunting it's going to be
different every time we use this
component but right now I just hit that
as a placeholder and why are you not
copying all right so for heading 2 will
just write the genre
and just so we make sure that everything
is working up to this point let me just
go ahead and render one of these
components right here so if I go ahead
and refresh this alright our component
is looking good but of course we don't
just want this in here we want custom
properties so instead of just using your
component like this you can actually add
attributes to it just like you have
attributes right here and they're equal
to some value you can do that in your
own custom components as well so in this
movie component let me just say title
and for the title I can set this equal
to anything I want so for this first one
I'll just say avatar so this is what's
going to display right here now after
this let me just go ahead and give it a
genre so again these properties can be
named anything you want title genre
favorite food pudding
whatever so um I'll say what is Avatar
an action movie alright there you go so
now what we did is we made this
component and we passed in two
properties a title property and genre
property so now how do we say where to
display them well you display them by
writing it curly braces now any of your
properties you can access through this
dot props so if we want to access the
title we write this dot props dot title
whenever we want to access the genre
great for this dot props dot genre just
like that now if i refresh this check it
out
now it says avatar action so this is the
coolest part about properties and I'll
show you guys this right here actually
it might be easier if I do this put it
on a new line
all right so say that we want to display
three different movies we want it to
display avatar and what's another
movement the notebook and the genre of
the notebook is romance and what's
another room Captain America
then what we can do is we can render
three different components and each of
these components have different
properties so check this out
every time I render one instead of just
having some static text in here it
actually gets the title of whatever the
component is in the genre right here so
again a property is essentially an HTML
attribute that we can pass in to
customize our components in different
kinds of ways
pretty awesome a nice I'll see you guys
