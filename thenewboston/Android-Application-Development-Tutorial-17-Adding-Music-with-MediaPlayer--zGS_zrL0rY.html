Android tutorial for the new Boston and
what we're going to do in this tutorials
basically set up some music and set up
some sound for application because when
there's music everything gets crazy
people start dancing there's right in
the street and before you know it you're
like grandma put your clothes back on
please so and maybe we shouldn't add
sound to our splash activity but we're
going to do it anyways basically before
we get started I want to make sure you
guys have a sound or mp3 clip within
your raw or folder now you want to use
most likely mp3 or OGG and again make
sure it's lowercase otherwise it's going
to give you guys problems so what we're
going to do is set up the sound variable
for the sound object for the most part
and run it and play it for the most part
but before we get into that I want to
just briefly talk about the different
classes we can use for music and for
sounds there's two classes that you guys
are going to get familiar with when
working with sound one is called the
sound pool and the other is called Media
Player now sound pool is used for small
Clips like explosions gunshots just one
or two second clips and media player is
used for pretty much everything else
like your background music for your game
or whatever you guys are developing so
we're going to use the media player
because not only is this sound five
seconds long it's also simpler to set up
and I think it's easier sound to sound
class that you guys can use to set up
it's pretty easy like I said and it's
going to be a media player object so
we're going to say media player like
this that's the type and we're going to
call it our sound or our song we should
say again we have to import the media
player class as always so we can use its
methods we're going to set this equal to
basically we're going to use a method
from the media player class called class
called create so we're going to say
Media Player referring to the media
player class we're going to
dot and we have this create method as
you can see there it takes a context
with s parameters and it takes an int or
a resource ID also you can stream stuff
from the internet using a URI we'll
probably get into that later but here we
go we're going to just click this method
sets it up for us now the context
basically we're just going to say this
but we're going to refer to the context
of this class for the most part so we're
just going to say our class name splash
dot this referring to the context of
this splash class so there you go
we set up our context again this is kind
of Java and we'll get into the
definition of what this means later the
most part but just realize its context
of the splash class for ID we're just
going to set this up just like every
other ID we do our dot r r dot splash
sound now we have our Media Player
variable setup called our song all we
have to do now is do our song oops song
dot
start maybe yeah we can use the method
start from the media player class just
click that and hit semicolon to finish
and now our sounds going to start it's
going to run but let's say for example
this this the sound clip is like 20
seconds long we don't want that sound
clip to carry over into our next
activity and also guys I'm sorry just
before I forget you want to define this
variable and start it below the set
content view just for you know good
habit so do that and then we're going to
start a sound but like I said we don't
want it to carry over to the next class
so what you guys might be thinking is
before this finish method we can say our
song dot and then we're like oh whereas
where's all those methods that we could
use from the media player class what's
happening is we defined our variable
within the oncreate method here so we
can only or basically this our song
variable is only recognized within the
oncreate method so we can only use it
within there but to define it as a
global variable for a whole class for
them
part sorry.just variable for a whole
class we can go above or on create
method and set up a media player and
then our song and don't define it or
anything just set up the variable and
say hey this is going to be a media
player variable just kind of like we did
in our other activity we set up some
variables above the oncreate method so
our whole class could use it so that's
what we want to do and then now we can
use that method use some methods on it
within our on pause the problem is now
that we're having is basically we're
redefining it here and it's still
thinking of it as a local variable
because we're defining it within the
oncreate method so what we're going to
do is get rid of the media player right
here and now it will recognize it as a
media player class or object and they're
all going to turn blue saying that
they're all pretty much the same object
so there you go we set up our our song
and now we can use it within our on
pause method so we're gonna say on stop
sorry our song and it is getting too
late shouldn't be doing any tutorials so
we're going to say our song dot and
release now you guys can always click on
some of these other methods and kind of
read a little bit about them and get an
idea of what they do we're going to use
the release basically this is going to
kick them down that you know this is
basically going to release the music and
just say we're done with you so we're
going to hit that and end it with a
semicolon and now our song should be
released when the on pause method gets
called I'll just test their activity
make sure it works turn up the volume
here
yeah I created that I'm a natural
Beethoven so uh yeah it looks like her
activity works and we have some sound to
it now grandma put your clothes back on
what are you doing get out of here so
yeah it looks like it's working I'll
catch you guys in the next tutorial see
you later peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
