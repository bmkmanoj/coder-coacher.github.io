metaphase one so let me go ahead and
draw my cell first now the first thing
that happens in metaphase one is that
your spindles are going to attach to the
centromeres of your chromosomes so
here's a spindle right here and remember
that these spindles are here they
actually like to line up on opposite
sides of the cell now whenever that
happens since they're attached to the
centromeres they're going to cause the
tetrads to line up along the equator so
let me go ahead and so as you can see
these tetrads are all lined up centered
in the cell because these spindles that
are attached to them are on opposite
sides now remember that these tetrads
each consists of four different unique
chromatids so let me go ahead and draw
my unique genetic information in here
here some random you know genetic
material scattered along these chromatid
and that's basically all that's going on
in metaphase one so remember that the
key to take away is that these spindles
right here are gonna attach even though
I didn't draw them attached they're
actually attached to the centromeres of
your chromosomes and since they are
opposite poles one right here and one
right here that's what causes these
chromosomes or tetrads as they are now
to line up along the equator of the cell
and anaphase one what's going to happen
is that these spindles are actually
gonna pull the chromosomes the
homologous chromosomes apart so if we
were to draw a diagram it would probably
look a little bit something like this
what does this remind you of a peanut or
boobs one or the other so here is the
spindle on this side here's a spend on
this side now again like I said what
they did is they eventually succeeded in
pulling the tetrad apart so we basically
have something like this
this in this and this and this now let
me go ahead and draw the random
chromatid real quick and then I want to
discuss a couple more things they're
actually pretty important alright so
basically remember that even though
these spindles right here
they pulled the homologous chromosomes
apart or the matching chromosomes take
note that the sister chromatids are
still attached so another thing that we
need to point out is cytokinesis or the
splitting of the cell is now starting to
begin so remember you know back to the
point of pulling the homologous
chromosomes apart homologous chromosomes
were matching Krum zones so that's why
you have 46 in your normal cells because
you get a set from your mom and it's set
from your dad well now what happen in
anaphase 1 is that it pulled the
homologous chromosomes apart so now
there are only 23 chromosomes over here
let me switch my color 23 chromosomes on
this side in 23 chromosomes on this side
so we now no longer have 46 chromosomes
we now are beginning to see that this
cell is going to end up with 23 and this
side cell is going to end up with 23 so
only one set instead of two they just
still have their sister chromatids so
that's why I drew you know two chromatid
for each one so remember one last time
23 chromosomes on each side but the
reason that there are two is because
their sister chromatid</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
