30th After Effects tutorial in this
tutorial I'm going to be going over
parenting now what parenting is is it
allows you to work with many layers at
the same time and apply the same kind of
animation to them and it's a lot easier
to show you like a thousand times easier
so I'm going to go ahead and do that
right now I'm going to go ahead and drag
this main clip into a new comp and get
rid of this one and so now we have this
main video right here and I'm also going
to drag this a Bucky symbol from last
time right on the comp anywhere I you
don't need to have any special symbol
just make sure you have a couple layers
so now as you can see we have two layers
that we can move around independently of
one another but sometimes you want to
kind of connect these layers so one it's
easier to work with and two that's kind
of the animation you're going for so
right now we can do things like scale
these in two different things and uh
they are really affecting one another
well when one thing is the parent of
another thing it takes the same
attributes of its child so for instance
say we have this Bucky layer right here
go down right here in your um in your
main clips and in your Bucky layer or
the layer that's on top click under this
parent tab and click Clips main or
whatever the other one is and what
happens now is whenever you edit this
main clip or the parent of it then the
child changes as well so for instance um
whenever I shrink this you can see the
child changes as well and that is a
pretty much what parenting is and it's
not only the scale of it but also if I
transform any property such as again the
position the scale
even though rotation then the child
changes along with it so any property
that the parent has the child has as
well but a neat thing to notice is this
is that when you change the child the
parent doesn't go along with it so I can
go ahead and since this Bucky is in the
parent of anything it only has a parent
then I can move this independently of
one another so that's pretty much your
basics the parenting is pretty simple
any time you want to take the properties
of something else just give a parent and
a child pretty much has like a
free-for-all for itself it doesn't adapt
the properties of anything else I don't
know if I'm saying you're right but it's
pretty much easier just to see than it
is to do but um yeah that's as pretty
much as simple as it gets
again I just want to give you guys a
real quick tutorial and again the parent
is under this main parent thing right
there so I hope you enjoyed watching
your tutorial on parents that's probably
all I'm going to be going over for
parents in the next tutorial I'm going
to begin animating text so I will hope
to see you in then so don't forget
subscribe and I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
