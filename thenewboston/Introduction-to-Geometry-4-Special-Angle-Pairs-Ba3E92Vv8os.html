talking about special angle pairs and
how they relate to one another so the
first type of angles we're going to talk
about our supplementary angles and
they're adjacent angles adjacent just
means that they're next to each other
that equal to 180 degrees so over here
we have two angles and we know that one
angle is 115 degree and we're trying to
find out what y equals so since they're
since they are supplementary angles we
can add them together to find out what
the second equals add them together and
set it equal to 180 degrees so if we
minus 150 from both sides we know that Y
is equal to 30 degrees because their
total must be 180 because if you look at
this line right here this lines
measurement is equal to 180 so that's
that's why their totals need to equal
180 degrees so the next type of angle
we're going to talk about are
complementary angles and they are
adjacent angles so side by side angles
whose total equals 90 degrees because if
you look at this this big angle is equal
to 90 degrees because it's a right angle
so over here we have two angles 63
degrees and we want to know what y
equals so we add them together and set
them equal to 90 degrees so y equals 27
degrees
okay
and the last kind of angles were going
to talk about our vertical angles so
vertical angles are across from one
another so this means that angle 1 and
angle 3 are a pair of vertical angles
and angle 2 and angle 4 are another pair
of vertical angles so vertical angles
are equal to each other so the measure
of this angle equals the measure of this
angle and the measure of 2 equals the
measure of 4 so over here we're gonna we
have two angles we know that this is 60
degrees and this is a hundred and twenty
degrees so since this angle is across
from this angle that means this angle is
also 60 degrees same thing for 120 so
this this angle and this angle are gonna
be equal so that means this angle is
also gonna be equal to 120 and we could
if we didn't know that this was 60
degrees pretend we didn't know that we
could find that out because these two
angles are also supplementary angles so
we could have taken 120 plus X is equal
to 180 and we would have found out that
yes this is indeed 60 degrees so those
are the three types of angle pairs so
now that we know all three we're gonna
do an example using all three
of the angle pairs okay so they want us
to find the measure of angle a measure
of angle a angle B angle C and angle D
so first we can find the measure of
angle a because angle this angle right
here whose equal to a hundred degrees
and angle a are supplementary angles
because they're adjacent and their
totals will equal 180 because this is a
line right here so we can add a hundred
degrees plus the measure of angle a and
set it equal to 180 degrees and find
that the measure of angle a is 80
degrees if we subtract a hundred from
180 so right here we can put 80 degrees
so I'm gonna fill this in so that we
know we remember what this equals so now
I want to find the measure of angle C we
can do this two ways we can set 150 plus
B equals 180 because these are
supplementary angles or we could set 150
equal to C because these are vertical
angles and then do the supplementary
angles for this one but first I think
what we're gonna do is solve for B so
since these are supplementary angles
we're gonna take 150 degrees plus the
measure of angle B and set it equal to
180 degrees because these two angles
form a line so if we subtract 150 from
both sides we find that the measure of
angle B is equal to 30 degrees so we can
fill that in
and fill that in so since B and D are
across from each other that means their
vertical angles and vertical angles have
equal measures so that means the measure
of angle P is equal to the measure of
angle D since we know that the measure
of angle B equals 30 that also means the
measure of angle D has to equal 30 so we
can fill that in right there and for
angle C we can we're gonna do two things
first we're gonna set C equal to 150
because what this angle and this angle
are across from each other so their
vertical angles and vertical angles are
equal so that shows that this is also
equal to 150 but we're gonna check it by
adding angle B and angle C together
because they are vertical angles so if
we add the measure of angle B which we
found to be 30 degrees plus the measure
of angle C and set it to 180 degrees
because they're supplementary angles if
we subtract 30 from both sides we'll get
150 and either way it still gives you
150 degrees for your answer so those are
all the special angle pairs make sure
you watch next time when we talk about
classifying triangles by sides and
angles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
