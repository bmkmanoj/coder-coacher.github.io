tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
to be talking about the if-else
statements now if you remember before I
talked to you guys about the if
statement and what this allowed us to do
is give JavaScript a condition and if it
was true execute the code so if you save
this and take a look at it you can see
that the condition is true so execute
the code but let's just make this
condition false and save it and see what
happens
as you can see JavaScript doesn't
execute any code if the condition is
false but what we want to tell us to do
is tell it to do something if it is
false and that's where you use the else
statement and to do this the syntax is
just else
and this any code that you type in here
JavaScript is gonna do if this statement
is false you don't need any condition
for it because it automatically knows
all right if this isn't true then I'm
gonna do the else statement so of course
your curly braces and let's just make an
alert box that says this condition
oops I just have condition is false now
here's what's going on right here
we give JavaScript a condition if it was
true oh to execute the if statement and
move on to the script to the rest of
your page but if it's not true it's
gonna say alright this isn't true so we
want to execute the else statement so
since this isn't true let's take a look
at what it looks like let's save it
and it says condition is false and
that's good that's what we wanted to do
and again I'll just set this true again
see what happens let's save it and it
says a good job Hoss then you click OK
and it moves on to the rest of the
script so this is how you tell
JavaScript when you give it a condition
if it's true execute this block of code
but if it's false execute this block of
code and again this is the if-else
statement so review this and in next
tutorial we're gonna be giving
JavaScript and unlimited number of
choices using another in the last
condition Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
