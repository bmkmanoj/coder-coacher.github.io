and and I got a comment from someone and
they say it's 3d s not 3ds max well too
bad I'm counting it 3ds max so welcome
to through these slides 3ds s max
tutorial and in this tutorial we are
going to be creating objects for the
very first time Inlet if you don't count
that little time we created that teapot
unless story bub let's get right into it
enough talking so in order to create an
object you need to go to the create
panel which is in your command panel and
as you see you got five different tabs
right here create modify hierarchy and
all these good ones what we want to be
is in the create one right here in even
in this great panel we got let's see six
different sub categories
that's geometry shapes light cameras
helpers space warps and systems we want
to make sure we're are in geometry
because we're going to be creating basic
geometric shapes so let's go ahead and
go ahead and pick any of these objects
I'm going to pick a sphere because it's
the easiest to create and go ahead and
once you click it you see it'll change
color and all these little sub menus
would or call it or rollouts pop-up but
you can ignore them for now
and go ahead anywhere click and drag
outward and this is going to create your
sphere and that's all you have to do to
create any object anytime you want to
create an object just go ahead and click
on the one you want to create click on
it in the viewport and drag it in your
you're going to be in crate mode so for
example you're going to have box
selected go ahead and well you don't not
create a box yet but go ahead and create
that then when you click somewhere else
you can go ahead and create another one
and another one but what if you want to
get out of this mode and you want to
stop creating objects and you want to
actually edit them well anytime you want
to edit or escape the great mode you can
either hit select objects and then when
you click and drag it doesn't
or if you're in create mode like this
you can just go ahead and right-click
and that's going to allow you to escape
great mode too so anytime you want to
escape great mode just go ahead and
right click it's easiest way so now you
can see that every object you have if
you select an object um what I want say
Maya but while Autodesk did was they
automatically gave it a name in the
color and of course these names aren't
very creative or inventive so we can go
ahead and change those by changing this
the leg ball instead of sphere and we
can also change default color it gives
it random color but if we want to change
that just go ahead and double click this
palette pick a color and click OK there
are also some other settings but I never
use them and usually 100 and here's
another thing if all your objects are
getting the same color then that means
somehow you toggle this button off
assign a random colors so make sure that
is checked on if you want each of your
objects have a different color what you
usually do then go ahead and click OK so
now you know how to change in name and
color and another thing I want to take
note of I'm going to go ahead and hit
ctrl a and it's going to select them all
and I'm going to delete them because I
want to teach you guys something else
different objects have a different
number of clicks and drags required to
create them so for example whenever I
created this sphere right here I just
clipped in drag once and bam I created
it but for example say I wanted to
create something like a cone right there
this one has 3 clicking drags that you
need to create it the first one is the
base radius or the base the second one
is the height and third one when I let
go click and drag is I don't know what
you call this parameter the pointyness
of it or the roundness pretty much the
top of it so just take note of that that
different objects have a different
number of clicks and drags so if you
think you're done you may not be done
now as soon as you create an object you
go modify it in these parameters right
here so your example you can change the
height of it
let's change the radius to notice is
pointing at the top we can change that
to like 10 and then click away and you
can see the changes or we can change the
height to 18 or 17 and then go ahead and
click it will be shorter but here's the
thing when you click away to another
object say select object and then you
click back to select this one those
parameters aren't editable anymore
so we're saying alright I want to make
this ball a little bigger so I'll just
click on it and I'll go over here and
change
WTF where'd they go I can't change the
parameters anymore well in order to
change the parameters what you need to
do is go to the modify tab after you
created it and this is where you can
change the parameters and again you can
enter something numerically or you can
click these or you can just click it
once and drag it so that's probably the
easiest way so again that I don't want
you to forget that as soon as you create
an object the very first time you can
edit it by hand but as soon as you click
away from it then you can't edit it
anymore as soon as you click away from
and then you need to go to the modify
tab and that's how you can edit it so I
guess the last thing important that I
want to teach you in this story let me
create a box real quick one click for
the base one click for the height in
order to delete an object while it's
selected and remember if you want to
select another one just go ahead and
click select object up here you just go
ahead and select it and press Delete
button on your keyboard that's the
easiest way and now another another
important thing that I know is going to
come in handy anytime you guys want to
undo something you did whether it's
creating or deleting something just go
ahead and hold down ctrl and press Z so
if you made a mistake by accident and
you want to go back and undo that
mistake just hold down ctrl + Z so
that's d4 excuse me delete to delete an
object and ctrl Z to undo
your mistakes so that's that for this
tutorial in the next tutorial we're
going to be going over creating some
more advanced objects so thank you guys
for watching don't forget to subscribe
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
