welcome to your let's see seventh
intermediate Java tutorial and this is
where we're going to be building all of
these methods that we didn't build last
time so let's go ahead and out again
this is your main method right here so
you want to make sure outside and not
inside your main method and when you're
outside to add a little comment print me
method I just like to add a little
comment begin them each my method so
then when I'm building a huge class with
a bunch of methods I can you know find
them easier so private static void print
me and of course it's a text parameter
of a list which is string data and just
name I name all my list l because I'm
lazy and now let's scroll down and ice
actually get to building method so let's
go ahead and make an enhanced for-loop
and of course is going to loop through
the string um b and let's get let me go
ahead and type this and i'll explain it
l so what this is doing is it enhanced
for loop that's going to loop through
the array of a list actually it's going
to loop through a list it's going to
treat each element in that list as be
temporarily there we go so now what do
we want to do to be just go ahead and
print out so system.out.print f and for
argument one let's just go ahead and
print that element which is percent s
and for the argument just go ahead and
write BNE so what this is going to do is
it's going to pass it in each item of
the list and just print that string and
space after it nothing new and then once
you're done doing that whole thing just
do system.out.print line just so we can
keep everything titled up and it doesn't
look like if you don't have this every
time you use this method it's going to
look like it's on one big line this
every time you use it it's going to go
to the next line easy enough and don't
forget your semicolon right there so now
we have a basic print method just pretty
much to go through the list and print it
out so now we can go ahead and build our
other method remove stuff so let's go
and move stuff method right like that so
this is also private static void remove
stuff but this one takes a list or not
sting that's embarrassing string and
data and we'll just name this list l
temporarily because again I'm lazy and
put in from int 2 because this is your
going to pass it in a range of numbers
you pass it in the number from what you
want to delete to what you want to
delete and I think we pass it in 2 to 5
so it's going to remove the elements
from 2 to 5 see see how why I named it
from in 2 easy enough so let's go ahead
and we'll get coding so this is a easy
one it's only one line what we want to
do is take that list that we passed it
in and we want to get a sub list off it
and sub list is a built-in method from
Java it's actually from the util so from
into and what this is going to do is is
we're going to return a portion of the
list it's going to return the portion 2
to 5 in this case now what do we want to
do that portion we want to clear it
right here and this is also a billing
method so sub list and clear our
built-in methods that you can use a
linked list and again we're just going
to do you're going to give it a list
you're going to take a portion of that
list and you're going to delete it so
easy enough that's how you remove stuff
so we got one more error right here it's
reversed me it says alright create
method reverse me all right you talked
me into it easily influenced I will so
let's put reverse me and put drive it
static void reverse me good enough and
now again we pass the end a list up here
so we got pass it in and list down here
list
string just going to name L because I'm
lazy again can't stress that enough and
what we're going to be using to reverse
is a list iterator kind of like the last
one so list
iterator and of course you got a cast
what type of data you're going to be
passing in like always and you can name
your list ater iterator anything you
want I'm going to name my bhabhi because
he seems like he would be a good list
iterator for me so now you got to write
what you want to iterate through you
want to iterate through that list you
just passed in which is L and list
iterator and what you need to pass in
here is a starting point of aware of
pretty much what you want to iterate
through now we want to start at the very
end and then print that out first
because this list is in reverse order if
we started beginning and printed out
everything then that would just be a
normal order so how do we get the
endpoint of the list
well we can go ahead and figure out how
many elements are in here and then go
ahead and figure out the end point so
let's say it's eight or something or
what we can do is put L dot size and
what this does is automatically gets the
size for you and what that is is
automatically the ending point of your
list so how cool is that so the starting
point if you put list size is
automatically the last element see
that's pretty cool so let's go ahead and
let me in that and now that we have
something that can iterate or go through
our list that's what iterate means we
can begin putting a while method so
while Bobby our friend Bobby our list
iterator has previous and this is of
course a built-in method so while it has
something before it so this is going to
be true until it gets to the last
element and then it's going to be false
so that's where this goes
system.out.print F and for the format
just go ahead and put a quotation
quotation string just like and remember
we have to print it out this time
because you see reverse me there's no
print me after it we could have built it
that way but this is so much more
exciting
Bobby dot previous just like that so
what this is going to do one last time
it's going to loop through the entire
list while it has something to look
through in
printing out the elements one by one so
let's go ahead and run this and we'll
see if it works so right here we got
here is our original list when we
combine the two Apple noobs pwnage bacon
goats that's our first one as you can
see it added the second one to it
sausage bacon goats Harry Potter so now
we have this one huge list after this we
ran the method let's see what we aren't
remove stuff 2 2 5 so it took the
elements from 2 to 4 and removed it so
you see Apple noobs and then pwnage um
bacon and goats and sausage is the lead
in and let's see no pwnage bacon goats
and then you have sausage bacon goats in
Harry Potter left so now here's our new
and enhanced list with elements removed
in it so lastly what we did is we took
this list which was our new list 1 and
reversed it and right here with the
reverse me method so what this did is
take this list and put Harry Potter
goats bacon sausage newbs apples so that
through the reverse me method we were
able to reverse the elements and that is
pretty much the power of linked list and
what you can do with it again some
different methods then the basic list or
collection interface so that's it for
