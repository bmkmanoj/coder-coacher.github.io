circumference of a circle circumference
is the distance around the outside of a
circle so it's basically like the
perimeter of a circle it's just called
circumference because it's you can't
take a perimeter of a circle because of
its route because it's round so you
don't just add up the distances like you
want to find perimeter but you're still
finding how long this blue arc is so
circumference is equal to PI times D or
2 pi R so D is the diameter so D is this
whole line right here R is the radius
which is d is equal to 2 because the
radius is just this piece right here
diameter is this whole part so this
thing this funny-looking thing right
here is called pi and it's we have to
multiply diameter by PI to find
circumference if you're good if you want
the exact value of the circumference
you'll write C is equal to like 12 pi
but if they ask for an approximation of
C you're gonna say pi is approximately
3.14 pi is a non repeating decimal so it
just keeps going on and on forever so
there's no way to get exactly
circumference unless you write it like
this but if you wanted to approximate it
you'd take 12 times 3.14 and if you plug
it into a calculator you'll get 36 point
six eight but that's just an example
so now we're gonna do some more examples
find the circumference so this is the
center of the circle so this is the
radius so to find our area we're gonna
take two PI R so for an exact value
we'll get 16 pi for an approximation
we'll get 16 times 3.14 you plug that
into a calculator you'll get 15 point 2
4 so when we have an exact value we use
equal signs but when we approximate the
circumference we're gonna use these
little wavy lines and that just signals
that we approximated it and that this is
not the act exact value of the
circumference it's pretty close it's
just not exact so if I'm a circumference
this time we're given diameter but if we
wanted to do the 2 PI R 1 7 PI D 1 we
would just divide 15 by 2 you get 7.5
but I think it's just easier to use pi
times diameter so for an exact value we
get circumference is equal to 15 pi for
an approximation we get 40 won't we get
forty seven point one inches now since
we're doing the distance around the
circle we're gonna be in just inches
because circumference is a
one-dimensional measure unlike area
which is two-dimensional so that's
actually all we have for today
but make sure you come next time where
we'll be finding the area of a circle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
