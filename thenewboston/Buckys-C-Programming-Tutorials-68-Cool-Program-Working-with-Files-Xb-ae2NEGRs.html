tutorial and these next couple tutorials
are going to be a chain of tutorials I
can't teach you guys what I'm going to
teach you in one tutorial so it's
probably going to be like a three or
four part series but anyways what I'm
going to be teaching you guys is this
I'm going to be building a really cool
program showing you how to work with
files and by the end of these tutorials
you guys are going to be a pro on how to
work with files so basically what we're
going to be doing is we're going to be
pretending we're making a computer game
now in this computer game we have a
character and this character in his own
little world is going to come across a
bunch of different objects
some objects have no effect on them
whatsoever zero effect on his health or
is you know happiness whatever you want
to call it some objects like ninjas meth
and dirty needles they harm our
character so they're going to you know
have negative 54 energy or what to say
it's like energy or something now some
objects like a fruit a soda and candy
help our character out so they're going
to give them positive energy so as you
can see we have a file with a name and
the effect that it has on our
character's energy so we're going to be
building a program just to print out
these different types of items and
groups for example we're going to have
the user press one if they want to print
out all the plain items like a shoe a
pencil and chair press two if they want
to print out the helpful items like
fruit and soda and candy and press three
if they want to print out the harmful
items like a ninja meth and a dirty
needle now we'll have them press four if
they just want to quit the program
altogether and you know go watch YouTube
videos so that's the basics of what
we're going to be doing we're going to
be incorporating a program with a file
and it's going to work beautifully
together but like I said it's going to
take more than one video so just be
prepared for that so let's go ahead and
start coding this baby right meow so the
first thing we want to do is we want to
give them a menu to choose from now this
menu is going to be one two three four
depending on what they press we're going
to output the appropriate items so we're
going to want to store this variable
either 1 2 3 or 4
in a variable so just go ahead and make
will store this number and variable
named what they want now this will be
equal to one two three or four so now
what we can do is we can just take that
variable what they want and we're going
to set it equal to a function in order
you know to get the number from them so
we'll just name this function get what
they want now we didn't build this
function yet and this obviously isn't a
built in function on C++ so we need to
go ahead and build it right now so what
I like to do actually is whenever I'm
building a big program that's going to
be working with a lot of functions above
each function well I'll just do with
main first I like to leave a comment
just the function name like a main
function and you guys may be like
alright why the heck do you want to do
that well if you notice the comments are
a different color and it makes it really
easy to find functions
whenever you're scrolling through like
three hundred three thousand lines of
code so you guys might be like alright
that's kind of dumb but trust me do it
it's going to save you a whole bunch of
headaches in the future so we're going
to be building this get what they want
function so the first thing I'm going to
do is get what they want function and I
probably spelled it wrong yep but you
know good enough so now remember this
function has to return an integer that's
going to be either 1 2 3 or 4
so our turn type is going to be integer
now the name is get what they want so
just go ahead and copy that and paste
that and it's not going to take any
parameters we don't have to give any
information into it we just want to get
information back from it so that's why
it's not going to take any parameters so
now what we want to do is we need a
variable to temporarily store 1 2 3 or 4
so we got to make an int variable and
we'll just name this choice name or
whatever you can name it X if you want
really doesn't matter so now what we
want to do is we
to output the their choices for them so
you know they know whether it enter one
two or three or four so just go ahead
and make four different see out
statements we can make it all in one
statement but it would probably look
cleaner if it's just four different
statements so in the first one we'll
just put enter one for just plain items
and you probably want to put each of
these on a new line so just copy this
three more times copy and we'll go ahead
and write enter 2 4 2 can be let's say
helpful items and this will be the you
know candy the soda is that really
helpful for a kid I don't think so but
in this game it is and three will be for
the harmful items and this will be like
the the ninja their dirty needles and
the website put oh yeah meth definitely
harmful for a kid and four will just be
like quit program so whenever they press
for the program is going to quit so now
what we want to do is we want to allow
them to input of course one of those
numbers so CIN that's how they get
information from the keyboard and
whatever number they enter it's going to
be stored in the variable choice now all
we need to do is take that variable
choice and return it in our function so
whenever we return choice it's going to
store that number and what they want so
now this could what they want function
basically gets a number from from the
keyboard and it stores it in a variable
what they want so now we have a variable
either 1 2 3 or 4 but we didn't do
anything with that variable yet and what
we want to do is since this program is
going to keep running until they hit 4
we want to throw pretty much our entire
program inside a while loop and this
while loop is basically going to say ok
keep running this program until they hit
the number 4 so we're going to say all
right while that what they want variable
is not equal to the number 4 keep
running this program
and of course at the end of this at the
end of this while loop well let me think
actually no okay
I'll save that for later on but
basically what I'm going to be doing is
this I guess I can throw it in right now
at the end of this while loop we want to
give them another opportunity to you
know get what they want to enter another
number so go ahead and copy this and
well I guess I can show you guys what's
going on right now basically this
program is going to run and I didn't
prototype it always remember to
prototype your functions ladies and
gentlemen and whenever your prototype
something just copy the header and paste
it at the very top and that way whenever
your program comes across it like it did
right there um it's going to know what
it is so let me show you guys what's
going on so far well the very first
thing that we did is we ran this program
and it called up this function right
here now once it got that function it
pretty much took a number from one to
three or four and stored it in the
variable what they want and we said all
right keep calling this function in
making equal to store to what they want
until they enter four so whenever they
run this program they're going to be
able to enter one it's going to do
something too it's going to do something
three it's going to do something they
can enter three 100 times if they want
but as soon as they enter for the while
loop is going to end and the program is
going to quit just like that so we have
the basic shell of the program right now
we basically are getting a number from
them and we're going to keep getting a
number from until they enter four so now
with the basic shell done the only thing
that we need to do now is whenever they
enter one handle that one appropriately
and show all the plain objects whenever
they enter to handle that appropriately
and show all the helpful items whenever
it ends will enter three show all the
items that are harmful to the character
in now that we now have the basic shell
we can move on to that but we can in
this story because if I do I'm going to
run out of time so copy all this code
down make sure you know how this menu
function works and also make sure you
understand why how we keep looping
through this function until they enter
the number four and by the way as soon
as they enter number four this while
loop is going to be false and it quits
and as you can see whenever it quits
there's no more quote there is no more
code after it so the main function ends
in our program stops so once you guys
understand that you're ready to move on
to the next tutorial so thank you guys
for watching don't forget subscribe and
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
