but you guys are probably getting ticked
off because you're like okay that last
tutorial was a waste of time
I learned what yams were but I still
don't know how to make responsive
websites getting pretty mad about the
punch me in the face well calm down
because in this video I'm going to be
showing you guys exactly how to use that
knowledge to make a flexible web layout
so the first thing I want to do is this
go ahead and get rid of all those divs
because we don't need those anymore and
also clear out everything from the CSS
file so we pretty much have two blank
templates now the first thing I want to
do is this I want to make a div in here
and we'll just give it the ID of I don't
know wrapper so this is actually going
to be our very first flexible or
responsive web element so you know
congratulations this is a big moment for
us so save that right here and actually
if you want to type something in there
just so we have I don't know something
to look at I'll type babies have rabies
but you can type whatever you want all
right so now we have a blank element on
the screen and if we looked at it pretty
boring so let's go ahead and hop over in
our CSS and I'll show you guys this what
I want to do is actually since this is a
div as you guys know divs are pretty
much boxes or containers that can hold a
bunch of other elements so just so we
can distinguish this div from the rest
of the screen I'll make the div white in
the background I don't know like a gray
color so the main body of the website
I'll put a background color you can have
anything you want just don't make it
white wouldn't make mine
tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu which is going to be
like a dark gray this color right here
so my div remember we give the ID of
wrapper so id equals wrapper let's add
some properties of this now the first
thing I want to do is give it
a background-color of white and that is
just because if we don't we're not going
to be able to tell it's just going to
look like it's blending into the
background so what we're going to do is
we're going to say that this is the meet
of our website this is pretty much the
main layout aside from the background
that everything is contained in so the
background is white that's good so far
arm let's go ahead and give it a width
of 1024 pixels since that'll look pretty
good on you know most of the screens
will also give it a margin and we'll put
five pixels Auto now whenever you do
this this means the margin of the top
and bottom is five pixels so five pixels
from top and bottom so it isn't like
very butted up against the top it looks
kind of weird that way and Auto means
adjust it so it gives you an automatic
value for the left and a right and what
this essentially does is it centers it
right in the middle of your webpage
because for some reason whoever is
making the CSS the rules for in html5
they made it really hard to Center stuff
and I don't know so this is how you
Center a web page now for the border
I'll just give it I don't know border
like five pixels and solid in red so let
me go ahead and say this and I'll show
you guys what we got all right pretty
cool so we got a nice centered web page
right here and I'm just go ahead and
shrink this all right still looking good
all right I see what the problem is here
so look at this border right here when
your screen is big enough it looks great
but once you start shrinking it your
crap starts getting cut off right here
so the website actually goes to like out
here but since we're using pixels in
this old cool or excuse me this
old-school crap it's giving us a bunch
of problems so what I want to actually
I'm not even gonna I'll comment this out
I won't completely delete it so this
will show you guys the difference
between a good responsive layout or
responsive web design and a bad one
so first of all like I said whenever you
see pixels it means okay I did something
wrong so let's copy this and transition
it all over to something other than
pixels now instead of a width a fixed
width a fixed width means no matter how
small or how big your window is it's
going to be the same amount of pixels no
matter what well we don't want anything
cemented in there we want this flexible
because that's what we're learning so
what you can do instead is you can
actually give it a percentage now what
this is going to do is it's going to say
no matter how big my window is always
make this inner object this white thing
right here ninety percent of it so if
it's two thousand pixels it's going to
be eighteen hundred if it's one hundred
pixels it's going to be 90 pixels it's
always going to adapt to the size of
your screen so this way it actually
flexes limitless it's very cool so the
margin of course this is bad too because
I don't know is five pixels like one
inch on some screens is five pixels like
ten inches on other screens
maybe maybe five pixels is way too much
on a phone so instead what we want to do
is we want to use those things called
EMS so if you use something like point
four e/m what it's going to do is it's
going to go grab the default font size
for whatever device you're on and it's
going to adjust the margin to that
appropriately so it's going to be more
consistent viewing experience no matter
how big your screen size is so of course
you're going to want to adjust this
based on how everything looks but this
is the basics of how you make an
adaptive flexible layout so check this
out now so even though the sizes didn't
match up exactly and if we wanted to we
can break okay 85 and figure all that
out but I just want to show you guys the
basics right now so right now check this
out before we would start the gate cut
off right around here but since we have
ninety percent no matter how small or
how big this is this inner box is always
flexing to 90
percent of the main container which is
the black or the dark gray part so
that's pretty cool right there
and also even though I don't have like
different devices to show you guys I
just have my browser right now this
border right here is 0.4 a.m. so what
that does like I said is it grabs the
default font size and the border is 0.4
or 40% of that font right there so later
on once I show you guys how to make
different font sizes depending on your
device the border is going to shrink and
grow accordingly so this is a lot better
and a lot more adaptable for every
single device than this crap right here
which pretty much cements your web
design in there and no matter what
device is displaying it it doesn't
really care it's saying this is how to
do it it's kind of like hard header
hard-headed and stubborn so that is the
very basics of how to make a flexible
layout using percentages instead of
pixels and also using EMS instead of
pixels as well so hopefully you guys are
learn a little something again I'm going
to be taking all this posting on my
forum thank you guys for watching don't
forget to subscribe I'll see you guys
