tutorial that I'm making for them in
Boston and in this tutorial I'm gonna be
showing you how to use the property grid
control and basically the property grid
control is just exactly like this
property panel over here you can select
and scroll through everything that's the
exact same so all you're going to need
for this tutorial is a button um
something for purses name from the third
age and something further email you're
also going to need to have a class
called person and inside of this class
we have three properties one for a name
one for age and one free email so when
the user clicks the button it creates a
new person and with the name Adam or the
age fifteen and an email that you know
and then it calls the reload method and
this will just basically set all those
properties to text box the text boxes
text so let's just go ahead right here
and test this out click this button and
it will just basically load all these
properties in these text boxes if the
name is Adam ages 15 and email is that's
you know alright so say you had a much
larger class with a lot of properties
something like a control class mainly
like like the text box class that
obviously has a lot of properties inside
of it so you would not want to have to
create a text box for each property
that's just too much work so what you
can do is you can use the property good
control so in order to use the property
good control just go ahead and go over
the tool box and drag a property grid
over to your form and as you can see
right here it looks just like this
property panel so it's the exact same
and if you want to set what thing you
wanted to read the properties from and
go here in the code so once it creates
the new person we're going to have it
say property grid 1 dot selected object
is a property and it says right here
gets your stuff the object for which the
grid displays property so whatever
object we want it to read properties
from
so the EKG we wanted to read from a
property class or the person class that
he's created so we're going to say P so
now only debug here and click this
button it's basically going to create a
new instance of the class and then load
all the properties for that class inside
of this control right here so we should
see name age and email right inside of
the control that we created we have the
age displayed the email and the name
perfect and if we edit them such as you
wanted to change this to something
different like Bob then it will say that
we just can't see it yet because we
didn't tell it to reload this so once
we're gonna tell it to once that raises
the event that we change a property we
wanted to reload all the all the all the
properties into the text boxes so you
can see that it changed so to select
your property grid right here go over to
the properties panel go to the events
scroll down until you see property value
change and just double click on that so
now when a property value is changed
it'll do this code and we just want it
to be car called a load method or reload
method and this will basically just set
the textbox equal to the classes
properties so that we can see if it
actually changed the value of the
properties in the property grid so now
we're going to create a negative person
yep we change this value we should see a
change in this text box as well just the
Bob click away and yep Bob email
something different like yo and you have
to change email to show now you don't
have to just limit yourself to classes
that you carry on your own you can also
set them equal to things that were like
on the form so that's controls like if
you wanted to mess with this bottner
here you can just select this go back to
a properties panel scroll down to select
that object and select our button that
it created and now as you can see all of
our options for the button or the
properties for the button loaded
this property grid right here and yes we
can edit them while the program is
running so if we wanted to change the
back color to something different like
that yeah see it change right there
change the text as well like load
changed in real time so yeah that's
pretty much it for this tutorial on
using the property grid control so see
you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
