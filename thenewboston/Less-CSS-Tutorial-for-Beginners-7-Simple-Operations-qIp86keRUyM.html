talk to you about operations now
operations are these small mathematical
formulas that you can use in CSS now
that probably sounds like the most
boring thing ever CSS mathematical
formulas now that I say it out loud it
kind of does but I'll show you guys how
useful this is so say that you had a
course tile for I don't know maybe your
button and you want to make like a
jumbled button which is a little bit
bigger and a lighter button which is you
know the same color but it bit lighter
well that is when you would want to use
operations and in order to demonstrate
this first let's make the base core
styling so I'm gonna make variables and
this is gonna kind of encompass
everything we learned up to this point
so say button background and I'll just
say the zero zero six six nine nine it's
one of my favorite colors now the button
color is just the text color that's on
the bond I'll just say it's white FFF
and the last thing we're gonna do is
we're gonna make a variable called
button padding and the padding of these
buttons is gonna be five pixels by
default so a pretty simple button and
whenever we make this button or an
element has this button class we want to
say use these properties so for that
background bottom background color is
bottom color and for the padding you
guys could probably guess button padding
simple enough and actually should
probably display this as a nine-block
that might be a little bit easier to see
what I'm about to do alright so now we
have our core main generic button that
inherits from all of these styles it
doesn't inherit it uses variables but
whatever so I decided that you know why
I also want to have a jumbo button which
is a bigger version of it and also a
lighter bun
so I'm gonna make another class called
jumbo bun and what we can actually do is
we can actually use mix-ins rubber
instead of copying all these or even
using those variables we can just use
mix-ins and what that does is it pulls
everything right from here but now for
my jumbo bun I actually want to add more
padding to the default so instead of
just using padding and giving it um you
know something like 30 pixels what I can
do is this I can take the original
padding for the button using at button
padding and I can actually use a
mathematical operation like plus 30 now
since we're using this variable right
here it knows to add 30 pixels you don't
have to tell it you don't even need to
save pixels or you know whatever other
type of units it knows that the padding
for this jumbo bun is now going to be 35
5 + or 30 and let's just for
demonstration purposes let's make one
more a light button so this is just
gonna be a different color so for this
button style we're of course going to
use a mixin 10 hair all of this stuff
from the button class and also for the
background which is the color what we
want to do is we want to use button
background which is that generic blue
but we want to multiply it by 1.6 and
that's just gonna lighten up whenever
you multiply it brings you closer to
white so this is gonna give us a lighter
button actually let me make it a little
bit more so CV easier to see and look at
what this gets compiled to so you can
actually see right here what the new
color is so this is our original and
don't worry about like the hex because
again it's all taken care of you if you
want to make it lighter then just
increase this value if you want to make
it darker then you can like times it by
something less than one and boom you'll
be good to go
so let me actually add a couple buttons
now so a
make it a dead link and for this first
one I'll just write like normal and of
course for this one we're just gonna use
the class of button and I'll do one of
each so button jumble button and like
button button and like button so normal
jumbo and light so now if we check it
out that is from my old tutorial all
right so here is our normal one here is
our jumbo one with remember we added 30
pixels of padding and here is our
lighter one where we took the original
background color and we multiplied it by
one point even though 1.8 C it looks a
little bit too light so let me bump that
down look at that so maybe you want to
use this for hover so for example this
is your normal and whenever you hover
over it it lightens up a little bit kind
of indicator to the user that hey they
are you know actually touching this
button and now if you ever want to go
back and let's say change the color of
this button to I don't know maybe
there's baby poop green color and I
don't know maybe we wanted to add like a
border radius to give it a nice looks
like a 4 pixel then what we do is we
just change it in one location right
here and since all of our other rules
that dependant on that color we don't
have to change it in these locations
because since we use these formulas this
is automatically gonna be lighter
without having to update it manually so
check it out we now get normal jumbo and
light they're all updated thanks to our
brilliant knowledge of less so how
awesome is that and yeah we now learn
how to use less with not only variables
with not only mix-ins but also these
awesome formulas and it's making
maintaining this CS
which would usually be a pain a whole
lot easier so there you go see you guys
