forty eight seashell tutorial that I'm
making for the new Boston and in this
tutorial I'm going to be showing you how
to overload operators so all you're
going to need for this tutorial is a
button and an item class and inside of
your item class and the students have a
public into your property so basically
what we're going to be doing is just
adding two item objects together to
create a new item object so the user
could create two item objects and then
say a new item objects equals those two
add it out so first step in overloading
an operator is typing public static
because our operator are all operators
must be both public and static next
you're going to want to type the return
type for your operators so basically
what you're two things would be equal to
since we're using addition we're just
going to add two items together and then
return a new item so is going to say
item right here following that you're
just going to want to type operator
since we're going to be overloading an
operator next you're gonna want to type
the operator that you're going to be
overloading and we're going to be
overloading the addition sign so we're
just going to type the addition sign
right there now think of this like a
method and inside of these parameters is
basically what you're going to be adding
together and the first parameter that
we're going to be typing out will be
what will ever will be on the left side
of our addition sign so I'm just gonna
like item and I'll call it I one is
after all we're going to be adding two
items together and then the second
parameter is whatever will be on the
right side of our addition side so I'm
going to type item and then I'll call it
I to that we're going to be adding these
two items together alright so once we
have that all set up we can now actually
type what our operator is going to be
doing and like I said before we're just
going to be adding the two prices of the
items together and then returning a new
item with that sum of those two items
prices it's always going to create a new
item first our item I'll call it i3 and
Senate equal to a new item and then
we're going to say I threes price is
equal to I ones price plus i2
so if I ones price was one and I twos
price was too high threes price would be
three and then we're just going to learn
our turn this new item so doesn't wanna
return and I through all right so let's
test it out roughly over just in
creating a new item I'll call it item
one and set it equal to a new pilot and
I'll say item ones price equals four and
then I'm gonna create another item call
it item two item as well and then item
it's whose price will be six and then
we're gonna say item and I'll call it
item 3 equals item 1 plus item 2 and
since we used or overloaded this plus
operator right here is just going to
take item 1 and item 2 and add their
prices together and then return a new
item so item 3 is equal to the sum of
item 1 and items twos prices so now I'm
here to display item threes price in a
message box we should get 10 message box
time show item 3 dot price and since the
integer we're gonna have to convert it
into a strings which will say died
Tuesday all right so now I may be bug
here we should just get 10 in the
message box yep perfect alright so
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
