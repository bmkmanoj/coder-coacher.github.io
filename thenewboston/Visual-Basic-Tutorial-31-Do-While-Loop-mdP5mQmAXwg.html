slash on live gamer for the New Boston
in this tutorial we're going to be
taking a look at the do-while loop so
basically what the do-while loop is is
it sounds very similar to the do until
loop but the concept of it is completely
opposite now what I mean by this is that
the do one two loop will perform a set
of code until a value or until something
is true
now the do-while loop is completely
opposite it will perform a block of code
while a value is true and then once that
value is false it's going to stop so
let's go ahead and make a couple demos
of this so go ahead and make a new
project we will call it do-while loop
make sure you've selected console
application and go ahead and click okay
so we'll just give that a second to load
here now let's zoom in a bit let's go
ahead and add console dot readline so I
don't forget this when we try to run our
program and now let's come up right
above that and we're going to create a
variable so we'll use the dim keyword
we'll just call it num1 as integer and
we'll set it equal to zero now let's go
ahead and make our do-while loop so
we're going to start off by using the do
keyword which the description says
repeats a block of statements until a
baloon boolean condition is true so now
we're going to add wild so repeats a
block of statements while a balloon
booth lean condition is true so do while
num 1 is less than or equal to 15 now
you can see that as the loop for us so
that it'll loop back up to the do-while
statement after every iteration of the
loop and you can see we did less than or
equal to 15 in this now if we just did
less than 15 then it would
printout until it got to 14 and then it
would stop so we just add the equal so
it will print all the way to 15 so we'll
just do console dot write line num1 okay
so now we're going to increment num1
because we don't then it's just going to
run forever so we'll go ahead and do
num1 plus equals 1 so now you can see
that if we run this we get 0 to 15
so I finish the load here
I don't know why it's been doing this to
me lately but um let's go ahead and
we'll take this statement right here
number one plus equals one we'll cut
that out and then we'll add it before
our print statement or our right line
statement so basically what this is
going to do it's going to add one two
numbers to number one first and then
it's going to print it out so we're
going to start at the value one and go
all the way to 16 now you may be
wondering why does it go to 16 well
because in the last one we had num1 plus
equals 1 after our console dot write
line so it was equal to 16 after we
printed out 15 and then it looped up
back to the top and said oh no it's not
less than or equal to 15 so let's go
ahead and quit out of this okay so if we
do num1 plus equals 1 before then it
will go to 16 and then it'll come back
up and say oh it's not less than equal
to 15 let's go ahead and exit out of
here so that was a quick tutorial on how
to do do-while loops go ahead and
practice some do-while loops some do
until loops from the tutorial before
this - once you got those down go ahead
and move on to the next tutorial and
