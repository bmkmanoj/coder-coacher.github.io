tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm gonna be
showing you audio the date time clicker
control so all you need for this
tutorial is the button and a date/time
picker
just go over your toolbox and drag a
date/time picker over and as you can see
right here we now control that will
allow us to choose a date and/or time
right now it only displays the date even
if you were to make this larger but I'm
going to show you how to choose the time
as well later so let's just do bug right
here and look at our control so you can
change the date and the time by clicking
this little log down button right here
and we can now select our date so if we
want to make it July 14 do that July 4th
you know you as well if you want to
change the years we change it to 2009 or
anything that you'd like but yeah that's
how to work a control now in order to
make the time be displayed you just
don't want to have the date time picker
selected and go over to the properties
panel then under format just change it
to something different the long is just
will display just like how it is right
now a short is the shorthand version of
the date the time well obviously display
the time and the custom will allow us to
free your own custom format so if we
wanted to have the date and the time you
can do that and in order to create your
own custom format you just have to type
the format that you want inside of this
box in order to find out what to type
for the format you want just go on
google and type in day time picker
custom format property and then click on
the first link it should be MSDN and
right here we just have a table
displaying all the different formats
we're going to have so if you wanted to
have the one or two too today so if we
wanted it to display the 12 since it's
the 12th of July you give you just put a
lowercase D so we just go back in the C
sharp type a lowercase D right in here
and we should get 12 and semester in
this date time trigger if we get 12 if
you wanted to have it
doubt to today since today is Tuesday
stipend $3 case DS or four lowercase T's
sorry and yeah we get Tuesday and I'm
not going to go through every single one
here because it explains it pretty well
but yeah you can create your own custom
format I already have some created just
to show you guys the first one is
basically the wrong version of the date
with time as well so see right there we
have a long date and we also the time
second one is the short version of the
date and out of the time ago yep and you
can also screw the fonts in your day
time clicker so if you wanted to font to
something different just click this
little drop down arrow right here and go
down to the name which is the font name
and just click this little drop down
arrow and now you can choose all the
different fonts or choose from all the
different fonts I'll just make it hot
tea but yeah just change this slightly
you can make it look old or you want to
make it old yeah I'm going to do that
though other property change as well you
can also mess with the calendar colors
I'm not going to do that seems fine to
me
umm yeah so you can as you can see you
can mess with the like how it looks but
I think it looks pretty fine the way it
is the last thing I'm going to show you
is how to do something with what the
user actually selects on the date/time
picker so this double click on the
button right here and in order to get
what the user is selected in the day
time picker just to date time picker one
or whatever you named your date time
picker dot and then value and the value
is yeah it's a gets or set the date /
time value assigned the control and as
you can see right here returns a
date/time value so we can set this equal
to a date time which we learned in the
last tutorial so we could just create a
new date time right here call it DD you
can set it equal to whatever user
selects in the date/time picker
now
you can obviously do different things
with this using the date-time struck but
I'm not going to get into that we
already learned that in the last
tutorial so I'm just going to have it
display whatever the user selects in a
message box or - message box show and
then BT - string so it'll just convert
the date/time into a string so now me
debug here and click this button
whatever the user selects in this day
time picker should be in a message box
yup seven twelve two thousand eleven
eleven fifty one forty five PM PM it's
going to cut off there but you may see
it so that's pretty much it for this
tutorial on using the date/time picker
control so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
