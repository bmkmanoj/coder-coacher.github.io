tutorial and this story really isn't
tutorial at all we're just going to be
running the program that we built in the
last two tutorials and I actually did
check for errors in the last video and
this program is built perfectly who
woulda guessed and so it's ready to run
so let me go ahead and press this build
and run and show you guys how it works
so the very first thing it does is pop
up a menu and it gives us a choice press
one to print out plain items to four
helpful items press three to print out
harmful items and whenever you want to
create the program press four so let's
go ahead and print out one and this is
going to print out the items that have
no effect on our character so press one
go ahead and hit enter and it's going to
print out chair a shoe and a pencil all
with zero effect on our character so now
let's go ahead and let's get down you
know three or something hit three enter
and it's going to print out ninja meth
and a dirty needle so now let's go ahead
and print two and whenever we hit two to
print out the helpful items is going to
print out fruit candy and soda and now
let's go ahead and press four to quit
the program and our program is going to
end with execution time of 49 seconds
how awesome is that so one thing that I
want to do because it's just going to
annoy me is I want to add a new line
right there and right there so now
whenever you run the program it's going
to you know it just makes everything not
bunched up in one line so if you go
ahead and hit two you can see that you
know it makes it a little bit better so
again there's a lot of different
formatting things that we can do but you
know I just want to make sure it wasn't
bunched together so to print out all the
helpful items um if I go ahead and you
know hit three it will print out are the
harmful items yada yada yada
so basically I wanted to show you guys
that this program does indeed work I
wasn't biessing you and this is how you
can build a program that works awesomely
with a file in this case the object file
or the objects text file so let me guys
let me talk you through how this program
works one last time the very first thing
I want to mention is whenever you're
building a program
takes a bunch of different functions
make sure to prototype your functions
first and foremost if you don't
prototype your functions like this and
try to run it you're going to get an
error message because it's going to come
across this function and it's not going
to understand what it means so that's
why you need to prototype your function
so once you have your functions
prototype let me run this get that error
message out of the way now that you have
your function prototype I'll tell you
guys how this program works the very
first thing we wanted to do was display
a menu to the user and we wanted them to
enter a number 1 2 3 or 4 depending on
their menu choice so what we did is we
built a function to display that menu
name get what they want and we took
whatever they entered and we stored it
in variable called choice and what this
did function did is it returned that
variable choice so it basically stored
that number either 1 2 3 or 4 in the
variable what they want because this
number tells us what they want so after
that we took that number and we first
made sure it wasn't equal to 4 because
remember 4 means they want to quit the
program so whenever they entered for
this while loop ended in the program
quit so what this wallet did is said
alright if they enter any number besides
4 go ahead and run this code right here
because that means that they want
something if they enter 1 it means they
want plain items 2 helpful items 3
harmful items so I said alright test
this variable if they enter 1 2 or 3
if they enter 1 call this function in
display items with the parameter 1 if
they enter 2 it means they want helpful
items so we're going to call display
helpful items and if they enter 3 we're
going to pass in 3 on this display items
function so you're saying all right so
the display item function obviously
displays the proper items to them so say
we passed it the variable 2 whoa it
calls the display items function with a
parameter to it basically Scrolls down
here and cause display items now
remember display items it just prints
out something on the screen it doesn't
give us any integers or strings back so
we made that void
now whenever we pass then 1 2 or 3 it
treated that variable as X so X was
pretty much your choice 1 2 or 3 so the
very first thing that we did in this
function is we open that file because I
mean all the crap that we needed was
inside this file so we open that file
and then we made two variables we made a
name variable to store the name of the
object and we made a power variable to
store how much power that object had
whether it's 0 negative or positive we
then tested what choice they wanted
remember if X which is now the choice is
equal to 1 then it means they want to
display the items with no power the
plain items whenever they entered the
number 2 it means they wanted to display
the helpful items and helpful items just
had a Power greater than 0 so that's why
we printed out the objects with the
power greater than 0 whenever they
entered the number 3 it means they
wanted to display the harmful items the
items that hurt our character so said
all right we're going to test this power
variable and any object with a power
variable that's less than 0 go ahead and
print it out so that is how our program
works and here's what I'm going to ask
one of you guys to do you guys probably
want all the source code for this so
actually what I'm going to do is I'm
going to go ahead and copy this and post
it in my forum under the c++ section so
if you guys want just go ahead and sign
up actually don't even need to sign up
for my form but I would prefer you did
sign up for my form go look in the C++
section and I'll post all the source
code here so if you guys you know are
getting an error in your program
whenever you're working along you can
just go ahead and copy my source code
and it's all there for you guys so thank
you guys for watching so much hopefully
you understand how this program works if
you don't understand then don't flip out
all you need to do is go ahead look at
the source code and once you see it all
together um you guys can understand how
it's all pieced together so again one
last time this is how you build a
program that works perfectly with a file
just like this
and with that being said I want to say
this a lot of well in this tutorial I
showed you guys how to have the user you
know input a number and print out all
the helpful items or harmful items but
in whenever you're developing a game
instead of just printing it out on the
screen you would want you know whenever
your user comes across a helpful item do
you know make them get that much energy
or whenever your character comes across
a harmful item have them you know take
that much energy away from your
character or whenever your character
comes across than item like a building
or a chair or a shoe it has no effect on
the character so aside from printing it
out we would do something different in
this line of code right here but that's
basically um your very first glance at
how games and programs work of files in
a useful program so I'm glad I could
teach this tutorial finally make a
program that's useful instead of
teaching guys just the core concepts I
know a lot of you guys were complaining
that I was just teaching the concepts
and you guys never really got to see how
a program was put together so hopefully
here's a nice little look at how it
works so thank you guys for watching one
last time thank you guys so much for
subscribing and I'm excited to move on
to the next topic so hopefully we're
done working on files at least for now
so thank you guys for watching and I'll
see you guys in next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
