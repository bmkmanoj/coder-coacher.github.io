your 39th python tutorial and this story
I'm going to be going over a little more
about modules hopefully you can
clearance some stuff up for you so in
the last tutorial I showed you guys how
to import a module using import and then
the module name such as actually this
one was swine flu I believe that was a
file name - the py extension and that's
how you imported the module and I showed
you guys how to access functions from
module by using the module name and then
the function name which was test mod and
that is how you can arm access these
functions inside this entire module but
I want to show you guys another couple
handy tricks aside from accessing them
this way with the module name and then
the function name another easier thing
that you might want to do is assign it
to a local variable and this is going to
save you a bunch of typing so instead of
swine flu test mod with empty parameters
you can just put baby or name it
whatever you want a swine flu test mod
without the parameters and then go ahead
and now baby is equal to swine flu test
mod so whenever you want to use this
function inside this module what you
would have to do is just put your
variable name and empty parameters and
then it would automatically call that
function from the module so that's a
handy little trick where you can access
on functions inside your module just
using a single variable and another
thing that I told you guys is right now
we have that function saying this baby
is fat and I showed you guys whenever
you edit this this baby is happy and you
go ahead and save it then you can't just
call it again or it says this baby is
fat again
but what happens if you import the
entire thing again swine flu and then go
ahead and use that module swine flu dot
test mod
it still doesn't work and I told you
guys this because I want to stress the
point you can only import a module once
per program but when I told you guys
that you can't do this without exiting
idle and coming into it again and
importing it again I lied there's a
little trick that you can do where if
your source file right here is edited
what you just did we changed it to happy
you can use the new version with
something called reload in your program
and this is probably the second easiest
thing you're ever going to learn this is
reload and then inside the parameters
put the name of the module so swine-flu
just like that and now you just reloaded
that entire thing and this is the
updated version so instead of putting
import again if you edit your version
you have to put reload and this is once
your module is imported and then you
change your source file you have to put
reload and then this will give you the
new module so now if we use swine-flu I
know what's it call it test mod as you
can see it says this baby is happy and
of course you can do your local variable
trick to assign it to what it was before
but again if you just try to import it
input your new one it won't import again
this is so to help you protect importing
the same thing over another thing that
was already imported so again if you
want to get the new updated version what
you have to do is use the built-in
reload function so that is how you are
well it's just some nifty little tricks
and also how you reload a module source
file after you edited it so I hope you
guys learn a little something more about
modules if you didn't I'll be clearing
this up and I promise you'll understand
much more in the next couple of
tutorials well if you have any questions
you can just leave me a comment or send
me a message and I'll try to answer so
thank you guys for watching don't forget
to subscribe to my channel for all my
latest videos again thank you and I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
