Python tutorial and this is tutorial
that I am sure many of you have been
waiting for we're finally going to build
a graphical user interface so instead of
running our programs from command line
we're actually going to be build a
program that looks appealing and awesome
to whoever is running it so before we
need a or excuse me before we can start
just building programs we need to
download um pretty much all the windows
and buttons and things that make your
program look cool and this is called a
GUI toolkit and GUI stands for graphical
user interface and that's pretty much
what we're looking at right now with
this minimize thing so we can move this
around these buttons and all these
toolbars and stuff that's what we're
going to be building we couldn't do that
before you're running everything to look
like the matrix for McMahon line but now
I'm going to be showing you guys how to
build awesome looking programs so it's
download this thing called a GUI toolkit
go to WX Python there it is right there
and you're going to want to go download
and this is of course like I said the
best GUI toolkit not only in my opinion
but in a lot of people's opinion so once
you're in the download tab scroll down
and you're going to want to run one of
these downloads in Microsoft Windows
most likely I chose this one win32
unicode you probably want a unicode one
but um well just go that in either 32 or
64 depending on your operating system
most of you guys are probably 32 unless
you have some well a 64 one but go ahead
and click that 32 one and I already did
it so I'm not going to do it again or
else be worthless but it's pretty much
just going to give you execute Abul and
once you download that double click it
and it's going to give you a wizard just
click Next about 80 times and after that
you're going to have installed and don't
change any of the defaults because if
you did everything normally it should go
right where python needs
go so once you have that installed and
again if you installed anything ever
before then you're not going to have any
trouble with this go ahead and open
Python and I want to show you guys a
little test to see if it works or not go
ahead and open up a new window and let's
go ahead and start typing what I'm just
going to show you guys a simple window
just to see if it works
first thing you need to do is import WX
and again I'm going to be just copy it
for now I'm going to be teaching guys
this later this is just a test to see if
you downloaded right so download WX app
dot capital a P P with no parameters and
then win equals WX WX frame and end your
parameters in this put none with a
capital n then put window with no
parameters and then put app main loop
with no parameters so import WX app
equals WX tap when equals WX frame
parameter none win show app main loop
now if we go ahead and save this because
we need to save it as something let's go
save as the tune of to use doesn't
really matter we can go ahead and run it
and this is just going to show up a
blank window and as you can see this is
our very first graphical user interface
we actually have a window that we can
minimize move around now in the next
couple of stories I'm going to show you
guys how to add a toolbar to this
buttons input areas and resize and stuff
like that so this is our very first
graphical user program so if you got
this blank frame then you know that it
worked and this is how we can start
building programs that the user can
actually use so again don't pay
attention to any of this stuff right
here this is just a test to see if it
worked and next couple tutorials you'll
know exactly what this means but for now
I'm going to keep you on the edge of Si
and not let you
so um thank you guys for watching do all
that like I said and once you're done
and once that works you're ready to move
on to my next tutorial so don't forget
