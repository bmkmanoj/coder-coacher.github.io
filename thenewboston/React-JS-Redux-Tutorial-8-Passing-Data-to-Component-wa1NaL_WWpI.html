display my list of users right here what
I wanted to do is reiterate exactly how
we got here
and how we are taking this list and
using it in our component because this
is actually the hardest part of redux so
if you guys understand this then you
essentially figured out Redux so it
really isn't that hard so what we did is
we made a reducer and a reducer is just
a little piece of data that we want to
save in our application now every
reducer that we create every little
piece of data we need to combine it into
one big object and we just name that
object all reducers so then we take all
of those different pieces and we make a
big master object called our store so
again all the store is is a bunch of
data any data that you want to store in
your application we're just going to
save it an object called store that's it
and right here what this provider did is
it took all of that data and since we
wrapped up with it right here pretty
much every single component has access
to this data right now so that's it now
you may be asking are right so why don't
you just pass it all in why do you need
this right here well the reason we have
to map state the props is because we
usually don't want to pass in every
single bit of data I mean right now we
only have this list of users but later
on we're going to have movies music
forum posts blogs you know a whole bunch
of stuff
so instead of just taking all your data
and passing it into every component what
we're going to say is actually just take
the users and pass into the users list
that's really all what cares about it
doesn't care about your movies at all so
that's all does connect your main state
or part of your store and pass in to a
component as its properties easy-peasy
so now what we can do is instead of
these list items we can actually display
these
users and let me get rid of this clean
it up a little bit so what I'm going to
do is I'll say um
this creates list items looking good so
again all this function is going to do
is instead of trying to write all our
functionality right here it's just going
to go through get each item in the list
which is a user and turn it into a list
item and I'm not going to print out
everything I'll just print out like
their first name and last name something
that the user can click on so you need
to return some HTML so anytime we want
to loop through part of our state again
remember we can access this as a
property called users so this dot props
dot users is equal to this list right
here so again since we want to loop
through it we just have to call a
function called map so map is going to
loop the Revue array and for each object
in there or each user or just say
actually let me go ahead and do this
actually I'll use a shorthand version so
for each object treat them as user and
for each user what do I want to do well
I just want to go ahead and return I'll
list item
so list item and I'll say user dot first
I didn't name it first not first name
right yep user that first user dot last
so it's going to make a list item with
their first name and last name now I
don't know if you guys remember this
from the last tutorial or the last video
series but anytime you make a list of
items each of these have to have a
unique key so for the key what I also
did is I included a user ID for each one
now since all of these first names are
different you can even use first names
just anything that's different but
basically this key in this case is equal
to user dot ID boom roasted so now if
this rear Enders check it out how
beautiful is that so again what we can
do is we can take in any piece of data
from the entire application and we can
pass it in to user list or any component
that we want as a property and then with
those properties we can pretty much do
whatever we want with them we can
display different bits of data we can
add event handlers which we're going to
be doing soon and man that is one
beautiful piece of software right there
mm-hmm
now another thing I want to point out is
remember any time we make changes to the
store say we add a new user
this component automatically gets
updated we don't have to call a special
update now function we don't have to do
anything weird that's the awesome thing
about reacting Redux all we have to do
is omit in action and whenever it
changes the store whether it's a button
a slider it doesn't matter it
automatically changes the view to
reflect your data properly it is
incredibly beautiful so yeah thank you
guys for watching and also I don't know
if I mention this if you guys want to
donate to my patreon account I'm
actually saving up for a grouchy
sandwich so yeah thank you guys I will
see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
