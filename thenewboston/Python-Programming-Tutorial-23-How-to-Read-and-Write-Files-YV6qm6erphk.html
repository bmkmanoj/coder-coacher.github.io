telling me that my font was too small so
this is my new font hopefully it isn't
too big it's kind of big when I'm just
you know kind of like looking at on the
screen but hopefully um I think a lot of
you guys had smaller resolution monitors
so even when you stretch it out to 1080
the video was still kind of small so
hopefully um that's a good size if it's
not then just leave a comment and I'll
read them and adjust it appropriately
but anyways in this video I'm going to
show you how to read and write files so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to be
creating a file first and then I'll show
you guys how to read from it so to
create a file the first thing we need is
a file object again just name it any
variable I'm going to name it fw4 file
right in other words file create so what
you do is you set this equal to this
function open and what this is going to
do is it's going to open a file or
pretty much prepare a file to be created
or written so the first parameter it
takes is the name of the file what do
you want to name this file that you're
creating well I'll just name it sample
text will create a very simple text file
now the next parameter after this it's
going to take a couple different
characters if you watch my seed
tutorials then you guys are already
familiar with all these but for this
tutorial I'm going to show you guys W in
are the first one is w which means open
a file and write to it so since this
file isn't created yet it's going to
open it and create it and what right
means is it prepares us to write text to
it so of course it's a text file let's
add some text to it now any time you
actually work with a file the first
thing you do is use your file object
mine's named FW and then you write what
do you want to do with that file well
there are a couple different functions
as you can see but what we're going to
do is just write to it basically um it's
like the equivalent of typing on it
simple enough and of course what do you
want to write so writing some stuff in
text file and also what you can do just
like whenever you print out string you
can use a special character backslash N
and that will move to a new line on your
file pretty sweet so now since we're on
a new line we'll go ahead and write
something else FW which is our file
sample.txt and write something else on
this line and we'll just write like I
like can you type Bucky bacon and
actually we could just put this all on
one line but I just wanted to
demonstrate that I don't know this is
just a cool way to do it all right
so whenever we're done working with a
file what we need to do is we need to
close our file object so FW close now
this doesn't take any parameters what it
does is it basically just frees up on
the extra memory so you aren't wasting
it so this object just isn't sitting
around in your computer so now as you
can see oh yeah by the way I deleted
that image from the last store oh just
because I don't know it was making some
clutter so right now whenever we create
this file by running this program you're
going to see a new file appear right
here so keep your eye on this whenever I
run this see that how it just popped up
now let's double click it to check it
out so what it did is it wrote this line
first and then this line and then a bump
down to a new line pretty sweet so that
is how you create files and Python so
now that we know how to write files or
create them let me show you how to read
them so in order to read a file you of
course need another file object and I'm
just going to name this one fr4 file
read you can actually name anything you
want but FR is just easy for me to
remember now again this is just object
that pretty much represents a file so we
need to open some file and this is going
to look familiar
we'll open sample dot txt so this pretty
much says okay
we're working with this file
then we need to tell Python what we want
to do with it well we want to read it
we're not creating anything we just want
to read data from it so the character
for that is our so now whenever we read
all of this data we need somewhere to
store it because we can't just work with
it directly in Python so we need a
variable to store that entire string so
I'm going to store in a variable called
text and just think of this like a
normal string variable so what you do is
make a variable and set it equal to Fr
dot read and what this is going to do is
essentially go to your file read all of
the crap in it and store it in this
variable called text so now we can just
do anything the text that we would with
string variables such as print text or
anything else
so whenever we do this it's going to
print out the contents of this file on
the screen and of course when we're done
remember to close it close and that just
closes the file object so now if we read
this check it out in this first little
chunk of code we actually created it and
then this next one we read the
information that was in it the text all
this stuff and then we just took it
stored it in a variable and printed it
out on the screen and of course just to
be nice to our computer we closed it
gave its back memory so simple enough
that is how you read and write files and
in the next video what I'm going to show
you guys how to do is actually read a
text file from somewhere on the Internet
and this is actually cool whenever
you're like making a bot or web crawler
and you want to crawl a bunch of
webpages get the links in storm in a
text file I'll show you guys have to do
that it's like a really simple version
of we're going to be making like a
really simple version of Google
eventually and I mean really simple not
anywhere that complex but anyways I'll
stop rambling now I'll see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
