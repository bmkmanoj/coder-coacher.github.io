tutorial for the new boston again with
me travis we're going to be doing in
this tutorials basically getting our
toggle button working we're also going
to introduce what the final basically
making a variable final and what that is
in java so what we're going to do is
we're going to have this toggle button
and we're going to set up us
onclicklistener because it's i mean it's
kind of a good review because we've done
this in the past as well and you guys
will get familiar with this because it
is kind of confusing the first time you
see it but again we defined all of our
variables up here in the reference to
the xml we created a toggle button
called pass hog and it's having this
yellow error because we aren't using it
so what we're going to do is we're going
to set up the onclicklistener by typing
out the variable name again within our
on create bracket so it'll be the you
know within the second bracket right
here and so we're going to say pass hog
and then we can set the onclicklistener
by hitting dot set onclicklistener and
there's also an option of set check
change listener but i want to use the
set onclicklistener because later i'm
going to introduce something else so use
the set onclicklistener and again we're
just going to finish off the bracket
right here before we define our
onclicklistener just so we don't get
confused with in all these brackets and
all this code that's going on so again
we don't have an onclicklistener so
we're going to say new view dot
onclicklistener you guys will again get
familiar with this it's kind of looking
and sketchy right now but all you need
to do is click right here and it will
set it up for you and if it didn't you
don't retype it out it should give you a
little help or a clip should give you a
little help and then you just click it
you'll set that up otherwise you guys
can kind of look at how this is set up
at the moment and here we go every time
the past or the toggle button is pressed
we're going to want to do something
within the on click method so we're
going to go within this bracket and what
we're actually going to do is we're just
going to change our edit text from kind
of the password setup that we did
basically right now we set up
the Edit text to have a password set to
true and that's going to kind of block
out whatever we type in give those
little stars or dots or whatever so how
we're going to do that is we're going to
create an if and else statement so
within here we're going to say if and
then we're going to have a bracket
basically we're going to define
something if this is true we're going to
do whatever is within this new bracket
that we just created else meaning that
it's false
we're going to do whatever is within
this bracket so there we go we have a
lot of brackets I'm going to try and
keep those all on the screen so you guys
can follow along if you get confused but
basically if you start a new bracket hit
enter it's going to finish it for you
and then you just do else new bracket
hit enter again there we go we have our
things set up but what we want to check
is if basically if the toggle button is
set to true or if it's turned on and if
it is we're going to do something if not
we're going to do something in this else
statement so how we're going to find
that is by going referencing our again
variable pass hog which is our toggle
button so pass tog and we can hit period
and use a method called is checked
checked and it's a boolean basically
meaning true or false statement those
are the only two options so if it is
checked it's going to be true if it's
false it's not true so I mean if it's
not checked then it's false now what
we're getting is a err over our pass
talk because we're using it within like
a sub bracket out so far basically a sub
bracket you guys can think of it and our
sub method and if we hover over it gives
us a recomme recommendation to change
the modifier to the type final so we're
going to click that and what that does
is it adds this modifier called final
right before we define what our variable
is now basically what final means is
it's not going to change
since this toggle button is always going
to have this reference bridge over to
the XML and not going to change from
that reference bridge we need to say
that it's going to be final because
that's never going to change it's always
going to be that reference
so what we can do is say if is toggled
basically that's the majority of the
lesson I want to show you guys is this F
where else but we're actually going to
get into the coding of setting setting
up the input type for the most part if
we want to be a password type or a
regular text and the next tutorial so
get kind of familiar with this layout
again we set the onclick list sir and we
set up a tiff or else statement within
our on click method and we also set this
to final because that reference is never
going to change and that will allow us
to access that variable within these sub
methods as well so thanks again for
watching guys and I'll catch you in the
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
