and welcome to this video tutorial for
the new Boston in the last video we
looked at HTTP requests in jQuery and
how it's similar it's very similar to
Ajax functionality we're essentially
using our this syntax here and we're
using the get HTTP request to send a
file sorry variables to this file and
then return the data so if you haven't
watched the last video go ahead and
watch that now in this video we're going
to be looking at the difference between
get and post and there's not really any
difference we're just going to be
talking about why we would use it
instead of gap and then we're going to
be supplying some additional parameters
to this as well just so you can see how
we pick them up in PHP so the first
thing I'm going to do is go ahead and
change get to post now remember our
original example returned the return the
reversed string that we typed in here
now because we've changed this to post
our get variables here are no longer
valid so we're going to also need to go
ahead and change them to post
okay so let's pull up our browser and
refresh the page I'm going to go ahead
and type in my name and click go you can
see that we've retrieved exactly the
same result as when we use to get now if
if you have you know written code before
either in PHP or another language you'll
understand that the difference between
get and post is one the security aspect
I guess where you don't show you aren't
able to modify the variables from the
URL and also the length of data that you
can send so let's show another example
let's say let's say that this text area
here with the ID of string was actually
a text area field
create a text area and we'll break down
the input box down there so the ID is
going to still be string but we'll just
change a few values like the rows and
the columns and now we have on our page
a text area so first of all it would be
more appropriate to use poast in this
case because we are allowed to supply a
lot more data in here going up to the
fact that post now allows us to have
this data it's still going to process
this data to reverse PHP and it's still
going to send this string along as an
INT as a variable called input now let's
go ahead and also create another field
so I'm going to go and break in fact
we'll put this in a paragraph here and
we'll create another paragraph just up
here with the input type of text and
we'll give this an ID of name okay so
let's go ahead and preview that in our
browser we've now got a field here and a
field here we're going to send both
these with the post HTTP request in Ajax
but we're going to send two different
values so the first thing we want to do
is change or add another variable just
up here and I'm going to call that name
so we're creating a variable called name
now this is equal to and remember we're
going to use a selector a hash because
we've called this input ID name to
reference with a hash and then name and
then again dot Val so now we have an
additional variable called name which
we're going to send along to this
reverse dot PHP as well so I'm going to
use a comet just after here and we're
going to use exactly the same syntax as
we did here but this time I'm going to
send a variable called name and that's
going to be equal to name I'm going to
go ahead and change this to string
I tend to do this personally I call the
variable that I'm passing to PHP the
same variable that I've stored in
JavaScript now it can get quite
confusing but for me this is just the
way I prefer to do it as long as you
remember that this is the name of the
variable and this is the value of the
variable the mission can confuse you too
much so now what we're doing is we are
taking the name and the string so the
name from this box here and the string
from this box here we are then storing
them inside variables in JavaScript
we're sending them to reverse dot PHP
with a variable named string and the
variable name name with the string value
and the name value and we're still
returning this data here okay so now
we're going to go over to reverse dot
PHP and we're just going to change how
this works it's no longer going to
reverse our string but we're just going
to relay both bits of information back
so additionally we need to check that we
have posted the net the string and here
we need to check your poster the name so
now we have two variables being
submitted to this file we need to check
both of them have been set we're then
going to create two more variables name
it is going to equal dollar underscore
post name and string is going to equal
dollar underscore post string now with
regards to security if you're taking
anything like this to a live server you
have to still be aware that if you're
posting data without sanitizing it first
you could be allowing yourself into some
security problems the best thing to do
is if you're you know going to put these
into a database or anything use the
MySQL real escape string function or at
least if you are posting these to a page
use the HTML entities function I'm going
to leave these out for now I just
thought I'd mention it just in case
anyone had any problems with this okay
so now that we've done this we can go
ahead and construct a center
that we're going to output so I'm first
of all going to say name then says and
then the string so now we've passed both
these variables and we're going to echo
them out in a sentence so we can include
of course HTML in here I'm just going to
make this italics and I'm going to make
the name bold okay so now that we've
done that let's go ahead and test this
on the page so I'm going to write my
name in here and I'm going to write a
short sentence in here how are you so
when we click go
you see we retrieve this information
back now you'll notice that there's a
problem here and we actually have tags
as opposed to the actual interpreted
HTML now if we go back to our Ajax JS
file you'll see that we use the text
function to apply this returned data
from a reverse dot PHP into our feedback
div area in actual fact instead of using
text if you need to you know pass HTML
and actually have it render as HTML you
need to go ahead and use the HTML
functionality so now let's go ahead and
just click go again and actual fact that
that's going to work so we refresh I'm
going to type Alex and hello how are you
I'm going to click go and now it says
Alex says hello how are you so hopefully
with this example you can start to see
the more practical applications of using
the get and post HTTP requests almost
always you're going to use the post HTTP
request because you need to allow for
sending large amounts of data and also
making sure that people don't access
your PHP file for example PHP forward
slash reverse PHP they could then go
ahead and modify the URL to input fields
for example Alec
equals name and string equals hello for
example okay but because we're using
post data this isn't possible from the
URL bar it all depends on the data
you're sending I mean in this case we're
sending a text field which could contain
a large amount of characters so we need
to ensure that this is catered for using
the post HTTP request</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
