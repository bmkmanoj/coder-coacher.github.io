today we're gonna be learning about
using selections to generate some
complex layer masks and we're gonna do
this by using the type tool and I'm just
gonna create a mask out of some type and
it's gonna be pretty cool-looking so
what we got here is just load up an
image and I like this one because it has
a lot of the sea color going on in here
or a lake or whatever they're on and I
want to use that in my text so go ahead
to your text area and we're gonna click
on it we're gonna scroll down to the
horizontal type mask tool and go ahead
and select whatever color or whatever
font you want I'm gonna select Bay this
new if that's how you say I'm not really
sure if that's how you say it or not
it's a weird looking well anyways let's
start typing here and looks like I got a
72 point font and let's see how big that
is not big enough let's go to like 200
maybe because that was really small
alright alright then we'll make this one
really big 400 or something like that
well that's good enough all right no I
got that going on and now I have this
mass that's being created here so I all
I need to do is click on well I have my
mass select art my mask selected make
sure I have my layer going on here
I got a select my layer and I just had
to click on the add layer mask button
and now I have taken color information
from the image used a mask and now I
have that color information on my text
and that's what's coloring my text now I
can take this and oops let me select
this mask here and I can move it around
if I select the actual frigging mask and
if you look over here you can see that
the image is moving around wet while I
move the mask and that's so that you can
keep the same colors instead of the mass
moving around and picking up other color
from around the image so it's always
gonna stay in the same place when you're
moving it around let me put a background
up real quick so we can see a little
better let's see how black looks there
we go
that looks cool so now we've got this
image here and that's how you create a
mask some complex some complex layer
masks going on there and you can use
this with other kinds of selections you
can add multiple selections together you
could use your lasso tool if you wanted
to or the magic wand tool any kind of
selections like that now one of the cool
things about layer masks is that you can
add applied the layer styles to a masked
image so if we come down here we've got
our different layer styles and we can
add like uh any of these to it so let's
uh let's just go to bevel and emboss and
now you can see that the layer style
works on the mask and it's just like
adding some cool effects to
so this is it without and this is width
so that's one of the cool features of
being able to use a layer mask on an
image and creating text out of it so
that's all I wanted to teach you about
about the generating some complex layer
masks and hopefully you guys learn
something and I look forward to seeing
you in my next tutorial see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
