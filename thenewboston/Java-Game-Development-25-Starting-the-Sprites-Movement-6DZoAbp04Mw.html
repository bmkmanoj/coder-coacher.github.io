25th ave game development tutorial and
in this tutorial we're going to be
working in the main class or the class
with the main method and we're actually
going to be running our sprite so now
that we have that sprite class all made
we can actually create an object from it
and make a spray on our screen and well
just watch it move around I guess so
let's go ahead and in case we really
mess up anything instead of just writing
or fixing or editing this main Bucky
class go ahead and copy everything in
here create a new class and name it
Bucky - and this way in case we F
anything up we have we pretty much mess
it up on this new class instead of our
old one so now we know we have an old
class to go back to if need be
so of course we've got to name this
Bucky to Bucky to Bucky to be done so
BAM how easy was that so the first thing
that we have to do is we need to import
one more thing import Java X dot swing
doll just to import all of the Java X
Swing components because we're going to
be using them and after this remember we
had all of our objects so we can access
the different classes and since we just
built a new class called sprite and we
can't put s because we use that in our
screen manager class we're actually
going to have to type out sprite so I
know that's the first time I name the
object that was bigger than two letters
but I mean o to save you guys from
confusion so now what we need to do is
in our scroll down to your load images
method and when you load images after
you create your animation right
here.look you created your Hana mission
that has two scenes in it go ahead and
under this what do we need to do the
first thing that we need to do is create
a new sprite object and remember a
sprite is the same thing
is your image and it's the same thing is
your animation there one in the same
so go that spray and set it equal to new
spray and as your parameters
take what animation you want to use this
pretty much is saying what do you want
to make move around the screen and we're
just going to use that a right there
that animation so now this animation was
of a guy blinking in one spot and now
that we're tuner turning into spray he's
going to be blinking but he's going to
be moving around screen instead of
staying in one spot so after this what
do we need to do well we need to start
them out with a velocity and it can be
anything you guys want but spray dot set
velocity X I'm going to go with like 0.3
F years could this is pretty much just a
speed how fast is you going the X left
or right and we also need to set his Y
velocity if we only set one then he
would I mean if we put this a zero point
zero then he would only go back and
forth but we want to go in all different
kinds of angles up and down left and
right so we can either set those we can
even set those at two different
velocities but I'm just going to keep
them the same so I mean why not right
so now when we're done that we need to
go down to movie loop and right here our
movie loop method right here and this is
the main loop that plays the movie and
what do we need to do in here well
instead of updating our animation right
here we can go ahead and take this out
right here and we're going to make a new
update method that's going to be time
passed right there and this is going to
take control of all of our updates and
as you can see this is underlined right
here because um we didn't create the
method yet we're going to be creating it
later
and if we're saying alright if this
updates the spray what the heck updates
the animation well if you go in arm your
spray class right here we updated the
animation when we called this update
method for the sprite so that's why we
don't need to update the animation twice
since
we call it here that's why we are able
to take it out in our main movie loop so
now we can't forget to build an update
method we'll be doing that later but for
now let's go ahead and scroll down and I
guess you have to do one more thing and
let me see if I figure out anything we
updated that all right and our draw
method right here let's go ahead and
take out this G draw image because it's
no longer going to draw an image anymore
actually we could just go ahead and take
this part out instead of drawing a
single image what it's going to draw is
that sprite so let's go ahead and the
first thing we want to do is go sprite
dot get image so instead of drawing just
a single image we're going to want to
draw the sprite whatever is in the
sprite class and whatever image it is so
it's going to go ahead down here to reg
get image and instead of going to return
whatever image is playing at the
animation at that time and now we have
to give it two parameters where do you
want to appear on the screen or in other
words where do you want me to draw this
image pretty much well we want you to
draw it at get X and the get Y value
since this is going to be changing we
can't just type in 400 300 because these
are the values that need to be changing
constantly and what we need to do to
this is actually round off since
whenever we call get X and get Y it
might give us a decimal point number and
if we say all right draw it one point
three pixels it's going back one point
three pixels is either one or two make
up your mind so that's why when you do
math dot round and in your round method
type sprite dots get X and what this is
going to do is edit X value it's going
to round it off the pixel off because
you remember you can't draw in half a
pixel it's either 1 2 5 10 or whatever
has to be a whole number and it's going
to get that X value of where a sprite
should be and draw there so now let's go
ahead and copy this
copy and do the same thing for y
control-v get y and for your image
reserver go ahead and type in null and
don't forget a comma right there so now
what we're doing is we're drunk the
spray and what this means get image
alright do you want the guys to be
opening our eyes close well that depends
on the animation we wanted to draw at
the x value rounded off to the next
nearest pixel at the Y value rounded off
to near explicit near nearest pixel and
for the image reserved we're just
putting all because I mean we don't need
to go over that right now so I guess the
only thing we have to do here the only
error we're getting is we need to build
this update method in this update method
updates the position of the sprite when
it goes up your screen so in the next
tutorial we'll be doing that in the next
tutorial we will be finally watching the
sprite bounce around our screen so thank
you guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I'll see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
