there's two I'm gonna have to tie these
together but still should be good
so now they've just got to tie all these
together and I should have a line that's
thin enough for fishing I don't know
anything about knots so I'm not really
sure how I'm supposed to tie these
I'm probably gonna need to find a branch
or something to wind it around to since
I don't you know be nice to have a
fishing reel
well that didn't work out
freaking bugs there are a lot less bugs
down by the beach but there we go I just
cut off the slack
just cut off the slack now should be
good
the knife on my sandal so doesn't you
sandy
oh yeah so each of these pieces is about
five feet long which I probably needed
ty Lee's six together I'm guessing so I
got three tied together so far and it's
about 12 feet I want to say right over
left left over right I wish I knew how
to tie up rep or not but these seem
pretty strong I'm I'm pulling them
before I make the final cut and I
definitely don't think that they're
going to come loose so they should be
good
want tight
that's like
and I also tied this one end to a little
it's like a rule on the tree so that way
if I'm not holding on to the line then
the fishing isn't going to pull it in
and also it's gonna help it from not
getting tangled up so so here's my liner
right here
I tied to one a bit to this little root
from the tree and it kept it from not
getting tangled let me step back and
show you guys can see so that should be
plenty long enough I think the deepest
part is basically right in the middle so
I think I'm gonna stand right on there
but before I do that I need a sinker
because even if I make a hook which
that's gonna be the most difficult thing
whenever I make the hook and put like a
worm or a bug on it there's not going to
be enough weight to throw it out real
deep so I need a sink or something to
tie it on like a rock or some weight so
I can throw it out more than like a foot
and then I need a widow a hook and
that's going to be difficult I'm trying
to find something that can make a hook
out of I want it alive I want to find a
branch a still alive so it doesn't crack
something big enough because it might be
good and I asked my not something like
this right here one of these to see
that's alive so I don't want something
dead because if I have something dead
then as soon as I cut it it's going to
snap so one of these should be good so
let me go ahead and break these off and
try to make a hook out of them that's
how this works I try to make a hook out
of this little crevice right here
that be careful not to break it
it's definitely strong enough where it
could hold a fish
there's a start I just got to take this
piece off and I know that uh if there
are fish in here which I didn't even see
any so far then they're probably not
going to be that big so I need to make
the hook small enough where the fish
aren't gonna be afraid to bite it
to start
and this
I need this to be really sharp
so there it is the final fishing hook I
would like for it to be a little bit
smaller but if I make it any smaller
then I think it's going to be weak and
this hook is actually really strung now
there's no way a fish would ever break
this unless it's just huge and it's nice
and sharp and I also made a little notch
in the hook right where my finger is
right here so I could tie the rope on
and it's right below but not in the wood
so the ropes not going to come loose so
there you have it now let me go find
some bait in see if it works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
