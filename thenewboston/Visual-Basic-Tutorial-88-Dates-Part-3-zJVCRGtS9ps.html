youtube.com/scishow on live gamer for
the new Boston and in this tutorial
we're going to be creating our own dates
and changing the values of those dates
now if you remember from the last
tutorials when we created created a date
object we could only get the current
date and time now we can set our own
date and time in our object so let's go
ahead and we will declare another
variable so we'll call will declare it
change date as date so now what we can
do is we can type current date equals
and to put our date in we use the pound
character and then we put our data in
using the month/day/year format now if
you live over in the UK you use the day
month year but in Visual Basic you
always need to use the American Way I
don't know why they do this but it keeps
you from confusing them so there's only
one way you can do it which is month day
and year so we'll just go ahead and do
October 20th
let's do the Year 2300 and we'll go
ahead and set the we'll just leave the
date at 12:00 a.m. so we could set the
date if we wanted to so but instead if
we just leave nothing there it'll
automatically set that date so let's go
ahead and display this date so message
box dot show current date dot to string
if we go ahead and run this if we click
show date we get October 20th 2300 at
12:00 a.m. now we can also manipulate
these dates to add certain values to it
now we can add days months years seconds
and hours and whatever we want so let's
go ahead and set our change date to a
change to current date change so type
change
date equals current date dot add and you
can see we get ad days add hours add
milliseconds add minutes add months
seconds ticks and years so let's just go
ahead and add days here so how many days
we want to add well the value that we
pass to this sub right here is a double
so let's just use a number let's just
add five days to it and then we'll type
message box dot show and we will show
changed date dot and let's just do to
long date string so let's go ahead and
run this and you can see that here's our
form and when we click show date we get
October twentieth 2300 click OK we get
Thursday October 25th 2300 so let's go
ahead and change this to two string
instead so instead of October on instead
of October 20th we get October 25th so
let's just run this one more time and
we'll look at it with the exact same
formats so click show date October 20th
and we add days we get October 25th now
we can also add years so let's go ahead
and add some years to this let's add 500
years let's go ahead and run this show
day we get the Year 2300 and this we
added 500 years so we get 2800 now you
can also use negative values inside of
the parameters for add anything so if
you want to add seconds or months you
can do a negative so let's subtract 150
or 250 years from our current date which
should give us the value 2050 so we get
2300 and then 2050 so
on go ahead and make some date objects
and set them to certain dates that you
want remember that you have to use the
month day and then year format and you
enclose this inside of pound symbols and
then you can add years or months or
whatever you like to the date and you
can also use negative numbers and the
argument for that is double so go ahead
create some days to manipulate them make
your own dates play with those and then
once you are familiar with those go
ahead and move on to the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
