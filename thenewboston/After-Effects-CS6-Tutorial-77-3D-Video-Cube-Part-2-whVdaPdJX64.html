way yet squares on the end are kind of
annoying
now you're gonna know what has been
moved because our you're gonna know what
access to use because we're on the blue
and we're moving the Z and the Z is here
at the end alright that looks good
now we can check in our custom view to
see if everything's matching each other
and it looks like it is so we've got
that no I'm not worried too much about
which way they're facing and everything
like that we can rotate it the way we
want to when it's all put together so
now we're gonna go over here into our
right view I'm gonna click on it so I I
know I'm in it
and in the right view we're going to
take our side here and we're gonna
duplicate it we gotta be clicked on the
layers panel here and ctrl D to
duplicate now I'm going to change these
cut ones to a different color so I know
that these are the top at the bottom and
we're gonna have to change the
orientation and we're gonna go on the
x-axis here let's see we got going on
and if you hold shift it's going to nope
it's gonna go crazy for me
well if you don't know if you hold shift
I thought it was gonna snap but it's not
so 270 is what we're gonna be at that's
the multiple of 90 degrees so that's
good for our orientation now we're gonna
change our position and we're gonna use
this right so we don't need to use this
top anymore we can probably switch to
our two views now so you can see it a
little better right
and move on the Z so it's in the middle
and then on the wine so it's up at the
top
now if the video is getting in the way
you can come down to this preview
section with the lightning in it click
on it and come down to wireframe and
then you can check out that way
no here's the peach one let's check in
our custom view here to see what it
looks like
let's click off everything I don't want
to have these masks on
it looks like it's right on there now we
just need to put something on the bottom
okay done looking around
so let's duplicate this we're gonna move
it to the bottom I'm gonna change it
back to what I had it on before I switch
to my regular tool or my selection tool
click in here and duplicate it and move
this down to the move it down to the
bottom I'm gonna just select them all by
accident
so you need to move it up a little
probably
it looks good
let's go to our main camera view see how
it looks
so it looks like we got our cube here
now it's topple everything so it's all
our videos here so we've got it look
we've got it all nice there and we're
gonna click on and select all of them
we're gonna go to the layer pre-compose
and we're going to name this video cubed
this way we don't have to worry about
parenting or anything like that so I hit
OK there and now it puts it all into one
layer let's go into my active camera
here we're going to I'm just going to
zoom the camera out a little
well that's in the custom view that's
why no I need to make it a 3d layer
there we go that's why I was being goofy
and I'm gonna click on this collapse
transformation tool so it puts it into a
box
now let's means move our video to where
we want it to be in the middle here and
what's head into just one view so I you
can see it better now we can rotate this
like that and it all stays together
and we don't have to worry about it ever
doing everything and uh parenting or
anything like that I'm gonna save it and
right now our video cube is playing
everything at the same time maybe you
want your video to be playing at like
different sections of the video each
time so we can double click on our video
cube here and it'll bring up our our
composition that we made I'll just take
your layer here and hold shift and just
drag it and it'll change the point of
the video so it's not all the same
everywhere you want to drag it to the
left if you're starting in the beginning
and you want to make sure it doesn't
come too far over because then I mean
you won't really see where you're like
video you the video will cut off at the
end obviously that's what I was trying
to say
and there we go
let's go back to our layers panel here
our layers comp there and we've got the
video cube there I'll rotate it around
so I can see what's going on I'm just
going to use my rotation tool change it
to orientation yeah there you go you got
a video cube so you can animate that
cube any way you want to I'm not gonna
go over just animating the cube around
you can you can do that on your own
using the basic animation techniques
I've showed you in previous videos I
just wanted to show you how to make the
cube and we did that using past
techniques that I went over about 3d
space so thanks for watching and see you
in the next tutorial
have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
