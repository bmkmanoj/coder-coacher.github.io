and this is another video tutorial for
the new Boston now in this video we're
going to go through some basic setup and
then some code in order to detect the
user's browser however the first stage
of this you need to obtain a file that
needs to be placed inside a directory
preferably inside your exam setup or
whatever a distribution you're using of
a PHP package of PHP Apache package and
you also need to modify your PHP ini
file so before you do anything even if
you think this file is up-to-date we
need to find a file called it's called
browse cap dot ini so if you haven't got
this file inside your I mean I mean I'm
in xampp here and then in PHP you need
to you need to have this file somewhere
existing so you can redownload it if you
google for it you'll be able to find it
at some somewhere available to download
just make sure it's the file for for PHP
and not for I thought for PHP so okay
once you've obtained this file copy it
over to a directory and that you can
access and you can specify in your PHP
to i/o nice for file so once you've
found this file we go to PHP to ini
let's find that down here okay we're
going to open this so I already have
this open and I've searched for browse
cap and I can see this here and I've got
browse cap equals something so here
we're going to specify where this browse
cap file is kept and in my case it's C
colon backslash xampp and then it's in
PHP and then we need to specify the file
name itself so once you've done this you
can go ahead and file save now what we
need to do is we're going to open up our
control panel for xampp
and I'm going to stop our Apache service
I'm going to click stop now that stops
and I can restart it now so our PHP a
night dire knife settings have been
initialized by our reset of this now
what we need to do is come into context
and I'm going to introduce you to a
function that's going to allow us to get
data about the browser so now if you've
correctly downloaded browser copter and
I put it inside a directory and changed
your PHP dot ini to point to that file
this should work if it doesn't work then
I check you've it done absolutely
everything right and you've restarted
Apache as well
so inside context I'm going to create a
new variable called browser and this is
going to be equal to a function get
browser now this function takes two
arguments the first argument is the user
agent which we could obtain from the
dollar underscore server HTTP user agent
however we're not going to do that we're
just going to specify the value of null
now the second the second argument that
we need to provide is whether we want
this to be returned as an array and we
do want this to be 10 returned as an
array because that's how we're going to
use it later on so you just simply put
true here can put 1 if you want it's
probably just better to put true so how
are we going to echo out all of the
array contents well we're going to use
the print off this and we're going to
obviously put the browser reference to
the array in there
so now let's refresh the page and see
what happens right ok so you can see
that it's returned quite a few bits of
information about my browser now you can
see things like Chrome in here Chrome 10
etc as well as some other information if
you're not receiving any of this
information like Chrome Mozilla anything
like that then you may have incorrectly
downloaded or incorrectly reference this
browse CAPTA ini so again make sure
that's correct
you major C's of star under this browser
name regex or something so if you have
the following information in front of
you you will be good to proceed so this
is the first stage to using this get
browser function and in the second part
of this tutorial we're going to look at
how we can extract information from this
I'm also going to test it with a couple
of other browsers to make sure this
information is correct before we start
praying if statements to detect the
user's browser now just before I go in
this part I want to talk about why we
might want to detect the user's browser
it's always an important part of when
you are viewing a web page to format
things correctly for users and also you
might want to notify users that using
another browser might be better to
display your web page so when you are
when you are creating a web page it
might look slightly different in other
browsers and if you want to say say to a
user download download Google Chrome
it's this is going to work a lot better
then you can recommend say Google Chrome
to your users in order for them to
switch their browser in order for them
to view your page lot better so how are
we going to work out what we're going to
say if they're say using Firefox or
Internet Explorer we might want to say
to them you're using this browser please
change to Google Chrome to view this
website correctly and vice-versa as well
a web page might be better displayed in
in Internet Explorer or it might be
better displayed in Firefox as well as a
host of other browsers that you can use
so including the State Opera or Safari
so in the next part of the tutorial
we're going to look at how we can
extract some of this information and
detect the user's browser and just print
a message to them telling them what
their browser is but we're not going to
give them any of this rubbish
information we're basically going to
give them it a single a single string so
we're going to give them Chrome or
Firefox or Mozilla or Internet Explorer
do you know what I mean something like
that so we're not going to be giving
them chrome 10.0 or chrome with the
platform a sari or chrome like this we
could just going to give it in lowercase
and we're going to use this some of this
information to detect what browser the
user might be
using</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
