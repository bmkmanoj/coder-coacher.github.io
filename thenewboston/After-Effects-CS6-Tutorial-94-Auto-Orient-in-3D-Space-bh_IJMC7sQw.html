effects cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and I want
to show you about Auto orienting in 3d
in this tutorial
sometimes when you're making a camera
move and going through your 3d scene you
get these ugly angles on your images or
whatever you've got going on in your
scene and you don't want to spend a
whole bunch of time fixing them well you
can use the auto orient just like in 2d
so that the the images or whatever
you're animating towards always points
at your camera so I'm gonna show you
real quick I made this motion path for
my camera and I'll switch to the top
mode here and you can see I made this
motion path for my camera where it flies
through the scene and I move this in the
middle so you can see it's just going
through the scene and I've got I'll show
you the properties here I don't want
this on I've got the position and the X
rotation changing and you see it comes
up to this at the end and it's got this
weird angle where it's like looking up
at it but it's tilted weird and I don't
like that so I'll show you how to make
these so that they are to orient towards
your camera so it's the same as when you
ought to orient in 2d on a motion path
so just click and select your objects
here and you can either right-click on
it and come to transform Auto Orient or
you can click on layer transform Auto
Orient and if you have all three
selected and click on orient towards
camera they're all going to auto Orion
so you can do it all at once now if I
scrub through and just take a look at
these in the top view here and watch
what they do when the camera moves along
you can see they're moving to be in the
direction that the camera is and now
when I get to this end one it's at a
decent angle and it looks kind of nice
so they're going to orient towards the
camera and since I'll go into like a
custom view and you can see it again
so that's how that goes I'm going to
ramp review a click for you and you can
look over here on this side
so that's a that's Auto orienting you
can also auto orient the camera itself
so I'm gonna turn off auto orienting on
these layers here transform and then
Auto Orient and I'm turning those off
and I'm going to take my rotation
keyframes off so I don't want those on
there cuz they'll mess with it now all I
have now is a motion path for my camera
as you can see in the left view and this
is how it goes now if I right-click on
the camera and go to my Auto Orient I've
got orient along the path and orient
towards point of interest I'll start
with path first and this is how this
camera goes in this one it's like more
of like a sweeping motion now you're
gonna have to probably keyframe your
rotation properties so that you're
facing towards the right ways but this
shows more of like a fluid sweeping
motion while you're going through your
scene one downfall of orienting along
the path is that the camera doesn't do
what they call a bank and that's
rotating on the z-axis so you're gonna
have to definitely wrote or move that
property around to get what you like and
it swerves a lot it might swerve a
little more than you expect when you
orient along the the path for the camera
so you may have to edit your position
keyframes so that it doesn't go so crazy
now if you want the camera to follow the
same
point all the time while it's moving
along its path
you can orient towards the point of
interest the way to do that is to go
ahead and go to your auto orient pop-up
box and just click on orient towards
point of interest and hit ok and now you
may want to set your point of interest
on something and you can do that in your
your orthographic view so if I take my
pan behind tool here I can put it on the
point of interest right on this maybe
this last guy here and then if I go to
my right view we'll make sure that it's
in there
yeah it's it's right on the guy there so
that's we got that where it's supposed
to be and I'll come back to my custom
view so you can see what's going on a
little better and zoom in so we've got
the point of interest on this guy back
here now if I move along in the timeline
he's always looking at that guy and of
course you're going to have to animate
your maybe your rotation values so my X
rotation had been moved to negative 8
probably when I was messing around with
it earlier but now I have him right on
the guy at the end and it comes right up
to him so if you need to focus on
something moving through other stuff
that may be before it or after it you
can always orient towards your point of
interest so those are the different ways
to auto orient in 3d and they're pretty
helpful and help you not use as many
keyframes and anytime you use a lesser
amount of keyframes it's a less work
that you have to do in case you got to
change something later so thanks for
watching this one and thanks for
watching all the tutorials that I've
posted so far even if you haven't
watched every single one
I appreciate it when you take the time
to view any of them so I'll see you guys
in the next tutorial have a good one
make some awesome projects see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
