tutorial in this tutorial I'm going to
be getting to the actual good stuff in
Java so in this tutorial we'll be
showing you guys what if statement is
and how to use it to make a decision
there's going to be a lot going on the
story so pay attention it's going to be
sweet
what if statement is is pretty much how
your computer makes decisions you're
going to give it a test such as am i a
boy or my girl and your computer looks
at this and if it says your boy it does
one block of code but if it says you're
a girl it does another block of code for
example you could build a program if
you're a boy take you to a boy website
but if you're a girl take you to a girl
website or something like that so what
we need to do here is build a if
statement and to do that go ahead and
write if now after that you have
something in parentheses
now what in is in your parentheses is
called the condition but what the
condition actually means condition is
just like the technical term what it is
is actually a test whatever you want to
test you're going to have two choices
for now say we have a variable called um
let's just name it test and let's make
it int int test is equal to 6 so now we
have a variable that we can test so
let's go ahead and test this and let's
go ahead and say if test
is equal to
9 and this brings me to another point
you're testing operators there um let's
see probably six different ways I've
taught my head that you can test the
first thing you can do is to see if
something is exactly equal to something
else so this means if six is exactly
equal to nine remember you don't use one
equal sign because when you use one
equal sign that means you're assigning
it to value when you're testing it you
use two because you don't want test the
equal nine you just want to test of
eight is equal to not so that test if
the variable called test is equal to the
value nine if you want to test if it's
not equal you need explanation point
equal sign and this means not equal and
of course as expected
you got your less than signs is six less
than nine is six
greater than nine is 6 less than or
equal to nine or a sixth-grader or equal
to nine and those are all
self-explanatory I'm not going to show
you guys exactly what those means but
for now I'm going to use the most basic
one and what we're going to be testing
right now is if the variable called test
is exactly equal to nine which it isn't
now I told you guys that you have a test
and this test can either go it is or
isn't and that's where your computer
makes a decision if it is then after
your if statement you have something
called a statement your first statement
and this is also called the body now
your first one is you need to tell your
computer what it's going to do if the
test is true if test is equal to nine
then we want you to system.out.print
line that's right yes just write
something simple now the first thing you
do is tell your computer what to do if
test is equal to nine and this what it
does if it is equal to nine but as you
can see test isn't equal to nine so what
do we want to do now
well if that isn't true then we give you
one more option and that's the else and
let's just go ahead and copy this copy
and paste where are you and let's go
ahead and write this is else so let me
run this free eyes and I'll show you
guys what happens press ok and our final
result is this is else so let me show
you guys clear things up how
if-statement works how if a statement
works is you write if and then you have
a variable so it pretty much is exact
same thing as saying all right if test
is equal to 9 I want you to print yes
but if it's not equal to 9 I want you to
print this is else so we're going to
have the test one thing if the test is
positive have this else if the test is
negative have this but say we had
something else like if test was less
than 9 which is true well since this
test is true is going to do the first
option and not the second option again
it can't do both of them it can only do
one or the other so let's go ahead and
run this and it's going to say this time
yes so that is how you can use different
testing operators such as equals equals
less than greater than less than equal
to and that's how you use a simple if
statement to give your computer two
choices again it's just like saying if
this test is true do this first thing
else do the second thing and don't
forget to use your curly braces to do
the body of the first thing and then
you're out statement and then your curly
braces to do the body of your second
choice and I'll be chaotic excuse me
I'll be clearing this up for you and
next couple tutorials but I hope this is
pretty self explanatory just play around
with it for now it's the best thing to
do to learn so just copy this throw in
some new variables and soon enough
you'll get the hang of it so thank you
guys for watching that's the basic if
statement how to tell your computer to
make a simple decision so again thank
you guys for watching make sure
subscribe my channel and don't forget to
check out my next Java tutorial so I'll
see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
