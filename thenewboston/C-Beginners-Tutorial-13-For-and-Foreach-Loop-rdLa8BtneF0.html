tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to use the four and a
forty three and a loop is just something
that will allow us to loop through the
same code over and over so all you're
going to need for this tutorial is a
button and once you have it on your
phone just go ahead and double click on
it alright so first we're going to be
looking at the for loop so to create a
for loop you're just going to want to
type four and then following that you're
going to want to have two parentheses
now for loop is composed of three
statements the first statement is
executed first
and it's only executed once so typically
people define variables inside of here
so we're just going to go ahead and type
int I equals 0 so now we can use this
integer that we created inside of our
for loop and only inside of our for loop
alright and next comes a conditional
statement and basically what it's going
to do is or it loops each time it's
going to check this conditional
statement and if it returns true then
it's going to proceed through the for
loop and loop again but if it returns
false it's just going to stop executing
and never loop through bed so we're
going to say while I is less than 5 and
then the third statement is executed
after it loops through and what we're
going to do here is just have an
increment I by one so we're going to do
I plus plus and then we're just going to
want to put two curly braces and inside
of these two curly braces is basically
the code that it will loop through
alright so let me explain this a little
bit more so basically what it's going to
do is just create integer I then it's
going to check to see if I is less than
5 and since I is equal to zero right off
the bat then 0 of course is less than 5
then it's going to go through and do the
code inside of here then after it's done
executing all this code it's going to go
up here add one tie then after it does
this it's going to go ahead and check
this conditional statement again and
then I'll be on 1 and of course 1 is
less than 5 so it's going to go ahead
and loop through this code again and
it's going to repeat that process over
and
/ until i is not less than five and so
once i is equal to five it's going to
stop executed so basically what it's
going to do right here is loop through
this code five times so we're going to
have it through this code right here
we're just going to have a message box
show so we're just going to say message
box show and we're just going to make it
say hello and then we're just going to
add I on to that so plus a two string so
what it's going to do here is just going
to loop through create I check to see if
I is less than five first off it will be
zero so of course zero is less than five
it's going to go through and execute
this code so we're going to get hello
we're going to get message box that says
hello and then it's going to say hello
is zero and then just going to loop
through again and then we'll get hello
one hello to three and so on
all right so let's just go ahead and
make sure that this works here you get
hello 0l l1 l2 l3 and hello for all
right so just loop through that code
five times you can put any code inside
of here that you would like all right
and something else people might want to
do is if you ever want to make it so
you're on the loop this infinite meaning
that will never end you can just get rid
of the conditional statement right here
so if it has nothing to check it's just
going to of course loop over and over
again making it unstoppable it's just
going to keep doing it over and over so
if we do hello we get hello zero
hello 102 l3 and you can just keep
looking it forever and never end so yeah
we're 45 right now so I'm just going to
stop executing by clicking f6 and it'll
ask me if I want to stop debugging and
of course I want to stop debugging all
right so that's pretty much all there is
on the for loop so next we're going to
go to the for each loop the for each
loop basically allows you to think
through every element inside of it all
right so if we were to go right here and
just create a string array I'll just
call it names set it equal to a bunch of
string so it's going to have
Adam Bob and Joe alright so now we're
going to create a for each statement or
for each loop to loop through every
single string inside of the string array
right here so we're going to say for
each and then we're going to want to put
two parentheses and then we're going to
want to say for each string s in names
so basically what it's going to do is
just going to go through every single
string inside of the string array so it
says for each string and then it calls a
pass in this names array right here then
it's just going to loop through this
code and every time it loops through
it's basically going to set this string
called s equal to something different so
the first time it loops through S is
going to be equal to this element right
here the next time it loops through S is
going to be equal to this element and so
on so basically what we can do out here
is just have a message box show s and
what it will do is it will go through
every single element inside of this
array and print it out inside the
message box so we should get a message
box for each element inside of this
array right here so we should get one
for atom Bob and Joe perfectly and you
can do this with any collection or any
array so if you wanted to you could do
this with a list of well so if we to go
right here and create a list of integers
I guess and all this college the numbers
and obviously setting equal to a new
list of integers I'll just add a few
numbers to my list I'll add these
numbers and I'll add five and then I'll
add ten alright so inside of our numbers
list right here we just have um three
numbers we have 5 10 and 15 so what
we're going to do right here is we're
going to say for each integer called I
inside of that numbers list right there
then basically what we just wanted to do
is print it out inside of a mess
box so we're just going to say I dot two
string outside of this message box
social soon go through every single
number inside of this list and have a
message box be displayed for it so it's
just going to go through five and then
so we're going to get a message box that
says five then it's going to go through
ten and we're going to get a message box
that says ten and find that it's going
to have 15 and we're going to get a
message box that says 15 all right so if
you bug hears you get 5 10 and 15 all
right so that's pretty much it for this
tutorial on the 4 and for each loop so
see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
