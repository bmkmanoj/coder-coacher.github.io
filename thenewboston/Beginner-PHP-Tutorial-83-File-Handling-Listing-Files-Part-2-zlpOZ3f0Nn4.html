moment when when we write it and you say
so I'm going to say file equals read dir
this time and we're applying the handle
into that so we're reading in the handle
that we've already opened with open dir
and let me explain what happens in this
loop every time we go around this loop
file is going to equal the next file
along so in this case we have let's just
double check we've got three files here
so for the first loop will equal first
file dot txt then second file of txt
then third file dot txt now it will only
represent in a string format so file is
now a string format it's ER it won't it
won't actually be a link to the file so
we need to do that ourselves so let's go
ahead and just test this out we can say
echo file and then a line break so let's
so preview this in our browser and see
what it looks like okay so we we have
the first file dot txt second file dot
txt and third file dot txt however you
can also see that we've got these this
double dot here and it's single door
here this is just part of a normal
directory structure so as long along
with the other files we've also got this
which means current directory and this
means back our directory so these are
the options that we can do by saying go
back a directory or forwarded directory
but we don't want to include these
because we just want to look inside the
files a look inside this files directory
and list our files so let's go and see
what we can do to sort this out now we
need to create a condition inside of our
loop so we need to create an if
statement here and one end that there
okay remember your block so we've
created an if statement and we need to
put a condition in here and the
condition is based upon something if
it's true we're going to echo the file
so the condition could be if file
doesn't equal
a dot and file doesn't equal two dots so
if it doesn't equal a dot and doesn't
equal two dots then we can echo out a
file so therefore these this dot and
this two dots will be eliminated for our
list and this echo won't happen okay
there still exist this echo just won't
happen so let's go back and refresh and
see what that's done okay so that's got
rid of the FIR the one and the two dots
there so we've achieved that just simply
with an if statement here okay so now
what I want to do is create links to the
files and we can do this just by
appending on and 8:8 href equals and
then that's the start of the a tag and
then we end the a tag them just like you
do in a in an HTML document a normal
HTML document now the link is going to
be the directory and then forward slash
the file so inside here what we can do
is just append on directory so what I've
done here if you didn't already notice
I've ended the echo so we've started the
echo here with ended the echo here using
a dot to append on our directory then
we're using a dot to append on the rest
of it so we can just do for short like
you just saw me do two of two of these
single quotation marks and then two dots
and then in here we can write our
variable data so it's directory and then
it's forward slash and then two more
dots two more single quotation marks and
file so now what we can say is when we
refresh you can see that these are links
now if you look at the bottom of the
video in the left left-hand corner you
can see localhost forward slash series
forward slash file handling for such
files and then first file dot txt if I
move my mouse down to the second one you
can see that at the bottom of the video
in the in the bottom of the browser it
changes to second file on the same a
third file so now we can just click on
these and view the contents of the first
file view the contents of the second
file and view the contents of the third
file which you can see I've just written
the first file
second file and third file but obviously
if these were images you could change
the a href tag and you can instead
change it to image source and you could
point the image point the image to point
the source to the image that's located
within the directory and you could also
talk about using functions that we've
already already seen in previous
tutorials by myself to only show JPEG
files so we could what we could do is we
could either read in the file itself and
check the type or we could select
everything after the last dot and say is
it a JPEG file but for now I'll leave
you this this is a basic this is a basic
most standard structure of looping
through a file and displaying all files
that don't equal a dot and two dots</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
