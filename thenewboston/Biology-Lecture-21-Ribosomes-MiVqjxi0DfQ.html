tutorial and in this tutorial I want to
talk to you guys about the ribosomes now
before we do that we need to understand
a few things and the first thing is that
whenever your cell decides that it needs
to make a protein for whatever reason
the instruction to make a protein is of
course inside the nucleus because all
the DNA we draw some DNA right here
these are another strand I might want to
color cut this baby so actually that's
not bad looking DNA if I don't say so
myself so here is your DNA and as you
should already know the DNA might as
well label this DNA has all the
instructions on how to make a protein
however the DNA never leaves nucleus
luhn here's the nucleus right here now
remember the DNA has the instructions on
how to make a protein however proteins
are made out here in the cytoplasm so
let's think about this if all of the
instruction is right here on the DNA but
the proteins get made out here how the
heck can that happen because you need
the instructions to make the protein now
the way that the instructions get to the
area where the proteins are made is
through a molecule molecule called M RNA
M R and a now of course na na mRNA is
the other type of nucleic acid or one of
the other types and it stands for a
messenger are n a now what messenger RNA
is it's basically just that it's the
messenger so again whenever your so
here's a cell right here decides that it
needs a protein what it does is it gives
the instruction to the mRNA now why
can't the DNA just go out and give it
himself well because the DNA never
leaves the nucleus it's not allowed to
so the mRNA which looks like a little
strand it leaves the nucleus and heads
over to something called the ribosome
are i b o s om es now the ribosomes are
these little
ugly looking blobs and they're actually
scattered through a couple places on
different organelles we'll talk about
that later on some are free-floating
some are stuck on an organelle which
we're going to be talking about in the
next tutorial but basically what the
mRNA does once it has that instruction
is it heads over to the ribosome
and where your ribosome is basically
where your proteins are made so proteins
are made right here on your ribosome so
again they aren't made from the mRNA
which is this the mRNA is not an
ingredient of the protein the ribosome
is not an ingredient of the protein
because remember proteins are made from
amino acids amino acids make up proteins
so amino acids are the ingredients for
proteins mrna is basically like the
template saying this is how proteins
should be made or the recipe in the
ribosomes are pretty much alike the
workbench where proteins are made so
just to recap one last time whenever you
decide that you need a protein for some
reason instructions for the proteins are
copied from the DNA and the instructions
are given to the mRNA called messenger
RNA then the mRNA which is a little pink
strand right here it leaves the nucleus
why does it because the DNA can't leave
the nucleus so that's why it needs the
mRNA tube and it heads over to the
cytoplasm to the special organelle
called the ribosome now the ribosomes it
will talk exactly the process where
amino acids come together linked
together and form a protein but for
right now just know that the ribosomes
then organize mRNA and other molecules
needed to build the proteins so this is
pretty much the instruction on how to
build a protein the ribosome is where
the protein is made and then amino acids
later on are going to come floating in
and according to the instruction from
the mRNA that's how they know
which order to pretty much form the
protein so ribosomes use' mrna is a
template for determining the correct
sequence of amino acids for a particular
protein makes sense I know it's kind of
confusing but just remember ribosomes
are pretty much the workbench workbench
where proteins are made so okay take a
deep breath in I know this is kind of
confusing so if you understand this then
go ahead and I you know watch the next
video we're going to be talking about
something else something a little bit
you know better than ribosomes but one
last time I just want to I know that
this is very confusing so I want to
pound in your head amino acids are put
together to form proteins so mRNA right
here it isn't the ingredient it's just
the template or the blueprint telling
how the amino acids should be arranged
now ribosomes right here are just the
location where all of this crap happens
so in the next couple tutorials we're
going to be learning about the specific
method where amino acids come together
to form this but for now that's how you
guys get so thank you guys for watching
hopefully I didn't confuse you guys too
bad so yeah I'll see you guys in next
