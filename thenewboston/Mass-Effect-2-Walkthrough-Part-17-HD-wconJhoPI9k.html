garrus but he took a bad hit the docks
corrected with surgical procedures in
some cybernetics best we can tell he'll
have full functionality but Shepherd
tough sumbitch didn't think he'd be up
yet nobody would give me a mirror how
bad is it he'll garrus you were always
ugly slap some face paint on there no
one will even notice uh-oh don't make me
laugh damn it my face is barely holding
together as it is probably for the best
everyone was always ignoring you and
hitting on me time for you to get a fair
shot at it
frankly I'm more worried about you heard
bad things about Cerberus these past few
years that's why I'm glad you're here
garrus if I'm walking into hell I want
someone I trust at my side you realize
this plan has me walking into hell too
just like old times unfit for duty
whenever you need me Shepherd I'll
settle in and see what I can do with the
forward batteries with this area of the
ship this is the FTL communications room
in addition to interfacing with the FTL
comm Network Normandy is fitted with a
quantum entanglement communicator linked
to the elusive man's office this allows
lag free communication even when you
operate off the com grid that's all for
now logging you out Shepherd
commander he's received a new message at
your private terminal
am i receiving warranty warnings about
the slums where dr. Morton solace runs
the clinic anticipate resistance at the
transport station I have also run
searches for reports on Archangel the
various mercenary groups appear to
believe that he is dead
works for me
this is valuable
this place makes me sick people still
dying strong still exploiting the lead
nothing I get here even made a dent
hello there might interest you and some
Salvage tech every credit goes toward a
ticket to get me off this forsaken rock</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
