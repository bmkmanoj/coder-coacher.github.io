and in this tutorial what I want to do
is I want to show you guys something
called the shorthand if-else statement
and it's basically a way where you can
write very small if statements so if you
actually have um you know you're having
your computer make a decision and you
have a bunch of code in your f
statements stick to the other one this
is for when you only have like one or
two lines to execute and I'll show you
guys the syntax for it right now so we
actually don't even ever type the
keyword if but inside parentheses just
go ahead and write your test which is
like um is five less than ten or
anything like that
now press a space after your test and
write a question mark so it's pretty
much you can read it as a question now
after your question mark if it's true
then the true code executes else in
pretty much in place of a else you use
this : this is your false code so this
is a syntax for this is an actual code
test question mark basically saying is
five less than ten if it is do this if
it's not do this so let me go ahead and
show you guys an example when this is
actually useful so what we can do is we
can say that we're making a computer
game and we wanna arm distribute players
on each team based on their name we'll
say if your last name begins with M or
above like mine does Roberts will put
you on one team if it's ever below will
split you up on another team so of
course we'll put char last once I can
got H last name and we just put 24 last
name hopefully no one has a really long
last name and give them a little prompt
and of course we'll say something like
enter your last name
new line so of course what we can do is
put scanf and remember since this is
indeed not just one character we
actually need to put skin in a string so
process and that string is going to be
stored in last name so remember a string
and a character array are basically the
same thing a string is a list of
characters simple enough so whenever
we're scanning in a string such as a
last name we use percent s and also take
note that it doesn't use on the
ampersand because it has erase pretty
much have a built-in name percent and
I'll talk to you guys about pointers
later on but anyways what we did now is
we got the last name which is going to
be in my case Roberts stored in this
array or string whatever you want to
call it it's actually the same thing so
now what we can do is use that syntax of
what are we testing for first and let me
actually just tuck that out so you guys
know what's going on so this is our test
this is the code that's going to xq and
true and this is the code that's going
to execute if our test is false so the
test is just testing for the first
character in their name in my case it
would return our for Roberts
so how do we get that first character
well remember to access individual items
in that list you type the name of the
array or list and you write 0 because
remember I told you in programming every
list begins with 0 that's just I don't
know that's how it is so 0 is going to
return r1 writter turn o to would return
B so on and so forth so this is going to
be our and we'll say is our less than M
so I don't know if you guys knew this
but you can test characters just like
you can arm numbers so of course um like
a and B would be less than C um D would
be greater than B and so on and so forth
but one thing I want to point out is
there is a
difference between uppercase and
lowercase so make sure the user types
the uppercase R in this example and I'll
tell you guys how to convert everything
to uppercase or lowercase later on but
for now this is pretty good so we'll say
is R less than M if it is we'll just say
printf you're on the blue team and you
actually don't even want that uh
semicolon right here else you're on the
red team let me put a space between
those because it's kind of annoying me
so basically saying okay anyone whose
name begins with something M or excuse
me under M which is ABCD all the way to
M then put them on the blue team however
anyone else put them on the red team so
run this and I'm going to say okay enter
your last name ro be RTS so you're
pretty much going to hit enter it's
going to take that are from you and
check it out my R is indeed greater than
M so it says uh this blue team is only
for less than M so you are on the red
team and one other thing I want to point
out one more time is make sure you don't
have a semicolon after this whenever you
have um a shorthand if-else statement
like I said it's only for it's not for a
code where you're going to write like
lines and lines of it it's for one short
code one line here and one line here
pretty sweet and you can just read it
just like a question so this question
mark is like is the first character less
than M oh if so do this if not do this
reads like a frickin book how easy is
that and let me actually go ahead and
show you guys right now why I use it all
the time
so you know how there's an instance
where um this is kind of confusing
whenever you say I have
I have zero friends I have one friend I
have two four oh forget that
so it says okay if you have zero friends
then you say I have zero friends one you
don't add the S 2 you add the S again
and that's why I hate the English
language because it's kind of confusing
so you need a special instance to say
okay whenever you just have one friend
you don't include the S which is really
probably confusing to like whenever
anyone's trying to learn language like
babies or foreigners or anyone so it's
actually really easy to do in computer
programming though so let's make a
variable called friends and we'll set it
equal to 87 and this is also a different
way where you could use the if-else
statements actually a really cool
shorthand one can't even type so printf
and as the first part we'll just put I
have % D friends and rut also shooting
just go I have % D friend
so again if this is 1 then this is fine
however if it's anything other than 1
then you can put % and of course what
this is going to be is s because we're
just going to I'll show you guys what
we're doing later on it could also be C
but you know tomato tomahto so now it
needs 2 parameters the first one is
spelled friends friends which is
basically going to say I have 87 right
now now for this next parameter we have
to take care of this percent s which is
going to be an S or not so now we can
say our test is let me give myself a
little space to work with what we're
testing for is this friend's variable
and we want to test if it is not equal
to one so that is our question that
we're pretty much asking and
if it's anything other than one then
just go ahead and use s is the string
else and you can just put a blank string
I don't even know if I told you guys
that but you can indeed have a blank
string and what this is pretty much can
mean is this I have whatever number it
is friend and then it's going to say do
I add the s or do I not well in order to
answer this question here is your little
shorthand FL statement and the test for
this is okay is friends the amount of
friends anything but one if it's not
equal to one then add the s and this is
the case 0 2 3 4 5 so on and so forth
however if it is equal to one and
nothing so now we run this I have 87
friends with s printed this out right
here now if we change this to 1 I have
one friend because it said okay it's not
equal to one
that's false and whenever it's false run
the else statement which is nothing or
empty so this is actually what I use on
my website so you know if you ever go to
Bucky's room and said ok Bucky has one
friend Bucky has zero friends or 87
friends that's how I do it so now you
guys know there's my secret thank you
guys for watching and well go check out
