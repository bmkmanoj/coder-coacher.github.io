and in this one let me teach you guys
just I don't even there's not like one
main topic just a bunch of other random
stuff to make improvements through game
and the first let me just my mic be a
little bit better
I was looking my nose before alright so
the first thing that we want to do is we
want to make these explosions look a bit
a little bit better and by that I mean
getting rid of the black right here so
what we can do is we can actually open
up a photo editor like Photoshop and
removing this black background but
typically it's a better idea to just do
it right here because well there's a
couple different reasons first of all
whenever we have effects we're going to
want different effects or different
images to behave differently so I want
to show you guys how you can do that
with the properties panel so select this
explosion right here in under effects
you can see that right now the blend
mode is normal and again if you ever use
Photoshop you know the different kinds
of blend modes basically how this image
right here which is explosion blends in
with the background so instead of normal
what I can do is I can select additive
and without explaining to you guys how
the pixels from that image are added
with the ones below basically just
remember this whenever you select
additive it's going to get rid of all
the black so that's a really simple
explanation if you want you know I don't
want to make this into a graphic editing
tutorial but whenever you select the
blending mode of edited it gets rid of
the black so now if we go ahead and
anytime we use this explosion spray
check it out now we don't have that
crappy black our game is looking better
already now another thing that I want to
do is I want to make the monsters a
little bit smarter and right now
whenever we play this as you guys can
see they all go at one angle from left
to right so they are all are going at a
line perfectly parallel with the x-axis
which you know is kind of makes it
really easy for us because they're all
just walking over the edge but uh not
very fun if you ask me so what I want to
do is I want to start them all off at a
random angle so how do we do that well
let's go ahead and hop back over to the
event sheet and in order to that we need
to set a condition a new condition
actually it's going to be a system
condition and what we want to look for
is see if I can find it here on star of
layout now this basically means is
whenever your layout starts or in really
simple terms whenever your game begins
so whenever your game begins
that's the events checking for what do
you want to happen of course we need to
add in action and remember what we're
doing here we're going to set the
monsters at random angles so the monster
object and you guys are gonna move it
angle not that one probably missed it
set angle wow it was like the third one
embarrassing so as soon as the game
begins we want to set each of these
monsters at a random angle and if you
put random 360 it just does that and
this is actually a function and if you
guys don't know computer program and
it's just to get a random number between
either 0 or 360 or 1 and 360 I think
it's 0 and 360 so press done and now
what we did is as soon as the game
begins
aka on startup layout each monster is
going to be started off at a random
direction so now okay oh now they're
going crazy makes a little makes the
game a little more interesting but one
thing I want to know is you see that
monster right there he just walked off
the edge of the screen never took them
back goodbye monster that's it all my
monsters are gone they're walking off
into the darkness of the universe into
the abyss so another thing that we can
do is say ok
whenever the monster goes off the screen
we want to keep them inside the layout
pretty much like our character is so
they just can't walk up the
edge so in order to do that we need to
test for one more condition so add an
event and we want to go ahead and check
if something's happenin with a monster
and the event is called is outside
layout I hate that these aren't just all
enough but a quarter is okay where the
heck is it is outside layout that's
embarrassing all right so what this does
is it pretty much says is your monster
outside the layout basically is it in
this gray area right here and if I swear
I'm getting ticked off about my stupid
throat but basically if it is I'll show
you guys what I just didn't den talk you
guys through it we want to add an action
and the action is give it a new angle or
a new direction to go towards so we want
the monster and this one got to find
this again set angle toward position
that was easy and 4x and I'll show you
guys well let me type this and then I'll
explain you guys what I'm doing player X
player y and just hit enter so basically
remember since these monsters act like
bullets
that's what behavior we give them
they're pretty much going to go in a
straight line so you give a point and
then the monster travels in that
straight line until it gets to the edge
of the layout and then they go to a new
point so what point do we want to give
them well we just don't want to give
them a random point on the screen we
want to make them go towards the player
so they you know are like kind of
attacking him so this is our player
object and if you guys like I said are
familiar with computer programming
you're going to know what this is but
this is our player object and each
object has certain properties with it
the X is just as x coordinates on the
game and it's why it's just it's Y
coordinates
so pretty much this is saying if you're
pressed on is the monster in the gray
area right here if they are then take
that monster and make it go towards the
player so now whenever I hit play
hopefully you guys can see what happens
and let me refresh it because none are
coming right here so keep an eye on this
monster as soon as he goes off he's
going to start coming in the direction
of me and look at this one on top he
went off the screen so he starts coming
towards me and of course I can move
because after he has that original point
he's going to go in that direction
forever so again it's not like the most
intelligent monster but you know it's a
lot better than just being an idiot and
wandering off into wherever universe
he's going to so uh that's all I have
for you guys for this tutorial and in
the next tutorial
it's going to be as always freaking
awesome so again if you have any
questions at all up to this point make
sure to ask me on my forum Bucky's room
dot work slash forum I'll see you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
