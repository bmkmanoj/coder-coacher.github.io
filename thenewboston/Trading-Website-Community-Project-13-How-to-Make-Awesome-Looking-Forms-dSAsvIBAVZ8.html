and in this video I got some good and
bad news now the bad news is we need to
make two more CSS files before you can
start coding on the actual register.php
page now the first CSS file is forms the
CSS so let me go ahead and import that
even though we didn't create it yet the
forms that CSS and what this is gonna do
is kind of that second bit of good news
I'm gonna teach you guys how using CSS
you can create awesome amazing looking
forms with all sorts of neat interactive
features we'll give you nice hints
whenever you rollover and so that's what
we're gonna be doing in this tutorial
and aside from that the next thing that
we need to create is a register is s
page now this register dot CSS page is
basically the main CSS page is the
styling for the main website in the form
CSS page is the styling for the main
forms however there are four or five
things that make this what register page
a little bit different so in that CSS
file it's only gonna be like three
things it's gonna take like four minutes
to do we just need to overrate some of
these things but anyways you'll see that
later on the first thing we need to get
started on doing is creating the forms
that CSS page how to make this form look
amazingly pretty so let me go ahead and
copy that name forms that CSS whenever
possible copy and I'm just gonna save
this file as CSS forms the CSS now the
first thing that we want to do is we
want to work on the labels now the
labels are this section the user name
email password and if I go ahead and
hover over these elements you can see a
couple things first of all the labels
are longer than they appear in their
kind of text aligned to the right-hand
side
so before each input element you got
that label so let's go ahead and style
that right now so label
and the first thing I want to do is
display it display is a block now the
next thing I want to do is I want to
float that to the left-hand side now of
course for just visual purposes I'm
gonna add a font-weight:bold just so it
stands out and I also want to add a
margin right of about 10 pixels now the
reason for this is because I don't want
this input section but it right up
against this because they look a little
funny so I want to give it a little bit
of spacing so that's why I did that
so aside from this as you can see
whenever we hover over this the entire
box the text is right aligned and that's
to just make it line up with the input
box instead of having it way over to the
left-hand side because that'll look a
little funny so in order to do that just
go ahead and put text align right and
now I want to give this an overall width
of 120 pixels now the next thing I want
to do is I want to change the line
height now the line height is basically
the vertical spacing up and down of the
lines and let me just go ahead and move
this with 25 pixels and that's gonna
give you a little bit of vertical
spacing rather than the default now for
the font size again this is all self
explanatory stuff 15 pixels make it a
little bit bigger than the default text
the color since our background is blue
we of course need a white back or excuse
me white text to stand out and I also
want to give a text shadow now I want to
put one pixel one pixel which moves it
over and down one pigswill each three
pixels for the blur and for the
hexadecimal Oh
800 eight that shadow is great and there
you go our label is fully styled and our
final product is pretty much this user
name email password bolded looking
pretty text aligned to the right we're
good to go
the next thing I want to do is style the
overall form now I want to go ahead and
I want to throw this into an
or give it an ID of general form now the
styling I want to do on this is
basically what we want to do for the
entire box now the first thing I wanted
to do is I want to not have all the
elements directly but up against the
border I want to give it a little bit of
padding of about 20 pixels and that just
makes it you know well obviously it's
pretty obvious the next thing I want to
do is actually give it a nice blue color
so in case you don't remember from the
search box it's the same color a
background of hexadecimal zero zero six
six nine nine and now I want to change
your overflow
now the overflow is auto now will
overflow means is basically if your
content is larger than the box then how
it's gonna pretty much if content
overflows inside this box then what
happens and auto is just the setting
that works the best for this now the
next thing I want to do is I actually
want to give this rounded corners just
like we did the search box with a radius
of seven pixels I want to do the same so
the first thing I do is border radius
and I'm gonna hit the wrong key seven
pixels now in order to make this
compatible crust browser we need two
more border radiuses one is for Moses
Firefox Moz border radius and the other
one for chrome is WebKit so just like
that and the last thing I want to do is
if you can see just to make this a
little bit more beautiful I want to give
it a subtle shadow to make it look like
it's popping out at you even more so in
order to add a shadow this is what you
do the standard eventually is going to
be box shadow and that's what some
browsers like Internet Explorer I think
adopted and I'm gonna give it a shadow
of five pixels five pixels 15 pixels and
just like it pretty much has the same
settings is Tex shadow how far over how
far down
what do you want your blur to be and
what you want the color of the shadow to
be now since this is on white we want it
a little bit lighter than the text
shadow and the perfect one for this is
um wait I can't tell if it's I believe
it
eh-oh eh-oh eh-oh it might be a 0 a 0 a
0 and uh man I can't remember I remember
aoa LOL i embedded that in my brain but
uh i can't remember if it's over zero
I'll check on that and I'll let you guys
know in the next tutorial
my anyways we need to do the same thing
for the different browsers Moz and also
WebKit so now what this does is add a
box shoutout wow I really messed up that
saying it has a box shadow on all the
default browsers this one does it on
Firefox and this one does it on pretty
much everything else
Safari Google Chrome stuff like that so
anyways what I'm gonna do is I'm
actually gonna pause the video right now
and I'm actually gonna pick up in the
next tutorial where and I find out if
this is a 0 or a ohh
so actually if anyone knows just leave a
comment in the section below and in the
next tutorial I'll just continue up
where I left off so thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
