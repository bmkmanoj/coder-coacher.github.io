After Effects tutorial and in this
tutorial we're gonna begin working with
text now hopefully you know the basics
of text just from like watching me in my
last couple tutorials and you pretty
much know how to put text on the screen
well in this tutorial I'm going to skip
the real basics because if you like ever
sat at a computer before you're gonna
know how to do like put text on the
screen and bold it and align it in this
story I'm gonna skip the how to move
text along a path so the first thing you
need is obviously some text so go ahead
and click layer new text and now your
little text bar pops up you could also
just click your cursor around the screen
and start typing but this is a little
more Juris thing so let's go ahead and
I'm going to type something this is some
text and apples
doesn't really matter what we typed make
sure you have a couple typos in there
for good looks and now after you have
text go ahead and select this text layer
right here and then once this is
selected go ahead and select this pen
tool now you probably want to click this
wrote up 0 because this is going to give
you a nice curved path now with the text
layer selected and then when you click
the pen tool go ahead and make a mask so
click this click this this and something
like that so now when you have that mask
go ahead and click text under your
properties right here and what you want
to do is click this little thing that
called text and then from here we want
to click is path options and right here
where it says path you want to click
mask 1 since that's the mask you just
created and now you see your text is
automatically conformed to that path so
again your text layer path options path
mask 1 now as you can see it's stuck to
that path but it's not exactly animated
yeah
along the path so in order to animate it
what you want to do is go ahead and
click this little stopwatch or by first
a margin and I'm guessing well first of
all when you click that stopwatch it
obviously means you can animate it and
I'm guessing you're gonna want this go
to left to right since most people do so
go ahead and scroll this all the way to
the left and as you can see your text is
scrolling to the left as this property
goes to the left now go ahead and move
later in your animation some and go
ahead and scroll it to the right even
more so let's go ahead and scroll it
almost off the screen and as you can see
my test I mean on my text is kind of
scrolling along that path so now
whenever we play this animation we see
that this text moves across the screen
just how we want it to so that's your
basics of how to move text along a
predestined path and again let's see it
one more time just because it is so
beautiful oh man would you look at that
and again you can add different
characteristics tears text if you want
but this is the real basics I just want
to show you guys how to move text along
real basic path so in the next tutorial
we're probably going to be going over a
text more and I'm going to show you
something else cool to do with it but
for now and that's all you get so I
guess you're just gonna have to
subscribe and wait to see the next
tutorial so again don't forget to
subscribe and I will see you next time
