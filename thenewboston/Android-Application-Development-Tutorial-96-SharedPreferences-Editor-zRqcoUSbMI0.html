Android tutorial for the new Boston and
what we're going to do in this tutorial
sorry by the way for any lot last
tutorial abruptly but it was taking too
much time so I just clipped it kind of
where I thought it should be clipped but
what we did in the last tutorial we
basically set up a shared preference
type variable or instance of a class and
all we did is we say we kind of do the
initialization where we say get shared
preferences from file name which is our
string called my shared preferences we
could have also done you know just like
my shared preferences here in quotations
or something like that and it would have
worked but what we did is we set up a
static variable that won't change so
we're just going to use that and you'll
see that in a lot of examples when you
work with data or just examples in
general so what we did is again we set
up this variable to get the shared
preferences of this file name and kind
of the default setting which was 0 now
what we're going to do is we're going to
use an editor to kind of edit the
information and then save it as well so
we're going to again do that within our
save button that we created and first
thing that we have to do is we have to
access the editor so the editor is from
the shared preferences class so we're
going to go shared preferences dot and
then you can see some of the things that
the shared preferences class has one of
them is an editor and then we can set up
our variable called editor or something
like that this would be the same as just
saying like see here we just deleted
this and we say import but since I mean
we could import the editor as well but
since we already imported our shared
preference class we can just reference
that and then hit dot editor it's going
to be the same type of thing and now
what we're going to do is we're going to
use this editor to get the settings for
the most part from our shared preference
variable that we set up in the last
tutorial so we're going to say some data
which
our shared preferences and we're going
to say dot and then we're going to say
edit
so we're basically editing our shared
preference variable and then we're going
to save it so that's basically going to
allow us to edit this variable and then
what we're going to do is we're going to
say our editor and then we say dot and
we can use the put methods like put
boolean put you know int float long but
we're saving a string so we're going to
say put string and within its arguments
it's going to take a value or a key and
then our value so our key we can set
this up to equal whatever we want that
we're going to reference later so we're
going to say something like our string
or shared string something like that and
then we can reference this later because
again this is the key and the actual
value is going to be from our edit text
that we set up again in our last
tutorial that's basically going to
convert whatever edit text is into a
string and that's what we're actually
going to save so we're going to save our
string called string data so again
basically this is the way that you
shared preferences is you it's a key and
a value system where we set up a key
reference and we apply a value to that
key reference and then we can kind of
use the editor to change things and then
save it again and again the purpose of
the shared preference class is just to
save like these type of values strings
boolean's anything that you'd probably
consider as a preference like our on and
off check that we used earlier in the
series for the music so it's kind of
just to save a certain value and for
this example we're saving a string so
we're going to put our string in and
then what we need to do is we just need
to say our editor and we just need to
finalize it basically so we're going to
say editor dot commit and that's
basically going to say hey we've changed
everything that we need to we need to
and I just commit to that and we're good
to go so basically this what we've done
is we've referenced our string
preference
I shouldn't highlight that but our
variable which would
a string preference called some data and
every time we hit save it's going to
create a string for us it's going from
the Edit text it's going to convert it
to text and I'm sorry it's going to get
the text and it's going to convert it to
a string and then we use this editor
variable to reference our shared
preference and then we're going to say
hey we want to edit something within
there and then we're going to use that
editor variable that we set up here to
put in a string and we label the string
shared string and we labeled the actual
value of that shared string as again or
edit text or whatever was within or edit
text and then we're going to say yeah
we've made the changes we want to commit
to that and make it happen so that's
basically this tutorial in the next
tutorial we're going to show you how to
load that data that we put in there so
for as for now we're just saving the
data so hopefully that made some sense I
know in the last tutorial kind of ended
abruptly and explained too much but
hopefully that made some sense and I'll
catch you guys in the next tutorial have
a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
