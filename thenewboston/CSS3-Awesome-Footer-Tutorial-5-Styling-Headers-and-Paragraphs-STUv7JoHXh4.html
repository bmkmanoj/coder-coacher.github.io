tutorial and in this video what I want
to do is I wanted to just start styling
the basic headings all the easy stuff
before we get into some more advanced
stuff so I'm gonna be styling these
heading first these are actually the
heading twos and that's just the red
thing that says my profile in two column
layout I think on the YouTube video they
look pretty weird but actually in real
life they look pretty freakin sweet so
the first thing we want to do is say in
the footer all heading twos and you want
to do this because your heading twos on
your main website are generally gonna be
a little bit different but this is how I
style mine the font weight is normal
because by default all headings are bold
now the font size is 14 pixels now the
default font size for the footer is
gonna be 12 pixels and of course you
want the headings a little bit bigger
generally so you know there you go now
for the text decoration I'm just gonna
set those two underline and for the
color the color I chose is CC 0 0 0 0
and that is that red color that you see
right here in my profile and I chose
that not because it looks good in the
background but because my social network
those are the colors of the headings on
the website so it's a good idea to match
it then you have the same theme for your
footer in your website now the margin
top for the headings is 10 pixels now
what I'm going to do now is I'm going to
set the margin bottom I'm gonna set that
to 5 4 5 5 pixels and the margin left
is 10 pixels so 10 5 10 with top bottom
and left
so that's your heading 2 and again all
those margins it just gives you a little
bit of space so you know the text above
and below and also it isn't butted up
against you know above below or to the
left of it you really don't need
anything any margin on the right-hand
side because unless you know you're
going you're floating it to the right
you're anything it's not really going to
be issue now after this I want to start
styling the paragraphs so in your footer
all paragraphs are going to be first of
all white now the reason that you need
white is because generally your
background is going to be very light and
if you have the default text color which
is black on this it's basically
impossible to read so black text on a
kind of dark background ain't happening
so as you can see it's very easy to read
whenever you have white text just like
that so the color is white the font size
is 12 just go ahead and steal some of
this font size is 12 now for the
paragraph we actually want to float
these to the left and the reason that we
want to do this is because whenever we
are writing several paragraphs well
you're going to see later on whenever I
piece everything together but for now
float your paragraphs to the left and
now the only other two elements that you
need are padding:0 pixels and ten pixels
now whenever you have two numbers in
your padding then what this means is the
top and bottom are 0 and the left and
right are 10 if you just had 10 then
that would mean the top bottom left
right it's 10 all around but whenever
you have two values in either padding or
margin then the first value is for top
and bottom in the second one is for left
and right so now let me go ahead and
copy this and change this one to margin
now my margin is going to be just the
opposite of this 10 pixels it's going to
have a margin let me go ahead and write
this first now the paragraphs are going
to
a top in bottom margin of 10 pixels and
a left and right margin of zero so this
is actually the best way to set up your
paragraphs and it gives it nice room
above below and to the left and to the
right and well that's how I set up my
paragraphs it's super easy to read and
it fits super nicely in your footer so
after this I guess what we're gonna do
is we're actually gonna style the image
and then it's going to take like two
seconds and then we're gonna start
styling the individual buttons so even
though these aren't you know there's no
button element actually well okay I take
that back these are actually some people
call them tabs some people call them
buttons some people call them elements
but the thing that says account profile
columns programs that's we're going to
be saddling in the upcoming tutorials so
I'll see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
