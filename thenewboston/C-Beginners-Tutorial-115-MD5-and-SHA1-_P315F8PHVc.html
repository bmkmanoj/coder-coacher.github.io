tutorial that I'm making for the New
Boston in this tutorial I'll be showing
you how to compute both md5 and sha-1
hashes and a hash is basically a number
computed from data and in md5 s case
it's always 16 bytes long and sha-1
skate it's always 20 bytes long and when
it mean that length it means that the
likelihood of two different types of
data or two different like data is being
hashed will be this being the same is
very slim so what you can do is well
this mainly what hashes are used for you
like you hash a bunch of data and then
save that hash and then when you were
sending it to someone else or storing it
or something like that if you want to
check to see if someone's tampered with
it you can always calculate the hash of
the file and compare the ashes and if
they're different than someone most
likely camford with it and but if
they're the same then no one came to do
it and it's perfectly fine so the first
hash that what any calculating is md5 so
just for this tutorial you're going to
need to have a text box and a button and
once you have those both on your form
just go ahead and double click on your
button for this tutorial you're going to
need to be using the system dot security
that cryptography namespace because on
both the classes that we're going to be
using are in that namespace so like I
said the first one keep looking at
calculating md5 so culturally md5 you're
first gonna want to create a new
instance of the md5 crypto service
provider class I'm just gonna call it
md5 and set equal to a new md5 crypto
service provider and that basically just
means it's going to compute md5 so in
order to keep the hash we're gonna say
and I dot compute cash this is the
compute hash method it's pretty simple
but right in here it calls for a byte
array so in order to convert this text
box into a byte array
first going to create a new instance of
the coding and coding or utf-8 encoding
class now let's call it ETH study equal
to a new utf-8 encoding class and this
is basically just a type of encoding
used to store text you don't really need
to know much about it just this is how
we're going to be on converting this
text in this text box into a byte array
so we're just going to do the name of
our UTF encoding class and then we're
just going to use the get bytes method
in that class to Hoover to text into
bytes so it's a text box once text right
here and this will just return the byte
array so then we can compute the hash of
the text and yeah now we're just going
to display the hash in a text box but in
order to display in a text box it has to
be in a string so we're going to convert
on this md5 hash it returns a byte array
so we have to convert that byte array
into victor dot two strings sort you
have to convert that into a string and
now we're going to display that in a
message box all right so that's really
long line of code there but basically
we're just converting the text box into
a byte array or the text in the text box
into a byte array then we're hashing
that or md5 hashing it then we're
converting that hash back to a string so
we can display in a message box so now i
needi bug here type in like an atom
click get hash and as you can see that's
a pretty long that's sixteen bytes long
and that's just the md5 hash for atom so
if we were to change even one letter and
just change it to n the hash would be
completely different and yeah as you can
see right there it's like completely
different than before if you're just
like hello if we were to type in or add
another zero it'd just be completely
different so this is a great way to
check to see if someone's
tampered with data or to see if it's
gotten there all the way or it's been
transferred completely or something like
that and the next one we're going to be
looking at its sha-1 and that is a
20-byte long hash so a little bit more
secure here so say sha-1 crypto service
provider
I was called sha-1 and instead of you go
to a new sha-1 crypto service provider
and just like before we're gonna have to
get or you have to turn the text in a
text box into fighter aces on utf-8
I probably shouldn't believe it this
whatever alright so now we're just going
to say sha-1 dot Q hash and just like
the md5 one this calls for a byte array
so we're going to have to use this utf-8
encoding class to get the bytes or
convert the text into a byte array so it
bytes Xbox one text just like before
we're going to convert this back or if
you heard that hash back into a string
so let's play it nice and Fox string and
then you just display this in the
message box all right so this basically
just converts the text into a byte array
a hash is it rips into sha-1 hash
converts that hash back into a string
and then displays that hash the message
box so now I need to talk to you type of
atom you get a 20-byte long hash go type
in something else like game table it's
something completely different
we're going to type in vo vo get
something completely different than just
Bob and yeah perfect so that's pretty
much it for this tutorial on computing
md5 and sha-1 hash is
so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
