with a video tutorial for the new Boston
now in the previous video we looked at
the jquery slides down functionality the
function that is present and we created
this this effect that you see here so
when the user logs in or enters the web
page this is automatically scrolled down
now in this function we're going to
implement a link which makes use of the
slide up function so when the user
clicks a link this element will actually
slide up again and be hidden so the
first thing we need to do is just go
ahead and I'm gonna surround the text
that we previously created in paragraph
tags and then I'm gonna create a link
just down here so I h4f equals no thanks
okay so now what we can do is just the
href is a hash and we need to give this
link an ID so I'm just gonna call this
hide message okay so now that we've got
this link let's go ahead and preview it
you can see that we just have this no
thanks and in here which we can click at
the moment it does nothing eventually
what's going to happen is we click this
and this completely slides up back
hidden okay so what we need to do is we
need to go into effects jas and we need
to create an event handler which will
handle when this link is clicked so when
we when we are inside our document ready
remember that our top slides down as
soon as we enter the page we can include
this event handler inside here as well
so we need to reference the button that
we've just created which remember I
called hide underscore message so I'm
just gonna say a hash hide underscore
message then I'm gonna say dot click and
then brackets so this is the event
handler that we've created now and
inside of this we need a function with
actually what's going to happen when we
click the button or the link so once
we've clicked the link we want to do
exactly the same as up here but we want
to slide up so
we again reference the top message div
we say top underscore message but this
time we say dot slide up and then in
brackets we create a speed so for
example 300 now it might be a good idea
at this point to start creating a
variable such as speed and I'm going to
make this equal to 300 and then just
substitute these values in here okay so
now that we've done that we can go ahead
and test this functionality let's
refresh the page you can see that the
div has slot slid down exactly as we
specified before now when we click the
no thanks button what's going to happen
is we are going to call this or this
event handler is going to catch the fact
that we've clicked on this button and
then it's going to perform this
operation here so let's go ahead and
preview that I'm gonna click no thanks
and you can see that slid right back up
into the very top of the page and is now
hidden so this is an extremely simple by
effective method of actually displaying
a drop-down message at the very top of a
website</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
