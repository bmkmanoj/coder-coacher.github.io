tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
show you how to have a message box to be
displayed when you click on a button or
hover over it and a few more events
alright so all you're going to need for
this tutorial is a button so just go
over to your toolbox and it's drag a
button onto your form right here alright
so in order to have a message box
display when your button is clicked just
go ahead and double click on your button
right here alright so right inside of
these two brackets right here is all the
code that will be executed whenever the
button is clicked alright so in order to
have a message box be displayed we're
just going to want to type out message
box and before we actually move any
further I'm going to talk about what
this thing is that popped up right here
this thing that pops up right here is
called intellisense and whenever you
begin typing it will basically show up
and tell you all the different things
you can actually type so we want to have
a message box be displayed so we're
going to go ahead and enter right here
it will auto type that out for us so
that we don't have to type it out
ourselves and if you get really good
with this and can program a lot to see
or find yourself just typing a few
letters and then just hitting enter and
it makes programming and typing much
faster alright and now we want to have
this message box be shown so we're just
going to press dot and then show and
again intellisense pops up right here
and we didn't even have to do and you
can just move up and down with our arrow
keys and then just hit enter and it'll
auto type out show for us so we don't
have to type that out alright and in
order to have this message box be shown
we're just going to want to put two
parentheses and inside of these
parentheses is called parameters and to
find out what you have to put inside of
here is put one parentheses up and
you'll see intellisense will pop right
up and tell you what to type and it says
string text right here now on a string
is just basically text and it's calling
for you to pass text through these
parameters right here or inside of these
parentheses and then it also gives you a
little description of what the string
will do this text will do it says
displays a message box with specific
text so we were to type in
on hello right here it'll show a message
box saying hello right inside of it now
on to end every single line of code that
you type you're just going to want to
put a semicolon and that will just help
us teach our compiler that the line is
finished and it's done all right so once
again I'm just going to want to type out
message box here to have a message box
to be shown and then we just going to
say dot show to actually show the
message box and then inside of these two
parentheses right here it's called
parameters and we're going to want to
pass through a string or text so we just
have to type out two quotes to represent
the text and then just inside of there
we're just going to want to type out the
text that we want to be displayed inside
of the message box and I just wanted to
say hello inside of the message box
alright so now let's just run our
application so let's go up here and hit
this green arrow start debugging and our
application should load and now when we
click our button which you get a message
box show yep it says hello perfect now
one more thing I'm going to show you
about having a message box is if you
just put a comma right here and say
something else this will be the text on
top of the message box or the title of
the message box so again it just calls
for string text so text we just want to
pass through here again so again we're
going to put the two quotes and then
inside of here the text that we want to
appear on top of our message box or is
the message boxes title so I'm just
going to make it say my title you're
obviously going to want to make it
something more descriptive of what your
actual message box is for example if it
was an airtime user they did something
wrong you could make it say err on top
of there or something like that all
right so let's just go ahead and bug
here and click this button again you
should get a message box yep and it says
hello and as you can see the title of
the message box says my title and that's
because we wrote my title right in there
alright so let's say we want to have
this message box we display when the
user hovers their mouse over the button
well to find more events you're just
going to want to select your button
right here and then go over and hit this
little lightning bolt right there and
that is the events tab so just go ahead
and click that and then use are all the
events that can occur for your button so
if you want to be mess
box the show whenever you offer your
mouse over your button just go down to
mouse hover right there and then just
double click on it but before we do that
you can see right down there it tells
you what this event really is it says
occurs when the mouse remains stationary
inside of the control for amount of time
and a control is just basically anything
outside of the form so this button is a
control so whenever the user basically
covers your mouse over this button this
event will occur so it's going to double
click on this right here and now all the
code inside of these two brackets will
occur whenever the user hovers your
mouse over the button and we're just
going to have a message box show so just
like a message box show and again you
can just hit enter instead of actually
typing out the entire word and we're
just going to have this message box say
you are hovering your mouse over the
button alright so now let's go ahead and
debug and see if it works so now we
hover our mouse over the button we get a
message box saying you are hovering your
mouse over the button and again that's
because we selected our control and over
to the events right here and double
clicked on mouse hover and then when we
did that it generated this code right
here and then inside of these two
brackets this code will be executed
whenever you hover your mouse over the
button so we just have a message box be
displayed telling the user that they
were hovering your mouse over the button
but then if we go to click on our button
you should get a message box saying
hello and the title should say my title
because remember whenever the user
clicks on the button we get this message
box saying hello and then title the
message box is just my title all right
so that's pretty much it for this
tutorial on displaying message boxes so
see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
