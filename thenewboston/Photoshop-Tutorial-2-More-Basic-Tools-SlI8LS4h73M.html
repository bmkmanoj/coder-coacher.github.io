tutorial and Photoshop today we're going
to be covering the more basic tools last
time we left off with a slice tool so
let's start now the Spot Healing Brush
tool there are three main sections this
espagne brush the healing brush in the
patch tool the Spot Healing Brush is for
anything that you want to go over in the
image that doesn't really belong in the
image just say you want to get rid of
this just paint over it and it would
disappear it's not really used for
useful for big images like this but when
you have an old image with a scratch on
it or some dust it's really useful the
Healing Brush tool is to recreate a
section of your image so say you wanted
to recreate this rock just hold down the
alt tab and you'll see little crosshairs
click once and then once you go to
another section of your image because if
you just paint in order to recreate
and the patch tool is just for larger
sections just like the same as the
healing brushes and the red eye tool is
just like it says you paint over it fix
a red eyes and photographs the brush
tool is one of the most basic tools as
you can see you select it and you just
paint just like a normal brush and the
pencil tool right here is very similar
except it gives you very hard and jagged
edges a lot more harsh than the brush
and the color replacement tool you
select a color from down here and you
paint over your image and it paints the
shade of color as you can see it's
learning everything achieve greenery
right now and these tools are called the
stamp tool and the pattern stamp tool
the clone stamp tool is a lot like the
healing brush to copy a section of your
image just hold down the alt tab click
and as you see you can paint again that
section of the image anywhere else on
your photograph
the pattern stamp tool allows you to go
up make a selection of the pattern so
we'll select the bubbles and as you see
if you go down paint we gain it begins
painting that texture or pattern on your
photograph
the history brush tool allows you to
paint
so say you wouldn't make a line and if
you painted over it painted the history
of whatever your last action was so if
you painted a line and then painted it
with a history tool it would delete
whatever section of that line you
painted over and the art history brush
is not very useful so we'll cover that
at another time the eraser tool erases
whatever section of the image very
simple in the background eraser tool
erases the background and since we only
have one layer right here you can see
that's doing the same thing but once you
have multiple layers and we'll talk
about that later on it's pretty useful
and right here we have the gradient tool
in the paint bucket tool the gradient
tool allows you to pick two colors down
here a main color and a foreground color
and go over your image and as you can
see it gradually fades from one color to
the next now the paint bucket tool is
different say we have an entirely new
layer which we'll talk about later and
paint this it allows you to paint solid
colors and this color is the color of
your main color right here
and these stools got the blur tool the
sharpen tool and the smudge tool the
bird so wet whatever you paint over it
blurs the section of your image the
sharpen tool sharpens the section and
the smudge tool I'll show you right now
let's get rid of this layer we just made
so say we wanted to smudge this beside
your smudge tool and as you can see that
portion of the M is smudging
these tools is the dodge tool and what
the Dodge tool does is a light in any
pixel that you paint over the burn tool
does just the opposite
whatever pixels you're painting over it
darkens those pixels the similar color
and the sponge tool just saturates the
colors so whatever colors you're
painting over with a sponge sponge tool
it just brings out more of the natural
colors this is called the pen tool and
it's a whole another tool on its own so
we'll talk about that later the text
tool does exactly like you think if you
click it you can type text either from
left to right or up and down these
arrows are for the pen tool so we'll
talk about those later the rectangle
tool and the other shape tools are just
like the sound if you select a rectangle
to tool you can of course make a
rectangle on your image just basic
shapes and then we have this custom
shape tool down here and as you see if
you go up here you can select from a
wider range of custom shapes
and then you consider drag and now you
have whatever shape you selected on your
image right here is called the note tool
it's for taking notes if you wanted to
remind yourself you can either take it
by text or audio if you have a
microphone this tool is called the
eyedropper tool and is very useful so
you wanted to paint this color with blue
but you couldn't find it anywhere just
select it with the eyedropper tool just
press click and as you can see on your
color palette and now change to blue so
you can now select your brush and paint
with that blue color
and this hand tool or talk about later
the zoom tool is one of the most useful
tools we have to zoom out you click this
tool up here and to zoom in you click
the plus tool to say we wanted to zoom
in just click zoom in and now we could
zoom in you could also use hold down
control on your keyboard keyboard press
- to zoom out or plus the zoom in and
clicking this right here will take you
to the default colors black and white
and if you want a toggle in between them
you can click this it's a SOT the main
color just double click this box right
here and I can select from a range of
colors and then press ok to verify it
and this mask tool we'll talk about
later on and this tool right here just
for changing how you want to view so say
if you want to view a standard or I'll
be working with maximize screen mode and
that's all the time we have for right
now but in the next section we're going
to be talking about the menu bars and if
you're not already there you can go to
