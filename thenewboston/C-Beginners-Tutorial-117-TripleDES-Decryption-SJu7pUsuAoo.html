seventeen sea shark tutorial that I'm
making for Danny Boston and in this
tutorial I'm showing you how to decrypt
data and in case you don't know
decrypting is basically undoing an
encryption so for this tutorial you're
going to need everything that we use in
a previous tutorial and you're also
going to need to have a decrypt button
alright so a decrypt button MightyText
box then put the key that you will be
using to decrypt the data and a text box
to display the decrypted data so under
the encrypt button you're just going to
want to have everything that we used in
the previous tutorial with a few minor
changes we just created this fighter a
to store the encrypted data so that we
can then decrypt the data when the user
clicks this button right here your fun
one so we just set that encrypt data
equal to whatever it encrypts and then
we just convert that encrypted data back
into a string so that we can see it in
this text box the encrypted data so in
order to decrypt the data we're just
going to go ahead and copy all of this
right here because all these settings
are exactly what we need we're going to
need to be using the utf-8 encoding
class as well
however right here it get the key from
text box one which is this text box well
we actually want to use the key in text
box five
so click on any little text box five
text and yeah we do need these settings
just like before to get we don't have
the settings right here
then it won't decrypt properly so now
we're gonna have to create a new
instance of this crypto transform
interface and instead of setting equal
to a krypter we're going to set it equal
to eight decryptor so we're going to say
though transform trans
and we'll study equal to a teacher so
create a decrypter out of our triple des
for a service provider class and in
order to decrypt data you're just going
to want to use the exact same method
that we used in encrypted encryption so
we can just say trans dot transform
final block and this will just be trip
the data so right here it calls for a
byte array that we want to decrypt and
you want to decrypt this encrypted data
up here so it is going to clip and and
the offset it's basically the position
in the byte array that we want to start
decrypting at and that'll be zero if you
want to decrypt the entire array and the
input count or the amount of bytes in
the fighter a that we want to your
decrypt and that would be all of them so
we're just gonna say the length of the
array first good dot the line all right
so now in order to view this decrypted
data in this text box add a string we're
going to be using the utf-8 encoding
class to convert those bytes into a
strength service going to say utf-8
which is the name of our instance of
utf-8 encoding class and then we're just
going to want to use get string method
to convert those bytes into a string and
now we're going to set the textbox doors
sucks we put that so now that decrypted
string will be displayed in this
decrypted text box so now I need to go
up here we're just going to type in a
key atom out the key we're gonna encrypt
a Centon that's a crap hello
so now I'm equipping thrift right here
it's just encrypted we cannot tell you
that says hello I am Adam now if we
supply the same key as before it will
decrypt it properly
Sophie supply Adam as the key which he
key will be used to encrypt it then it
will decrypt it properly service both
decrypt and yet we get hello I'm Adam
but if we try to put something else like
hello and now we try to decrypt it it
won't decrypt it properly little we're
on air so fat data and that just means
that if she was wrong so that's pretty
much it for this tutorial on decrypting
data using the Triple DES algorithm so
see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
