eighth my SQL tutorial and in this
lesson I want to start off by talking
about fully qualified names now let me
go ahead and show you guys what the heck
I'm talking about select address from
customers I'll go ahead and show you
guys the variation that we've been doing
and then I'll show you guys how to make
fully qualified names so if you go ahead
and run this query we can see that it
selects all the addresses from the
customers in our table simple enough so
what is a fully qualified name a fully
qualified name would be something like
this select customers dot address from
customers we go ahead and run this query
it gives the exact same thing so
basically am I saying that there is two
different forms of writing the same
query two different variations of the
same syntax well yes that's exactly what
I'm saying so why is this case why would
they make - hello - basically B we can
give it two different instructions in
the exact same way so first of all
whenever you're working in a class and
you have a really strict teacher they
may make you write the fully qualified
names just to you know make your life
more miserable or a more useful way that
you could you would write fully
qualified names is say you were making a
huge website and you had something like
eBay where you had buyers and sellers
now buyers and sellers both have
addresses so you may want to write okay
buyers address sellers address and then
quickly just by looking at your code you
can determine what table you're working
with so whenever you have a lot of
tables and you have the same a column in
multiple tables it may be useful so that
is you know a different way when you
would want to use fully qualified names
but for the rest of these tutorials I'm
just going to be using the I don't know
what they're called fully unqualified
names I guess I don't know I just made
that up don't quote me but now that we
understand fully qualified names
basically it doesn't you know matter
performance wise it's just you know okay
I'm just going to move on because enough
with fully qualified names they're
boring
what isn't boring though is learning how
to sort our results so let me go ahead
and run
a simple query like select a name from
customers go ahead and hit go and look
at our results
Bucky NOAA Kelsey Cory Harry okay that's
nice but our boss is going to come in
he's gonna be a dude Bucky these names
are way too randomized I want this in
alphabetical order and we're like oh
crap how the heck do we do that but
lucky for you you've been watching my
tutorials and you know that if you add
the keyword order by and then you go
ahead and write the criteria you want to
order your results by you can go ahead
and hit go and check it out whenever we
hit order by name it takes the results
in orders by the name now whenever we're
ordering arm-like letters it's going to
order alphabetically and whenever we're
ordering numbers it's going to order
that what's it called not alphabetically
but by number I guess I don't know how
to say that numerically there we go BAM
baby so by default it orders it from A
to Z and we can change that later on
I'll show you guys how to order in
reverse alphabetical order later on but
now I want to mention this because now
that we know how to order results you
may be thinking okay what if I wanted to
retrieve some information for example I
want to retrieve the name and the
address from customers but I want it to
order by the ID number can I do this
even though the ID number isn't
retrieved well yes you can this is
perfectly legal results can be sorted by
their ID even though we don't want the
ID to be retrieved so let me go and
check it out as you can see in our
result set we get Noah or excuse me
Bucky Noah
Kelsey Corey Harry and at first this may
look unsorted totally but if we browse
the entire customer staple check out the
IDS Bucky Noah
Kelsey Corey Harry so this information
is sorted blur by their ID number even
though the ID number was not retrieved
now I want to mention this another thing
that people get confused a lot about is
whenever they want to sort multiple
columns now we already learn how to
retrieve multiple columns for example we
can retrieve the ID name and address of
you know a table but what if we wanted
to do something like this we wanted to
retrieve multiple columns well let me
just go ahead and show you guys an
example because if I talk try to explain
it without showing you guys an example
it's going to get kind of confusing so
I'll just show you guys the example
first select state city and name so this
is the information we want from
customers and we want to order by state
in name so let me go ahead and run this
and check it out what I'm trying to say
is this at first the first criteria we
give it to order by is state and so it
takes in order two states alphabetically
Arkansas Alabama I don't know what these
I'm not very good to see like Alabama I
think California I know that one but
check it out even though all these
states are sorted alphabetically look
what happens whenever we have one two
three four five six California's so it's
going to say okay I order the states but
how do you want me to order all of the
people that are in California well
whenever we have multiple states we say
ok now that you've done that now the
next criteria to sort by is the name of
the people so says ok first I sorted by
state and then within those states I'm
going to order the people in that state
based on you know of course alphabetical
order so basically states are arranged
in order and then each person in that
state are arranged alphabetically and we
did this by giving it more than one
order criteria first order by state and
then order by name so again the rule for
this is the same is whenever we're
selecting multiple columns one less
comma then column name so just remember
that and you'll be good to go so anyways
that is how you retrieve multiple
columns and order by multiple columns so
ok probably
brain overload right now so I'm going to
let you guys take a break go get a glass
of chocolate milk come back and watch
the next video but for now thank you
guys for watching and we're going to
subscribe and yeah I'll see you next
time and don't forget if you have any
questions just ask me I'm reformed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
