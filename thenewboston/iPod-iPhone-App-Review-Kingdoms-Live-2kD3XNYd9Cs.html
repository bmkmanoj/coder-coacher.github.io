review and this app is for a little game
called kingdoms live now kingdoms live
is pretty similar to this imobsters if
you ever play that before and I even
think it's made by the same company not
entirely sure but this is a free app and
again it's one of those apps that is
very addicting so it starts out on this
kingdoms live screen and go ahead and
close this nice i found a chest okay and
go ahead and click no thanks to this
little ad and now have you start out you
got a bunch of buttons that you probably
don't know anything means that that's
what i'm going to be going over today
now the probably most important thing is
this quest right here now before i do
that you see we also is one of those
games that you can level up by getting
more experience and moving to the next
level so go ahead and you can do this
get experienced by doing quests now
quests pretty much our let you earn gold
which is the money and experience gold
lets you spend stuff obviously an
experience lets you level up so how you
do a quest you just go scroll to the
quest should click do it so then you
have more quest in you unlock them as
you level up another cool thing is
battle which i just call fighting and
this is actual other people that are
playing the game right now i'm on Wi-Fi
so that's everyone who's playing the
game now the winner of the fight let's
see i attack this guy who's a level two
and i lost so how do you decide who wins
and loses well the winner is based on
the size of your army which i'll be
talking about later and everyone their
army their equipment and their spells
and their tech and defense attributes
but we'll be going over that and later
let's see what else you can go over
armory right here these are your like
quick Loki's at the bottom your armory
is pretty much how you can buy weapons
and armor and this will help with your
fighting in battles and spells those
help as well so you get more options as
you can see i only have like three
spells right now you get more options as
you level up you can see i'm only level
for right now because i'm a noob
guys are probably gonna pull mate but
anyways that's how you do that now let's
go ahead and go back home and let's go
to my profile right here now what your
profile is pretty much an overview of
your character and you can also like
spend points here you can look at your
skills on the loo or the stuff you stole
from other people and you know it's just
your profile I didn't really even need
to go into that but you know what I did
so oh uh now the army thing I was
talking about is very important it
depends how much how strong you are when
you go into fights the bigger army you
have the more likely you are to win
fights and if you want to join my army
my code is to XT 89 g so just go ahead
and pop that in there and press invite
and then you'll be in my army and the
more people that we get to join the more
likely we're going to win flights
because our army stronger right now you
see I just got this game so far besides
one so that's pretty embarrassing so I'm
just going to eggs a bit and hopefully
you didn't see that and one of the last
thing I want to talk about well let's
talk about 3 or thurs land is one of my
favorite aspects of the game this are
pretty much investments that you can buy
in you earn a steady income right now
you see I only got one gold coming in
every you know so often but the more
land you by then the more pretty much
income you'll get in well that's pretty
much it no need to talk any further
about that but that's what I like about
this that you can keep earning gold even
when you're you know sleeping you
remember you're at work or anything like
that the game still keeps going on so
aside from that let's go over the vault
right here now whenever you get attacked
and you're not online well or if you are
online people can take your money when
they attack you pretty mean I know but
it's pretty fun and what you can do is
put your money in a vault and that keeps
it safe from attackers so if you know
you're going to sign off and you have a
bunch of money make sure to put it in
the vault in that way they can't give to
it so the last thing I want to talk to
you guys about the less important thing
is this agents right here now that
agents
you get legends points just from doing
random stuff playing the game they
awarded to you what ancients does is
pretty much gives you a variety of
services you can do like you get 200
gold if you spend 10 points you can also
change your name reset your character
and a whole bunch of other stuff like
that or you can buy it from the company
of course points or gold or whatever but
I mean aside from that what you do is
pretty much um keep doing quests keep
leveling up unlocking stuff building
your army and it's actually a really fun
game even though i just started again
like i said a lot similar to high school
superstar and I'm officers that feeling
but I like these type of games up a lot
since you can just pretty much keep
playing them forever and aside from that
is free one hundred percent um that's
why I'm giving this game in a top 10
rating because you know what it really
never gets old if you don't want to do
until you get sick of it so you know
that's all i have for this tutorial or
excuse me review if you want to if you
want me to review any more apps then
just go ahead and leave a comment on
this video right here of what app you
want me to review and i would do for it
doesn't matter if it's a paid app or a
free up or what i'll review for it and
aside from that thank you guys for
watching and don't forget subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
