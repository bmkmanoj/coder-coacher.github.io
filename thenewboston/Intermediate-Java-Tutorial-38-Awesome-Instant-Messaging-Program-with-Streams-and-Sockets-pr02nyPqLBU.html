intermediate Java tutorial and in these
next couple tutorials what I'm going to
be doing is I'm going to be teaching you
guys how to build probably the coolest
program that I taught you guys how to
build yet and that is a simple chatroom
in Java now I say simple chatroom but it
actually uses a lot of in-depth features
such as streams and sockets and this is
probably the first true networking
application that I tell you guys had
bowed yet because you know we build
those we built those other browsers and
stuff that can go to websites and read
files and pretty much connect to the
Internet but this is a true networking
example where I'm actually going to be
building two programs here one of them
sits on my computer one of them sits on
your computer and we can actually chat
back and forth to one another so it's
absolutely amazing definitely the
coolest program that I built yet so let
me go ahead and show you guys how this
works right now what I'm going to do is
I'm actually going to build one program
first and I'll talk you guys through
what you know like what a socket and a
stream is as I'm building it because I
think that's the best way to do things
but I'll go ahead and give you guys a
little background about what I'm doing I
first made a entirely new project and I
named this first class server Java
because this program right here is going
to sit on a public server now just a
2-second you know basic introduction of
what server is if you guys never heard
of it a server is pretty much a computer
that anyone in the world can access so
you guys are going to be able to access
this computer I'm going to be able to
access this computer my mom's going to
be able to pretty much a server is a
public computer so I'm going to be
running this program on my server and
any of you guys that wants to chat with
me you just have to run the other
program and then we can chat back and
forth so let me go ahead and I start
coding this bad boy and you need to do
this too so go ahead and make a class
called server and the first thing we
need to do is import a free things so
import at the speller right import Java
I Oh
there we go already finishing it for me
import Java dotnet there we go
import java.awt import Java probably
coulda type this out beforehand but you
know you guys probably want to okay
event right there and the last thing we
have to do is import Java X swing and
this one's not popping up for me use sob
okay so we got all of our imports again
io net a WT a WT event in swing now what
we need to do after this is we're going
to be building a very simple GUI that
looks a lot like in you know how you
used to use AOL Instant Messenger it's
basically going to look like that with a
little input where you can type your
text in a little chat window which
displays the conversation so in order to
do that we actually need to extends J
frame for all the good GUI crap now I
guess I have time basically to go
through all the variables and pretty
much suck you guys through the core
pieces of this application so the first
thing we need to do is build some
variables for the GUI remember like I
said in old I don't even know it's not
called a chat room it's basically like a
chat application like instant messenger
you pretty much have a little area that
you can type in your text like hey dude
sup ASL and you have another area that
displays you know your conversations
history of all your messages so the
first thing that we need is a variable
that you can type in your message before
you send it so maybe we'll make this
variable private jtextfield and we'll
just name it user text text so that's
the area that you type in your message
before you send it so now we need to
create the area that displays the
conversation so this is going to be
private of course jay-j text area
because you know it's a big area and
we'll just name this the chat window now
again like I said this
is going to display the conversation
itself both year messages and you know
whoever you're talking to their messages
so now after this we need to build some
streams so let me go ahead and code this
variable object output stream and I'll
just name this output so before I
continue let me talk to you guys about
what a stream is now whenever you
connect to someone else's computer
through networking in Java we'll talk
about sockets later on because that's
technically what the connection is
called but just think that you have a
connection between your computer and
someone else's computer now the way that
you guys communicate you actually
communicate through something called
streams there are two main streams
between your computer in another
person's computer there's an output
stream and an input stream now this
output stream is the stream that flows
from your computer to your friends
computer so whenever you send a message
whenever you type hey dude this text
gets sent packed up in a boat sent along
the stream to your friend's computer now
whenever they type message like hey man
what the heck do you want that message
gets packed in a boat or you know a
little rowboat whatever you want to call
it gets sent in the input stream to your
computer so again remember this it's
actually really important output goes
away from you input goes to you and
whenever I say you know like the data
coming in that's what I'm talking about
the messages all the information in that
stuff so now since we have an output
stream we can send stuff away now we
need an input stream so private object
input stream
input I'm not typing over here very
accurately today alright so now we have
our stream set up our main passageways
that we can send stuff out and receive
stuff in so now what we need to do is we
need another variable and this is going
to make sense later on probably not so
much sense now server socket server now
remember that I said that
basically I'm building this first
application that's going to go on the
server so you guys are pretty much going
to be all of the clients because all of
you guys watching this video are
probably going to be on a personal
computer and you know I'm going to put
this program that I'm building right now
on a public server so everyone can
access so this is why I need to set up
the server that basically says ok wait
there's a program that's going to go on
the server and it's going to wait for
everyone to connect to me from a
personal computer or from the client so
this is pretty much the variable that we
have to set up and we just pretty much
have to configure the server to say okay
this is what port you're going to set on
this is where you're going to be on the
server and pretty much it takes another
thing like how many people can wait to
be connected at one time so again like I
said if you guys don't understand this
right now I don't expect you to but
later on whenever I'm you know
configuring the server and showing you
guys how to set everything up to you
know accept people that want to chat
with it you guys can understand that now
the last variable that I want to make
right now is pretty much the most
important variable for this um well for
this tutorial I guess it's a socket
itself now you remember when I was
talking about connections in you know
because I had it I said your computer
and another person's computer are going
to be connected well in Java they
actually named connections sockets so
whenever I say ok arm a socket I don't
know what I'm going to be what context
I'm going to be using it in but I'm
going to say set up the socket I pretty
much mean set up the connection between
your computer and
person's computer so you guys can
actually network interact have a
conversation together so there you go
there is your very basic tutorial and
again that's not like the formal
definition of sockets but for now for
just the introduction that's all you
have to remember a socket just think a
socket is basically a connection between
two computers so in the next tutorial
what I'm going to be doing is we'll set
up the GUI first before we get into any
real programming so that's what we'll be
doing then so thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe in I
can't wait to finish this baby</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
