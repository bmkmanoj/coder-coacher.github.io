and welcome to your third Premiere Pro
tutorial so basically in the last story
what we did is we learned how to
organize all the panels how to move
everything around but now what I want to
talk to you guys about is what the
panels actually do now before I said
that each panel has a different job and
is responsible for taking care of a
different part of the movie so let me go
ahead and start with probably the most
important panel that's debatable between
the timeline and the project panel but
you definitely need both so I want to
talk to you guys about the project panel
however this project is kind of bland
and it's going to be really difficult to
explain what everything is when we
really don't have a movie open at all so
what I'm going to go ahead and do is
open up a project that I've been working
on this is actually a video from my
podcast and all of this stuff is already
loaded and I know that you don't even
know how to load everything and slice it
up but once you see a project put
together in the final product it's going
to be really easy for me to explain
everything and you're going to be able
to understand a whole lot easier so the
very first thing I want to take a look
at is this project panel right here its
main job is to organize all of your
files for your entire movie and we're
saying alright if I'm making a movie I
don't have like one video clip right oh
no when you're making a movie you have
video clips you have maybe a music track
maybe separate audio tracks you have
titles pictures for example check this
out
in like the first 10 seconds I start out
with the picture is my title and then I
move to this camera angle which is one
track and then I move to this camera
angle which is another trick so those
are three separate files like in the
first 10 seconds and if I wanted to add
a title or a caption under here that
would be even another trick so again
working with multiple files and being
able to organize them is critical and
that's the job of the project panel
right here so let's go ahead and kind of
take a tour of it and before I maybe you
want to follow along and have your own
video files interesting are Bucky
just tell me how to get the video files
so I can kind of follow along with you
to get the video files into your
projects panel or to get anything
pictures audio clips into your project
panel go ahead and hit file import and
then just go ahead and scroll through
you know on your computer wherever the
file is and double click it and it's
going to go ahead and import it into the
project panel so now once it's imported
what you can do is you can go ahead and
select it and once it's highlighted it's
going to show you the information of it
right there so if we're saying all right
what one of these clips is the one I'm
looking for maybe you can tell from the
information listed right there or if you
need to if it's a video clip you can go
ahead and hit this play button and
that's going to give you a nice little
preview however there's a better way to
get a preview and that's by double
clicking it and it'll just appear in the
source but I thought I'd tell you about
that thumbnail to sense it you know it's
right there in front of you so aside
from you know just getting the
information if you go ahead and double
click any of your sources for example if
I wanted to name this image something
different I wanted to name it title I'll
go ahead and double click the name and
name it title and just go ahead and hit
enter and that's going to rename it so
that's a whole lot easier to tell what
it is other than you know what was it
something dot ping you know it just
makes a lot more sense so you're saying
all right I have all this crap right
here it's a lot of stuff to manage well
I don't mean to throw everything on you
at once but there's even more
information for each piece so say you're
looking for a specific clip and you
import it like five different clips if
you go ahead and scroll to the right you
can see stuff like video duration maybe
you're looking for a long one or maybe
you want to make sure I don't know I
just want to let you guys know that
there's a lot more information and if
you can't find it then you probably
should be scrolling to the right a lot
of people don't even know about that
which is surprising but anyways thought
I'd tell you about that now the last
couple things I want to talk about are
these buttons down here these first two
are pretty much your different views
I always do everything in ListView
because it's so much easier if you go
ahead and switch the icon view I mean
this is just really hard to manage and
it's just not the best way to do things
so guys I'm always going to be sticking
with ListView and that's what I'm going
to recommend now this other stuff is the
find is just up here whenever you want
to find like title there you go it's
really more useful whenever you have a
bunch of stuff but I only have like six
different things so it's really weird to
explain the fine thing because we can
just look but anyways if you have a huge
list of stuff then you can either find
it through there or here a new bin is
basically just like a folder or a
directory on your computer say you want
to organize this audio file in this
title and put it in a folder called crap
so you'd go ahead and click this and you
would name this crap and hit enter and
now you can go ahead and drag this in
the crap and you can go ahead and drag
this title in the crap by just selecting
the icon and hovering over the name then
releasing and now all of this stuff is
in this folder and if you want to expand
it just go ahead and click the arrow and
if you want to collapse it just go ahead
and click the arrow so for my podcast
I'll show you guys when this would be
useful I have two different camera
angles one that's mainly on me one
that's mainly on her and I put all the
clips from one camera on me and all the
clips from another camera on her so then
instead of having to look at all this
crap I just have to look at two nice
pretty looking folders so how cool is
that
so aside from that arm where was I knew
bin we have a new item now you know how
I said that we can add video clips in
what so else did I show you audio tracks
titles which was pretty much the image
we could also add other things new
sequences and I'll tell you guys about
sequences later but titles for example
if I wanted to put a custom title over
here we can do that arm bars and tone
I'll show you that later black video is
just a plain black video and you're
saying well when would that be
would be used
when would you want your video to be all
black well say for example you were
fading out maybe you want a black
background so you would put a black
background behind your video you know
it's not like you're going to edit a
bunch of black video together and make a
documentary about space or something
like that there actually is a use and
I'll be showing it to you guys later on
but aside from that I think that is
pretty much all there is for the project
panel again pretty much to sum it up it
organizes all your files in everything
you need to work with your main movie so
there you go there it is I hope you guys
learn at least a little bit so for now
thank you guys for watching and I will
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
