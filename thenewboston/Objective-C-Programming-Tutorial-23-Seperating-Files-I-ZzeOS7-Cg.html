your 23rd objective-c tutorial and in
this tutorial we're gonna be learning a
little more about classes and taking a
break from the if/else statement because
I mean come on it was getting kind of
boring so why are you gonna learn more
about classes and what else is your
learned well before whenever we made a
class in a program with interface and
implementation section we put it all in
one big file but I showed you how to do
this because that's the easiest simplest
way but when your program in the program
in the world no one ever does this they
always break up that interface the
implementation and the main program into
three separate files why because it's
easier when you work with large programs
and if you're building any program at
all that's useful this is what you need
to do so let's go ahead and go back to
the very bare-bones and what we're going
to be doing is taking a program that we
built before if you remember from like
tutorial 5 or 6 and we're gonna be
splitting it up into different files and
I'm going to show you how so let's go
ahead and create a new Xcode project
right here and what we want to do is of
course we want to get a new project
application right over here make sure
you have that selected and then once you
do go ahead and click command-line tool
right here and then make sure this is on
foundation and now go ahead and click
Choose right here and I'm gonna name my
project like bucky test two because I
already have a bucky test so go ahead
and save this and now you see if you
click on Bucky test 2 em we already have
the simple program inserted for us so
this is gonna be the file Bucky um let
me scroll down here Bucky test um that
we're gonna have our main method and run
our main program but like I said this is
only one of the files we're gonna be
using we also need those two other files
I was talking about
so what we're gonna do is go up and I
know you guys can't see this in I don't
really feel like messing with my screen
recorder but at the top on menu bar
that's out of view if the verse says
Apple Xcode file edit view go ahead and
file and click new file and then once
you click a new file this thing pops up
so what you want to do here is under Mac
os10
go ahead and click Co Co class Objective
C class subclass of nsobject and then go
ahead and click Next
right there because we're gonna want to
create a new class which is pretty much
a new file now for our file name before
in case you forgot from it was many
tutorials ago I named it person because
we created person object and it says
when you create person em also create
person H and by the way person H is the
interface and person M is the
implementation so with bucky test to arm
that's the main one person H this is
going to be the interface in person M
this is gonna be even implementation so
if you go ahead and click finish right
here you see and by the way go ahead and
click source so you can see all your
files if you select only one of these
then you only see one of them go ahead
and click source and then it shows you
all your files so now in your same
directory you have person H person not m
and Bucky testitude I am again person
about H this is where we're gonna put
the interface person that M this is
we're gonna implement it and Bucky test
through that M this has your main method
which you need to run your program so go
ahead and click source and under your
source I guess we can go ahead and do
person H first and now you can see that
you have all of this code with these
comments and this gives you a nice
little place to put your interface first
problem we have off the bat we need to
change this cocoa since this is a
Cocco application we need changes to
Foundation and Foundation dot H in it
automatically filled in the other dot H
for me not cool man not cool so what we
have now is under person H you can see
right here we can begin making the
interface now I'm not going to go over
everything that's in the interface
because I did in tutorial five or six or
something but we have an age in there
and these are the properties of person
and we have an int weight so after we
have our variables we write what methods
we want well let's go ahead and put void
and we have a method called print' and
then void
and then we have a method called set age
and this takes a argument of int a and
what we're gonna be doing is later on is
passing it in a value called a and
setting equal to H and let's just go
ahead I'm gonna copy that not that lazy
void set Waits
there we go and this has an argument
that's int of course and it takes W and
what this does is set the weight so for
our interface what we need to do is
first of all delete this because it's
ticking me off way too much comments
what we do is import foundation
foundation H and for our variables make
sure you have a age and weight and for
your three methods that we're going to
be implementing later make sure you have
a print set age and set weight with
arguments of a and W is integers so
that's all I have for you guys for now
so thank you guys for watching don't
forget to subscribe and I'll see you
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
