your ninth get tutorial and in this
video i want to talk to you guys a
little more about diff and i want to
show you guys a problem that a lot of
beginners have and i want to explain it
and hopefully after this video you'll
understand on how to avoid this problem
so let's just go ahead and open up any
text file i'm just hold on got a
freaking itch in my eye
eyelash stuck to my eyeball awesome
so uh let's just go ahead and make some
changes to the first text file and i'll
just put like hand blasts or whatever so
let's go ahead and save this and now if
you open up bash and put git diff it
says okay that file which is the one on
your working copy is different from the
one in the repository so that's why it
pretty much is telling you the changes
that's what we learned in the last video
right but check this out what i'm going
to do now is put git add first text and
whenever i hit enter what it does is it
takes this file and takes it and takes
it from the working copy and puts it in
the staging area so if I do get death
now and hit enter a lot of people expect
to see the differences but what this
diff command does is it only shows the
differences between your working copy in
the repository since this file is now in
the staging area it's not comparing it
against the repository so that's why it
looks like everything is up-to-date even
though you still have this file that's
different than the one in your
repository so if you're like okay I open
up my git bash um so how exactly do we
compare the staging area against the
repository well it's actually really
really easy put git diff and again what
this is doing is comparing your
repository against your working copy but
if you add the option - -
staged and to enter what this does now
is it compares the files in your staging
area against the repository so remember
just real quick get def compares working
copy and a repository and get this stage
compares staging area in a repository so
now um what we can do let's just go
ahead and get come in and we'll just put
a I don't know made some really dumb
changes hit enter and now if we do get
status enhancer or working directory
scaling again so I just want to point
out that differences well shows a
difference the that detail about the
diff command because it confuses a lot
of people and well that's it nice short
video so thing guys for watching number
get subscribed and I'll see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
