show you how to create a list view and a
list view is a little bit different than
the other lists that we've been creating
because first of all it's not a
drop-down you're going to have a list in
a fixed area and if your items are
bigger than that then you're going to
have one of these little bars on either
the right-hand side or the bottom so
another thing that or another reason
that it's different is unlike a
drop-down list where you can only select
one item from the list whenever you have
a list view you can select multiple
items so it's kind of like selecting
files on your computer where you can
like select multiple items or just one
of them and let me just run this real
quick and show you guys where we're
starting so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to show you guys how to create a
simple list view and whenever we click
this button print it out on the screen
so and this is actually really similar
to a combo box so list view boom look at
that store some strings in there not
strength certain all right string and
we'll just name it list view now under
the button and create a right here let's
view and set this equal to new list view
now the easiest way to add items to your
list view is just right the list view
get items no matter if you're just
adding items in there for the first time
or it already has items in it like we
said before at all and whenever you do
this you can add multiple items at a
time so I'll say like Ironman oh it's
another one Titanic um by the way did
you guys ever see the movie contact um I
actually don't know I'm pretty sure
that's what it's called has Jodie Foster
in it awesome awesome movie it's about
like a you know these aliens send down
this like machine and the want humans to
communicate with them sounds bet it's
better than I explained it trust me so
by the way another movie surrogates
where these people have like I think
plugged into their back of the head and
they can like control
just just watch it it's awesome I'm
terrible at Alex what if that was like
the voice to a trailer oh man that would
be awful all right so anyways we created
a ListView and we added four movies to
it and then after this what you can do
is you can actually set the selection
model now by default you can only select
one of these items in this case one
movie but what if you want to be able to
select multiple movies maybe you're
making like a Netflix app and the user
selects what movies they want sent to
their house well they can either choose
one or maybe they want for movies sent
through their house at a time so the
first thing you need to do is get the
selection model before you can edit it
and then hey how did you get down there
buddy
okay cursor and set selection mode and
if you want to select multiple ones you
just use selection mode multiple so let
me just add this to the screen or a
quick and I'll show you guys what that
just did so again there is our ListView
again it's not a drop down menu in of
course if we had um more items for
example if we had like a dozen items in
it was longer or bigger than this box
then we would have a little scroll bar
on the right hand side but check this
out anytime you want to select one item
just click it anytime you want to select
multiple ones you can click it hold down
control and click another one and of
course any time you want to select a
range of items just click it hold down
shift and so I fell the items in that
range so just like we're working with
you know basically any computer and just
so I show you guys how to handle the
items a little bit more room here I'll
say uh whenever we click the button just
print out whatever items we have
selected and it's a little bit tricky
because you just can't say print out
this item you don't know how many items
these are has selected they have one do
they have a dozen so I'll show you guys
how to handle
a little tricky bit of logic and we'll
just build a method called button
clicked private void button click in the
towel we do it and we don't need to pass
anything in because we declared our list
view up there so we can just reference
it down here alright so shrink message
will be the message that I'm going to
print out in the terminal now remember
all of the lists that you work with in
JavaFX are of type observable list so
what we can do is we can actually grab
the items from here in other words we
can grab whatever items the user
selected store them inside an observable
list object and then we can just do
something cool like a loop through so
that's pretty handy so now what we have
to do is actually take movies and set it
equal to ListView which was that
ListView that we just created that we
saw on the screen and in order to get
the items that they selected we need to
get the selection model and get selected
items so this is going to return all of
the items that they have selected it
might be one it might be all four of
them we don't know in we stored it
inside the list movies so now it's
really easy we just treat it like any
kind of other you know pretty much in
array any kind of list so we're going to
take movies and loop through them all
and treat each movie as M and then we
can just do something like for our
message that we're going to print out um
I'll just say M plus like I don't know a
new line
so this is pretty much just going to
loop through each movie that the user
selected and one by one is going to
store inside the variable or the string
message and then we can just print it
out in the terminal so it's just thumb
outs message so that's that let's run it
and check it out all right so I'm just
going to select contact right now hit
submit contact
now what if I select Iron Man &amp;amp;
surrogates prints out Iron Man
surrogates and of course you can select
them all and boom look at that so again
what we did is we created a really basic
ListView and then whenever we click the
button we made a temporary observable
list and it looked at our ListView and
saw okay you have these items selected
so I'm going to make a real quick loop
in one by one I'm going to add all of
those movies to the message variable and
print them out on the screen so there
you go thank you guys for watching and
in next tutorial I'm going to show you
guys a really awesome list called a tree
view and it's essentially something like
this where you can expand your options
and you can have like multiple these are
well talk to you guys about the
terminology in the next video so yeah
it's gonna be cool see them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
