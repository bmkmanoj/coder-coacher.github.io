to talk to you about variables and also
nesting if we have time so this is my
website right now all I have is heading
and a paragraph look how beautiful that
looks and I also have a link to this
main CSS file now this is just a regular
CSS file that we're including but we
don't even have it created yet the only
other file that we created is the sass
file and any sass file that we create
has the S CSS extension so let's go
ahead and learn how to use variables so
what I'm going to be doing is I'm going
to be changing this heading in the
paragraph to both use green but instead
of just writing it like normal I'm going
to show you guys a cool way to do it so
I'm just going to name my green any
variable name I want and any time you
make a variable use the dollar sign in
the variable name so your variable name
can be letters and numbers or hyphens or
the minus sign just you can name it
pretty much anything you want just don't
include any weird symbols like on
percent signs or like at symbols or hash
tags or anything stupid like that so
just stick with like letters and numbers
and hyphens you'll be good so I'm going
to name my primary color you can name it
tuna Bucky whatever you want and then
add a colon and then after give it a
regular value just like you were typing
normal CSS now actually let me just go
ahead and write green to make things
really easy to understand so now instead
of the actual value the actual word
green whenever we want to include this
color anywhere we can just use this
variable so let me add it for what's his
heading one and paragraphs so I'll say
heading one and let me copy this and
I'll say color is this and what this
means is since this is a placeholder for
green you're pretty much going to look
at this and say okay for heading one the
color equals green now let me just do
this for the paragraph as well and I
know I can put both of these on the same
lines and make it more efficient but I
just want to demonstrate that you can
actually have this variable in several
different locations so now what's going
to happen is our compiler and remember
already I already have one built in is
this going to look at this and translate
it into regular CSS so if I expand this
it auto-generated this file so I pretty
much took that variable and replace it
with green everywhere we use that so now
if i refresh this page it now turned to
green now the cool thing about this is
before before we learn by a CSS or sass
if we ever wanted to change its color
then we would have to go through all of
our files find this instance of green
and say we wanted to change it to red so
I'd have to go right here and let me add
semi-colons bothering me and change it
to red and here change it to red in this
color I know in this example you know we
only use it in two different spots but
usually we use it like in 30 different
spots whenever we're making an actual
website but now if our bus comes in is
like hey change the color we only have
to change it in this spot such as that
and it automatically updates in every
single place we have the variable so
check that out it's a lot more efficient
especially when you have multiple files</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
