with a video tutorial for the new Boston
now in the last video looking at some of
the jQuery utilities with regards to
functions we looked at in array and this
checked whether a particular value was
present in an array in this video we're
going to take a look at inserting values
into arrays using just the standard
JavaScript just standard JavaScript and
not a jQuery and not the jQuery library
but we're also going to be looking at
the each utility or the each function
and this will loop through element in an
array and we're gonna just display them
out on took you know area on our page so
the first thing I want to go and do is
just modify this form that we used in
the last tutorial if you haven't already
seen this tutorial all we have is an
input box where we can type a user's
name and then we have a button that in
the last tutorial we use to check if
this was in a particular array now what
we're gonna do instead is change this
value here just to insert and we're
gonna allow the user to enter a name
into this text box and then pop that
into an array or push this into an array
and then we're gonna be looping through
the results and just displaying them out
so they'll get instant feedback so let's
go ahead and change this to insert as
well as the value as well I'm gonna go
ahead and create a just a div content
area down here where we can list out
these names and I'm just going to call
that names so we've got util jeaious
which i've included on my page and we
can start writing out code in here the
first thing I'm gonna do as with the
majority of code you're right is
document dot ready and inside here we'll
have a function which we will then just
pull down and inside here is all the
code that we're going to use when the
document is loaded okay so the first
thing we want to go ahead and just and
do is just outline a function that's
going to loop through the the values in
a particular array so I'm just gonna
define this function and we're not going
to fill it in just yet so the function
is going to be called display
oh right and underneath here I want to
be able to check whether the insert
button has been clicked so I'm going to
go ahead and set up an event handler for
our insert button so we use a ID
selector to select insert and then we
say dot click and then inside there we
create our function and we just pull
that down now just up here after the
function definition and before this
event handler I'm gonna go ahead and a
create a an array called names I'm gonna
just put three values into this so one
two three and the first one just Alex
Billy and then Dale so we now have this
names array so what we want to do is
when the user clicks insert we want to
retrieve the value let's just refresh we
want to retrieve the value from here put
that into an array and then we're going
to use our function to just list
everything in the array down here on a
line by line basis so the first thing we
want to do inside of our click function
is grab the name so I'm going to create
a new variable called name and again we
use an ID selector to select the name
text area and we just take the value
from that using Val okay so now what we
want to do is go ahead and pop that into
the array or push this into the array
sorry
so we use names which is our a name up
here and we use dot push and dot push is
just going to take a value or a set of
values that we want to put into the
array so we could specify them like this
or we could specify just one element and
that's just going to be name so the name
that's currently that's been entered
once the button has been clicked that
goes into the array and then we call it
the display array function we also want
to go ahead and call the display array
function just down here so as soon as
the user lands on the page the array is
displayed as well so now that we've done
this all we've essentially done is
created our array with three values in
to begin with we're displaying these
values initially to the user and then
once they click the insert button it
will take the value from the name input
field
here and that will push that into the
array and then it will just redisplay
the array so that we've got enough to do
now is use the each utility which is the
whole point of this tutorial to actually
display this now the first thing we want
to go ahead and do is just clear the
names div so I'm just gonna say names
text and then we'll just enter an empty
value in there now what we want to do is
go ahead and loop through all of our
results so at the moment when i refresh
and type in a name let's just say Ashley
the array now contains the values Alex
Billy Dale and Ashley but obviously we
haven't displayed this to the user yet
so we need to use dollar dot each and
then we fill this in to actually loop
through particular results from a
specified array so this is going to take
two parameters and then we have a
callback function with two additional
parameters and what we want to do is say
names and that's the name of the array
so we've specified the name of the array
which is names and then we want our
callback function just here I want to go
ahead and just pull that down and inside
a function we're gonna take two
parameters or feedback two parameters
and that's index and value so index is
the position that each element is
located at so for example Alex is
located at zero Billy at one day lat -
and then so on and value will be Alex
Billy and Dale so we can also point out
where the the elements are located so
this is would be good for you know
searching in an array and then you know
modifying an array perhaps taking values
out and putting new values in so it's
extremely you know powerful way to hold
data as I'm sure you already know if you
program before so now what I want to do
is for each name I want to go ahead and
append this to the names div so I'm
going to say name names dot append
and in here we want to append on the
value and then we want to append some
text and then the in there are sorry
yeah the index so I'm gonna say value ie
Alex Billy or Dale or anything else I'm
an actual fact no we don't need to do
that that was from the last tutorial
sorry what we want to do is display the
value and then a line break okay so got
a bit ahead of myself but yeah we've got
the value and then a line break so at
the moment when we enter the page we
call this display array function and
what it will do is it all it'll show
Alex and then a line break and Billy
then a line break and then Dale and then
another line break so when we add
another value in it will just keep
appending to this list and remember the
function does the display error sorry
the display array function clears this
before it really fills the div with this
data just so we don't get duplicate data
so let's go ahead and just refresh you
can see that we've now got Alex Billy
and Dow in a list and what we can then
do is go ahead and enter a name so when
we click insert we'll just run through
it again we have the handler here we
grab the value from the text field we
add it to the right and then we again
call the display array function so that
will just display that back out so when
I click insert you can see that that's
just pushed on to the end of the array
so we can go ahead and type in you know
a variety of names and they'll just be
added to the array so a somewhat useless
application you know depending on you
know you might want to go ahead and and
use it somewhere else but a somewhat
useless application but it demonstrates
the use of each and also you know sort
of like an original JavaScript
functionality with regards to pushing a
value onto an array so hopefully you've
learned a bit about arrays and also
looping through arrays and as I
mentioned before if you want to go ahead
and hold data in the front end in
JavaScript variables and it's lots of
data that obviously belonged to one
category or one you know group you can
go ahead and use a raise because it's
extremely powerful and jQuery does have
some utilities that do deal with arrays
so go ahead to the jQuery documentation
lookup utilities and see what other
things you can do with arrays
such as converting etc so yeah that's a
the each utility in jQuery</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
