nights we finally have the perfect
Android app develop so now what we need
to do is we need to figure out how to
get this on the Google Play Store so we
can start making millions of dollars now
the process is actually really easy
what's going to happen is Android studio
is pretty much going to take all of your
files and bundle them together into
something called an apk file now that
apk file is the thing that you put on
whatever app store probably Google Play
or in or excuse me
Amazon also has an app store that you
could put it on but essentially that's
what we need to do first we need to
pretty much export this into a apk file
so we can publish it wherever we want so
the first thing that we need to do is go
down to this icon at the bottom and
choose build variants so whenever we
were just developing the app what we did
is we were building it in debug mode now
that's really good for like I said
developing because it shows you if you
have any bugs and gives you some other
cool messages but now once you're ready
to actually build the final release
click on this and change it to release
so this is going to say ok now when I
build it I'm building the final version
of this the version that other users can
actually install that's what we want now
we adjust myself in my seat here alright
so from here what we do is we actually
go up to build and say we want to
generate assign apk I already know what
apk means is the final version of your
app but what's this sign thing well
here's the thing anytime you publish a
app you need to sign it and signing it
just like signing anything in real life
it just verifies your identity so it
says ok bucket Roberts this is your app
or if you're working for a company like
I don't know like Microsoft Microsoft
this is your app it pretty much just
ties in identity along with the final
build so since we don't have any keys
yet in the key is just another name for
your digital signature we're going to
create a new one
now in order to understand what a key
store path is we need to understand what
a key is so like I just said all it is
is your identity either your
organization or your name so I'm just
going to say that um I'll just say that
this app is being developed under the
new boss then again all you have to
write is either your organization name
or your first name you don't need fill
out this other stuff out and for the key
you can name anything you want did this
certificate is pretty much your identity
and the alias and password is just armed
for you it's nothing that the like the
user doesn't see it on the Google place
or anything so for the alias I'm just
going to write like a release key and
give a password
and for the validity it's always good to
have 25 years don't do anything less
than that actually i think google
recommends 25 years so this is pretty
much setting up your identity and
remember to uh it's always a good idea
to write down your password and your
alias because later on if you ever want
to update this app it's going to ask for
your password to verify that you are
indeed the owner so if you lose this
then you actually need to delete your
app from the App Store and republish an
entirely new one so again that's why you
have to set all this up so that's your
key so what the heck is this key store
stuff the key store is just a file that
contains all of your keys all of your
signatures so I know it's kind of weird
but uh hey um you have to yell like yell
at Google or whoever made Android studio
so for the keystore path click this
button right here it says where do you
want to store the file that's going to
hold all of your keys well I already
made a directory on my desktop called
final apps you can name it anything you
want I'll just write like key store and
this file is encrypted so if you're just
trying to look at it in notepad or
something it would like look like weird
hieroglyphics
so to unencrypt it if you just give it a
password like before and there you go so
again once you hit OK it's going to
create a key store path which is a
special file to hold all of your keys
and it's going to create this one key
which pretty much says ok you are the
new Boston and verify that later on this
is the password that you need to give me
so hit OK and now it automatically fills
out all your stuff for you so just hit
next and just hit OK and alright so
you're trying to build a final version
and of course where do you want to put
it actually just want to put it no not
there by default so
I'll put it in final apps and build type
release and everything else is good by
default and it really doesn't matter
where you put it but uh put it somewhere
that you can remember and click finish
so now it's going to start building that
final apk for you and you can check the
status of it down there and when it's
finished it says sign apk generated
successfully so I'm just going to close
that and I'll show you guys so again
this is the keystore file that's my
special encrypted file with all of my
signatures in it and this APK this is
the final file that you add to the
Google Play Store so later on in the
next tutorial I'm going to show you guys
how to set up um you know how to add an
app to the Google Play Store how to add
all your screenshots in your main icon
and description and stuff like that so
we now have a signed apk file we are now
good to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
