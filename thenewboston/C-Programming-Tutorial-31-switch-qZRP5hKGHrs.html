switch statement a very cool way and see
that you can pretty much take a variable
and test it against several different
possibilities or options now this is
kind of the same as in if-else if-else
statement but it's a lot cleaner syntax
and you can do a couple different cool
things with it as well so in this
example I'm just going to be taking a
grade like a student's grade ABCD or F
and using that to test because we know
we have limited options it could only be
equal to one of those five letters so
let's do that right now so char grade
set this equal to C and now here is the
syntax for the switch statement you type
the word switch and then right after it
you type what you're going to be testing
so what is the variable that can have
those possibilities well it's grade it
can have one of five possibilities which
is the letters a b c d and f so in
between curly brackets in between these
are where we're going to be explicitly
writing all of those possibilities that
could have so in order to do that we use
some kind of a weird syntax we type the
word case hit a space and then type the
value that it could possibly be equal to
so again the first thing is a now after
this add another space and add a colon
not a semicolon just a regular colon now
you can pretty much read this like a
sentence so it's saying test grade to
see what it's equal to in the case of a
colon what do we want to happen well
after the colon you can type either just
one single statement on a bunch of
statements as many statements as you
want just like you would inside an if
statement so what I'm going to do is
just pretty much print something out on
the screen what would we say to the
student who got an A
I don't know I just say some stupid like
sweet and I don't know why it says sweat
with tea accidentally hip caps lock
there but I'm just going to leave that
okay so apparently if the student got an
a we're going to yell sweat to them why
I don't know who the heck cares now
after this under the statement right
here I'm going to add the keyword break
and once I get done with this entire
switch statement I'm going to explain to
you guys why I did that because if I
just say right now it's not going to
make sense so this is what you do if the
student gets an A you have sweat to them
and then just add this keyword break
whatever that does so on the next line
we need to build another case so in the
case of B we need to print out something
else other than sweat we'll say um could
have tried harder you know we got to be
rough on the kid you know that's
parenting 101 don't take it easy on them
never okay so now got a couple other
ones to take care of see okay what would
you say if your kid got a C well I would
say I see you didn't study and that is
why I am NOT dad because I wouldn't make
very good one because I would always use
puns when I should be you know actually
having a conversation with them but
whatever all right now what would you
say if they got a D well I would tell my
kid is that's embarrassing
say hey spell embarrassing I hope so if
not well that is embarrassing how ironic
is that
now for F
um what would you say in the case of a F
I would be uh actually let's do this
let's say in case of F we just tell them
that that's embarrassing and if they get
a D just tell them that you love the D
then again thank God I'm not a father
right now
now what this switch statement says
right now is this test this character
right here if it's an a do this stuff if
it's a B do this stuff so we can pretty
much see the syntax of it right now
however when all your cases are done
we're going to add one last case and
that's default now what this key word
basically means is if you go through the
options a B C D and F and this character
isn't any of those then run this
statement by default so what if we test
it every character and none of them
equal a B C D or F well then that grade
like wouldn't even make sense so be like
that doesn't even make sense explanation
mark why the heck not in a new line now
if you run this right here check it out
right now it's C so it said okay I'm
going to test this in the case of a
print this out well it's not a it's not
B it's C so what do you want me to do
since is equal to C well just print this
out I see you didn't study what you did
right here and then break so if we added
something else like I don't know what's
even not a letter like P and then we ran
this what this program is going to
pretty much read like is okay you want
to test the grade is it equal to a nope
B no C D F nope so by default if none of
these cases are true then this is what
you want me to do and it just says that
doesn't even make sense because P is not
a grade so that's what happened so the
only other thing we need to figure out
right
is what the heck does this break
statement mean so let me go ahead and
type B in there so we you know forget
about the P and check this out what this
break statement means is just like a
loop it pretty much breaks out of it or
discontinues it early now why would we
want that well it pretty much is good
for um speed and well let me tell you
what it does first the reason that we
want to break early is because we found
our answer there so there's no need to
test if it's C D or F once we found the
case we're looking for why would we even
want to run these because we know
they're not going to occur so what break
does they say okay once you find it skip
over all of these and continue pretty
much just helps you save memory and
makes your program run a little bit
faster so that's what the break does
again you already know the break keyword
so you probably already understand it so
hopefully now you guys got a pretty good
grasp on the switch statement and in the
future tutorials I'm going to be showing
you guys another way that this is
incredibly useful but for now I'll
actually have nothing to say so thanks
for watching I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
