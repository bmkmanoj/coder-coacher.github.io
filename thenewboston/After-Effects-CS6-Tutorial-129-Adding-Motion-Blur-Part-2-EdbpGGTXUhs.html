limits and samples per frame so if you
read this down here and I'll read it for
you
because this is a newer for the cs6 this
little text box here samples per frame
controls the number of motion blur
samples for classic 3d layers and we're
in classic 3d right now that's the mode
that our 3d is in so here's classic 3d
right here now 2d motion our 2d layer
motion automatically uses more samples
per frame
when needed so you don't really need to
mess with that in 2d motion up to the
value specified by adaptive sample limit
and that's this right here and we can
increase that to have more samples when
needed in a 2d layer raytrace 3d layers
like when you're creating 3d with in
After Effects cs6 use ray tracing
quality to control the appearance of
motion blur so we've got the adaptive
sample limit here if we increase it I'm
going to increase the shutter angle here
so we can see this a little better
what's 360 because I know that negative
180 is gonna be what we want here let's
increase the adaptive sample limit to
256 which is double and we can increase
this to like 32 or something like that
it's supposed to increase the quality
here of the motion blur the maximum
adaptive sample limit is 256 and you
can't go any higher than that and you
want to increase that more when the
motion when the object is moving a lot
faster so let me put this back at where
it was which was one I can't remember
what it was at so I'm just gonna hit
cancel bring it back up it was at 128
and 16 here so what I'm gonna do is make
this anime
a little faster which I probably can't
do with this on right let's make this
faster and you can see how the motion
blur will change if I can bring it back
to the middle
see we're supposed to get a strobe
defect when something is too fast it
doesn't seem to be doing it with this
picture very well but what happens is
when you have a something going too fast
in after-effects it will kind of do like
a it's called a strobe defect and it's
like the picture actually seems like
it's broken apart in the blur instead of
all nice and blurry together so if that
ever happens to you then increase the
adaptive sample limit I'm gonna increase
this a little more now you can see how
the blur is a lot different now it's
only on the sides so let's try to
increase the adaptive sample limit when
it's in the middle really far like this
so composition composition settings and
if you use this a lot then the
composition settings hotkey is ctrl K or
that is command key on a Mac so let's
increase this to 256 and you can see how
it is a lot smoother now and I'll put it
back I'll put it down to something like
90 and we can see you can start seeing
how the effect is a lot like is not as
good looking
now it's a lot more blurry in between
I'll zoom in and we can look at it
that's gonna just be blurred up by 5
zoom in it's gonna be pixelated and
stuff we won't be able to tell but you
get that just keep it a keen eye out for
these things and make sure you're paying
attention to what it looks like I'm
gonna put these back on the original
again 128 16 that's what I wanted so
I'll hit okay now a motion blur also
works on masks so let me turn this off
real quick and make a mask I turned it
off just by clicking on the motion blur
column here and I'll just create a quick
mask show you that it also works on
masks so we got that I turn this back on
and now it works on the mask yep
now if any of you have ever tried using
motion blur before and have rendered and
you can't figure out why it's not
rendering correctly I'll have to show
you that so we're gonna add this
composition to the render queue and I'll
go over that in another something else
so in another tutorial so we're gonna
add to the render queue by going to
composition add to render queue now we
have to come down here to this section
here called render settings and click on
the yellow lettering here you know bring
up a reddit render settings box we come
down to this time sampling section and
there is a motion blur section here now
it might be set on to off or on now you
want it to be on if you want the motion
blur to work correctly in your render if
you have it to off it's not gonna work
so that's a something you need to make
sure that is on and that I'll make sure
it'll help you like figure out what what
the heck's going on because that's
something people might get caught up on
so that's all I've got for you for this
tutorial about motion blur it's a handy
tool actually and it makes things look
nice so use that up it's a pretty nice
day out today so I think I'm gonna go
over to Bucky's house and grill up some
steaks with them and or maybe some
burgers actually I kind of would rather
have a burger today because we always
eat steaks so I'll see you guys later
and I'll make some more tutorials after
we eat so have a good one everybody have
a happy Memorial Day if you were in the
US and have a I'm not sure in you the
other holidays I think there are any
this weekend for any other country so
sorry about that see you later everybody
have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
