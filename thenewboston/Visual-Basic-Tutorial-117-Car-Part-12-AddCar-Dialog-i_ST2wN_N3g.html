youtube.com slash on live gamer for the
new Boston and in this tutorial we're
gonna be working more on the car program
now as I've said before if this doesn't
look familiar to you you may want to
move back to the beginning to the
beginning of the series okay so you may
remember that we added this button right
here that says new car that will allow
us to add a new car to the program but
at the moment it doesn't actually do
anything
we haven't even created the event for it
so let's just go ahead and paste this
debated right here then we'll be
accessing that in a second so go ahead
come over to car application right click
and add a windows form select windows
forms windows form and just call it new
car vb and then add it i've already
added it so i'm just going to click
cancel so here's my new car dot V B this
is the design for it now let's come over
here to our all cars file and we'll see
some of the information that we're going
to need to create a new car so we're
gonna need the color the name let's just
leave the starting speed at 0 miles per
hour
the number of doors and the horsepower
so let's just start adding stuff to our
new car form we will add a label we'll
set the name to label name and we will
set the text value to name of car now
we're going to need to do is let's add a
text box so the user can type in a name
for their car we'll make this a little
bit bigger and we will set the name of
it to text car name now I'll do this
again for the color and some of the
other properties of our car
so we will do the color of the car so
we'll just have color car and that
stands for the name still do label color
and we will set the text value to the
color of car so color of car and we will
just add a text box so that they user
can type in their color okay
so now let's see what else we're gonna
need we're gonna need the number of
doors and the horsepower so we'll just
add a let's add a numeric up/down picker
for this we will add a label that says
number of doors so we'll set the text
value to number of doors and we also
have a name to label doors now we're
gonna go into the properties for this
numeric up/down picker so let's just
call it numr and then doors and when you
just set a max value for this so we'll
scroll down and we will find
the maximum value right here in our
properties well set that max value to
five so that they cannot exceed the
number five so let's see what else we're
going to need we're going to need the
horsepower so we will just add a text
box right here then we'll add a label so
we'll set the label text to horsepower
and we'll set a text box we'll set the
name of the text box to text horse and
then we will set the name of this one to
label horse okay so now let's add a
button that says okay or we'll just type
add for that so the name will be button
and car then we'll add another button
that will cancel it
so button cancel we'll make the form a
little bit bigger okay so let's make
these buttons a little bit bigger than
what they are
okay so we'll set the text of this one's
button cancel when you switch the places
okay
so let's set the text of this one to
cancel and we will set the text of this
one to add and we'll just make this a
little bit bigger okay so now let's go
ahead and head back into form on DB and
here is our create car event I'll click
event handler so what we're gonna do is
we're gonna create a new object of new
car dot V B so we'll declare add new car
as new new car so now that we have this
form right here we've got an object of
it let's go ahead and show it so we'll
type add new car dot show dialog now the
reason for using show dialog is to
prevent the user from going back to the
form one whatever the new car dialog is
shown so now that we've shown the dialog
we need to get whatever they put into
this so to do this we're going to use
the width keyword so we'll start off by
typing width and now we're going to use
we're going to create a new car object
so with let's just say Cu from new car
let's say let's just call it a new car
one and then we need we first we need to
declare a new car one so dim new car one
as new all cars dot car so we're going
to use with new car one then we hit
enter and you can see it adds end with
so basically what this does is it's the
equivalent of typing new car one dot car
name equals and then setting our value
and then typing new car one color equals
then our value by using the with keyword
it's just gonna use new car one before
the dot each time we call something with
our new car one object so let's just do
dot car name so the car name is going to
be the value that is entered in the text
box right here the name of the car so
what we're going to need to do is access
the text changed event for this so
whenever the text change changes we're
gonna store that in a public variable so
public car name as string so whatever
the text is change car name is going to
be equal to text car name dot text</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
