be showing you guys what the arrow
member selection operator does and when
you should use it but I was thinking and
I was like you know what we haven't
created a new class in a while and it
actually would be kind of useful in this
tutorial so let's go ahead and start
working with the new class so just a
refresher from I don't know I probably
did this like 20 tutorials ago in order
to create a new class press file new
class and then you go ahead and name
request anything you want I'm going to
name mine Sally and I don't think we
covered destructors yet so let's go
ahead and uncheck those and make sure
we're working in the same directory as
our main.cpp so everything looks good go
ahead and click create and of course
it's going to give you these two
confirmation yeah of course I wanted to
do both of those and now we got two new
files a Sally header file and a Sally
CPP file and remember the Sally header
file is basically where we're going to
be making all our prototypes and the
Sally CPP is we're going to be doing the
actual coding so in our main CPP we need
to do a couple housekeeping things first
go ahead and copy these and of course
it's your iostream and name space and go
ahead and copy it right in here and of
course we need the Sally header I forgot
I always try to right-click and select
copy but there is no copy so anyways go
ahead and get our Sally header and paste
it in our main dot CPP so basically the
beginning of main.cpp
and Sally CPP should look pretty much
the same so now a couple things I like
to do actually the only thing I like to
do is this go ahead and take out this
comment because useless comments annoy
me
and I guess I might as well go over this
one more time in FDF and define and end
if all of this means the stuff in green
right here they put that there in every
class they automatically build for you
and it pretty much means don't include a
header file if you don't need it this
literally means if not to find Sally
header file then define it so basically
whenever you're running in main.cpp all
these classes are going to have it in
it's like if you already included Sally
header file then don't include it again
because you only need to include it once
obviously so that's what all that means
so now all my explaining we can finally
get to the torial so in this tutorial
the first thing we need to be able to do
is I'm just going to create a random
stupid function in the Sally class so in
order to do that let's go ahead and it's
not going to return anything so I'll
just put void and then write your class
name Sally and then we need that double
colon operator and then print scrap I'd
already have my my favorite function
stored forming so basically we need this
double colon operator again this is a
reminder because without it it wouldn't
know what function print crap blonk do
so we're saying alright this belongs to
the Sally class and you know if we
didn't have that then we would get a so
write your class name double colon and
then your function name whenever you're
building functions so print crap and all
we're going to have this do is see out
um very something see like did someone
say steak and n line so basically we
have the Sally class and we have our
constructor function which doesn't do
anything and we have this function
called print crab that pretty much
prints crap out on the screen so now we
can go ahead and prototype it and
remember whenever you're prototyping in
class go ahead and copy that and
actually what we need to do is this
don't even copy that just under your
public right boid print
crap and that's all we have to do to
prototype it we don't have to copy it
because this Sally is basically telling
this header file it belongs to the Sally
class but whenever we're prototyping the
class it already knows that of course
we're working with the Sally class so
that's why we don't write something like
this Sally like that so you know just so
a nice little note to keep track of so
now that we have basically a class made
with one function in it I want to talk
to you guys about what I'm going to
teach you in this tutorial and that is
the arrow member selection operator and
that's this little dinging right there
saying what the heck is that what's it
do what's the point of it well in order
to explain you guys what that does let's
go ahead and first build Sally objects
so Sally make a Sally object called
Sally object and we know with our Sally
object then we can access the stuff
inside the Sally class using Sally
object using the dot and then go ahead
and you know use what every one use a
variable or function or whatever so now
when we go ahead and build and run this
it says did someone say stake
pretty cool huh so we know that these
facts are true in order to access stuff
from the Sally class we need to use a
Sally object and then we can use that by
putting the object first using a dot
separator and then writing whatever we
want to access after it so that is how
we access stuff inside the Sally class
but now I want to teach you guys that
there's a different way to access the
stuff inside the Sally class this is by
making a pointer to the Sally object so
let's go ahead and see what I'm talking
about in order to make a pointer you go
ahead and write what type of data you're
going to hold I'm going to be holding
Sally type of data because a class is
actually a type of data that you create
yourself and now you go ahead and name
your pointer using pointer and I'm just
going to name mine Sally
Poynter and now we set it equal to the
memory address of Sally object so
basically the Sally pointer is pointing
to this object right here simple enough
so they're basically the same thing I
mean I shouldn't even say that because a
lot of people are grammatical pointers
and so I'm putting this little drug but
you know they're basically the same
thing so now what we can do is we can
use that pointer to access the stuff in
the print crap class I'm going excuse me
the Sally class so let's go ahead and
put Sally pointer and you might be
thinking all right so use the dot
separator and then write print crap just
like that and I'll try to run this it's
going to work fine but why am I getting
error message right here and that brings
me to the point of this tutorial
whenever you using a pointer to access
stuff inside a class you need to use
something called the arrow member
selection operator so again whenever you
run this it's going to work fine and
dandy so this is accessing it with the
object and this is accessing it with a
pointer
pretty cool huh so it's basically two
different ways where you can access
things inside a class arm right now I
just want to show you guys how to do it
and then later on I'm going to show you
guys when you would need to do it but
not in this tutorial for this tutorial I
just want to make sure you guys
understand this information you have two
different ways of accessing things
inside of a class one way is to use an
object and then you know the function
name and another way is to use a pointer
and then the function name or variable
name whenever you use an object you use
the dot separator whenever you use a
pointer you use the arrow and that's
actually pretty easy to remember because
whenever you're using a pointer it kind
of looks like a pointer so I mean it's
not can't get easier to remember than
that so that's all I want to teach you
guys for this tutorial hopefully you
understand the concept behind it you
probably don't understand why you would
use one versus the other but you will
later on so for now just understand this
and don't forget to make sure that your
beginning of all your dot CPP files are
basically the same so that's all I have
for you guys for this tutorial thank you
guys for watching them to subscribe and
I guess I'll see you guys in the next
