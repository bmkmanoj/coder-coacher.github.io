already 30 first tutorial oh boy if I
mess enough already you guys are in
store for a horrible tutorial but
anyways welcome to your 31st tutorial
and in this story we're going to be
building a picker from scratch now ever
saying our isn't that we did last time
no we built a premade date picker and
you know that was fun at all but it
really didn't teach us too much what we
want to learn be able to do is create
our own custom picker from scratch so
let's go ahead and well let's go ahead
and jump right into it so the first
thing that we're going to need to
implement is some protocols and the
first protocol is you I picker delegate
yeah right there and another another
another picker we're going to need to
implement is you I you I picker view
data source just like that and all right
we're good to go so what these protocols
are going to do is we're going to need
to take some built-in methods that's in
these protocols and they're pretty much
going to be responsible for storing our
data for the picker so instead of a
bunch of dates that are already in there
we're going to begin a bunch of data
ourselves what data well anything we
want you me given types of food numbers
your favorite your list the
ex-girlfriends it really doesn't matter
anything you want so now once you're
done to that we need to go ahead and
make a bigger object so you I picker
view and just name this like single
pecker and this is pretty much going to
represent your picker itself and NS
array and then just need this like
picker array so this picker rate is
going to hold a bunch of strings and
it's pretty much going to hold like a
bunch of names and each name is going to
show is an item on the picker array so
after that let's go ahead and put
property and non-atomic retain ib outlet
and
go ahead and copy this single pecker and
now let's just go ahead and copy all
this copy and I excellent up that paste
and check this out you don't want to
outlet for your array just go ahead and
put NS array and paste and of course we
need one more method and that's remember
whenever you press a button on the
screen there we go can't talk in type
the same time when every plus a button
on the screen then an alert box is going
to pop up so that's what this method is
for so now that we made it outlet for
the picker and we also put a setter and
getter methods for the array and also
put action for whenever we press the
button let's go ahead and build this
just see if we forgot any semicolons or
anything nope so now that we have that
interface file built let's go ahead and
hop into single pecker to xib and we can
go ahead and start building the view for
whenever we click that second tab in our
main program this is the view that's
going to show up so from here what we
want to do is the very first thing is go
ahead and click your view icon and
attributes in for the bottom bar go
ahead and select tab bar and I see we
get a simulated tab bar that pops up so
after this let's go ahead and drag a
picker view and that's this thing right
here pic of you make sure you don't get
the date picker picker view and drag it
over to your main view make sure if it's
a nice and snug just like that so now we
have a picker don't worry about the data
this is just a dummy data that they just
fill in just show you guys will look
like but anyways what we need to do now
is hook up our outlet from the files
owner so go ahead and control drag from
files owner down your picker and so now
whenever we type single pecker in our
code this is the picker that it
represents so now what we need to do now
is check this out in our Pickers go over
to your connections and you see two
outlets a data source and a delegate so
look at this this picker has data that's
in there by default but we want to give
it our own data of course I mean why
would you want to use a picker that only
had you know the names of cities in
California looks like by default so what
we wanted to do is say alright our class
our files owner that's where we're going
to be storing the data even though we
then type it in yet trust me guys I'm
going to type it in later so in order to
tell our program this is the class
that's going to hold the data go ahead
and in your outlet drag this over to
files owner and just release and now
drag this delegate over files owner and
just release so pretty much the
datasource and delegate are going to
work together to access the data from
this class and put that data in the
picker and that's what we're pretty much
saying we're saying this class has the
data for this picker easy enough so now
all we need to do is go ahead and drag a
button down make a title like press me
oh you know our titles are getting more
and more violent and I plan on doing
that because you know sometimes people
just need to be demanded to do things so
the last thing we need to do is hook up
this button to the action so of course
select the button and then go up touch
up inside over here and in files owner
while action press button action simple
enough so now that's all we need to do
for this tutorial so make sure please
save your file interface boat or quit
interface builder and now in the next
tutorial we're going to be hopping into
a single pecker m and implementing all
of our while we're pretty much going to
be learning the meat and bones of the
story so that's all I have for you guys
