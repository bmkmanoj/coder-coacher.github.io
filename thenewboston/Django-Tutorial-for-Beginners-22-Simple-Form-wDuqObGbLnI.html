video I'm going to show you how to use
simple forms with Django now there's
actually a lot to cover
concerning forms but for this example
I'm just going to show you guys a really
basic way to include forms on your web
pages and since we don't have a whole
lot going on with this website right now
for this example what I'm going to do is
for each of these songs I'm just going
to put a radio button next to it and
then at the bottom I'll have a button
called like submit or favorite or
whatever and then when you select item
in hit favorite it's just going to put a
little star next to the song aka
favorite it and of course that's a
pretty dumb way to favorite songs if
you're making an actual application but
whenever I'm teaching forms it's going
to be you know a really easy example so
let's go ahead and get started so of
course before we start coding all fun
stuff the first thing we need to do is
we need to change this song's class now
we need to change it because these songs
they need another attribute and I'll
just name it something like is favorite
so this is just going to be a regular
boolean so models boolean field right
here now of course by default whenever
you just add your songs they're not your
favorite yes so we can set default of
false to these songs so again whenever
the user either clicks a star or submits
this form then this is going to be set
to true and whenever this is true that
means that this particular song is one
of their favorites simple enough so now
that we updated it in our models we
actually need to do those migrations I
talked to you guys about so remember
that's Python manage spell that right
manage up you I make migrations music so
this means hey we made some changes to
the blueprint of the songs and just go
ahead and make that SQL file
aka make the change file so now we have
the change file and we actually have to
run it on our database to actually
update our database structure
so Python managed @py my grade so again
this makes the changes in this actually
applies the changes so now our database
is up to date the structure is beautiful
and you actually saw it turn blue on a
fig I saw that and that just means that
changes were applied now another thing I
want to point out actually don't even
know if I pointed this out but whenever
you change the structure of your
database you also have to restart your
server so if you're using the command
line in running a server from there just
hold ctrl C and that's going to stop it
and then use the run server command
again or if you're using PyCharm then
you can just go ahead and hit this
button rerun website so there you go
booted back up again
and hopefully when you're fresh we
shouldn't see any errors so good to go
and after this what we can do from here
is create a favorite URLs map so you
know how I said that these URLs usually
point to a website in you know they
pretty much the user requests of you and
it gives them back a website but this
isn't always the case
it isn't always a 1:1 relationship
sometimes you want URL that just
performs some logic for example let's
say that you are making a social network
of course the view profile will take you
to someone's profile videos will it take
you to the videos but the log out URL it
wouldn't take you to a page just for
logging out it would take you to some
URL it will perform some logic a a log
you out and then it would just redirect
you to the home page so again that is
the one case scenario where you're going
to have a URL and it's not directly
hooked up to a template or something
that the user looks at sometimes it's
just hooked up to some logic and then it
redirects you to some other webpage so
that's what favoriting is going to do
whenever we favor it just like logging
out which is going to perform some
action in the background and it's just
going to redirect them to the same page
that they're on so they're not going to
know that you know we even have this
your
so let's just go ahead and let me change
this and there's a dog barking outside
so you know that's pretty cool
all right so the structure for this
would just be favorite why is there a
dog barking it's annoying me
all right and I could actually copy this
alright so instead of views detail which
is going to be views favorites and for
our nice little shortcut we'll just name
it favorite so again whenever we submit
the form to favorite a song what it's
going to go through is its going to find
the ID of the song whatever song we
selected and it's going to take that
information and it's going to pass it to
the favorite URL now whenever the form
information gets there you're just going
to set the songs is favorite to true and
then after it does that it's just going
to redirect them to the same page so
simple enough and this dog is really
annoying me so I'm going to go ahead and
close my windows I'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
