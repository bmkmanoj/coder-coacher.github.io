housekeeping code written in the dummy
content Java file we can actually hop
over to the fragment web page detail XML
file and we can start working on the
interface or the design of it now
remember what I told you guys this app
is going to do is it's going to have a
list and the user is going to select
from that list what webpage they want to
view and in the main area right here all
it's going to do is display some webpage
so the easy thing about this is that we
don't actually need to have any widgets
on here at all like no text areas no
buttons no sliders or anything the only
thing we need to do is somehow display a
web page in here so how do we do that
well first of all delete every single
thing that's in your XML file and since
this is the only thing in here they
won't just let you right-click and
delete it so you actually need to go to
your source code and delete all of this
so I'm going to pause my screen recorder
right now and type all the stuff that I
need to type in and then I'll explain it
so you guys don't need to watch me type
it because it's going to take a few
minutes alright so what I did of course
this is just housekeeping stuff but the
widget I added is this webview right
here and actually if you go down it's
this one right here now what this
webview is this is just an area or a
widget that you can have that can
display a webpage easy enough and also
what I did is now you can't tell because
it's not giving me those gridlines but I
set it to match parent both for the
width and height and that way it takes
up the entire screen size so whenever we
display a web page in here it's going to
display on your entire screen and not
just a small section of it now another
thing that I don't want to forget is I
actually want to change the ID of this -
I'll just name it like details area
actually detail area that might be
better
all right now of course we need to do
that because we need to reference it
whenever we say hey this is the webpage
that you're supposed to display so now
we got all our list items created and we
have our interface set up with this web
view thing that can display webpages so
how do we say okay this is the webpage
that we actually want you to display
well for the Associated Java class for
this fragment right here and that's this
one web page detail fragment and this is
the one that opened by default so as
long as you didn't close it if you did
it's right in here again this is pretty
much a controller for that this area or
this fragment and the first thing that
we of course need to do is we need to
say okay you need to be able to work
with that web view so if you go to web
why are you popping up webview why
didn't none of that pop Oh weird what's
going on here okay suspicious but we
didn't get any errors right here so
should be good to go
all right so down here what you're going
to see is you're going to find this
method called on create view basically
whenever you create this fragment this
is the code that I want you to run now
by default it's still set that that
textview and remember we deleted that
textview and replaced it with a webview
so we can see web pages so delete this
because we don't need it anymore and
instead pretty much change it to web
view and this is how you do that
so web view root
do why is none of this crap popping up
it's kind of annoying me all right I'll
just type the hard way find view by ID r
dot ID dots what was the ID of that
detail area and of course what this is
essentially going to do is it's going to
reference this right here this entire
webview or this entire section so now
once we have that reference the only
other thing that we need to do is we
need to call load URL and what this is
going to do is of course take this
webview and display a web page depending
on whatever URL we pass in and this M
item is the list item and this is
actually like 90% of this is taken care
of whenever we just click master detail
view in the very beginning of this
tutorial so that's why like we don't
need to make M item manually or anything
it's really easy however like I said
this M item is going to resemble one of
these objects whatever one the user
tapped and of course since this load URL
needs a URL we're just calling the URL
property on this so why that didn't
autocomplete kind of annoying me and
actually we don't need this text view
anymore so we can delete that so the
last thing that we need to do one more
line of code is we need to head over to
the manifest right here and again what
this is is essentially the manager for
your entire app it glues everything
together now since we're going to be
using this webview right here
what this does again it displays a web
page and we're going to be connecting to
the internet now anytime you do that in
your manifest you need to say hey I need
to request permission for the internet
so I'm going to type uses
see on this poppin all uses permission
in troy'd name equals enjoyed mission
dot internets alright so looking good
and if you ever go to like the google
place or in your downloading apps and
right before you download it says this
app needs um like your location access
to the Internet and it says and it
pretty much su is this ok can this app
have access to like your camera and
stuff well this is how it gets all of
those permissions right there so pretty
cool bit of information and that's
actually it so now what we can do is run
this bad boy and see if it works alright
so here we are again this is going to
look a little bit different on a tablet
this menu right here would constantly be
stuck on the left hand side but since
this is phone we get the list on one
screen and the content on another screen
so I'm just going to click Buckey and it
displays my profile
pretty sweet my beautiful face and of
course if we ever want to go back to the
list then just click this button again
and now you can choose something else
such as videos and it will display that
video page pretty stinking sweet so
again that's the very basics of how do
you create a master-detail flow I know a
lot of people were wondering what that
thing was whenever we chose blank
activity as every like project setting
so now you understand hopefully you guys
can make some pretty sweet menus now so
thank you guys for watching don't forget
subscribe and well I'll see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
