tutorial for the new boss and again with
me Travis and what we're going to do in
this tutorial is basically access at
least our check box preference within
one of our classes which will be your
splash activity so what I did is I just
changed the title to music and a summary
that says for the splash screen so what
we're gonna do now is basically go into
our splash activity that we have set up
from quite some time ago it's been a
while since we visited this splash
activity and so within our on create
method that's where we set up our media
player object and we started it but now
let's say if we're gonna kind of
reference our preferences and if that
checkbox is checked it's gonna play if
not it's not and so we're gonna kind of
surround this start or song method so
there we go
this is we're gonna at first first we
have to access our preferences and then
we can use that access from the most
part to see if it's checked or not so
we're gonna do is set up that access to
our preferences and we use something
called shared preferences so we just
need to set up a little variable for the
most part and we're gonna call this get
prefs because that's all this method or
all this thing is going to do so we're
gonna say get preface again you have to
import the shared preferences and then
we just need to reference the preference
manager which again is a class and
within this class there's something
called get default shared preferences so
we're gonna hit dot and it's only the
like basically the only method for the
most part there's not too many methods
within that class so we're gonna do that
and it takes a context with s parameters
for the context generally we'd say this
or something of the sort but we're gonna
get the base contact so there's also a
method called get base context that's
what we're going to use for this
preference manager or this shared
preference object we're setting up so
there we go we're going to kind of get
the information from our preferences
that we set up in
the XML so again it's just getting the
Preferences that's all this variable is
doing and then we can refer to that
variable with with our actual what we're
trying to accomplish and the check is
basically it true/false on off just
think of it as switch those are called
boolean so we're gonna set up a boolean
variable that is going to determine
whether that check box is on or off or
true or false
so we're gonna say music something like
that we're just checking if the music is
allowed or not and what we're gonna set
this equal to is our variable that we
just set up which basically got all of
our preferences right here again our
shared preferences we're gonna say
shared preferences
dot and we have aa bear we have values
like get boolean get string get an to
get long all that good stuff but we're
gonna use get boolean because the again
the check box is a true/false statement
for the most part and again we have to
access our key so let's go into it again
our preferences XML as you can see our
key we set up to check box just like
when we were working with sharing data
between activities same kind of thing a
key is a kind of value or a file path
for the most part so we're gonna say
check box just felt like that yeah check
box right there and there we go that's
our key for the most part and this
second parameter again if you guys ever
get confused with something you can
hover over it and kind of gives you some
details and this is the name of the
preference to retrieve the key is the
default value just returns if the
preference has not been set for the most
part if it doesn't exist so we're gonna
set it as a default to true because we
want to play music for the most part
less if the user doesn't want to so
there we go we set up our music for the
most part it's getting their preferences
and then getting the boolean called
check box and if if there's nothing set
yet we're just gonna set to default
value of true now what we can do is we
can set up an if-else statement around
our start of our of our Media Player
that's going to play some music so we're
gonna say if and within parenthesis
we're gonna say music equals true then
we're gonna play it for the most part
you can set up something like that and
then again if our checkbox is clicked if
that will mean it's set to true and then
it's gonna play our song if doesn't it's
gonna skip over this whole line because
you know this is false so it's gonna
skip with whatever's in those brackets
but also just to show you guys some Java
we can delete our brackets actually
because this if statement will include
the line below it if there's more than
like one line of code you will need to
use the brackets but it knows that if
statement for the most part and it's
going to include one line of code again
probably be safe to put brackets but
just to show you guys you can do that as
well but anyways let's check out our app
activity make sure it works
again the default value is set to true
so we're just gonna start it up real
quick
and as you guys can probably hear the
music's playing right now let's open up
our menu and go into our preferences as
you can see it's checked we're gonna
uncheck it hit back and then menu exit
it's gonna exit our application hits the
new Boston again as you can see silence
it's beautiful very awesome and then
just to double check our preferences as
well it's still not checked right now so
you go pretty pretty quick tutorial for
the most part just how to access our
preferences and how to use it for the
most part probably do one more tutorial
how to access our edit text and our
other thing if you guys don't wanna
watch it that's fine just skip that I'm
still gonna you know cry myself to sleep
every night either way if you watched a
tutorial or not but I'll catch you guys
in the next one if you decide to have a
good one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
