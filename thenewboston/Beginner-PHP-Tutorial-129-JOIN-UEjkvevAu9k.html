back with another video for the new
Boston now in the last tutorial we
looked at left join and I used left join
for this example where we're returning a
name with a pet arm on the end so we're
saying here down here with the result
was from this query we've said Alex as a
cat Alex as a fish and out as a dog now
what happens if we go into pets here and
we're going to delete the entry for Dale
so people ID - was Dale let's go ahead
and delete that and let's run this query
again let's paste it in there and we'll
click go now you'll see that we've
returned Dale add null it next to pair
so this is useful the left join is
useful for returning the name of the
person because the the table we used on
the left was the name and even if there
are no values in pet so what we've
essentially done here is said if there
even if there are no entries in the
right table which is which is pet still
returned the name of the left hand side
table which is named now the reason this
is useful is because M PHP if we were to
run this we'd need to know if the user
had no pets at all this would save us
using PHP num rows because we would just
eat say if the pet equals null then
obviously this user has no pets
whatsoever so where we've used the left
join for this now what happens if we
were to use join on its own so let's go
into SQL tab and let's go and paste this
in here now instead of using left join
I'm going to just use join let's go out
click go and see how this differs now
you'll see that we've removed the result
Dale the reason that we've removed the
result Dale is because we have reusing
the join which will only return values
that equal or that are found and based
on this on here so we're saying if
people ID equals pet store people ID so
we're returning using the join only
values that exist in each table so we're
not saying does it only exist in the
left table or does it only exist in the
right table which
does it exist in both tables so now what
we're doing is we're only returning the
data where the left table matches the
right table so why could this be useful
well we might want to inside of our PHP
program eventually when we're executing
this query or running this SQL query we
might want to say we only want values
where someone actually has a pet
whereas before in the left join we
looked at where Dale didn't have a pair
we want to just say with the join only
return results where user has a pet or
where name has a pet the person has a
pet so in this case we've returned two
rows where Alex has a cat and Alex has a
fish so now you can see the use of the
join on its own as opposed to the left
join where it where we're returning
we're returning a value even if the user
on the arm or the user doesn't have a
value in the right hand table so this on
is really important because what we're
doing is we're making the comparison at
this point so the comparison could be
any operator but for now is people do ID
equals pets people ID so we're matching
from the left and the right and if we
don't match we're not returning the
values with the join</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
