tutorial and as promised we're going to
be working on the constructor and also
the GUI in this lesson so let's go ahead
and well do that right now so public
client is the name of the class that I'm
working in and I'm actually going to
pass it in a string host now let me go
ahead and explain you guys why the
client class is going to be different
from the server class
so basically we're building two programs
here one of them we just built is going
to be sitting on a server now the server
is a public server everyone in the world
is going to be able to access that so
it's basically going to be waiting and
listening for anyone to connect with
however this program right here is going
to be sitting on your personal computer
your desktop or your laptop whatever it
may be
now those computers you don't want
anyone in the world to access that's
only your computer your information is
safe so since we don't want everyone in
the world to be able to access it we're
going to build this program a little bit
differently we're going to be giving it
the IP address of the server that we
want to talk to so this program right
here that we're building right now is
only going to be able to connect to that
server
wherever that program is instead of
everyone you know being able to connect
to your laptop because you know that
wouldn't be safe and that would just you
know probably blow up your laptop so
that's what we're going to be doing and
that's why we need to pass in the IP
address of pretty much the server or
where we are connecting to so again
before we do that
we're basically going to be building it
the same as the last one we're super
just the title that appears client
client mofos and the other one was like
named buck against the messenger but
I'll just name this client something so
we know that it's the client and of
course the server IP the variable that
we created right here is going to be
equal to the host or whatever we pass in
and the reason that I made it up here is
because we're going to be setting the
variable equal to a value right here
which is of course the IP address of the
server but we want everyone to be able
to access it so that's why we're putting
it right there
and the rest of this is pretty much just
like the last one user text of course
set this equal to a new jtextfield and
after this user text set editable equal
to false because we don't want them to
be allowed to type anything before
they're connected to anyone and the last
thing we need to do is use your text add
action listener and inside here let me
go ahead and make it pretty add action
listener and let's go ahead and add a
new listener class and of course this
has to implement the method public void
actionperformed
action event event now that my error
messages are out of there we can go
ahead and do the important stuff and the
first thing we want to do is send data
which is basically event how you of
course send the data or send the message
or whatever the next one is user text
set text equal to nothing at all all
right so basically what we're doing is
we have to build this method right here
send data and what this does is
basically take whatever is in side your
text area and sends it to the other
person and this right here of course
like you know resets it back to blank
and if you don't know what I'm talking
about I go into detail in the last
tutorial basically the same technology
that we're using so now we just got to
add this all to the screen and user text
borderlayout north make it appear at the
top of the screen like the last one chat
window set this equal to nu J scroll
painting
don't do that right
okay I think I'm way messing up here I
was typing I was looking at my keyboard
because I got a weird keyboard right now
all right so the first thing that we do
do is chat window equals new J text area
and now we add it to the screen add Dre
scroll pane chat window first and where
do you want to put it and the center and
okay I finally got that right now set
the size and I believe my other one was
300 by 150 and now we just might have to
make a visible so set the visibility
equal to true and you guys should know
what all of this crap does already we
basically um added this to the screen
and put inside a scroll pane so we can
you know scroll up and down set the size
of it and made it visible and the only
error we're getting right now is the
send data because we didn't create that
method yet and we have to create it in
the next video so again in the next
video what we're going to be doing is
we're going to be making that start
running method but I'm actually going to
name it something different and as
you'll notice I name a lot of my methods
something different because it just
helps me out understand you know I don't
like the name of the exact same as a
server in the client so I might switch
it up a bit and we also have to code it
a little bit differently since you know
we're not accepting IP addresses or not
accepting connections from everyone
we're only connecting to one specific
computer so definitely don't just copy
this exactly like you did the last
program where else it's not going to
work so anyways next program we're going
to be setting up one of the main methods
so I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
