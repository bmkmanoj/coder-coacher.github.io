Blackford we are doing in After Effects
cs6 tutorial on switching between
cameras so what I'm going to do today is
set up a few cameras go over a rule
called the 180 degree rule and show you
how to switch between the cameras that
you have so let's start by showing you
the scene real quick it's the same as
before with the other two camera
tutorials that I've done but we have
just a static background that's not 3d
we've got three vectors here that are in
3d so let's go back to our 2v let's go
back to two views vertical here man I
always do that horizontal and let's
change one of them to our 15 millimeter
two node camera here and what we're
going to do is set up cameras and switch
between them throughout this 15 seconds
here so we've got our two millimeter our
fifty millimeter two node camera here
and we will keep that right here in the
front and we're going to create we're
going to duplicate it by hitting ctrl or
command on a Mac and pressing D and
we're going to select the second one and
then we're going to move it to a
different position let's use the top
view on this side so we can see where
we're putting these we're going to move
it to a different position let's use the
unified camera tool oops
got to do it in this got to do in this
one right here and that's good for there
let's make another camera and we'll make
sure it's selected and go to the other
side
and maybe from above here and then I'll
pull it back a little I'm not looking in
the red camera over here there we go
now we're in the right to put my to note
or the other camera back to where it was
kind of me I just did the same thing
again you got to make sure when you're
in your comm panel that you have the
right camera selected or else it's just
going to move around the camera that you
have your view on and that was something
that I was going to go over after to
show you what not to do and then I went
ahead and did it so I guess I killed two
birds with one stone there so I've got
three cameras set up this is the first
camera and then this is the second
camera view and this is the third camera
view and this is the one that I want to
zoom out a little bit with just going to
move the position back actually I'll use
the trick Z camera tool and so now we're
a farther back and we can see everything
now the way that you want to switch
between your cameras is by moving them
on the timeline here and just cutting
off you can't do anything like dissolve
between cameras or anything so you have
to just cut and then when you're done
with their different camera views you
can then go on to something like
premiere and add crossfades and things
like that so this is the way you do it
and we're switching from let's go to our
active camera here and you can see that
the active camera is going to be the
camera that is on top in the timeline so
we have three cameras over top of each
other but the only one that's going to
be showing is the one that's on top in
the timeline now I'm going to shorten
this
so that we can go back to another camera
after and also when you shorten your
layers somewhere to like here
you don't have to use computer power in
after-effects to render out any any of
these cameras so it's just good to
always have your layers trimmed up when
you don't want to use them anymore
so let's just go to our one view here
and we'll go to our active camera and
we'll just do a quick Ram preview and
you can see how this works
it's just switching between camera cuts
and then you use another program later
to switch between the two put in
transitions if you would like or
anything like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
