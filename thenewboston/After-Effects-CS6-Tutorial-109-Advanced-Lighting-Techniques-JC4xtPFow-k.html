After Effects cs6 tutorial where I'm
going to be talking about how to light
different things in the scene without
affecting other things that you don't
want affected by a second light so what
I'm trying to do here and what I was
trying to explain was I've got these
vectors here on the back and then I've
got these two hero ones in the front so
in the back I want these to be still lit
by the main light but I don't I want
them to be lit differently than the hero
one so that they don't stand out as much
so what we're gonna need to do is create
something called an adjustment light so
first of all let's look at my setup here
I've just got a bunch of of these in 3d
space I've got my camera and I've got my
main light here which is a spotlight and
it's just shining on the entire scene to
light everything up so I'm gonna hit OK
now so I'm gonna have to create an
adjustment light and the way I do that
is just by creating a regular light
layer new light and I want to create in
this in this tutorial I'm gonna create a
point light and I'm gonna just make it a
little darker I'll just make it dark a
darker light there and I'll put it at
100 or you know it's 400 and see how
this works
so what I'm gonna have to do is just
like an adjustment layer use this light
and I'm gonna rename it adjustment light
I'm gonna bring it down below my to hero
vectors and enable this layer here
called making an adjustment layer so
click on that and as you see when I
click on that the heroes above
aren't affected anymore
now if I adjust my light settings if you
press you-you-you on your keyboard it'll
bring up all the light options so let me
adjust maybe the color here that made
the back ones darker now need to adjust
the intensity I'm going to hit T for
intensity and lower that down
maybe pull the light back a little bit
see the light doesn't seem to be
affecting as much I'll check and see
where the light is if I pull up closer
there we go
and since I have it too dark as of a
color it's not working correctly so I'll
just put it back up to the light here
come back to our camera and now I'll
adjust the intensity again now it's
darkening the back once if I go into
negative identity but keeping the front
hero ones not affected so if I turn this
adjustment layer off
you see it's gonna affect them that way
I turn it back on now it's not affecting
them so that's how you use adjustment
lights to affect everything that is
below the light so it's affecting all
these 3d layers not the black solid
background because it's not in 3d and
not anything above it that's that went
by a little bit quicker than I thought
so we can just end a tutorial here and
you know how to use adjustments lights
now to light up things that you want lit
up and not light up so thanks for
watching this one and I hope you guys
have a good day see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
