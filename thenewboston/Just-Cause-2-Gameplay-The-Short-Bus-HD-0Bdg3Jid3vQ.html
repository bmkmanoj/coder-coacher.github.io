the first thing I do is open my
parachute evidently I'm supposed to be
blowing up like government buildings and
stuff I'm not sure I never played before
so just fly so you know parachutes kind
of cool so far so I think that's one of
the buildings I got blow up they said
they have white stars on them so I'll
just walk around here see what's going
on it was a nice wall could use a house
or a roof but you know it's fine now and
who's this oh hey baby can I get your
number oh you don't date white guys huh
alright I see how it is which see you
later find another Indian woman so let's
go walk around here is that enemy right
