slash on live gamer for the new boston
and in this tutorial we're going to
creating the exit menu item so we could
go ahead and add a new class to our
favorites viewer tray but we don't need
to create a new file all we need to do
is create a class within our web
favorite menu item so we'll call it
public class exit menu item and then
we'll just go ahead and press enter and
we need to have it inherit from menu
item so that we can use that as a menu
item just like all of our favorites so
we need to create a constructor for this
so we'll do public sub new so whatever a
new exit menu item is created we're
going to set the text of that which is
the caption of the menu item we're going
to set that equal to exit so once this
is created text is going to be equal to
exit so now we need to do and that we
need to do is we need to access the
click event of this menu item so we'll
come over here to exit menu item and
we'll open up the events for that and
we'll click on the click event so
whatever exit menu item has been clicked
we just want to type application dot
exit so what this does is it uses
application which is let's read the
description here it's provide static
methods of properties to manage an
application to start and stop an
application as you do other stuff so
it's going to access our application
that we've created or are exe and dot
exit now this is self explanatory says
informs all message pumps that they must
terminate then closes all application
windows after the messages have been
processed so what that means is
basically if there's let's say a message
box open once you click ok it's going to
to the application so now that we've
created our web favorite menu item and
our exit menu item we're going to have
to add those to our notify icon so we'll
go ahead and come over here in to form
one BB and under form one visible change
we want to go ahead and access the load
event so we can do this by just clicking
form one events and we can scroll until
we find load so this will add the form
one load of it so whenever the form one
loads we want to go ahead and create a
favorite and object to the favorites
class so we'll just create it inside of
form one so that it's not created when
the form one loads so we will type
public favorites as new favorites or it
will do
internet favorites dot favorites so we
created an object of favorites and what
favorites does is it creates a
collection of web favorite objects and
stores them so that we can use them so
it reads through all your favorites
stores them in web paper objects and it
adds those to the collection so that we
can use them so we have our web favorite
here let's go to form one so we have our
favorite right here so public favorites
as new internet favorites dot favorites
and whenever the form loads we just want
to scan the favorites so favorites scan
favorites and now we need to do is
create a context menu so we'll call it
object menu as new context menu and I
forgot to do this in the previous
tutorial and in this tutorial but full
credit for this program goes to the
writers of beginning Microsoft Visual
Basic 2008 dear in willis and brian
Newsom they created this great app and I
am teaching you guys how you can make it
yourself so a context menu would be like
this whole menu right here this whole
file menu so new project would be a menu
item open project would be a menu item
but when file would be a menu item and
then this whole thing is a context menu
and now this isn't going to take any
arguments so go ahead put this code in
if you haven't already if you have any
questions leave them in the comments and
then if you don't have any questions
move on to the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
