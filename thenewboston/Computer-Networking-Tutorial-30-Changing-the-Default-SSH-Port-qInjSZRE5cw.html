video now that we got our cloud server
setup now that we can connect with
securely using SSH what we can do is we
can just hop into all the fun stuff we
can start installing Apache MySQL PHP
node all the reasons that we actually
bought the server we can just jump into
and start installing all those fun
services now before we do that I'm going
to make a couple recommendations and
these recommendations are going to make
your server a lot more secure one is you
should probably set up and configure a
firewall in to and this is what we're
going to be doing in this video you
should probably change the default SSH
port from 22 to something else now if
you guys are unfamiliar with ports or
maybe you heard the term port before and
you aren't really sure what it is I'll
explain it real quick
so whenever you're trying to connect to
a server you need two key pieces of
information the first is the IP address
and the second is the port now the port
of a computer isn't something that you
can physically see or touch with your
hands it's just built into the software
and it tells the server how you want to
connect with what are you trying to do
to that server so for example whenever
you're just online browsing websites the
default port for HTTP is 80 now if you
ever browsing a website that use HTTP
that default port is 443 so we usually
don't see this in it usually always
happens behind the scenes but remember
when we first started putty and it said
okay give me the IP address of the
server you're trying to connect to and
by default the port was 22 well whenever
someone's trying to hack into the server
they know that the default port is 22
already now we don't want them to have
that information so we want to change it
to something else something that we only
know so this is how you do that so if
you go to sudo nano etc I just call it
etc SSH SSH D underscore config then
what we're going to do is we're going to
open up this SSH
configuration file with our suite editor
now of course got type my password and
check it out so these are all of the
configuration settings for SSH luckily
we don't have to worry about most of
this the only thing that we're concerned
about is this right here this port so
again the first thing a hacker is going
to do if he tries to attack SSH is he's
going to try to connect the port 22 so
we're going to delete that and we're
going to make that unavailable and just
change it to anything like 8 8 8 8 7 7 7
7
that's what I'm going to use make sure
that it's not a standard port for like
HTTP or HTTPS or FTP and just look
online to make sure that you're not you
know overriding one of those these ports
go from 0 to like 65,000 or something so
you're going to have a lot of options to
choose from many ways remember what port
you wrote down 7 7 7 7 and then we can
just use control X just to exit do we
want to save it yes confirm enter so now
whenever we connect the server again we
have to remember to connect the port
7777
now before we just close out of this
terminal right here we probably want to
test and make sure that it works and
before you even do that we actually need
to restart so sudo service SSH restart
and after we restart SSH then our new
changes are going to be taken into
effect
so again just minimize this don't close
it yet open up putty again and check it
out for droplet 1 whenever we load it
this is the IP address and since we're
connecting through SSH this is the port
now watch what happens if I try to use
these old settings I'm going to open and
network err connection refused that's
what a hacker is going to see so I'm
going to hit OK open up putty again I'm
just going to load in those but I'm
going to change it to 7 7 7 7 so now
actually I want to save this again
with our new settings and then open it
and it says ok this is the first
you're trying to connect to it this way
just hit yes and we're going to log in
as Bucky boom look at that we are in
without the hacker knowing or having any
extra information pretty awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
