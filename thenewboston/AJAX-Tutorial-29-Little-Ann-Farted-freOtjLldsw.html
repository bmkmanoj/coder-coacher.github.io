my ear by the way guys by the way I
found out something cool if you stick
your finger in your ear and scratch it
sounds like pac-man you think I'm
messing around with you but do it it
does if you stick your finger in your
ear and scratch it sounds like pac-man
so pause the video do it and then you
can you know probably text all your
friends about it and then come back so
encoding equals utf-8 and stand alone
of course put yes because I'm actually
standing alone in my house right now so
lonely and alright I think we're good to
go I think that's all we need I'll make
sure vision 1.0 don't want any typos
coding utf-8 standalone yes and we're
good to go
alright so now let's go ahead and build
this XML file now what did I tell you
guys I told you guys that we're going to
be making a program that prints out a
list of people or employees whatever you
want to call them so the first thing
that we need is the root element because
every XML file needs a root element now
just go ahead and name it response
because that's kind of what it is the
response and this is more for
understanding whenever we write our
JavaScript program like I said it
doesn't need to be the word response
because XML there are no preset tags
that you make them all up yourself but
I'm going to name my response because
it's going to make sense to me later now
what is this going to be a file of well
it's going to have a bunch of different
information of different people so of
course that's another appropriate tag so
all of the different people or each
person is going to go is going to have
their own separate set of information
all right so whenever we are looking for
a response in our Ajax program we're
going to talk to the server and it's
going to give us a list of people so of
course if that's the case we should
probably make some people in it so you
don't want to write people because this
is only going to be one individual
person so person person now what
information are we going to file for a
person or an employee well we'll just
keep things simple right now and you can
either do like their first name and last
name but let's go ahead and do their
name and their social security number
it's just two simple things and I will
just make fake social security number
and uh Wow I just got a new puppy little
hand and she is literally standing or
she's actually like sleeping about three
feet away from me and she just ripped
the nastiest fart Wow a little ant I can
barely breathe right now I might have to
pause the video spray some freaking
Cologne that is terrible all right
anyway so try to fight through it
alright so the name of the first
employees of course bucky Roberts the
greatest employee ever to live and next
thing we need file his social security
number because might as well suck all
that privacy information that we can and
this is my social security number so
just double check that we have all our
tags embedded correctly all right there
we go now to add another person it's
actually quite easy go ahead and select
all of the person information and make
sure that you're still within the people
tags
now the person armed the second employee
let's see competition competition I'll
call him mike litoris mike litoris and
his social security number can be
something like that alright so now let
me just go ahead and double check his
structure make sure everything's nested
correctly all right so now what we have
is an HTML file pretty much the core of
everything and also an XML file that
as the information of two employees one
Bucky Roberts and two mike litoris and
they're all nested correctly inside the
tags people because you know they are
people employees and this is the
response this entire XML file that we're
going to be getting from the server
using Ajax so that's what we're going to
be doing in the next tutorial but for
now thing guys for watching don't forget
to subscribe and I'll see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
