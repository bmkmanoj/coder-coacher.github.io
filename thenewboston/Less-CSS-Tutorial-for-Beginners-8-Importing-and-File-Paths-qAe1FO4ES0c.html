talk to you about importing and comments
and file pass gonna throw a whole bunch
of information at you but it's gonna be
handy and super useful now the first
thing I just want to mention real quick
is this you know whenever you're just
using CSS then you can comment using
this style right here and you can put on
multiple lines if you want well with
less they also give you the single line
commenting syntax so you can actually
type a comment on a single line or if
you have some ruler property like right
here then you can put this comment after
it and it's gonna work fine so again I
just wanna let you know that there's
also a single line comment that you can
use whenever you use less now aside from
that I want to talk to you a little bit
about importing so what people do and
what I see a lot is this instead of
having all of your styles in one style
sheet for example main dot less they
like to break it up into you know like a
different one like buttons and maybe
another one called forms actually let me
show you so instead of just having every
single style for my entire website in
main I'm gonna add a new file called
like buttons that less and I'm gonna add
another file called like forms dot less
so I would have all my button styling
right here all my form styling right
here how the inputs and text fields are
gonna look and what I can do is I can
actually just include those using the
import command so import buttons import
forms so what this is gonna do is
essentially go over to buttons copy all
the stuff in here
and plop it right in there then go over
forms copy all of it and plop it right
in there now guys are saying what's the
point of this if I can just include a
bunch of different style sheets right
here well whenever you do it this way
then what you can do is on every single
web page that you design you can keep
one single link because this link right
here whenever it looks at main it's not
just
looking at the styles directly in here
it's also getting all the styles from
here in here and that's how you can have
all of the styling from your entire
website nice and neat just like that now
pretty sweet and the last thing I want
to talk to you guys about is this and
this is actually a problem that I had
with my website what we're doing is the
new Boston Common we're making an
open-source probably in the next couple
weeks so we had it set up where
everything was running fine on the
server it still is running fine however
whenever developers download it on their
local machine their own computers to try
to work on it the file paths were really
weird and difficult to work with
so we needed to change all of the file
paths in the CSS so we uh well I'll show
you guys a quick example and I download
these two images off the internet and
there's this really cool site I forgot
what it's called but uh you get a bunch
of free images so here's a watermelon
and here's a girl and they're in two
different directories the watermelon is
just in the image directory and say that
we had um images also in this one I
don't know maybe removing all of our
icons in a new directory will say that
that's the story that we're going with
well any time you want to use image
paths as variables then what you do is
this make a variable we just name it
whatever you want like images and set it
equal to images and you know whatever
file path if there's a more complicated
one then you can do that as well but say
that we wanted to also have another
variable for like homepage images so
these would be in images directory and
also home page so we were working with
two different directories this image
directory and home page directory inside
that four images for your home page and
instead of having to write all of these
every single time then what we could do
is something like this this mode called
one and two
so height it's 500 pixels margin bottom
is 10 pixels and of course for the good
part that we're actually talking about
the background which would be the URL
and this would typically be an image URL
button here instead what we can do is we
can actually use that file path now look
at what I did instead of just using at
images whenever you're working the file
path you have to separate the @ sign and
put the variable name inside these curly
braces that tells Les and CSS that hey
this is actually a file and not just a
generic value like a color or something
so what was in here watermelon dot jpg
and let me just copy this for the other
one and this was home page images copied
and paste it right there so now if I
just add these two divs real quick check
it out so ID one and another one of ID
too so hopefully this works and boom and
two didn't work because this isn't
watermelon it's girl all right so there
you go so instead of anytime you want to
move your files around then you're gonna
have to go and change the URL in every
single spot what you can do is you can
just stick it in a variable and manage
it easily right here now for our website
we had that problem so instead of you
know having to just change a variable in
one spot like Oh
instead of images we're gonna put them
all in images um you know like Buckey or
whatever we had to actually go through
all of the CSS and do it the hard way so
there you go
that's how you properly
use image pass and if you want to see
how it gets compiled boom there you go
and I messed it up so look at that
awesome easy to manage you guys are
probably in love with less right now I
know I am and yeah there you go that's
how you use importing comments in file
pass so congratulations
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
