Photoshop cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and today
we're going to learn how to use the
finding and replacing text tool and it
basically just takes a word that you put
in and replaces it with another word and
this is helpful if you've got the same
word in there a bunch of times but
you've misused it or put in the wrong
word and you need to switch it out so
it's pretty handy and time-saving so we
might as well learn how to use it all
right
so I have this document here that just
contains a bunch of a bunch of words and
the word that I want to change is beans
and I want to change it to anything and
you can see that beans is in here a few
times one two three four four times and
I need to change that out for a
different word so we're going to go to
edit and finding replace text and the
word that we want to find is what we
want to type in and I'm going to type in
beans and I'm going to change that word
to music actually I'm going to change it
to puppies room so we can see it better
now if you have one or more if you have
two or more layers actually you can
check this search all layers button and
that's going to search every single type
layer that you have we've got four word
here and this searches for word through
the document case-sensitive when you
type in the find what box right here
it's going to be case sensitive if you
type that in so if there's a capital B
it won't change it if it has a lowercase
B whole word only so it's only going to
search for whole words in the in the box
or in the find what and then ignore
accents which is new in cs6 and it
ignores the accents that they have on
the word during the search so I'm going
to hit find next and it's going to show
me where the words are not found ooh
that's my bad so let me do it again
find and replace text beans for puppies
room okay there we go
now now it's working a little bit better
if I hit find next
there goes it's going to find it and I
can hit change right now to just change
it once or I can hit change all to
change all of them at once which is what
I really wanted to do I'm going to
change all I'm going to hit OK and you
can see it changed all the beans too
Bucky's room four times there so that's
how you use that really easy to do and
pretty pretty awesome I guess and let's
open it up really quick again I'm going
to go back in my history real quick and
do it again edit find and replace text
let's go to find next and then there's
just one here called change find that I
want to show you if you click on that it
automatically changes the word and
locates the next occurrence so that's a
pretty handy that way you don't have to
change and then find necks again or
because sometimes maybe you want to go
through the document and you only want
it you want to leave one of the words
beans in there so if I had changed find
it's going to go to the next beans I can
skip over this by hitting find next and
then I can change find change fine and
that way it leaves in beat that one
beans and changes the other ones to
Bucky's room so just a little hit a
little tip there so you can use it a
little bit with more precision so that's
it for this one finding and replacing
text and be sure to LIKE and subscribe
for more Bucky's room and the new boston
tutorials thanks a lot everybody and
have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
