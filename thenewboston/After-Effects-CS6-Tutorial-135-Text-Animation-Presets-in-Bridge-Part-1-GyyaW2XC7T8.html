Effects cs6 tutorial on your host buddy
blackford and today I want to show you a
little bit more about text presets and
show you how we can browse the presets
and see what they're going to do before
we put them on our text so what you need
to have for this is Adobe bridge which
usually comes with all Adobe products so
you should already have that so what you
want to do is well show you what bridge
looks like real quick I'm going to type
it in here so you can see what the logo
looks like and if you look down here
it's the BR with the yellow color and so
Dolby bridge cs6 so we can come up to
After Effects now and come into
animation and then come down to browse
presets and this will open up Adobe
bridge now well it brings us right to
where our presets folder is and After
Effects now if we come down here to the
text folder so this is the exact same
folders that you'll find over here and
your effects and presets search panel on
the right so let's go into the text
folder here double click on it and then
let's just come into any text that
preset that we want to we'll come in to
fill and stroke and then we can just
click on any of these and after a second
it'll pull up here in this preview and
then we can look and see what the what
it does in real time now we can make
this a little bigger
but not too much bigger it's just a
preview panel so we can check out the
different presets we got here and then I
can show you like the different the
different categories of presets that we
have and so you can see what you want to
expect when you open up a text folder so
it doesn't take so long
so let's go back in here and that was
fill and stroke so basically this
changes the color and adds possibly adds
like a stroke to it so that's a you can
see what's going down here so they got
some cool looking effects and let's go
on to the next one
I've got 3d text here now this is three
space not that's not the kind of 3d text
that like you would make with the
raytrace 3d renderer so we've got some
rotating everything that happens has to
do a 3d space you've got the it you've
got it in this area let's go back anime
in so these are going to come in into
play so you use these if you want your
words to come in let's bring up I go
fading in this one's called buzzwords
this one you won't be able to tell what
this one does but you type in different
words into your source text and this
will pop up a bunch of different words
so I mean here's these now the opposite
of it is animate out and you can
probably see that it just takes the text
off the screen so that's how that that's
how this one works
let's get out of here and go to blurs
the blurs are the words are coming on by
using blur or they're coming off using a
blur as you can see here so that's that
one now we've got our curves and spins
which you guessed it it'll be words
coming on or off or just on they're
using different spins and like things
like that
so check out tire rim
a little crazy on that one some of these
are a little crazy and weird
I wouldn't use all of them but that one
might be cool for like a design kind of
logo let's get out of here
we got expressions here's the buzzwords
that I was talking about where you could
use the where they just pop up different
words and they've got this in the
expression so you might as well use that
one instead of the other one and then
you just edit the words and the inside
the expression you don't have to go over
our expressions at some time with you
guys
frame number in case you ever needed to
have that in the side it's good for when
you're working on film so when you when
you're rendering it out it'll have the
frame number in the corner and when you
go to review it you can see what frame
it is frame you messed up on pretty much
so there you go let's go back to the
next one we already went over a filling
stroke graphical and there you go has a
like kind of like graphics in it that's
what the graphical stands for
see they're a little crazy alright let's
head to the next one lights and optical</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
