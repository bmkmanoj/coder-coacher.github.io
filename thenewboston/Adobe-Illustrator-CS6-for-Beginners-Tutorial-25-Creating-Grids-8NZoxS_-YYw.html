welcome to another Illustrator cs6
tutorial today we're gonna be going over
creating grids now there's two types of
grids in Illustrator there is the
rectangle grid and there are circular
polar grids which are just called polar
grids but I added circular in there
because that's the shape of them so the
rectangular grid tool over here where
the line segment arc tool or spiral tool
is you get the rectangular grid tool and
that just creates rectangular grids of a
specific size and number of horizontal
and vertical dividers so if I go ahead
and just click and drag this is the
basic rectangular grid that you're going
to get now most of the time you're going
to want to be able to specify what
you're using and what type of grid you
want so I'm gonna hit control Z so I can
go back I'm just going to change this to
black because they've been using orange
the whole time alright and then go ahead
on your artboard when you have the
rectangular grid tool selected just
click and click where you want the
rectangular grid to be where you want
the center of it now we can change the
default width and height of it we get
the number of horizontal dividers and
then we give vertical dividers and if
you don't want those lines to be
straight in these you can skew them from
either the bottom over the of the
divider to the top so say I want three
horizontal dividers which are from left
to right think of if you get horizontal
and vertical are confused think of the
word horizon in here and when you think
of the horizon that's what the Sun sets
on and that's the land so that's gonna
be going left to right and then we've
got vertical dividers say we want ten of
those and we've got use an outside
rectangle as a frame and what that's
going to do if you have that checked
it's going to replace individual
segments with a
rectangle object so I'll show you what
that is
so okay and here's what we get it looks
like the corner of our grid is what
you're going to be when you click that's
where the core top-left corner of the
grid is gonna be so here's where we got
our grid we got one two three horizontal
dividers and I'm not going to count but
we got ten vertical dividers and that's
not counting the outside ones so
remember that all right let's go ahead
and delete this out and go ahead and
mess with our tools again
so let's uncheck this use outside
rectangle as a frame and I'm going to
hit OK and we can see what the
difference is and if I go to click on
these and try to move it there we go
it's not too much different it's we can
select the sum of these individual lines
and stuff like that we've got this
individual line path here where we can
move it out and everything like that so
that's what I was taught that's what
that does so I'm gonna delete this out
that's nice there we go
sometimes illustrators been doing that I
click and then it creates a one pixel by
one pixel object which doesn't help
anybody I'll just go to 100 by 100 and
so what we get so I'm gonna start
skewing some of the dividers put that
back on and hit OK and you can see that
dividers are now skewed towards the
bottom and they have actually been
skewed a lot so that's what that looks
like and then that that was way skewed
so if I want to just do it a little bit
maybe 82% and I'll make this a little
bigger
600 500 something like that
okay now you can see that these are more
skewed I made the Box way too big oh
well let's make it less big way less 300
how about 1 to 300 wide to 200 tall
because tall was where we're getting
screwed over on all right hit okay I'm
gonna have to move this whole thing
again but now you can see how it's been
skewed towards the bottom and that's all
I was trying to show you in that whole
debacle there so let's go move on to the
polar grids the polar grid tool pretty
much makes a a circular grid it has a
bunch of circles kind of like a
dartboard and it has some radial
dividers in it I'm going to go ahead and
click here and we've got our options
here we've got 5 Co centric dividers
which are the circles and radial
dividers which are lines that come out
I'm going to hit OK and this is what we
get kind of like a spiderweb kind of
looking thing so these outside ones or
the co Centrex
and those are the circular dividers and
then the radial dividers are these lines
that are coming out from the middle that
divide the circles now we can go ahead
and mess with some options if we want to
let's make these a little bigger and if
you want a perfect circle you're going
to want to keep the width in the height
the same and I'll lower this down to
like two and make this something like 10
and we'll see what happens now we've got
a couple boxes here we've got create
compound path from ellipses and that's
going to replace circles with separate
compound paths kind of like the other
use ice outside rectangles frame it's a
little bit like that
and then we got the fill grid and then
that will just fill it with our current
fill color we don't have a fill color
selected right now as you can see up
here in the top left hit okay and here's
what we got so that's how you use the
polar grids and the regular rectangle
grids so hopefully guys learn something
around here and how helpful that these
different grids can be used for you and
pretty much the grids will be used in
like some types of business things you
can use them in in backgrounds if you
make the entire background a grid and
then lower the opacity or something like
that and change the colors around you
can make some really cool things using
grids so thanks a lot for watching this
one hit the like button if you thought
the video was worthy of a like so thanks
a lot for watching everybody and have a
good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
