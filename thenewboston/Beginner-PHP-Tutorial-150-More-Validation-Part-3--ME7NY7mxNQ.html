first note for the password I'll give it
one anyway and perhaps you could specify
a minimum length as well well no we
can't actually do this but but I mean in
in PHP we could give it a minimum length
it needs to be for security reasons
in fact I'll leave this out for now
because I don't want to be writing too
much code and waste too much time so max
length okay
so we'll put a max length in here for
the first name and that's gonna be 40
remember 40 and the same here for the
surname max length equals 40 so let's
save that and go back to our page and
we'll just see how that's changed our
form itself register okay so first name
let's type in a load of rubbish and we
can see when it stops okay you can see
that that I'm still typing you can
probably hear my keyboard but you can
see it's not typing anything so that's
okay let's do the same with surname okay
you can probably hear that I'm still
typing however the inputs not working
and then the same with username
okay you can see that stopped as well so
that's fair enough but now we need to
ensure that it's checked while PHP
script as well now I'm not going to be
able to test I'm not going to be testing
this by sort of downloading this file
modifying it because I've already got
access to it so when we test it in PHP
I'm just going to remove the max length
so we've got max length of 30 for the
username 40 for the first name in
surname
so let's come up and find out where are
we going to put this check what's the
best place that we could possibly put
this check well we're checking here if
the username and everything else is not
empty so a good place to do it would be
to do it underneath this because we want
to check the max length but after we've
checked that it's not empty
so let's some will indent in and then
we'll M will indent the rest of our code
in in a minute
so we're going to create an if statement
with the condition here and then start a
block the block ends after this so it'd
be down let's just double check where it
would be so if we come over to this one
here it's going to be yeah it would be
here
so let's indent the rest of this
it might be there anyway we might return
an error but it's hard to hard to see
when you're doing things like this so
what we want to say is if STR Len of
username is greater than 30 remember
this is the condition and then we say
else the rest of the code so if the
string length string length of username
is greater than 30 or the string length
of first-name is greater than 40 or the
string length of surname is greater than
40 we need to echo please adhere to max
length of fields now the reason we're
not giving a user-friendly message here
is the only reason this would ever this
error would never be returned if someone
had modified the form themselves max
length is a standard property for input
types so therefore all browsers will
pick up this max length and they'll
always allow you only a max length so
we're only doing this if people are
going to mess around with our form so
let's change the max length up to 100
for each of them so we can test this and
then we'll change them back in just a
moment well don't say that so safe okay
so let's refresh the page case let's
enter a load of rubbish into there
ok let's enter a password sensibly
because we need this to match and load
of rubbish into here and later
operations here let's click register and
it says please adhere to max length of
fields okay so now let's sensibly
register a user
okay so let's click register and it says
you've registered let's go over to our
database to check that that everything's
worked and you can see that that's
worked so let's go back before we do
anything else or well this is the end of
the tutorial but let's change these back
make sure you have your max length in
here so what we've done is we've
corrected a few undefined variable and
undefined index errors and we've also
changed part of the form validation
which might not immediately be you know
a priority for some people people might
not think about it straight away but you
are in fact going to cut data off if you
submit or allow your users to submit too
much data so for example if it was a
description about themselves you might
want to limit them to two hundred three
hundred you know five hundred characters
but then you need to take into account
that you need to limit them otherwise
your data is going to be cut off when
you submit it in in in MySQL there are
some exceptions you can give it the text
data type which will allow you a common
by how many characters but quite a few
characters but always always always give
a max length in your field and also do
the relevant checks inside your PHP code
as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
