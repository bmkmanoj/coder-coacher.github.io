be Illustrator cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and today
we're gonna learn how to work with type
styles and a style is a group of format
settings I can use to get the exact
looking look that you want in your text
and what you can do is you can take that
style and apply it to other sets of text
without having to always put on that set
of set of what are they called the
different parts of your text like the
the font and if it's bold or the kerning
and all that stuff can all be set in for
hands so you can apply it to another set
of text that doesn't have that style
there's two different types of styles
there's paragraph style and paragraph
style is a group of settings that can be
applied to all the text within a
paragraph mm-hm and even even if it's
just like one line paragraph like some
of these and then you've got character
style and that's a group of settings
that are applied to any block of text so
they've got different things going on so
we'll go over the different styles and
how to edit them and everything right
now so let's uh create some text so I
just made a text box and I pasted some
text in it that I found on the internet
I'm gonna select that and then I'm gonna
select the character style so go to a
window go to type and then we want to go
to character styles and you can see that
paragraph Styles is down here as well
we'll go to character styles first and
this little thing comes up so the thing
that we've got here first is normal
character style if you want to edit it
you can but first we're going to create
a new one so let's click on this button
to create a new style we've got a
character style one if you double click
click on it you can change the name and
this is gonna be tutorial style for me
and if I click click on the options here
we see we can have some other styles
here and we've got our character style
options so let's go ahead and start
working on these but I double clicked on
the space to the right of the name and
here we go we've got our style name
which you can change there or you can
change it the way I did and then we've
got a couple categories over here I've
got general basic advanced the color and
we got the features here so let's go to
general and what the general does here
is gives us a little overview of what's
going on with our style now you're not
gonna see much for everything so I went
in here and added some character color
real quick and if I twirl down this menu
we can see that this has been changed
and that the fill color registration at
10th 100% is what we have used so let's
go ahead and start editing stuff we've
got basic character formats and this has
got all your basic values that you can
edit my bad I didn't mean to click that
so you can change your font so if I
wanted to change this to try it bogus
below there we go well I use this one
and it got rid of the quotations just
try to find something else that has
quotations there we go and then we've
got our font style and all I can choose
on this one is regular I can choose my
size so I want to go to like 16 maybe
that's too too high go 12 we can fix the
leading we can fix the tracking I can
underline if I want to or do a
strikethrough well just do a
strikethrough because it's prominent and
you can see it and and then I could fix
my kerning I've got my case where I can
do all caps or small caps and then the
position now
all these if you don't know what they
are like leading and tracking and
kerning be sure to check out the
episodes before this of the type section
it's only a couple episodes back that I
went and talked about this so check
those out if you have no idea what those
are let's go to advance character
formats
we've got horizontal scale vertical
scale which is going to increase the
size of your font or decrease it
we've got baseline shift and then we've
got character rotation and a baseline
shift pretty much which is how long your
I hope it your lines are and character
rotation will rotate the characters a
little bit so if I went to like 45
degrees you can see that they are
actually rotated a little bit and that
can come out with some unique styles
doing that character color right now
registration and switch if I switch it
to blank then it'll go black if I go to
yellow to go yellow let's go with red
and then open type features don't really
have to I haven't gone over open type
features but if you know what you're
talking about go ahead if not then you
can skip this part and we'll go over
open type features and some another
point in time so I'm gonna hit OK and
now the style is applied if I go back to
normal character style it'll bring it
back to what what normal character style
has set for it which is myriad Pro and
pretty much nothing else I can click our
tutorial style then and it's gonna bring
out just what I just made so this is how
you add styles to different things
quickly and if you have a font they are
a couple fonts that you're switching
between all the time with different
sizes and everything you don't want to
have to switch every single setting
every time so you can use this so that's
it for this tutorial
I'll go over some more stuff with you
about styles later on
and then the next one looks like I've
got a couple more tutorials on fonts and
typing everything like that so that'll
be pretty cool I really like working
with type because I think that toy
biography is really cool so thanks a lot
for watching everybody you guys have a
good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
