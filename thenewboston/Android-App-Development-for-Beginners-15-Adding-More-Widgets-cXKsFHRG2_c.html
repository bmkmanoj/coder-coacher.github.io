tutorial what I want to do is I want to
talk to you a little bit more about
relative layout so if you don't really
understand what's going on with this
relative layout or exactly how things
are positioned what we're gonna be doing
is I'm gonna be adding another widget
right above here and it's gonna make a
lot more sense and you guys are gonna
have a lot more control over the
positioning of your widgets after this
tutorial so just like actually let me do
this just might like make a little more
sense so I'll say that we're making the
same home screen as last time where you
have an email and a password and you
click this to log in however I'm just
gonna be adding one as an example so
instead of clicked me hospital-like log
in so I don't want to just run that but
this button is eventually gonna say log
in so now let me go ahead and add one of
those inputs which would be an area
where the user could type something so
the first thing we need to do is import
it so imports Android dot widget in this
code edit text alright so actually let
me do this
alright I'm gonna take this button cut
this and put it right under here alright
so we have the layout created and then
we have the button created and now these
are the buttons rules and then all of
the housekeeping is taken care of down
there so I think that's a little bit
more organized so now the first thing I
want to do is just create that edit text
field and I'll say that I don't know it
could be like for the username so please
use your name input even though it's
technically called edit text so edit
text I'll just name a username that'll
be easy to remember and set equal to why
do I always freaking time you new edit
text
in this holy sweet okay so now we have
that at a text field created now the
next thing I want to do is this
eventually of course whenever you make a
real-life application you're gonna have
a bunch of widgets on your screen a
bunch of stuff now a good thing to
always do is to set an ID for each
widget so then you can reference each
one you can also do some other cool
things
if each widget has its own ID so again
an ID is just a number to reference each
one so let's go ahead and add an ID to
this button and also the user name so
red button and all you have to do it's
really easy set ID and then pass in a
value and also do the same for username
set ID in we'll call this one two so the
idea of red button is one and the user
name input which is above it that widget
will be ID two and I'll show you guys
what we do that in just a second but for
now remember I said whenever you want to
lay out something explicitly in a
certain position you need to give it
these rules right here
so we already did it for the button so
now we have to do it for the username as
well so this is actually gonna be really
similar so if you just copy these button
details and paste it right below then
just change the variable button details
to use your name details and let me see
who's texted me all right
it's my sister and she's giving me gifts
suggestions for my mom which I kind of
need because Christmas in five days and
I have absolutely no idea what to get
her she's actually um very difficult to
shop for so alright where was I oh yeah
in the middle of a disorder alright so
now we have rules and these are
basically the same exact things we're
pretty much just making a container
right here called a username
details in the container is the same
size of whatever that input is simple
enough so now what I want to do is say
okay I'm gonna take that container which
is pretty much the input and I'm coming
to position it right above this button
so how do we do that
well above these button details yeah
give rules to position widgets all right
so the first thing we need to do is use
your name details we need to add a rule
and the first rule is gonna be this
we're gonna say that we want to position
it above here we're above well we didn't
get into that those rules yet but we do
want to position it above so relatively
out dot above so that takes hitting that
puts it above the button now actually I
lied this doesn't put it above the
button this just says okay you want to
position it above something in the
second parameter that's where we put the
button so we say red button and this is
where the get ID comes in handy because
we need to pass an ID of a widget in
here which is going to be one and then
it's gonna say okay take this and
position it above the thing with the ID
one so position that above the button so
now our username in place in above that
button so the next thing we need to do
is add another rule and that is this so
it's gonna be above the bun but we also
want to take it and center it
horizontally so it's in the middle of
the screen and of course horizontal
means left and right so now it's gonna
be above and in the center but right now
if we just ran this it would be sitting
directly on top of it and of course you
always have some space between the input
and the button so let me go let me show
you guys how to add a little margin or
padding between those two so the last
rule we're gonna add little my voice
just cracked
I'm like freaking 27 years old what's
going on bunky all right
so set margins and actually let me and
here's another tip if you ever highlight
something and hold down control and
press Q and it's gonna pop up those
details so these details I know I can't
see my butt
alright so says give me 4 values left
top right and bottom so if you're used
to web design it starts on top but
remember in this it starts on the left
now we only want to add some margins to
the bottom a little bit of spacing
between the bottom of this and the
button so for everything else the first
three we can just pass in 0 and for the
last one we'll just pass in I don't know
like 50 and if it if it looks too small
then we can always come back and add
more
but again that's all we're doing right
here so we created an input we gave all
of our widgets an ID and then we're
setting the rules on how we want to lay
everything out right there now of course
the last thing we need to do is actually
take this and add it to our layout so
just like the bun buckey's layout ad
view which means add widget basically
and what we want to do is we just named
a username yep so what we want to add is
that widget and the rules that we're
going to be using are these rules right
there so now let me go ahead and run
this and check it out so there you go as
you can see we now position that input
relative to this bun we put it on top of
it and we added some padding or
technically margin it's called
below the input to give us a little bit
of space now we have a problem here and
that's this is incredibly small it looks
like the user could fit about one
character in there and their username is
probably going to be a little longer
than that so in the next couple of this
Oriels I'm gonna be showing you guys
some more cool things you can do
and how to fix that problem as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
