Android tutorial what we're gonna do in
this tutorial set up our own activity
from scratch home made Java is what
we're going to be doing we're going to
set up a java class so we're gonna go up
to our source folder and right-click and
go to new either
I'm sorry new class right here
hit OK and we're going to call this
splash with the capital S and again I
should guys should just tell you this
because since we're working with Java
it's basically good grammar for your
class names to start with the uppercase
letter I didn't do that with the
starting point that other other class
that we have called starting point but
general rule of thumb you want to have
it uppercase not a huge deal but you
know whatever and then we're going to
hit finish got our class started and now
as we we're just also going to open our
starting point class as a reference you
guys can kind of see what we need to set
up here now right now it's just a Java
class it's not an activity and Android
uses activities they're basically like
different tabs for example this is a tab
and this is a tab think of this is an
activity for the most part and then we
can open up this activity and it will
put that previous activity behind it and
then if we hit the back button on our
phone it opens this activity I don't
know if that made sense but they're
basically like different windows or
different tabs that's what an activity
is so we want our splash to be an
activity so what we're going to say is
extends activity and what extends means
is that we're extending the activity
class so we have to import this activity
class which comes from the Android app
package again from the SDK for the most
part so we're going to import that and
what extends means is we're since we're
using or extending this activity class
we can use some of the methods from
within that activity class now let's go
back to the starting point and we notice
that we have this method called oncreate
so we're going to add that real quickly
by right-clicking within the brackets
going down to the source and then going
to override implement methods click that
as you can see here's our activity class
that we're extending and we can use all
these methods from within that activity
class there's a method called oncreate
which you guys saw in our starting point
activity so we're going to click this
and make sure it's the one that takes in
but takes a bundle within its parameters
click OK and we have our activity for
the most part set up at least our
oncreate method set up and now basically
I kind of want to quickly talk on the
Java just kind of give you guys a little
bit better understanding of what's going
on public just think of that meaning
that it's accessible by other classes or
other yeah for the most part other
classes if it's private for the most
part won't be being able to be accessed
by those other classes and again we're
setting up a class again that might be
confusing word for new Java programmers
but basically a class defines certain
things I'll get into that explanation
later as we go just know that this is a
class what we're setting up all these
are classes over here under our package
and we're extending the activity class
so we can use this method called
oncreate now anytime you guys see void
that basically means that it's going to
be a method we're using a method so when
you see void just think of a method for
the most part and this method is called
oncreate and what it takes within its
parameters is a bundle so this is just
like a variable we set up so we could
change this bundle to something like
Travis loves bacon again we're just
renaming the variable and then we're
sending that variable to the superclass
for the most part and giving some giving
it some data so we need to change a
variable down here - Travis love bacon I
guess it's supposed to be Travis loves
bacon but it's just Travis love bacon
that's my middle name and my last name
love bacon but uh there we go so
basically we're sending this bundle into
our super
class you guys don't really need to
worry about what super is since again it
sets it up for you but as you guys get
into Java you'll realize what that is
actually doing it's using the method
oncreate I just don't worry about that
okay now the other thing that we want to
do for this activity is set up the
content view this is how we're going to
let this activity have the background of
our layout that we just set up called
splash so to do that we use the method
called set content view and within the
parameters we're going to resource or
reference that splash layout by going r
dot layout dot splash and then we just
need our semicolon and we're good to go
basically our activity will load up that
new splash and I'll show you guys how we
can basically uh well just watch the
next tutorial where we're going to get
into the Android manifest again thanks
guys for watching hope you have a good
one hope that someone made sense and
catch you then peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
