welcome to your second Android
development tutorial now in this
tutorial what we're gonna be doing is
downloading some more stuff we need in
order to develop on the Android so the
first thing that I'm gonna have you guys
download is called the Android SDK now
the Android SDK is pretty much a package
that includes things such as the
libraries the debugger some sample code
documentation and also the emulator
which is pretty much a simulator so we
can run Android programs on our computer
so in order to do that go ahead and open
Google and go ahead and type in download
Android SDK I don't want to give you
guys a direct link because you know how
are they're always changing things
the websites probably gonna change but
anyways go ahead and click on the first
thing that pops up and this is going to
take you to download page that give you
guys a bunch of different options of
SDKs download now the first thing you're
gonna want to look for is what platform
are you developing on make sure for most
of you guys that you're on Windows and
that is of course I'm assuming you're
not running Linux or you're on a Mac but
anyways and once you get under this we
have two options right here we have a
zip folder and we have an executable
file well I'm gonna recommend and
evidently Android is - is just
downloading the executable file the
executable file is pretty much an easy
wizard to guide you along the
installation so go ahead and click this
and the file is gonna start to download
I'm not gonna click it because I already
have it downloaded by anyways that's how
you do it
so anyways once you click it and you
have your file downloaded go ahead -
wherever you download that file and
double click it and this is gonna start
the wizard now once you're in the wizard
you just gotta hit next next next
install next and once you're done
installing that it's gonna give you a
program and this program should
automatically open called the SDK
manager and if it doesn't automatically
open just go to you know SDK manager and
your programs and you can open it
way hold on gotta itch my ear uh uh yeah
that's a spy right here alright anyways
moving along so anyways at the end of
your installation this program should
automatically open but if it doesn't
automatically open for some reason then
just go to your programs where it was
installed and just open it like you
would open any other program so anyways
whenever you see my program opens right
here you see that I have a bunch of
stuff under my install packages well the
first time that you open this program
you're not going to have any of this
stuff installed so you're gonna need to
install all this on your own now to
install all of these packages all you
need to do is hit the accept all button
and then go ahead and either click
download or install or one of those
buttons and then your download or
installation is going to begin now you
guys need to be patient because it's
gonna take like 20 minutes to install
all these packages and if you get an
error a lot of people have been getting
errors just go ahead and cancel out of
it and try to do it again so anyways
it's pretty much I know it sounds
confusing but it's pretty much gonna
guide you along all you have to do
basically is hit next next next accept
all next next next and it's gonna do all
the work for you so anyways once you
have everything installed and
everything's downloaded you're good to
go just go ahead and cancel out of that
and now we have the Android SDK
downloaded again it's a lot easier done
than said yeah I said it so anyways we
have the Android SDK downloaded at this
point the only thing we have left to
download or any big thing is a program
called eclipse now if you don't have
Eclipse downloaded on your computer then
what it is is pretty much the text
editor we need in order to develop
Android applications so go ahead open up
Google again let me go to google so you
guys don't get confused and by the way
do you guys ever do this with you guys
with Google Chrome um is it even called
Google Chrome or just curl
I don't know but anyways I done this for
the longest time whenever I first got
this
instead of just typing whatever I need
like download eclipse right here I would
always go to google.com and type it in
right there so instead of just using the
slow shortcut bar I always want to
Google bad habit but you know whatever
so anyways now that you put up with my
little side story here's what you need
to do download eclipse go ahead and type
that in Google and click on the first
link that pops up now this is gonna give
you a list of like a thousand eclipses
the download but the one we're looking
for is this Eclipse IDE for Java
developers and we're gonna want to
download the 32-bit version now I know a
lot of you guys are running a 64-bit
operating system but either way download
the 32-bit version and the reasoning
behind this is whenever we download the
JDK in the first tutorial that was 32
bits so in order for this program to be
compatible with that we need to download
the 32 bit version of Eclipse so again
like I said if you're getting an error
message even though your computer might
have a 64-bit operating system you need
it download 32-bit eclipse
so anyways go ahead and click this link
right here and this is gonna take you to
downloads page what i found is you can
either click this one right here and
this is gonna give you the file but some
of these mirrors are actually faster in
the mirror is pretty much just a
different place to download from so um
you can download you know from harvard
but don't download from there they're a
bunch of perhaps they're probably
Indiana University looks like a good one
to me but I'm just gonna you can
download from any of these ones just
make sure it says HTTP for your best bet
so anyways once you have that downloaded
it's gonna give you a file on your
computer let me see if I can find out
for you guys Bucky download and it's
gonna look like this well yours might
look like a little folder with a zipper
on it but I got wind zip so it's gonna
give you a zip file and what you need to
do with that zip file is go ahead and
right-click it and it's either gonna say
open with WinZip or extra
or unzip or something like that pretty
much you need to decompress it and once
you extract everything from it it's
gonna give you a regular folder right
next to it so once you have that folder
extracted let's go ahead and click the
regular one and go ahead and open
eclipse and it's going to give you a
bunch of different files in here well
we're looking for is this application
file right here called Eclipse it's
gonna be the one with a weird icon next
to it this purple planet looking thing
so what you can do anytime you want to
run this program you can either go to
this directory navigate through your
folders and go ahead and double-click
Eclipse or what's gonna be a better bet
if you just right-click it and press
send to desktop right there create
shortcut it's gonna give you a handy
little icon right on your desktop and
since we're gonna be using this program
a lot hopefully um that's your better
bet so go ahead and once you got your
icon on your desktop just go ahead and
double click it and go ahead and press
run you need to do this every time
probably and it's gonna ask for your
workspace just go ahead and keep your
default workspace press ok and now
Eclipse is gonna open and by the way if
you get to that point and my computer is
freezing that is just great that's just
a finger let me close this program I'm
about three seconds away from
drop-kicking my computer right now
uh-huh
this is nice so hopefully your program
shouldn't do this but I think it's
because I'm recording with Camtasia and
trying to pump like a thousand different
processes into my computer but anyways
if you guys get an air before that I
just say err err err before that then uh
that's because you downloaded the wrong
version of a clip so anyways you know
I'm just gonna stop here because you
know I don't feel like talking anymore I
think I'm going to bed so anyways that's
what you need to do for this tutorial
make sure you download the Android SDK
and also eclipse and if you have any
problems just go ahead and shoot me a
message on YouTube messaging and
actually you know what I'm probably not
gonna look at those ever just go ahead
and ask
my forum and someone will help you say
nice thank you guys for watching don't
forget subscribe and I'll see you guys
