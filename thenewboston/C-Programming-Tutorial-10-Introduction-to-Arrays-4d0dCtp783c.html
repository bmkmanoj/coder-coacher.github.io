tutorial and in this tutorial we're
going to be covering something called an
array arr a why that's probably going to
be at the title at the top of the screen
but you know I like spelling things so
there you have it so you're saying all
right Bucky that's a pretty cool word
but what the heck is an array well let
me break it down to you guys real simple
don't even read any definitions online
or else they're just going to confuse it
with all their technical talk all an
array is its variable that holds
multiple values so for example before we
said like int X was equal to 17 well now
what we can do is instead of just one
number in there we can store multiple
numbers or values in there pretty
confusing huh so let's go ahead and
let's see an example right now let me
give myself some space and let's go
ahead and make an integer well before I
even start typing let me tell you guys
how to create an array in order to
create an array they are all made
basically the same way the first thing
you do is type what type of data you're
going to be storing this array let's
just keep it simple and store integers
in it whole numbers next you give your a
cool name and we're going to give this
array the coolest name of all which is
bacon you know besides from Bucky
because that's pretty dang cool and
after you write the name of your array
in square brackets you're right how many
values you want that array to store so
let's go ahead and make a relatively
small one we're only store five values
in here won't take too much of a toll on
our processor so go ahead and just like
variables set it to the equal sign and
now we need to set it equal to multiple
values so what your computer needs to do
is it needs to recognize where these
values are so go ahead and go ahead and
put these I don't even know like these
things are curl curly brackets or curly
braces I think
I don't know whatever those things are
called and in your line so inside these
curly braces this is where you write
your five values integer values
separated with the comma so let's go
ahead and type in any five values
12:43 54 3 and 897 so check this out
again to recap in order to create array
here's what you do
what type of data is going to be stored
in it these are integers what is the
name of your array you can name it
whatever heck you want just name this
bacon and how many items are in it and
by the way the technical term for these
items are elements I call them items
some people call them elements
technically they're elements but
whatever I'll use them interchangeably
deal with it so check this out you know
how before whenever we wanted to use a
variable like C out we would just print
out the variables name like this bacon
well how on earth are we going to
reference this array and get to the
values in it if it has like multiple
values well this is going to be super
confusing right wrong check this out
anytime you want to access any element
in array all you have to do is type the
name of the array and right what index
it is so let's go ahead and see an
example and you're going to see
something a little weird but stick with
me let's go ahead and put bacon 2 and
print out and see what we get run this
and we get 54 now let's scroll this down
and check this out all right 12 is first
43 is second and 54 is third so how come
when I type too I got 54 instead of 43
well check this out in computer language
they love to start with zero
you know binary code is all zeros and
ones whenever you learn counting as a
kid you started with one but whoever the
heck built computers whenever they learn
counting as a kid they evidently must
have started at zero
because in computer programming whenever
you count anything it always starts with
zero so that is why when your your
reference to that this is actually the
second index because it goes like this
12 0 43 is 154 is 2 3 is 4 or excuse me
3 well that's confusing 3 is 3 and 897
is 4 so let's go ahead and change this
to UM 4 and remember since it starts at
0 0 1 2 3 4 this is actually going to
print out 897 right here check it out
897 so how cool is that
so anyways that is what an array is
pretty much a variable that can store
multiple values and how to access each
individual element in the array is you
type in the name of the array which is
bacon and then you type where what index
you want to print out so 0 would print
out 12 let's just go ahead and see that
12 and if we did something crazy like 5
let's go ahead and build and run that
and we get some weird air and this is
actually looks like a number but this is
actually a space in memory it's pretty
much in air so that is because it goes 0
1 2 3 4 and 5 doesn't exist so it's
going to just print out the memory
location of it but that's like in that's
like like 40 tutorials away from now
just notice that whenever you go outside
every Ray you get error message so
anyways that's the basics of an array in
the next story I'm going to show you
guys a different way to build an array
other than this so you definitely want
to stick around and I know just printing
out variables on the screen right now is
going to seem really useless but trust
me whenever we come across building a
program that uses an array in a useful
manner you're going to see how useful
these things really are it's actually
incredibly amazing trust me you guys are
going to be amazed
so anyways thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe and I'll see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
