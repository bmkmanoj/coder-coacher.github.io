org back with another video for the new
Boston now in the user system we have
completed everything and we have sorted
out the form validation there's a few
points that we need to address before we
continue any further let's just go back
to our code and have a look and then
we're going to run the web page so we
can see what the output of everything is
okay so at the moment we have our form
form here which is actually reoccurring
our data that's already been submitted
in the form which is fair enough so when
the user submits a username let's say
Alex a password which we're not saving
just for security reasons and then a
first-name let's say Alex and then Gera
now what happens if they haven't
submitted this data
we're just echoing it out as a variable
so we're just echoing out username and
then we're just echoing out first name
and then just surname we're not saying
has this data been submitted or not and
we also have another issue in let's just
open chord in PHP we've got this HTTP
referer here
now obviously the HTTP referer is going
to give us the page that we were
referred from so therefore if we were to
open up our page and we were to go over
to the register dot PHP file but just
the PHP you can see that we are given a
variety of errors now the error at the
top is to do the HTTP referer it gives
us an undefined index tear in undefined
index error and what this means is that
we have this variable here equal to an
undefined index this has not been
defined anywhere because we haven't been
referred from anywhere if we had say a
link on index.php and we were linking to
this register page then we would be able
to would be able to have a refer our
referrer
information will be sent
so how do we go and solve this problem
well it's quite simple all we need to do
is we need to come down a bit and we
need to use an if statement to check if
this here is already set before we
define it so let's just come up here and
we'll say if is set much like when we
were doing the form validation on the
register dot PHP page dollar underscore
server and then HTTP referer so we doing
exactly the same thing
we're just saying is it set is it has
this been set and we wrap that in the
block and we could also say and not
empty HTTP referer just for added peace
of mind I guess it's this part here
isn't important necessarily but just
means is it set and is it not empty
remember we using the exclamation mark
for naught then we set the variable so
we only set this variable here if we've
performed these checks correctly and
this block is run so therefore we're not
going to receive an undefined index
error because we're not setting a
variable to something that doesn't exist
because these checks up here do the
existence check for us so let's go back
and refresh ok you can see that that
errors gone let's go back to the index
page that Court is included in as well
and you'll see that the error is gone as
well so we've solved part of our problem
then you've probably notice back on
register dot PHP we've got exactly the
same error message we've got here notice
undefined variable username in and then
it will tell us all about the
information this is a PHP error but
because we've echoed it out
let's just go down because we've echoed
out in the value property of our input
type here or our input field it's giving
it to us with its HTML data we've got
the same here as well notice undefined
variable first name notice undefined
variable surname
so how do we go about doing this well we
say the exact same process applies to
this code here then we've just changed
this here so what we need to do is we
need to say if let me start a block so
the block the if the block if the
condition is true we're executing or
running rather than this block here so
if is set username echo that and then
that's it that solved our problem so if
is set username then echo username
otherwise don't and we can put the and
doesn't equal it is not empty but it's
not terribly important for now so let's
refresh and you can see that that's
disappeared from there so we've solved
that one now let's just go down and
correct the others so using inline PHP
here we're saying if and then we own oh
sorry I've missed the echo that
so we put that echo back in the right
place there and we need to obviously
close our block so again if is set first
name so the the type of error you you
see you just need to look at it
carefully and think undefined variable
we have an undefined variable now why
might it be that we have undefined
surname just look through your code just
examine your code and see what is
happening obviously we haven't submitted
the form so we've we created these
variables for ourself to be able to use
username password now that we're using
these this username first name and
surname what it's doing is it's grabbing
data from post that hasn't actually been
submitted
we're not posting the first name when we
just land on register dot PHP so we need
to incorporate checks that deal with
errors like this because the last thing
you want to do is to be is to be dealing
with them or showing these errors to
your users</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
