studio max tutorial and in this tutorial
we're going to be covering editable
polygons now this is probably what
you're going to use when you're making
the rest of your animations from now on
actually like character models or you
know cars or anything actually so let's
go ahead and get right into it
go ahead and click sphere and create a
sphere and just press W on your keyboard
for a move tool and bring it up and you
know bring it out so it's into view
there we go so now that we created a
spear what we would usually do according
to our last tutorial is right-click it
and create editable spline but what we
want to do is right-click this press
convert to and convert to editable poly
now I can't show you this Rell to my
screen recorder will mess up it again
I'm going to right click it convert to
convert to editable poly so you do that
and I'll see you in a second alright
guys I just selected this converted to
editable poly and it brought up our
modify tab and it shows that this is
indeed an editable poly so there are two
different ways that we can alter this
and that is with our modifiers is and
those are things we learned before that
does weird transformations do this or we
can work with each of the individual sub
objects so if we go ahead and expand
this menu right here we can see them all
the vertex is all the points that make
up the object the edges let me see
I could probably scroll in this one a
little better the edges are these aligns
the edges are what connect the vertex is
you don't want to work with border
usually unless you're doing something
real specific the poly is each one of
these shapes or each face of it pretty
much so the Polly's are the faces and
the last one the elements if you have
any like if you have like a couple
objects in here then it's going to
select the entire thing so you don't
really want to work with elements a lot
what we're going to be doing is work
within poly like 99 percent of time poly
and probably polygons so we can work
with the faces but for right now go to
vertex
that's where we're going to be working
with and let's just zoom in a little bit
right there and another thing I want to
point out let's zoom in a little bit for
more anytime we have one of these sub
objects selected it's going to turn red
so we can select them by clicking on
them we can also click and drag to
select a multiple amount or if we want
to select non-adjacent ones we can click
hold control click click and then we get
like random ones if we hold down control
and click so that's how we select
various whether it called sub objects
and again once you select them they're
going to turn red now a problem that we
have with selecting sub objects is
here's what happens whenever you select
a sub object like this it doesn't only
select that ones you see what it does is
it looks through this and if you can see
in this one person just look and mom it
not only selects the ones in front right
here but it selects the ones behind it
too and that's because if I turn this
whenever I select it the box here what's
a better way to see this like right here
whenever I select these up here it looks
through and now you can see it selected
the ones behind it too so not only the
ones that you could see but the ones
through that the ones you couldn't see
as well so this is a problem whenever
we're trying to work with only this side
of the spear so what do we want to do
that whenever we could select it like
this it only selects these and not the
ones behind it too like there well let's
go back home and what we can do is check
this little box you take a break here
for a second and this is called ignore
back-facing and what this little thing
does is it only selects the ones with
the normals pointing towards you or in
other words the only selects the ones
that you can see and it doesn't go
through it so now when we have that
checked and we select this look this the
ones in the back are not checked only
the ones in front how awesome is that
so I usually have ignore back-facing on
all the time I don't really know why
they have it is default off because you
always or excuse me you usually want to
have it on so now with those selected
let's go ahead and well I want to teach
you guys one more thing another thing
that you can do is grow or shrink your
selection whenever you make a selection
like let's say we select these two
vertices right here whenever we grow it
expands our selection outward so what's
a better view for this let me see here
we go as you can see well I have to
select now then when I grow that it has
all of these selected then I want to
press grow again it has a huge range
selected right here so I can do the
opposite of that by shrinking shrinking
shrinking shrinking until nothing's left
so that's another way to alter your
selection but for now let's go ahead and
do something with this I'm going to
select these two right here and make
sure you have ignore back-facing off
press W to get your move tool and go
ahead and pull them out so now we have
this little thing popping out of our
sphere right there so now let's go down
here and select let's go ahead and
select something like that one hold down
control and you probably just want to
work with your select object this one
this one this one and this one and this
one now go ahead and press W again and
let's go Hogan and take those and Y and
move them back like right there so let
me see how it looks so now we got
something that looks like a nose kind of
in the mouth and again I'm just teaching
you how to use them I'm not making a
real good animation but uh I guess the
only thing we need now is eyes this
pretty much looks like a jack-o'-lantern
but hey whatever so now in order to get
eye sees what I'm going to do go back
and get out of your modify panel and go
to the create panel and let's go ahead
and create two spheres Soner standard
primitives go ahead and create a sphere
alright there alyx good now let's go
ahead and move that up and if we zoom
out a little bit we can move it over
up and over and just back a little bit
to set it in his head
I've got positions just right don't want
to mess it up right there actually
approaches you move it over a little bit
he ain't no Cyclops so then after that
go ahead with this selected hold down
shift on your keyboard and we can move
it over to this adder right here and
move it back just like that
so what shift does is create a copy of
it which you should know from the other
tutorials so now we have this little
dude with the nose that we extruded
using the vertices and also the mouth
which we selected all the vertices and
push them back so that is your real
quick tutorial on how to make a
jack-o'-lantern
type again I'm not really didn't want to
really create anything this story I just
want to show you how you can use your
vertices and sub objects to select
different parts of the sphere or excuse
me sphere and move them in and out so
look at that that is a
professional-looking they should put
that in a video game or something
mr. jack-o'-lantern that is good I got
to send that got to put this on my
resume but anyways thank you guys for
watching hopefully you know how to work
a little bit with editable Polys now in
the next tutorial we're going to be
learning how to work with them in
advance kind of way so again thank you
guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
