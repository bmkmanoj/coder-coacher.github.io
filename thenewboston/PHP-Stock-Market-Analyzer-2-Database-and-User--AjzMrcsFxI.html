tutorial in how to create a PHP program
that can predict the stock market sounds
awesome so let's go ahead and get
started the first thing I'm going to be
doing is I'm gonna be building a
database now we're gonna be working with
massive massive amounts of data so
therefore we need a database to put it
in you get how that works data goes in
the database makes sense right so if
you're working with any cPanel not only
on Hostgator but if you're working with
any shared hosting and you have cPanel
there's going to be an icon called MySQL
databases you can also use this wizard
but I like working straight with the
databases so go ahead and click on that
and now this first thing that says
create new database so go ahead and give
your database a name I'm just gonna name
mine YouTube and hit create database now
what it does is your database is not
named YouTube it may or may not give you
a different name to pair it on depending
on if you're on shared hosting or not
but anyways go ahead and copy the full
name of your database not what you named
it the full name and from here what we
wanted to do is I want to mention this
we're gonna be having you know like a
user with the password and a database
name and a bunch of other stuff and I
can't remember all the stuff in my head
so I'm just and I always do this I
always make a blank text file that
pretty much stores all my stuff and now
notepad is freezing that is just great
notepad okay let's try this one more
time open notepad and frozen again
excellent
really okay so evidently I just pasted
it in and it unfroze thanks no bad I'm
not doing a tutorial or anything and
just go ahead and put a database and
what this text file is gonna do is
pretty much just gonna remember all of
our information passwords and stuff like
that we're we don't need to upload this
file to the server it's not going to be
part of the program it's just like our
memory so go ahead and what I did
already is
I made a folder called Danielle 1986 and
this is where I'm gonna be storing all
of my stuff and guys this is not mine I
promised oh wow
this is embarrassing but anyways I
wanted me storing all my stuff in a 4
called Danielle in 1986 so right now
there's nothing in it so I'm gonna go
ahead and save this one as let's see let
me go ahead and find them and I'll just
name it
documentation okay good to go so now art
we have our database name right there so
if you never built a PHP program before
then what you need to do in order to
access your database in your MySQL
tables is you actually need to add a
user now through that user you can
access all your tables and databases and
stuff like that
so I'm gonna be creating a user and I'm
just going to name her Sally
sounds like a good memorable name now
make a password that's really impossible
to hack mine's gonna be
PA SS 1 2 3 Wow no one's ever gonna
guess that PA SS 1 2 3 and you can use
the password generator but for the sake
of this tutorial just so you guys
understand where the passwords go in my
files I'm gonna be making it real simple
but typically you want to make one
that's really hard so anyways go ahead
and put a user name in and the password
and hit create user and then it says ok
you created a user called Sally with the
password of pass 1 2 3 now what you want
to do is you also want to go ahead and
throw this into your text file now just
go ahead and put user name Sally
Danielle Sally to be exact and it's
password is passed 1 2 3 now go ahead
and save that see this is why I created
the text file because I would never
remember a complicated password like
this so now that we have a database and
a user you think we're good to go but
we're not not yet what we need to do is
we need to give this user permission to
access to database so you can do this in
different ways but what cPanel does is
it gives you a really easy way to do
this you just go under this add a users
- data page section and choose your user
which is Sally and choose the database
that you want them to access which is
YouTube and you click Add and what this
does is it says okay you're gonna add
Sally and give her permission to use the
database YouTube what privileges do you
want to give her
well whenever you're making a PHP
website you typically want to give them
only limited privileges so in case
someone hacks your you know PHP website
they can't like delete tables or
anything but for the sake of this
tutorial
I'm just gonna give her all privileges
because Sally seems like a nice girl I
trust her so hey all privileges this
mean this user can do anything to this
database and go ahead and hit make
changes and now user sally was added to
the database YouTube now your database
is setup and you can access it through
Sally to pretty much do anything you
could possibly want so for now we got
everything setup that we needed to in
cPanel basically all we did was we
created a database we added a user to it
and gave her all the privileges that she
needs so that's all I have for you guys
for this tutorial and again another
thing
please remember to save all of your
stuff because if you forget it then
you're kind of screwed so anyways thank
you guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I will see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
