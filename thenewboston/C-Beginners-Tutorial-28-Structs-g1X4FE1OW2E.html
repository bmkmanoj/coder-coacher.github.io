tutorial that I'm making for London
Boston and in this tutorial I'm gonna be
showing you how to use struts or
structures so all you're going to need
for this tutorial is a button and now
we're going to create our first struct
so in order to create a stroke you're
first gonna wanna type the keywords
struck just type struct then following
that you just want to give a name for
your to your struggle I'm going to call
it client and you'll see why later and
then after that you just want to put on
two purl raises and now inside of these
curly braces is where we're going to
type all the things that will go inside
of our strap so now I'm going to show
you why you use struck so here we have a
string for a client's name and they have
an integer for clients age well say we
wanted to create another client so we'd
have to copy this and changes like
client one change all this well this
isn't too bad for only having two
clients and only having like a couple
properties for each client like all we
have is age and name we'll say we had
like 40 clients and we had like not only
their name their age being stored but
also their address and their email
address and their phone number stuff
like that so that's pretty impractical
to have check to create a new string for
each person's name and stuff of that so
what we can do is we can create a struck
and inside of our struct since we want
to store the clients name we're going to
create a new public string for the
clients name and then we're going to
create a public integer for their age so
basically what this structure will allow
us to do is will allow us to store their
clients name and age right inside of the
straw so now we can just go back and
delete this here and we can create a new
instance of our clients truck
call it client 1 equal to a new client
now instead of having to do like string
clients name we can do client 1 dot name
and then set that equal to the clients
names Adam then I can do client 1 all
right so now if we wanted to create
another client all we have to do is
create a new client so the client s 2
equals new client client 1 named Joe and
new new plan to a new point to a equals
27 all right so now as you can see this
is a much more organized way to store
your clients information also you can
access it much easier and inside of
structs you can have methods so say we
wanted to create a method so that we
will clear all the clients information
so we'll just make it just this be a
void we'll call it clear client so now
we can just do name equals empty string
age so now now that we have this method
right here if you want to clear the
clients information we don't have to do
like client one dot name equals string
we can just do client 1 dot clear client
info and now we'll just clear out all
the clients information you can also add
properties and indexers to your struck
you can also add events as well but we
haven't learned that yet so you can all
so add a constructor for your struck so
ctor and here we have a constructor but
when you have a constructor if you have
any fields and the field is just
variable if you have any fields right
here then we have to set those equal to
something so name equals otherwise we'll
get an error also when we career struck
it must um pass one at least a parameter
so I'd have to do like string I guess
name then we can do is name equals in
the lower case so there but yeah so you
have to have at least um one parameter
so that will always be a default
parameter or they'll always be a default
constructor where it doesn't set is
equal to anything so now if we did do a
new client and now we can either do the
option of putting note passing no
parameters through and it doesn't do
anything with the variables inside of it
or we can pass a string the name through
and it will automatically create client
for us also client or structs cannot
inherit from classes or another struck
so say we create another struct here
like I don't know my straw we'd get an
error if we tried to inherit from this
struck yeah intellisense automata so
yeah the only thing that I'm struck spin
inherit from is interfaces so if we were
to create a new interface here where we
have I guess what is called us I client
good to just have like public string
name in here
say we had like a whole bunch of
different types of clients like a whole
bunch different clients trucks well then
we could just use this client interface
right here and use live put all the
different properties in there but yeah
we could could use all these properties
from the interface so I think that's
pretty much it on structs so see you
