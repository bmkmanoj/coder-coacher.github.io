solving combined equation equations so
we're gonna take what we learned in our
past two lessons and put them together
to solve for our variable so right here
we have seven times the quantity of X
plus two equals negative 35 so normally
if we were using our order of operations
we would do what's inside the
parenthesis first and then do the
multiplication but because we don't know
what x equals we have to do our ordering
a little differently so what we're gonna
do first is we're going to use a
property called the distributive
property and we're going to take this
seven and multiply it by this X and
molds and also multiply it by this two
so we have 7x plus 14 equals negative 35
and we're allowed to do that because of
this property which which we multiply
the seven by both of these so it would
be the same as if we added them first
and then multiplied so now normally we
would do we would undo division first
but since our whole since our whole
point is to get this variable by itself
we're going to subtract this 14 over
first so we get 7x is equal to negative
49 now finally we can do we can divide
that seven out and we get negative seven
so the whole point is to get X by itself
so we work with the things that are
farthest away from X first if that makes
sense okay so for this one same thing
we're gonna wait to leave this five two
last since it's closest to the X so
we're going to plus three to both sides
we get 5x is equal to 225 now we can
divide by 5 and we get X is equal to 5
ok so the same thing goes right here
normally we do division or
multiplication first but if we were to
undo this division we would have to
multiply every single term by 4 so it's
easier just to collect these like terms
first and then multiply so we're going
to add 6 to both sides and we get
negative or positive 5 is equal to
negative Y over 4 now we're going to
multiply it by the reciprocal and we get
negative y is equal to 20 and then we're
going to divide that negative 1 over we
get Y is equal to negative 20 the same
principle applies over here plus 23 on
both sides so we get 51 is equal to 17 x
over 32 we're going to multiply it by
its reciprocal and these are pretty big
numbers so I'm gonna have to plug these
into a calculator so if you multiply 32
by 51 maybe at 1 6 3 2 and if you
divided by 17 you get X is equal to 96
so we have one less problem we're gonna
do we're gonna take this 4 and subtract
it over 2 x over 5 is equal to negative
16 multiplied by the reciprocal yet X is
equal and here we can reduce by twos so
this becomes 1 this becomes 8 negative 8
times 5 is negative 40 so that's it for
our lesson today but make sure you come
back and watch our next lesson where
we're gonna talk about solving equations
variables on both sides</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
