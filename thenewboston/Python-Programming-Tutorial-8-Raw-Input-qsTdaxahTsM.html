to your eighth place on tutorial and in
this story
I'm going to be teaching you guys the
difference between raw input and regular
input or just input now in the last
couple tutorials or I don't know what
tutorial was but I showed you guys how
you can use input and also raw excuse me
come on keyboard raw input to get
information from the user now I pretty
much just told you guys how did how to
do this but I didn't tell you guys what
the difference was between the two in
well let me do that right now input the
input function right here
it pretty much treats anything in there
as an expression or not a string in rot
and put which I guess you guys can kind
of tell by what I just said
it pretty much takes whatever the user
inputs and treats it as a string and let
me show you guys why this is useful say
you have a variable called book and it's
equal to on the input of let's say enter
name say we have a program that lets the
user enter their name and then prints
out their name print buck
now let me run this save it so whenever
you use input basic input like this it's
going to say enter name Bucky
whoa whoa whoa we're getting to ear
error right here and we're getting this
error because it's trying to print out
something that's not a string that it
can't really print out so to combat this
problem what Python did is made
something called raw input and what this
does is take anything that the user
inputs and changes it to a string and
remember you can't just print out
expressions but you can print out
strings which is this a bunch of
characters so now whenever you run this
module or program let's go ahead and
save this now it says enter name my name
is Bucky BAM so that is how we can use
um the
I input to get information from the user
and convert it to a string so again the
difference between input and raw input
use input whenever you want to work with
expressions like a number would be fine
that you're going to use like in a math
problem but else when you're using a
string you're going to always want to
use write input like whenever you're
outputting a name like this or anything
back to the user so that I know I didn't
tell you guys in last tutorial but that
is a difference between an input and
write input we're going to need to know
this in future tutorials and the future
programs that we're going to build so
pay attention to it learn it play around
with it thank you guys for watching make
sure to subscribe and I will see you
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
