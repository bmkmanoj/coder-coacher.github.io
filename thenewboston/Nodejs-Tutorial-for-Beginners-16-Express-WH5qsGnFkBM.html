video we're gonna be talking to you guys
about Express which is one of the most
popular web frameworks for node however
before we begin I need to tell you a
story
so I was taking a shower this morning
and I got undressed and now standing in
my bathroom my shower was running I was
ready to hop in and right before I did I
was just looking in the mirror and I
noticed this little arm it was like a
white little stringy thing across like
my stomach next to my belly button and
at first I was like freaking out I'm
like is this a some kind of vein or that
doesn't look right
be wrong with me and I started worrying
that something is wrong and then I
realized that I was just eating a piece
of pizza on the computer with my shirt
off about an hour earlier and a piece of
cheese must have fallen down and crusted
to bits so uh yeah some of my health
issues were you know just a piece of
cookie but uh you know let's just get on
with this or oh please do not judge me
we're not here to judge we're here to
learn node and Express all right
what is Express Express is a web
framework what's that mean well we
already know whenever we have a
framework a lot of the functionality
that we need it means someone else has
written it for us so we can use it
pretty awesome also the entire structure
for our projects in other words how we
organize our folders our files
it's all set up for you and Express so
how further ado let's go ahead and learn
how to make one from IntelliJ if you go
to file new project we can do here is
you can choose so you can see all right
in the little section down here it's
note is in NPM and choose node.js
Express app it's our only option and
click Next so from here it's really easy
you just give it a project name I'm
going to name mine I'm gonna name my
Megan why well because Megan is a cute
girl that works at McDonald's and I
always see her but I'm too afraid to ask
her out I don't know why I guarantee she
would say has but this is the most
random tutorial ever all right whatever
name your project whatever you want
where do you want to put it this place
looks good now the one option I do want
you to change is this for the template
engine what this essentially is is
pretty much how you're going to write
your plain HTML templates so Jade is
kind of a weird arm it's not weird it's
actually pretty popular but the one I'm
going to be teaching you guys is ejs
it's really easy to understand it's
pretty much just like HTML um
Jade it kind of looks like Python if
Python and HTML had a baby that would be
J but we're going to go with ejs you
guys are going to see what this is in a
second but click finish
all right just open it in this window
core modules configure it for this
project and boom we are good to go so
what that does is it essentially sets up
your bare-bones project so all the
default basic files and directories that
you need if you expand your project you
can see them right here and I know what
you guys are thinking already ok this is
a lot of crap we were working with like
one file before now I'm going to have to
understand what all of this crap is well
I'm going to give you guys like the
two-second overview right now but first
before I even begin double click
actually expand bin right here and
double click this w wjs file and if you
right click this you can run it right
now and the ports by default I believe
is 3000 so go to localhost 3000 and
check it out so if you see this that
means everything is good if you don't
then make sure that you actually are
running your project and once it's
running verify that everything is set up
correctly we can start figuring out what
all this crap is so let me just clap
some of this so it's a little bit easier
to
along alright so the reason well I guess
I might as well explain like this I'll
just go top-down and explain what all
these files are this one idea this is
just your IntelliJ settings nothing new
don't touch anything in there that's
just for your piece of software your IDE
bin as you can see there's one file in
here and this is the one where we had to
right-click in a run to get our project
up and running and if you guys are like
you know what I thought you said that
fjs was usually the main file like the
main starting point well whenever you're
working with express this www file right
here this is pretty much your startup
script and it has a bunch of core
settings pretty much saying create a
server tell it what port to listen to
and what this file does is it actually
kicks off fjs so again this is your
startup script with some really base
settings but this like I said is really
the core behind your project and we'll
get to that in a second so that's what
bin is now these known modules these are
all of the modules in addition to the
core modules so again any time we use
node we get all of the core modules and
we can see those in the external
libraries now what expressed it is it
downloaded a bunch of additional modules
that we need in addition to the core
modules and if we ever need any more
core modules orcses doing any more
modules other than the core ones then
those are going to go in the node
underscore modules directory as well now
public what this is is essentially files
that the users are going to be able to
access so this is going to be all of
your images your JavaScript your style
sheets all that stuff so anything for
the public not directly related to like
your server files because obviously you
don't want to give you know every user
access to this file so again anything
that the users are going to be able to
access goes in public now routes these
are pretty much the brains behind each
page so by default whenever we just set
it up and made that
a club a template it gave us two pages
by default the index in users and if we
go to users a real quick we can see so
again this is just a really basic demo
page but whatever and obviously those
are the only two pages we have so far so
if you go something like bacon that
doesn't exist it gives us an error open
that back up alright so whenever you're
making a project you're going to have a
bunch of different pages as you guys can
expect each different page typically is
going to have its own route file as you
can see they're pretty simple they're
pretty much saying well explain exactly
what a route is later on pretty much
think of it like the brains behind each
page now the views as you can probably
already expect is the view in other
words the HTML for each page now index
right here you see it has a HTML head
body I'm sure you guys know HTML and
this is what I was trying to explain
whenever I was talking to you guys about
the difference between Jayde and ejs
with ejs we include javascript with
these weird little symbols and I'll
explain in detail what these symbols
mean but with the Jade um it doesn't
look like HTML at all it just looks like
a bunch of words and kind of like Python
but again we don't need to worry about
this just remember that in your each a s
files you pretty much have plain HTML
and anytime you want to include whether
it's just some variables or JavaScript
or anything in addition to HTML you use
these weird symbols and I'm going to be
explaining in detail what they are later
on so again that is the pretty much the
bare basics of it so again this is your
startup script whenever it gets called
it's going to set up your server and
kick off app dot J s and in the next
tutorial I'm going to be explaining all
this code and I know it sounds boring
but trust me it's not as confusing as it
looks there's just a lot of stuff and I
know there are a lot of files but it's
not really confusing at all they're just
you know some things we need to go over
first so if you guys feel overwhelmed
right now
worry I'm gonna explain everything
perfectly maybe I'll tell you another
story about cheese falling is who knows
but for right now think as you're
watching and we get subscribe and I'll
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
