youtube.com slash on live gamer for the
new Boston and this tutorial we're gonna
be talking about the win keyword now the
wind' keyword is similar to the if
statement so what it does is let's say
you want to catch an index out of range
exception only when a certain value has
occurred so let's go ahead and create a
for loop here so for index as integer
equals 0 to 5 what we want to do is add
each one of the items from my array to
the list box and you can see that we
have my array up here which is an
integer array and it's got 5 4 3 2 1 and
this holds 0 1 2 3 4 and once we hit 5
we have an index out of range exception
so we want to catch this index out of
range exception only when a certain
thing has happened
so we'll just type win and now what we
can do is type whatever we want right
here so let's go ahead and to be able to
access index let's declare it outside of
our try try catch statement so dim index
as integer so now what we need to do is
just get rid of this right here
so for index equals 0
okay so now that we have index outside
of our try-catch statement we can run
this index out of right exception when
index is equal to five so if index is
equal to anything other than five and we
get this exception right here it's not
going to run what's right here so let's
go ahead and run this we'll go ahead and
click add all and you can see this it
says do not access memory that isn't
there then it's got I on the finally and
it beeps right there so if we do when
index is equal to six you can see that
if we click at all the program freezes
up and crashes because index is not
equal to six it is equal to five is
equal to five when the error happens and
not equal to six so we can do is if we
really want it to only run when index is
equal to six we can add a catch IX as
exception right here and this will catch
anything that hasn't already been caught
let's say we use the win keyword and
it's not going to catch it we can go
ahead and catch it down here so we'll
just type message box dot show e x dot
message so if we go ahead and run this
if we click at all it says index was
outside the balance of the array and
this is not don't access memory that
that isn't there because index is equal
to five when the exception occurs and
this only runs when index is equal to
six and then we've got I am the finally
now we can add as many win keywords as
we want and you can use them when index
let's say is equal to null so if we just
put win index is equal to no
and let's do
let's do nothing okay so when index is
equal to nothing if a no reference
exception happens then it's going to
show this message box right here so go
ahead practice a bit with the wind'
keyword and once you got that down what
you know they try the catch I'm using
different kinds of exceptions throwing
your own exceptions they using finally
and whatever else once you got that down
go ahead and move on to the next
