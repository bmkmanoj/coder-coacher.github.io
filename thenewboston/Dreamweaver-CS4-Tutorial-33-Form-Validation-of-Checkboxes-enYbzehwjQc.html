to be going over spry validation of
checkboxes first thing we're gonna do is
click on spry validation check box over
here to the left and I'm going to give
it an ID of check box one and a label of
check box one up also and I realized I
should probably name these something
that is relevant to whatever we're going
to be selecting but for this example I'm
just gonna call it this so you guys can
see which check box is which in the code
so there we go it inserted our label and
our input force for one check box and
for this example we're gonna want to
check out more than one check box so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna copy this
label right here and underneath it I am
going to paste it in and I'm doing this
because I'm creating extra check boxes
to go inside of our check box group and
whenever we do that we want to change
the name of our check box to something
unique something different from the one
before and I'm just gonna replace the
number one with the number two and I'm
gonna do the same thing one more time so
we have three different check boxes
inside of our check box group and I'm
going to change the two to a three and
as you can see right here
what this is doing is actually creating
a validation making sure that the user
has selected something on submit so you
can see that this is the message that is
going to be presented to the user if
they have not selected something out of
these three check boxes so I'm gonna go
ahead and run this so we can check it
out
there we go so I'm gonna click Submit
and I expect to get an error there we go
please make a selection so check it and
it allows us to submit let's go back and
look at our options here for this ride
checkbox we have required single we also
have enforced range which enforces
multiple checkboxes to be selected so
you can say that they have to select
either one or two and the max they can
select would be either three or two
depending on what you want so basically
what enforce range means is that they
have to select a certain amount of
checkboxes inside of this spry checkbox
one inside of this band right here they
are gonna have to select multiple if we
set it that way so that is it for this
tutorial in the next tutorial we are
going to be going over a spry select and
make sure that you guys subscribe and
keep checking out these tutorials after
after the next one we are gonna go over
a few more spry validation techniques
and then we're gonna move on to add
everything up in one large forms
tutorial we're going to be creating
actual real useable form using
everything that we've gone over in the
past 15 to 20 tutorials so make sure you
guys keep watching now see you the next
