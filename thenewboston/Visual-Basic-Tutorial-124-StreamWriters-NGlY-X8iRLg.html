youtube.com slash on live gamer for the
new Boston and this tutorial we're going
to be talking about streams now
basically what a stream is is it's the
what you used to exchange data between
files memory or maybe a network so you
can send bytes of data back and forth so
what we're gonna do in this tutorial is
write some types to a text file so we'll
go ahead and click new project we will
select windows forms application and we
will call it streams okay so let's go
ahead and make this resize it a little
bit so we'll add a text box and we will
make it multi-line by clicking the arrow
and selecting multi-line so now we can
drag this out and make it a little bit
bigger let's come up here and add a
button now we'll set the text of this
button to right and we'll set the name
to button right and we'll set the name
of textbox1
to text too right so now let's go ahead
and double-click on right to create an
event handler for that
so we'll just zoom in some here now what
we need to do is create a stream Rider
so we can write to a text file so we'll
come up here and to be able to do that
we need to type in imports system dot IO
and IO stands for input/output so it
will create any new stream writer now so
we'll type private my writer as new
stream writer and for the arguments
we're gonna need a path so I'll just do
it in my G Drive and I'll call the file
my file dot txt
so it's gonna look for this file and if
it doesn't find it then it's just gonna
create it for you so now what we're
gonna do is let's take the text that the
user typed in or whatever they could
click write you know go ahead and write
that to the text file so we will type my
writer dot write line which is similar
to the console apps that we learned
close to the beginning of the series so
we're gonna write line and we're gonna
write whatever is in the text box so
text to write dot txt so it's gonna
write that to the text file now there's
one problem with this if we go ahead and
click right and it'll write that to the
text file if we try to open that text
file you're not gonna see any changes
made to it because in order for the
changes to take place we're gonna have
to close that file so let's move this
button over here a little bit we'll add
another button and we'll set the text to
close file I'll set the name to button
close so whatever they click close file
and they're finished writing we'll just
go ahead and type my writer dot close so
this will close the file and all of our
changes will take effect now we'll go
ahead and open up my G Drive and you can
see that there is no text file in here
right now we'll go ahead and minimize
that now if we run this it creates that
text file so you can see that it created
my file right here and currently it
doesn't have anything in it you can see
that right there so we'll close out of
that will minimize this so that's just
write hello world we can write that to
it and we could also have it clear this
text box every time we click write just
to make it a little bit more
user-friendly then we'll say just on
live gamer we'll write that and you can
see that whenever we write it doesn't
actually save the changes to our text
document so in order to save the changes
we have to click close file now
if we come over here and open up my file
we get looks like we get hello world and
on live camera so we could change this
to say file that would look a little bit
better but that's just something that
you can do so basically we just made a
streamwriter and it access to this file
right here and since it wasn't there it
created it and then we wrote whatever
was in the text box to it and then when
they're done working with it we click
close so that it will say the changes to
that file so go ahead practice with some
stream riders then once you done that go
ahead and move on to the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
