first tutorial in Adobe Premiere Pro I
am very excited about doing stories I've
been waiting to do these for a very long
time but the specs on my computer we're
not up to actually recording at a good
level so actually built a brand new
computer which is awesome and sure to
record this just fine in case you don't
know what adobe premiere pro is it's a
video editing program in it in my
opinion it's one of the best video
editing programs there is out there so
enough of the small talk and let's get
started with this bad boy so as you can
see if you've been paying attention to
my last videos i recently upgraded to
vista from my old XP accidentally had my
old computer center right next here
beside me but for these tutorials i'm
just going to stick with my new computer
since it's a lot better so go ahead and
click and open adobe premiere pro now it
may be under all programs depending on
how often you use it but since i use my
lot it's right in the start menu so go
ahead and click that and it's going to
go ahead and start the load you just
might take a longer but mind pops right
up so and as you can see the first thing
that you always see when opening this
program is it says welcome to adobe
premiere pro and it has all of your
projects what you are going to want to
do is go ahead and click a new project
if you don't already have one but since
i already started 109 in bit myrtle
beach i'm going to go ahead and click
that now if you do click new project
you're going to have a bunch of settings
to choose from just click ok because you
want all over the default settings but
that's in case i mean unless you know
specifically that you want to change
something but ninety-nine percent of the
time you just want to go ahead with the
defaults now once you open it up you
take a look around and it's kind of
overwhelming
there's about eight thousand things and
you have no idea what any of them are so
uh before we start going around
interfacing me showing you what
everything is which I will do I'm just
going to go ahead and show you how to
actually get video on here since a lot
easier to show you than just telling you
so let's work through it instead of me
just uh telling you everything does now
before we even start to think about
getting video on here there are two very
important things actually one important
thing that I'm going to tell you right
now all of the video you work with it
must be saved directly on your computer
you can't hook your camera up to your
computer and start editing video from
there you have to first put the video on
your computer somewhere and save it now
there are two different ways to get
video in Adobe Premiere Pro if it's
already on your computer you can go to
file import and find it somewhere but
the easiest ways probably go to my
computer or desktop and find it from
there but most of the time if we were
like making YouTube videos with your
camcorder here's what you do hook up
your camcorder directly to your computer
using firewire or I Tripoli port and go
up to file actually before you even go
to that make sure your camcorder is
turned on play not the setting you use
when you're recording video but play
like you want to watch it go all the way
to the beginning of your video and just
stop your video now go to file capture
and once you do that these buttons down
here will be lit up in case you don't
know this is the program or the device
that allows Adobe Premiere to capture
video directly from your camcorder to
Adobe Premiere Pro forget about the
middleman yes is actually that easy so
once you have it hooked up all these
buttons are going to be lit up
especially this one record and stop
you're going to want to go ahead and
hit record now if you're thinking all
right do I need to press start on my
camcorder or do i need to stop it when I
stop it no you don't need to do any of
that all you need to do is hit record
right here and it will automatically
start playing on your camcorder yes it's
actually that amazing because technology
nowadays is just awesome so once you hit
record your camcorder will actually
start playing in your video or start
recording on here now once you want to
stop just go ahead and hit stop and
it'll make a clip for you and it'll stop
on your camcorder how awesome is that
now after you're done with that it'll
probably ask you to name your clip so go
ahead and enter a name for your clip the
default name is probably like something
like the date a bunch of numbers a bunch
of stuff you can't even understand but a
name it something memorable like a me
jumping off my house or something you
know something that you would put on
YouTube just to make it easily
understandable now once you're done with
this you don't have to save it or
anything just hit close and as you can
see all of the clips are automatically
imported to your project panel see
working with this is almost too easy to
learn so that's the only problem with it
now as you can see I named mine Myrtle
one two three and four since this whole
uh video was about 20 minutes long I
wanted to split it up so I split mine up
into four different videos that are
about five minutes long so uh actually
before we learn how to put it on the
timeline or anything like this just a
study this tutorial and make sure you
know how to open Adobe Premiere Pro and
try to capture some video or if you
heart already have it on your computer
it's all that much easier so in the next
tutorial probably going to be learning
our way around what all this stuff
actually means and I'm gonna be actually
start making our first movie so I hope
you enjoyed i hope you learned a little
something at least and thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
