73rd Java tutorial and in this tutorial
we're going to be finishing up our
program and actually running it so in
the less store we created a list on the
Left we created the move button and we
added some functionality to it so now we
go ahead and all I think we have to do
is create the list on the right so let's
go ahead and make right list and just go
ahead and like set equal to nu J list
and we don't need any parameters for it
because by default we want nothing in it
so that's why I don't need any
parameters for it right now you can if
you want but I mean it'll be kind useful
and hold on let me itch my ear ahead of
feels good
you're right in there ah disgusting so
now what we need to do is since we have
nothing in our list by default then it's
not even going to appear on the screen
by default since I mean it doesn't have
anything in it so what we need to do is
set a default height and width for it
pretty much so let's go ahead and see
what we put up here for three ok what we
need to do is first take that right list
and to make sure it appears on the
screen by default what we need to do
first is get out of my way
set visible row count and I'm going to
set this equal to three because our
other one is set three and just want
some consistency so next I'm going to
take that right list and we need to set
fixed cell height and width so set fixed
cell let's do with first I mean only
make sense
we'll set a width of like a hundred and
do the same thing for height right list
set fixed
crap my default thing height and we'll
set this equal to like 15 or something
like that
and this should be enough to a holder
values if it's not we'll go back and
tweak a little bit but oh well and the
last thing we have to do aside from this
is take that right list and we need to
set the selection mode like before it so
set selection probably can copy this
from up there but too lazy to set the
selection mode make sure to read get
selection mode and what this is going to
list selection model dot and we're going
to write Wow how can be is that multiple
interval selection so then once I type
write list and type this right what this
is going to do is allow you to select
the multiple items from the right hand
side and I know you guys can't see that
multiple interval selection so just like
that now that we have our right list
made the only thing we need to do is add
it to the screen so let's go ahead and
add new j scroll pane so we want a
scroll ball airing this one to right
list so now we have everything added to
our screen and our program is basically
built right here so let's go ahead and
in our main I already have this stuff
from the last Oriels let's go ahead and
run this and see what we got well I
resize my window a little weird but we
can always change that by setting the
size right here but I'm too lazy for now
so as you can see the title is tighter
title and now unlike before where we can
select single things if I hold down the
shift key on my keyboard
look at this click and now I get a
multiple selection or if I hold down
ctrl on my keyboard I get that selection
where you can select like every other
one or if you want to deselect something
just click it again and now if you move
it you get bacon more bacon or if we
want bacon wings and ham
click bacon hold down shift click him
and move and we get bacon wings in ham
and of course following everything let's
go ahead and just select that move and
now we got everything right there so
that is pretty much the program of using
a multiple interval selection Oryx or in
other words multiple selection lists and
one quick time how this program works
we've pretty much made variables right
here in an array we took that array and
passed the end of left list so left list
will have something to display we set
the visible row count we made it so you
can select multiple things and we also
made a scroll bar on the left list then
we got to the move button we did all
this default stuff when he also did this
cool stuff set list data of the right
list automatically depending on what you
select in the left list that's why
whenever we click move it first looked
what we selected in the left list and
depending on what we selected that's
what to put in the right list so this is
how you do that using setlist data in
the get selected values method we added
that button to the screen and then what
we did is we made a new write list that
was empty by default and since it was
empty by default it wouldn't display if
we didn't give it a height in width and
now we made that list so you could
select multiple things in it even though
you didn't really need to and last but
not least we added the right to the
screen so everything was added to the
screen and it was good to go and it was
good to run so that is our final program
using multiple selection lists I hope
you guys enjoyed it I got the hiccups
now so thank you guys for watching don't
forget subscribe and I will see you next
