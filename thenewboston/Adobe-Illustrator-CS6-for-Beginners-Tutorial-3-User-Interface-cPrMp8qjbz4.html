illustration to toriel my name is buddy
Blackford today we're gonna start
learning about the illustrator interface
and word is it's going to be the pretty
much the first getting started video
that we're going to use so let's go over
the illustrator menu so first of all or
the interface so first of all let's
create a new document go to file and
we'll go to new and then we got our new
document now you can name it whatever
you need to and preferably something
that's recognizable to the project that
you're working on and then we've got a
profile here and pretty much these are a
list of settings for these settings down
here we've got artboards which are the
pretty much the white canvas here that
you're going to be working on and then
you got your with your height and then
we've got some preset sizes and then
we've got some bleed here which I'll go
over all this other stuff later on so
just go ahead and hit OK so we can just
have something up here to look at and
and now you can see what we've got going
on here we've got some guides up here's
more guides and all these guides that
are on here right now are for TV and
I'll go over these at some point in time
and a little more depth so let's go over
the interface up here we've got our
menus and these all display lists of
commands that you can use our second
that we've got down here is the we've
got the application bar and that this
that's these right here and this changes
like the layout and since we don't have
any other like canvases to look at it's
not going to change up but at some point
we'll go over that and this button here
takes you to bridge and that's like a
program that'll be made they it's like
kind of like
the the windows it's kind of like this
if I click on it I'll show you it might
take a second to load up so and it's
basically like a file finder kind of
thing but that's what bridge is and then
you can use that to like import canvases
and things like that we've got our
control panel over here and that
displays the options for the currently
selected tool that's this whole section
here and you see we've got different
things for different tools so if I click
on another tool at our pen tool and
here's the text and you can see more
stuffs popping up so you can see the
different things coming up not every
tool has a bunch of different stuff on
it so we're going to come over here to
the left and this is the tools panel and
it contains drawing and other related
tools and you can use these to
manipulate your graphics and over here
on the right we've got the panels panel
and these are pretty much give you the
tools to modify and check your documents
so things like your appearance your
color your layers and your links so this
is the layers you've got are different
artboards here and then we've got
different things that I'll end up going
over at some point
pretty soon probably this section up
here is called the document window or
window and this is going to contain all
the lists of the open documents so if I
open another one you can see I can move
back and forth between documents here in
the in the middle here this is the
artboard and that's the workspace for
your illustrator designs and then in the
back here is
I'll go to this one here this back this
gray area that's a canvas and that
provides the work area outside of an
artboard so I can go ahead and grab
something and I can move it out and it
still be outside of there it's a helps
to organize things and get them out of
the way if you really need to now what's
new in cs6 is you can change the user
interface brightness up a little bit so
if you don't like the style that you've
got go to edit will go to preferences
and user interface and we've got this
brightness here and we can change it to
whatever we need to whatever you feel is
better on your eyes and whatever you
like more and I went a medium dark to
try to keep it in between to kind of
appeal to everybody but you do it you
put it on whatever you want to it's not
going to affect the way we go through
our tutorials so that's going to be it
for the tutorial about the interface
actually we got down here actually I
forgot to go over we've got this section
here where it tells us what tool we have
selected so right now I have the direct
selection tool if I pick this one we've
got the selection tool and I'll come
down onto here now we've got the
gradient we've got our zoom amount here
fit on screen will pretty much help you
out the most I think and then we've got
here our artboards
and since we only have one only one
shows up and you can use these panels
here to switch between your artboards
and as you can see if you can have more
than one artboard in a document that way
you don't have to have a whole bunch of
documents open you can kind of just go
through each one kind of like my favor
used excel you have different workbooks
and in this one you have different
artboards so now we're done with this
tutorial about the interface and in the
next tutorial we're going to start going
over our
pannels how to show out different panels
and hide them so we can go over these
thing on the right now you know what I'm
talking about when I talk about like
maybe the menu bar or the art board or
the tools panel so it's a good way to
start out and I look forward to seeing
guys in the next tutorial have a good
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
