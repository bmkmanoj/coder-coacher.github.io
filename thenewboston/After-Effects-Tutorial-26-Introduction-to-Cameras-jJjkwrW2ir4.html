your 26th After Effects tutorial and in
this tutorial I'm going to be going over
cameras now what a camera is is pretty
much a different way of viewing your
composition so I'm set just viewing it
straight on me looking directly at it
like a TV you can have your camera move
around and view from all the different
sorts of angles and distances and just
like a regular camera one of the main
things is the closer you are to your
composition the bigger it appears in the
further away you are the smaller it
appears so you'll see why this is useful
in a little bit but before we start
working with the camera I need to show
you guys how to create a camera so how
you do that is go to layer again make a
knot again for some Tunya but make sure
your current time indicator is the home
and just for us home on your keyboard um
if it isn't but anyways just go to layer
new camera to create a camera and press
ok and now you see again I'm working
with two views this is active camera and
this is right at when you look good good
good good
when you do that a camera pops up in
your layer panel and you can edit this
camera in the position of this camera
just like you learned any other layer
but it has a few gotchas so anytime you
want to get to the settings of that
camera go ahead and just double click
this and as you see we now have the
settings of the camera so the first
thing and one of the main things I want
to talk to you guys about is this preset
right here it's a 50 millimeter but go
ahead and click something like a 35
millimeter or actually 80 millimeter
then go ahead and press ok and you see
that the composition increases in size
but let's go ahead and take a look down
at our composition right here and the
size is all the same so what happened if
you can see out here here's my little
camera right here instead of just
increasing the size you just give the
appearance that it increased in size so
let's go ahead and this brings me to the
point that any
time I don't know what it was it before
35 maybe good enough
anytime your camera increases or
decreases in this little preset right
here a decrease means you can see more
of your composition an increase in size
means you can see less of your
composition but that is irrelevant for
now I just wanted to show you guys what
that is so pretty much what you're
seeing isn't it the size of your
composition it's just your perspective
of how big it is based on the angle of
the camera that makes any sense at all
if it doesn't oh well another thing I
want to take note of is aside from when
we started when you start editing angles
and all stuff like that aside from all
these basic what they call preset views
you have your custom camera views too so
ours is the same right now but whenever
you start adding in weird angles you can
also view it from the camp cameras you
made so that's a neat little thing to
take note of if you want to make a
camera just for viewing angles you can
do that as well
so now let's get to something half way
useful in when you're making like
professional film films and stuff a real
camera has different stuff have
different amounts of blur depending on
if it's in focus or not now in After
Effects you don't have to do this and
everything can just be in perfect focus
but if you want to make your animations
look more natural you can do this so go
ahead and click your camera settings
right here and go ahead and press enable
depth of field and what this is gonna do
is allow things that are in focus to be
clear and how to focus to be blurry just
like you would on a real life camcorder
now what this is is the focus distance
right here and when the focus distance
this is pretty much the distance where
an object has to be for it to be in
perfect focus anything that's further
away than 1200 or closer than 1200
pixels it will be blurry so go ahead and
press ok and
in the lock the zoom is just to make
sure this and this are the same value so
if you have this checked and you change
it to nine hundred or something what you
won't see that this is not hundred do
you guys can figure that out I just
thought I'd share with you so go ahead
and press ok after you have enabled
depth of field press again if you don't
have that press everything's gonna be a
perfect focus no matter what you want
and another thing before I show you guys
if if you see that things in your
composition are too blurry then you can
go ahead and subtract a little bit from
this blurry level but this is pretty
much the preset or if you're thinking
alright these things aren't blurry
enough the things that out focus I'm
talking about you can go ahead and
increase that but enough of the small
talk let's get to work
so now we have our camera right here and
we can move it around with the x y&amp;amp;z and
this is our object or composition right
here so whenever let's go ahead and work
with camera settings actually it
probably well that's good for now what
we're gonna be working with is focus
distance parameter right here so again I
told you anything
that's not 1200 pixels as said right
here focus distance is gonna be out of
focus so this is exactly 1200 pixels
away so let me go ahead and move the
focus distance closer say to 900 as you
can see my image becomes a little more
blurry actually I'm just gonna go ahead
and change it to 600 and as you can see
my image it gets really blurry right
here and again if I move this to like
300 it would become incredibly blurry so
that's what this little bar is on your
camera this is the focus distance right
here and as you can see my image is
incredibly blurry right here that's
because this camera is viewing its focus
distance at 300 pixels but this
composition is actually at 1200 pixels
so if you ever have a composition and
you want things to like go from far away
in there blurry and have them Zhu
men and they're clear for a little bit
as they get closer but then they come
out this is how you do that
but for now I'm running out of time in
this tutorial but I just wanted to show
you guys the main thing is double click
this to get your camera settings your
presets enable depth of field allows
things to be blurry and not blurry and
just go ahead and press ok and this
focus distance is the distance your
composition needs to be away or the
layers need to be a way for it to be in
perfect focus so anything that's not 300
pixels is going to be progressively
blurrier and blurrier and in the next
story I'm probably going to show you
guys how to move your camera around or
probably something now it's useful as a
sentence you can guys can probably
figure that out but make sure to check
out my next tutorial play around with
your camera a bit and hopefully you get
good at it before moving on in my next
tutorial so thank you guys for watching
now see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
