show you guys this is a pretty special
game right here that I want to show you
using the Barrett 50 Cal on guess what
scrapyard yes I said scrapyard first of
all first time my dollie not not too
good that's one of that's us yeah yes I
do die a couple of times during this
game but still get a decent amount of
kills there is one thing I actually do
want to show you guys later that what I
do in this game just night-night
so I'm kind of mowing them down in this
little spot right here you can get
snipers but no you're not walking up to
me what do you people not get this
I'm sniping you you don't walk up to a
sniper how do you people not get about
that
like that guy because he's in laughs get
went in the last and luckily for me
right here is when I get my carrier
strikes I think are pretty awesome and
whatever in one of my member one of my
first games I played it on care package
right there guess what happens
it's a deja vu I just don't get it why
do people want to take my care package I
just I just don't get it why I really
don't get it even if it's a president
misaligned I can get you back ill my
might I am finally may I ask why oh and
I just realized my Claymore got a kill
and that's my first stuff I think I got
the fourth angel streak maybe oh maybe
10 like somewhere in between 10 and 15
right there just with a bet 50 Cal on
scrapyards that's that's pretty
impressive I'd probably say I may be a
little cocky but that's still pretty
impressive that should have been a kill
it also should have been a kill
see I guess I you know you're not
jumping you're not gonna jump away from
me cuz im gonna snipe you anyway right
this here I'm looking around there's
predator missle
try not to die from it I'm right here
I'm trying to snipe right just a little
area right here as you can see decent
portion up the back right here and try
to see and people come out right here oh
that wasn't fair anyway back to my
sniping and you can go and die and you
can go and die and I actually see oh why
why are the aa12
yes the age 12 the deadly shotgun ever
made but still why hey I tried over
there and tried to throw a stun grenade
at somebody and of course I died from
the same guy using an 8 a 12 because
he's a fag anyway I go back to this
little spot right here cause I want to
try and snipe some guys like I did
before and I'm going over here and I get
shot by some random guy that I
apparently didn't see so I decided to do
a little sniping up here which is
probably not the best idea but hey I've
been plans not perfect so
and I think I don't think I get actually
to kill for either get it right here
alright get it on my next I'm not sure
yep nope there's my shotgun kill as bad
as 12 awesomeness and I get shot in the
back
I was I just realized something why
would you use and why would you use
lightweight with a blinged-out before
that makes not really much sense
whatsoever yeah whatever
anyway um right here is well actually
what I want to show you guys on nope
come on wait for it wait for it wait for
it wait for it to fall on collateral
damage awesomeness and let's see get
this guy come on oh no he outsmarted me
but then again he using an ACR
so the big difference that I see I keep
going get another and more kills with my
bear to account my awesome third count
and let's see I'm trying back in this
one spot trying as I was before trying
to get some kills it's actually a pretty
good spot if you're trying to snipe get
this guy who was okay I think I get this
guy he was shooting at me get this right
there oh and I actually want to say
something real quick of the bear 50 Cal
I don't know why whenever I get it I
seem to get a lot of headshots like on
my fourth prestige on my real name I'm
like a level about 55 fifth prestige on
my fourth prestige I was about to
actually now there's the game when you
kill or just when there's to get money
killer right there with my awesome bear
tipycal as I was saying before I usually
get a lot of head something the weapon
that's basically all I want to say with
my awesome Barrett 50 Cal and there we
go
26 and 9 scrapyard Barrett 50 Cal file
