85th Jeff tutorial and in this tutorial
I'm going to be teaching you guys about
something called je color chooser now
we're going to be building a program to
make a box pop-up and allow the user to
pick their own colors and we're going to
set this color equal to a variable and
just going to be doing some cool stuff
of it but this is a really useful
application and we're going to be using
this a lot from now on so you know it's
going to be good so what we're going to
have pretty much on the screen as a
button and when they click the button
they're going to be able to choose your
color so let's go ahead and make a
private variable refer J button and now
just name it be for button since I'm
lazy and next we need a color variable
so private color let's just name it
color color variable name the color and
we'll set it equal to the constant way
if I can type takes a little bit I'll
get there eventually so now we have this
color variable set to white and the last
thing we need is pretty much a panel so
private J panel and panel we'll just
name it that for simplicity so we have
three variables so let's start doing
some stuff with it um the first thing
we're going to need to do is build our
constructor so name it public peach or
whatever your class is and it doesn't
take any parameters because this
constructor no parameters now let's go
ahead and add a title and the title I
cannot type today I apologize for that
although I'm not really sorry suckers
and now that we have a title let's go
ahead and make our panel so take that
panel variable you just made and set it
equal to new J panel and again this
doesn't take any parameters either so
now we have a panel on the screen pretty
much well we didn't add it yet but you
know we got it and next on our panel we
want to set the background and this is
pretty much the background of our window
our panel so next we need to set a
background color for it so set back BAM
look at that too easy to have to type
anything next we want to set the back
ground color and we're just going to set
it equal to color and what this means is
we're going to set the background equal
to white since our color had the value
of color dot white so now we pretty much
got a panel chilling on our screen so
now let's go ahead and add our button to
the screen so B equals new J button
doesn't take let's go ahead and for the
text on our button let's just put choose
of color because when they click the
button they're going to need to choose a
color so now we can add some
functionality to do this so B dot add
action listener right there and is our
arguments we're just going to add an
anonymous inner class and let's go ahead
and just put something like new action I
was sure the way they'd have to do this
every time new action listener and again
this action listener must implement the
method action performed and then after
this we'll finally get to the good stuff
so public void action performed we did
this enough hopefully action event event
and now let's get to the meat of this
story finally so whenever we click this
button what do we want to happen well
the first thing we want to do is we want
to change that color variable but
instead of changing it to this just like
a regular constant or something we're
going to let the user decide what they
want to change it to so we need to put
something called J color chooser and
what this allows is the user to choose
your color so just put show dialog right
there
and this dialog takes three parameters
the first parameter is the positioning
just put a null and if you put a null
it's going to appear in the center of
your screen the second parameter is when
you click this button um a new box is
going to pop up so what do you want the
title of that color chooser to be just
pick your color and last the last
parameter is the initial color that's
selected and you'll see it's hard to
explain
because you can't see the box but just
go ahead and put color right here so
whatever the color was set as before
then that's what we want to have so
let's go ahead and change that and let
me move this over just like that and now
we're good to go but the one thing we
have to watch out for is if they don't
choose a color at all so if we give them
an option choose a bunch of colors and
they don't choose anything we're going
to write all right if the color that
they choose is equal to nothing and this
is going to happen if they either hit X
or cancel what do you want to do well we
just want to take that color and set it
equal to whatever color it was before or
let's just go ahead and set it equal to
white so if they don't choose anything
then they got white so that's your fault
if you didn't choose anything you're
getting white and last but not least we
need to change the color of our
background so again the background is
pretty much the panel and set back
around just like that and what do we
want to change it to whatever color they
chose so now outside our action listener
let's go ahead and add everything to
screen panel in I know I guys didn't
teach you guys about border layout but
border layout dot center
this means the panel is going to appear
in some of the center of the screen next
let's add our button and that was named
be in border layout in let's just make
this appear in south this means the
button appears at the bottom of the
screen set see you're getting like
tutorials for one in here set size of
the window that's 425 by 150 and once I
run this program you guys are going to
see what's going on
set set visible and we're just going to
set this to true so it appears now let's
run this so I can actually explain it a
lot better and again don't forget to
call your object and set default close
operation set okay now we have this
program that says title choose a color
again this box is white by default so
now if I go to my code right here
we're going to go ahead and press choose
a color now this is going to pop up so
we go ahead and choose a color like blue
or something and press ok and now our
background has turned blue and if we
click it again choose a color change it
to yellow and click OK now our
background goes to yellow and last but
not least if you choose it and hit
something like X or cancel it's white by
default so let me go ahead and I'll
explain this if I can get my code to set
up right there what this pretty much
means you know what all this means this
is a good stuff we change that color
variable according the whatever they
wanted to change it do and again we use
that using J color chooser show dialog
this is positioning this is the title of
that window right here in again pick
your color see that title pick your
color right there and someone's calling
me I'm not going to answer it and then
this color is when you choose a color
it's what's selected by default so if
you click red ok when you do it again
Pink's going to be or Red's going to be
selected by default and next what this
pretty much does is whenever you pick a
color it's going to store that value in
the return value for color so if you
chose black now this color is going to
be set to the color black and so that's
pretty much what that does J color
chooser so then you test it if they hit
X or cancel pretty much if they didn't
select any color if they didn't give
them white but if they did then we want
to set that background equal to the
color that they chose since that color
variable will now equal whatever value
was returned and then we pretty much
just added the panel in the center of
the screen right here we added the
button to the bottom we made the size of
our window we set as visible so you can
see it and then we called it so that's
your real quick tutorial on how to use J
color chooser in essence whatever you
pick right here is going to be stored in
this very
man that's all you need to know so thank
you guys for watching we're going to be
using this in our couple tutorials from
now on so make sure you learn it and
again one more time thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and I
will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
