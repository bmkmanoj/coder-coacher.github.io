another objective-c tutorial I know it's
been a while but I made this sweet forum
and I've been spending most of my time
on there a ka about 20 hours a day so
you know I decided to take a break from
it for a little bit even though I'm
addicted to now and I thought it was
time for another awesome objective seats
tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
to teach you guys about one of the
biggest features not only with
objective-c but with any object-oriented
programming language and that is
inheritance now inheritance is the first
step from learning about regular boring
program languages to object-oriented
programming languages I know you guys
are excited so let's get started as you
can see we deleted everything from the
auditorium except you know all this
necessary crap that we got to type in
but for now what I want you to do is
forget all this is here I would delete
it but uh then I have to type it in
again and anyways just pay attention to
this well I'm going to teach you guys is
inheritance works pretty much exactly
like inheritance works in your family so
say you have a grandma and then she has
a baby it's your mom and then she has a
kid and that's me now I probably should
have done this with guys that would have
been easier but anyways whenever you
have a baby that baby inherits
everything from you and don't be like
yeah but inherits half the stuff from
the dad you know for the sake of this
tutorial these babies are going to
inherit everything from the parents and
what they inherit is their talents um
their um attributes so for example my
grandma had my mom she inherited her
name and this would be like a variable
your name she inherited the fact that
she's white
that's another variable and she also
inherited the ability to do things like
make bread mow the lawn this would
methods so everything that my grandma
could do my mom can do since she
inherited everything for my grandma
now when mom had baby me I inherited
this stuff as well so I'm white my last
name is Roberts I know how to make bread
and Mogollon this is automatically built
into me so this is how it works any time
you have a child they inherit everything
from you and I know this isn't exactly
how it works in the real world but is
how it works in computer programming
land so what kind of things would this
mean in computer programming for example
if you have this main class that's a
class of everything else will name this
class a these class would have a certain
type of variables then whenever you made
another class class B and you inherited
from class a without even have to create
initialize any variables that would
automatically be inherited from Class A
so let me give you guys an example and
usually my examples are easier to
understand then the programming itself
but I'm going to make this program so
awesome it's going to be really easy to
understand so let's say for the sake of
this tutorial that I never had a grandma
and my grandma was actually named
nsobject
now if we say inari Bucky disco is
confusing already well you know in the
programs before we did these weird
methods the burnout and stuff and they
were called like NS log and we already
had I mean we never program this method
called NS log but for some reason we
were able to use it that's because we
inherited it already so go for example
let's go ahead and build interface
interface my mom's name is Leslie thank
you for letting me use your name for
save this tutorial and the class you
want to inherit from what you do is you
put : and you put NS object now NS
object is a class that's built in
to objective-c as soon as you start
programming that's one of the beauties
about this language it already gives you
a bunch of default on methods to do so
NS object is a class that has the method
most frequently use NS log which pretty
much means we're allowed to print stuff
out this screen so now since Leslie
inherited from nsobject
she now has the method NS log so let's
give her another attribute of herself so
let's give a Leslie my mom a variable
called int a so now not only does Leslie
have all the methods in variables from
NS object which is like my grandma or
her mom it also has this new variable a
what it means it doesn't matter so now
she has a bunch of variables that in
methods that she inherited and also some
cool stuff of her own so in and by the
way I'm just going to put everything in
a one big file for the sake of this
tutorial
it'll make it easier to see so now she
has a variable might as well give her
one method to let's say void and just
name it
meth so my mom does meth yeah go ahead
laugh it up laugh out guys so at end so
here's what's going on so far actually
let me just build the implementation
there we go
implementation of Leslie
void and let's see what is this meth
method gonna do there we go I've been
typing on a Windows keyboard all day and
now I have this little pad with numbers
on it and when I switch over to Mac it
takes me a little while to get warmed up
but anyways so we'll make this really
simple for you guys what's this
where'd this come from oh that's
automatically popped up embarrassing so
now we have the beginning of this Leslie
class with the interface which pretty
much says she has one variable and one
method and the implementation all it
does is take that variable and set it to
50 so now we learn our first little bit
of inheritance that we have this class
named Leslie and it inherits everything
from my grandma and s object which is
her mom and also has a couple stuff of
her own and actually I'm going to save
me for the next tutorial
what's going to happen is now I'm gonna
build my own class and I'm going to
inherit from my mom which is going to
give me not only her variables and
methods but NS objects variables and
methods too so I know you guys don't
understand what's going on yet but in
the next tutorial trust me it's going to
make a whole bunch of sense and by the
end of the next tutorials you are going
to be an inheritance expert so uh
thank you guys for watching and please
check out the next tutorial and by the
way if you haven't been to my forum yet
if you have any questions for me ask me
on my forum I never check my inbox but
I'm on my forum all the time so I'll put
a link below so thank you guys for
watching and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
