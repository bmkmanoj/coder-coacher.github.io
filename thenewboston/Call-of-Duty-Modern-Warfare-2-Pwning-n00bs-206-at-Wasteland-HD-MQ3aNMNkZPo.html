game i joined our goes to the first game
I join you after I got my own 6pm so I'm
sad try it out and I did get a pretty
decent game with it on wasteland okay
before I talk about anything I'm gonna
talk about the my voice manager it is I
gotta say not the best map in this game
like it's not very good for the snipers
it's a Cypress idea it's basically
either camping where physic right now

sniping at ski gloves on him let's hold
on tyrannus it's not much of a battle
and I see people shadow got a shuttle
there hey get shot back with I need only
heard of 10 is a level 7 anyway um I
gotta kill record and then as you can
see everyone again I wasn't just change
but I got like 0 concentrate off how
many I can fool people who know what I'm
talking about um as you can see you in
other games driver chains we were losing
quick like 30 to 50 now we're only
losing a fight on and oh that's before I
ask you it's better sniper here so
beside it sticking out right and wrong
spot and us after this calm such a try
and come to try to get us guys over here
if our system IQ but it makes up on I
can make up for it because my sentry gun
actually we're exactly where I wanted it
doesn't know they can talk over there
and let's see it's two kills for the
sentry gun make sure there's nothing i
was talking about with such a gallon
sucks they can but i keep a second gun
what i mean by that is for such a gun
doesn't officially like soccer the tank
a good but a predator you can use on a
spot like where you are so you'll have
to run to a visit us pacific area that's
just what i was talking about I wasn't
like talking smack about it and it's
harder to tell you the cakes more trying
to use that the ship is basically what
I'm talking around again okay after over
here guys okay well and so I think I guy
from it like twice duty and uh you got
you brother hey where we started this
girls pissing on come on where's the
next one no the game will not end
