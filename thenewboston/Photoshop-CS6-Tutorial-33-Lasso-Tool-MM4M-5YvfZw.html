Photoshop cs6 tutorial
I'm your host body Blackbird and today
we're going to be going over a few more
selection tools and these ones are the
lasso tool political polygonal lasso
tool and magnetic lasso tool and you can
see that their hot key is capital L so
let's get started what these two tools
do are pretty much create selections
along things that you want to cut out or
that you want to or you can switch them
up and cut around them and everything
like that
so I'm gonna duplicate my layer here
that way I don't have to import or mess
up my first layer that I'm working on
what I'm gonna do is use the regular
lasso tool first and pretty much this is
just a free-form
drawing tool that you can use to cut
things out with so if you take a look if
I click and hold down I'm able to draw
from the triangle on the mouse cursor
and I say I want to cut this bike out be
able to draw my own free-formed
mask or selection here and that way I
have the bike cut out and then I can
move it out and then work on it
separately from away from the background
if I wanted to so a couple of tricks
with the lasso tool if you hold down alt
you can see that there becomes a
negative or a minus sign next to the
lasso and that means when you try to
when you go to cut in it's going to cut
away what you are using and this has the
same modes up here as the other
selection tools we've got to subtract
we've got the intersect and we've got
what is this one called again subtract
intersect
add that's what the other one was adding
so and then this one's just normal on
normal selection tool so that's a trick
with the lasso tool I'm going to hit
ctrl D to deselect and that's the hotkey
to deselect or you can come up into
select and go to deselect which is right
here now if I'm dragging now a lasso
going like this and then I hold down alt
and let go you can see that the icon
changes into a polygonal lasso tool and
I still have all held down if I click
here I'm going to be able to make
straight lines now and then when I
finish I just let go of all and then it
will connect everything for me also with
the lasso tool if you draw something
that's incomplete it'll automatically
connect by a straight line the first
point to the last point that you ended
up drawing like that so that's how you
use the lasso tool and it's good for if
you have a really steady hand you can
use it to cut things out with if you
don't then it's good for just creating
like a garbage mask or a garbage crop or
something like that for you to work work
with and you can also get in and
fine-tune some harder to figure out
areas like if you wanted to cut out a
look at the area in between here you
might want to use this lasso tool so
let's get on to the next tool which is
the polygonal lasso tool and basically
it's the same thing as the lasso tool
except for it creates straight lines so
if you hold shift down it'll create a
line that is perpendicular to the line
that you just made and then by coming to
your beginnings point connecting those
two you can see that the icon by my
mouse has a circle and that means it's
ready to be completed so click again and
then I'll complete your selection for
you
so that's how you can make a hard-edged
polygon shapes now let's go to the
magnetic lasso tool and this one's a
pretty sweet tool it pretty much binds
the selection to the contrasting color
that's near where you are putting your
selection so I'm going to click and I'm
going to hold and you can see that the
selection I'm going to stay near my
selections here and you can see that it
pretty much like binds to the handle bar
it'll bind down to this piece of metal
or cable or whatever that was it's
binding to the basket you get a bunch of
points when you're doing it this way but
it's pretty helpful that it does that
this nicely for you so then when you're
done you just connect and you just go to
your first it's basically meant to be go
around the whole entire object and then
come back and connect so that you can
now use this to cut out more or to have
a nice nice exact cut out shape on your
object so that's how you use the
magnetic lasso tool the polygonal and
the regular lasso tool so use those to
your advantage they're pretty nice tools
and thanks for watching this one I'll
see you guys in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
