video and in this video what we're gonna
be doing is we're gonna be working on
some more of the styling I don't even
know if we're gonna be finished with it
but anyways that's what we're gonna be
doing so the first thing I want to do is
I want to style a bunch of headers I'm
gonna go start a header too and then I'm
just gonna work my way down until header
six now each of these headers is gonna
be a little bit different the first one
is kind of like the main header it's
whenever you need a title or description
I want to make it these dark grey
letters because I just think it looks
cool I just think gray with this theme
looks quite beautiful so that's what
this is the main titles and for the font
family wow I really messed that one up
font family most of them are going to be
a Arial I like having the same font
scheme and the font size for these is 14
pixels and the color that dark gray
color is hexadecimal 40 40 40 it's
actually pretty fun to type so that is
header - and now from here on I want to
go to header 3 now let me go ahead and
show you guys header 3 header 3 is
actually the form titles and I'll
actually go ahead and add a comment but
whenever we build our forms let's see
what's a form add item at the top of
these forms you can see a title right
here and that title is white and it also
has a little bit of a shadow I don't
know if you guys can see that through
YouTube but there's a little bit of a
shadow what makes it pop out a little
bit so before I go any further let me go
ahead and add a comment now to add a
comment on in CSS that's how you do it
and I'm just gonna name these dark gray
titles even though gray is spelled
differently depending on where you live
and this is just gonna be form titles
now for those white letters the first
thing I wanted to do is I want to add a
margin bottom so basically I want some
space on the bottom between the title
and where the rest of the form elements
are now if I didn't have an
space between this title and these
elements then these would be pushed
right up against this and it'll look
really weird so that's why you usually
want to put a margin bottom right on
that
so margin bottom is 15 pixels thing that
looks pretty appropriate the font size
for this and actually I'm gonna copy one
possible these are going to be 22 pixels
and a color of white now the last thing
we need is that text shadow so text
shadow and whenever you make a shadow it
needs a couple parameters the first one
is pretty much how far away from the
element do you want the shadow well we
only want one a pixel to the right and a
pixel down so pretty much the first two
parameters are your X&amp;amp;Y coordinates one
pixel one pixel now if this means is
take the shadow move it right one and
down one because remember XY is in the
top left now the next thing is how far
do you want to blur the shadow do you
want it really tight and crisp or do you
want it spread out in a blurry kind of
like you would see in real life well I
think a good blur is three pixels it
pretty much depends on the size of your
element the bigger element the blurrier
the shadow in my opinion and the last
thing is the color not all of the
shadows have to be completely about
black and if they are completely black
they sometimes look a little bit funny
so I'm gonna make mine oh wait oh wait
oh wait which is a shade of gray which I
think works really well for titles now
for heading for moving right along this
is pretty much going to be the whenever
we're looking well I didn't even make
the page yet so I'll explain it later
but anyways for heading 4 we want font
family and a font size of 14 14 and the
last thing we want is a font weight of
normal now you're saying wait a minute
isn't font-weight:normal by default whoa
yes it is in most cases but whenever you
make a heading the browser automatically
makes that heading bold so if you want
it to be normal you need to add this
font weight property in
remember this is only four headings
normal so the last thing I want is a
nice grey color in the shade of this is
sixty sixty sixty and four heading five
what this is going to be is a prompt for
shipping now if I go ahead and look at
my shipping information I got a couple
things here so that's what I'm gonna go
ahead and create in this next two
headers so heading 5 is
text-align:center
which obviously centers a text the font
family is Ariel for the font size let me
just go ahead and make this 14 I think
that's an appropriate size and for the
last thing the color is actually going
to be right here 40 40 40 so I probably
just could it go ahead and grab that
whole thing but I didn't and the last
thing we want is the address for your
shipping info so let me go ahead and
think about this I want a different
color so okay I figured this out so
right now this is pretty much what you
see right here it's centered it's a bold
and it stands out a nice dark grey now
for this address right here what I want
to do is I don't want to make it bold I
pretty much wanted to do the same thing
but not bold and maybe a different shade
of grey so that's what I'm gonna do
right now so the last thing that address
was h6 and I might as well make this h5
what am I gonna call it address prompts
now name 8 h6
address in shipping info you guys know
what it is so for this one let's go
ahead and knock this baby out Tech
Center text-align:center what else Arial
14 normal Arial 14 and
font-weight:normal
because remember you don't forget that
all headers are bolded by default and
for the color I want 60 60 60 how
beautiful so as you can see a lot of
these headers are very similar but they
have a different appearance maybe only
one or two attributes are different and
what this is going to do is it's going
to give you a different flavor so you
aren't looking at the exact same text
across your whole website but if we made
each one of these elements completely
random like one red bold one green
really big in a weird font family then
it wouldn't flow together so that's
typically one of the keys whenever
you're making a website to make a bunch
of different fonts but have them all
related in a sense and that gives your
webpage you know not so consistent of a
feel but makes it artistic and beautiful
so there you go there you have it
in the next tutorial we're gonna be
doing is we're gonna be styling the
tables and links and I'm gonna totally
get well you know what I'm just gonna
quit rambling you'll see in the next
story so thank you for watching I'll see
you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
