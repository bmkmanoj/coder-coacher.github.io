tenth cocos2d tutorial and in this
tutorial we're going to be going over
different ways we can use the actions
that we already learned so the first
thing I'm going to be teaching you guys
how to do is reverse in action so for
example say you build a game on you know
a chess game or something and the user
moves a chess piece well you can have a
button to take back that action and no
matter what they did you can reverse it
in it kind of exactly like you think
reverses action so let's go ahead and
start coding ID just name it the action
and set it equal to you know so you see
the action doesn't matter move by action
with duration just say one or something
and just put position and ccp um 50 by
50 looks good and then let's go ahead
and take this chick and run action the
action hopefully I didn't mess anything
up it's you know I probably should have
had this pre done but let's go ahead and
move this make sure that yep alright so
that's a basic action so now let's go
ahead and reverse this so let's go ahead
and quit and check this out the easiest
thing you will ever learn in your entire
life make a new action called ID just
name it like Rev act for reverse action
and all you have to do is set it to
whatever action you have and just go
ahead and type in reverse just like that
so now when you run this Rev act check
this out build and run save it
whatever action it reverses it does the
opposite of it so you remember before it
went to the top into the right and now
goes to the bottom and to the left so it
pretty much takes whatever action and
reverses it simple enough so now you
know how to reverse actions done that's
in your memory easy as pie so the next
thing I want to tell you is about a
sequence and this is a list of actions
and executed in the order given so in
the last tutorial we put a couple of
actions together and try to run it and
they both kind of happened at once but
what if you actually don't want this to
happen you want to do one thing and then
another thing and then another thing
simple we can do that as well so let's
go ahead and put ad I mean you know I
D&amp;amp;AD same thing what's the difference
right now let's go ahead and type of
action CC move let's put move to why not
and put action with duration position
right there so actually what duration is
2 and 4 position just put CCP I don't
know 100 100 just and your actions don't
have to be the same as mine just go
ahead and make any three actions you
want so I'm going to put first do this
and I'm going to name this one A two and
this one 83 and for this you know don't
make them all the same or it's going to
look weird CC rotate by and I actually
want action with duration angle right
here so I'm going to take this for one
second and then make this you know 360
degrees and for my third action let's
get something a lot different let's do
CC scale by and let's go ahead and get
action with duration scale just so make
this to take two seconds and make it you
know three-point oh its original size so
now that we have three actions what we
can do is this in order to make a
sequence well I'll show you it's
probably easier if I just show you run
action and for the action is this see
c sequence none of the actions and the
actions parameters are what actions you
want to do it's pretty much a list of
stuff you want to do so let's go bit but
a1 a2 a3 and you have to end it with nil
like most things in this program
language so again what this is going to
do is a little bit different than what
we saw last time it's going to run a 1
and then 1 a 1 is completely done it's
going to run a to than a three so check
this out to 12 so it should take a total
of five seconds to get done with
everything so let's go ahead and build
and run this save and run this and see
if I mess up anything it moves and then
it turns and then it scales beautiful so
instead of doing everything at once like
we saw in the last tutorial this is a
way by using a sequence in CC sequence
we can do one after another after
another and now once that's covered i
want to show you guys this the correct
way i mean in the last story i saw a
bunch of different things happen in all
at once but there's a proper way to
actually run multiple actions all once
and that's to use something called spawn
and method for this is CC spawn so let's
go ahead and do this right now um
instead of CC actually all we have to do
is delete this instead of CC sequence
what you do is CC s spawn and I think we
should be good right here so unlike
sequence instead of doing them one after
another after another we can use spawn
and throw our actions in as parameters
of course end up with nil and this is
going to run all our actions at one so
you know this should actually look
pretty interesting sometimes I didn't
mess anything up so spawning does this
you guys are really anxious for me to
press this button actually I don't think
I'm gonna I think I'm going to go grab
beer first I'm your skin I'll press it
so turn move and grow and why did it
look like it was taken all at different
times is because these times are
different so if we change this tattoo
they'll all finish at the same time so
let me go ahead build it around this and
now you see the difference between spawn
and sequence spawn happens all at once
like you know a bunch of eggs spawning I
guess if you're familiar with starcraft
zerg and I anyways there you go just
like that so it's spun moved and grew
all at once so anyways that's that for
that tutorial um I don't have anything
more for you guys that's all I'm going
to cover because you know I don't feel
like teaching anything else in this
story I'm gonna have to make you guys
watch another tutorial so anyways um we
cover reverse action sequence and spawn
once you got this covered you're ready
to move on to next tutorial so thank you
guys for watching don't forget subscribe
and by my apps you know check out my
forum and you know just uh just do a
bunch of stuff for me and I'll keep
making swords for you guys sound like
deal good so thanks for watching then we
can subscribe now see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
