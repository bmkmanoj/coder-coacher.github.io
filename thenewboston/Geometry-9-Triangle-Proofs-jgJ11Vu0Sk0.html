with proofs and expanding what we are
able to prove so our first proof we're
going to do is a triangle inequality
proof so given that the measure of angle
abd abd right here is greater than the
measure of angle DBC so this is greater
than this proved that ad is greater than
B D ok so first we're going to write
down our given information
and then is given to us okay so what
we're trying to do is get this to be
greater than this so you want to think
back a little bit and remember the deal
with triangle inequality if we can prove
that the measure that the measure of the
angle opposite this so this angle right
here is greater than the angle opposite
this then this the first side is greater
than the second side so that's what
we're going to try and do so our next
step we're going to we can say that DBC
so this little the smaller angle right
here is greater than D a B which is
right here or sorry not da yeah DC DBC
is greater than this angle right here
because if you remember that property
that says this angle is equal to the sum
of this angle in this angle well there's
another little theorem that says the
exterior angles are greater than either
remote interior angle which is these
which are these two angles right here so
then we can say look see how this
is greater than this and this is greater
than this well if the measure of angle
abd is greater than the measure of DBC
doesn't that mean it's also greater than
da be because it's greater than D bc
which is greater than da be so we're
going to use our transitive property to
say that the measure of angle abd is
greater than the measure of angle D a B
and all we're doing is we're sliding
this onto the end is greater than that
which is greater than that and that's
transitive property where if a equals B
&amp;amp; B equals C a equals C okay now we have
one last step so remember how I said
that the bigger side is opposite the
bigger angle well since we know that
this angle right here is bigger than da
b that means that the angle the side
opposite b which is a d is greater than
the side opposite a which is DB so
therefore ad is greater than B D if a
triangle in touch to in a triangle if
two angles are not congruent not
congruent then
the bigger side lies across the bigger
angle and we're done you always want
your last statement to match the prove
statement you're given in the problem
okay given B 0 is congruent given bo is
congruent to H n and O H is congruent to
n BN prove that this angle o is
congruent to this angle n okay so we're
going to render give in pairs be hos
congruent to h + + o H congruent to be
and given okay now if we want to be able
to say that this is congruent there's
something we can do if we prove that the
triangles are congruent first we can
then say that their corresponding parts
are congruent so so far we have one
angle or one side is equal to one side
two sides is equal to two sides and then
they share this side right here be h so
we can say that B H is congruent to be H
reflexive property
and then we can say that these triangle
can these triangles are congruent by
side-side-side because we have three
pairs of congruent sides so triangle be
0 H is congruent to triangle h + b by
side-side-side and then we can say that
angle is congruent to angle and because
you remember when we have congruent
triangles their corresponding parts are
also congruent so if two congruent
triangles corresponding parts are also
congruent and that's all we have to do
for that one so that's all we're going
to do with proofs today but um in our
next lesson we're going to do some some
new kind of proofs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
