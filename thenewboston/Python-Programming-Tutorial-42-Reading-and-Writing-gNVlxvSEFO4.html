your 42nd Python tutorial and this story
I'm showing you guys more of reading and
writing the lines in the text file so
you guys already know how to read a
certain way from text values and read
and then something like three or
something that three three bytes and I
also taught you guys how to read the
rest of your file by using read um with
a no parameters taken but let me show
you guys how to read line by line and
this is a little different so let's go
ahead and make a file objects we can do
some stuff to our file and we want to
open it of course so let's see if I can
remember my directory it's in test and
also a text I believe it is and we also
want to read and can't forget our
parentheses right here so that goes
ahead and makes our object file and now
in order to read a line what we need to
do is print this is optional fo B dot
read the line so instead of just read we
want to read one line and once you hit
enter what this does is read a line up
to the first break and this um has about
four lines in it so that's the first
line of my text file hey now brown cow
with brown misspelled but again just
like read uh with no parameters there's
a different way to take read lines in or
excuse me there's different way to read
the lines of the rest of your file and
that's print your file object and read
lines in unlike this one or it's a red
line that reads a single line this one
reads all the other line by line in
aside from this let me show you guys
aside from just reading line from line
and print out like we've done before
what this um function does is it take
lines by line each line and it inserts
it into a list so instead of just
returning the lines line line line
at a time it takes all the lines and
returns them line by line but it does it
as a list so that's a different way
where you can use red line to return a
single line or if you use red lines
plural it returns all the lines but it
does it as a list so this is the first
line this is the second third and fourth
so aside from that let me show you guys
how to write line so let's go ahead and
close this because we're done with it
for now and let's open up a new one
where we can write so file object equals
open and let's go ahead and see if I
remember you're my director again test a
text and instead of reading this time
we're going to want to write this time
so make sure to put the W right there
now we have a file object that can write
now let's go ahead and write new lines
into our file so go ahead and with your
file object go ahead and put the write
command now it only takes one parameter
and that's the right lines now let's go
ahead and put this is a new line and
then put backslash N and whoever you put
this I don't know if I told you guys
before but this inserts a new line so
whenever you write backslash n it knows
to go to the next line so this is a new
line this is line - box - and this is
third line backslash n this is the last
and final line and so once you go ahead
and press Enter you just wrote four
lines of text into your file so let's go
ahead and close that and I'll show you
guys exactly what it did and I just hit
that that doesn't mean anything I just
actually hit that with my finger by
accident so now if we go ahead and look
our file we should have four new lines
that we just wrote so this is line this
is line two
this is third line and this is last and
final line so let's go ahead and close
that and let me show you guys how to do
one more thing now I showed ad has or
how to read one line at a time I showed
you guys how to read all the lines all
the rest of your lines in file return is
a list and I showed you guys how to
overwrite your old file to make a
completely new file with new lines but
another thing I want to show you guys
how to do is how to modify only certain
Alliance in that file if you can
remember that old file said this is new
line this is line two this is third line
this is last and final line four one two
three and four fourth lines but say you
want to only edit one of those lines in
that file let's go ahead and make a file
object actually I'm going to show you
guys how to do this in next tutorial
this one's getting kind of long so in
the next tutorial I'm going to show you
guys how to modify only certain lines
using well I'll show it in the next door
so thank you guys for watching make sure
to subscribe and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
