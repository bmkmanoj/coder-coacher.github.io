After Effects tutorial and this is where
I'm going to be going over some things
that are going to help you a ton when
working with 3d and after effects so go
ahead and make a new composition or drag
something in the composition panel
doesn't really matter and go ahead and
resize it so it's only a portion of your
background and this is going to help you
see what we're about to do another thing
you want to do is go ahead and turn on
your 3d since uh that's what we're going
to be working with now the first thing I
want to talk you guys is about anchor
points and that's this little point
right here with all the arrow sticking
out of it now another kind of name for
anchor point is the pivot point so if
you see if we change the X rotation and
Z rotation this might be a little more
clear then we see that everything is
kind of pivoting around this one point
but sometimes we want to make it where
we don't pivot around the center of
every graphic so in order to change its
anchor point what we need to do is go
ahead and select this little thing or
you can press Y for shortcut and this is
your pain behind tool and this is pretty
much the same thing as your anchor tool
they gave it a new name now when you
have this selected you can move this
entire anchor point and what this does
is give you a new pivot point so now if
you go ahead and move this X rotation or
Z rotation this will be a very clear you
see that instead of pivoting around the
middle it pivots around that one pivot
point and again you can move that around
so you can pivot around the bottom right
instead of the top left and this is how
you pivot around different points and
again that's called the anchor point now
the next thing I want to talk to you
guys about now that you got your pivot
set wherever you want and go ahead and
select your selection tool again I want
to talk to you guys about how to change
um kind of the view so and I'm not
talking about the show either i'm
talking about the perception of your
compass
zishan so go ahead and go up to here and
these are your camera tools track XY and
track Z these are two ones I'm going to
be talking to you guys about today now
go ahead and track XY camera tool and go
ahead and start playing around on this
and as you see it gives the perception
that your composition is moving around
but if you go down here to position when
I'm moving this around position isn't
changing Sara figure like all right
what's going on well what's happening is
not actually the scale or position is
changing but your perception of where
you are your eyes according the thing is
changing or the camera so again if this
might be a lot easier if you see from Z
if you grab the Z it lets you zoom in
because remember the z axis is toward me
and away from me this allows you to zoom
in your composition but not actually
alter your composition it pretty much
just give you a different position or a
different perception I mean um and just
gives you different angles that you can
look at your composition but not alter
your composition if that makes sense so
this um these two camera tools are only
if you want to view your composition in
a different way again this is just view
so none of these properties change only
our perception of how we're looking at
it so just play around to that for a
little bit and trust me if you do for 30
seconds you'll know exactly what I'm
talking about another thing that's going
to give you some on different 3d views
is the shortcuts f10 f11 and f12 now I
can't press them because my camera or my
screen recorder is going to mess up but
if you do you'll see exactly what I'm
talking about now on the last thing I
want to talk to you guys about is
sometimes when you're working with 3d
it's going to be kind of complicated um
when you're only seeing one view at a
time so well after effects did is give
you a way to view multiple views on the
same workspace and this is how they make
like different 3d programs this is what
they usually do so after effects
incorporated this as well
and to do that to get multiple views arm
all at the same time what you need to do
is go down to here and go ahead and
select one of these views probably the
most common is this for views and this
gives you four views at once so go ahead
and select your selection tool or
something and as you see when we move
one of them they all change so these
aren't for different compositions so I
don't think that this is just for
different views in this way arm this
might be a little more clear when you're
using the cameras and stuff like that
but as you can see when you change one
um i'ma grab my camera when you change
one of them then the rest change with it
and I just saw one point out that well
again like I said these aren't for
different compositions it's just for
different views and this will help you a
lot especially when you have pretty
complex 3d compositions and graphics and
stuff like that so this will give you
just a bunch of different perspectives
on how to work with the air composition
so again don't forget the anchor points
how to change your anchor point or pivot
point don't forget that you can change
the camera angle that give you a better
outlook or perception of what you want
to view without actually changing the
composition itself and again if you want
to work with multiple views or go back
to your main view here are your options
down here to give it a more traditional
3d program kind of feel so that's that
for this tutorial I'm not a very
exciting tutorial but these simple tools
and tips will help you a lot when you're
working with 3d and I'm going to be a
going over these later and I don't want
you guys get lost so that's why I had to
tell you so thank you guys for watching
and next door I promised I'd do
something a little more exciting but for
this one just thank you guys for
watching I don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
