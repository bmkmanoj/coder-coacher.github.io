your third UDK tutorial and in this
tutorial I want to talk to you guys a
little bit more about the user interface
specifically these big four boxes that
take up the majority of your screen
these things called viewports now before
I even get started I want to say this if
your screen looks like this right here
then what you need to do is you need to
hit this restore it's basically a
minimize button and what that does is it
takes you to your default four viewport
screen now the four viewport screen is
typically it's basically the way we're
going to be working most of the time
sometimes when we're working with one of
these views we want to maximize them in
order to get you know the nitty-gritty
detail but most of the time we're just
going to be working like this this is
kind of the default view in the UDK so
with that being said let me talk to you
guys about viewports each of these
viewports right here they're basically
just different views different angles
where you can view your model this is
the side view well actually let me go
ahead and build an object real quick I
know you guys don't know how to build
objects but if you want to follow along
go ahead and click this linear linear
staircase button and then go ahead and
hit this CSG ad that's going to give you
a nice little staircase that you built
and again this tutorial isn't about
building objects so I just did that so
we have something nice to look at on the
screen if you didn't follow along with
that don't worry so basically to the
viewports like I said all these
viewports are our different angles in
which we can view a model so this angle
right here is the side view the top left
this angle in the top right is the front
view looking at your model from the from
this view and the bottom right is the
top view it's kind of like the bird's
eye view if you're on top or looking at
it from an airplane and this in the
bottom left is obviously it's called the
perspective view it allows you to change
your camera move it around basically
look at it any way you want it to so as
you can see these viewports are
basically just different views different
angles in which you can look at the same
model
so with that being said I want to say
this I already talked to you guys about
if you know you want to do some nitty
gritty work on this view right here you
can go ahead and maximize it that's one
way where you can change the size of
this window or the view another way is
you can go ahead and hover over it's
basically just like resizing if you're
familiar with resizing windows on
Microsoft Windows go ahead and hover
over any of these viewports and you can
drag it to make it bigger
up and down or hover over in between
here and move it left and right so with
that being said that's how you can
resize your viewports and one other
thing I want to mention when it comes to
viewports is this anytime you let's say
you I don't know something went wrong in
your viewports messed up or maybe you're
working on someone else's computer and
you want to get it back to default
anytime you want to get it back to
default go ahead and hit view viewport
configuration and this will give you all
the configurations where you can
configure your viewport for example if
you want a 1:1 horizontal split some
people might like working like that and
by the way the default is the viewport
configuration - to split this gives you
two viewports on top - on bottom so
that's basically all the main core
aspects of the viewport and the next
tutorial I'm going to be talking you
guys about this thing right here this is
the viewport toolbar now just a little
teaser for next sorrow every viewport
comes with its own viewport toolbar and
this allows you to customize how you can
view and how you can work with the view
inside the viewport so that's where
we're going to be covering in the next
tutorial so now that we know the basics
of the viewport ready move on to that so
thank you guys for watching don't forget
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
