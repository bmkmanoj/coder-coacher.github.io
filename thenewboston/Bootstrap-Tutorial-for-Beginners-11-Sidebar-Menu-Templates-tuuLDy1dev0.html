going to be doing is we're going to be
styling the two different layouts the
one with the menu and the one without
the menu in the right hand side or the
main content takes up the entire site
now I have to admit that I was going to
teach you how to do this in a kind of
like the standard way that everyone uses
whenever they're using bootstrap but in
between the last video that I just
filmed in this one I thought of a new
way to do it and I'm not sure if it's
going to work but we'll see so just to
make it a little bit easier to see
what's going on instead of toggled
because it's like alright is this the
one where the menu showing or is just
the class where the menus hidden I'm
going to change this to menu displayed
so by default the wrapper is just going
to show a blank website with no menu but
then whenever we toggle this class then
the menus going to appear and you can
keep clicking the button to hide it show
it how to show it anyways by default no
menu and then we're going to click it
and this menu displayed is of course
when the menu is displayed I thought it
was a little bit easier to understand so
in here the first thing I wanted to do
is should I add comments or not might as
well all right we're going to style the
sidebar the main menu bar on left now
sidebar wrapper
so the sidebar wrapper is essentially
just the entire sidebar and whenever we
you know actually style what color do we
want the items to be when we hover over
them and all that good stuff then we can
do it with this but remember the sidebar
wrapper is just your entire left menu so
what I'm going to do first time I'm
going to set the z-index to one now
you're going to see what later on oh man
this is not going to work actually I
have faith it will so the position of
this and the position of everything is
going to be absolute what that means is
this
starting point for this menu is the top
left now also the main area whenever we
make that to that starting point is
going to be top left as well so it's
kind of a weird way to position things
both you know kind of overlapping but
I'll show you guys what's going on
hopefully it's pretty cool so by default
remember this isn't going to display so
I'm just going to set the width to zero
now I also want to set the height to
100% because I always want this to take
up the entire height I don't know I
think that's just how like most software
works like this right here so what we're
going to be doing is whenever we toggle
it we're just going to give it a width
of like 250 pixels so essentially it's
going to be like this at first and then
when we toggle it is just going to have
a width so it displays really easy right
hopefully so another thing I wanted to
do is overflow Y which means left and
right whenever you have content in here
that takes up more than the width then
I'm just going to say hidden and that's
because you see all this stuff in here
how it maybe like a 250 pixels wide well
whenever the menu is you know only this
big we don't want the content popping
out on the right-hand side so pretty
much exactly how this little area works
right here if the contents too long then
just cut it off and don't show it all
right why did I have some eye spaces
there all right
so now we can just give it a background
and what my favorite colors is to see
three e-50
I kind of dark a blue and just so this
is actually easy to see for the border
I'm going to give a border of two pixels
solid red so it's going to look really
goofy but I want to show you guys um
clearly how it shrinks and expands and I
think putting a border around it will be
easier to see and just I'll see if my
little trick works I'm going to give it
an opacity so we can kind of see through
this and it's a little bit transparent
so right now what we have is
we have this menu on the left hand side
and by default we gave all the settings
we need to what we set the width to zero
so essentially we have the menu it
exists but the width is like that that's
all we did
simple enough now after this we're going
to just put like the main I don't want
to say the main area like that right
I'll say like the main content so again
this is just the main area on the right
so not the entire thing but the area on
the right now all I'm going to do right
here is I'm going to set this area to
take up the entire screen kind of weird
but maybe it'll work so page content
wrapper
and that's just this right here remember
the right-hand side what I'm going to do
for this is set the width to 100% and
the position:absolute and the padding is
I just said to 15 pixels and that's just
so um the buttons and the headings
aren't butted right up against the top
and I also want to add a border to this
so border I'll say like a 5 pixels solid
green was my other on red all right
green will be good on this one
so right now what's happening is
whenever the user first loads the page
this sidebar on the left hand side it
isn't going to be displaying because it
has a width of 0 so that means that the
main content is going to be taking up
the entire width all right good to go
however whenever the user tries to open
this menu and we give a width since this
is absolute then it's going to look like
this menu is displaying on top of this
and it's going to hide some of the
content and it's going to look really
goofy so to remedy that's what I'm going
to do is this the first thing we need to
do of course is give myself some more
room to work
all right the sidebar to display all
right so now I want to start working on
that dreper what do we call it menu
displayed did we call it menu display on
that menu display class so I'm going to
change the styling of this for whenever
the menu is actually displayed now for
the sidebar wrapper which is the side
menu all we need to do here to display
the menu is we need to give it a width
so right now has a width of 0 and if we
just give it a width of 250 pixels then
it's in the proper location already it
has all the settings and you know
styling that it needs once we have width
is going to display now like I said the
problem with this is it's going to be
overlapping on top of our main content
so to fix that you don't even need these
stupid comments on every single thing I
do so let me wrap her menu displayed and
we want to change something with the
main content now for this all we have to
do is we have to give up padding left so
what this is going to do is even though
the user isn't going to know what's
going on what's going to happen is the
menu the side menu is going to take up
250 pixels on the left and all the
content in here your main area instead
of starting right up against the
left-hand side we're going to say hey
actually start 250 pixels to the left so
we have room for the menu so all we have
to do now is our basic styling so
sidebar styling no bootstrap weird
techniques you know just how do we want
it to look and what are we doing first
so sidebar nav which is our main menu
inside that sidebar and just for
housekeeping I'm going to put the
padding to zero
and I'm going to put the list style to
none since this is an unordered list we
don't want those stupid uh bullet points
or like little diamonds we just want you
know no styling we'll do it ourselves
so so now the actual list items which
are the menu items that you click I'm
going to have a text indent of let's say
like 20 pixels just so it's off the left
hand side a little bit and for the line
height I'll set this to uh 40 pixels and
if you don't do this then they look kind
of jumbled together this will give them
some space so they look like actual
buttons and not just a bunch of text
stacked on top of each other and for the
sidebar nav holy Hot Tamale the links
inside I'll just say display:block
so they stack on top of each other
instead of you know trying to read like
a paragraph and the text decoration
since they are linked we don't want to
underline on them and for the color I'll
just say uh
DDD which is kind of a light gray now
the last thing that I'm going to do is
I'm going to say whenever you hover over
one of these then we want to give it a
background like you're hovering over a
big blocky button so sidebar nav if your
hover over list item will just change
the background - la la la let's say one
six a zero a cool little like turquoise
or something so hopefully if this works
we'll see what's going on so run this
and check it out so like I said by
default this is what we get and this of
course would usually be on the toolbar
but whatever and this main content which
is surrounded with a green border it's
taking up the entire width of the
Paige now I'm going to toggle this
button and check it out so since this is
transparent you can see that this main
content which is surrounded with the
green border it's still taking up 100%
of the site so it's still taking up this
area right here
but what we did is we added a padding on
the left-hand side so the content
doesn't actually start until right
around here where my mouse is now if you
notice this menu that's on the left-hand
side all we're doing here is by default
it has a width of 0 and if I took that
red border away that's the only reason
that you see it right here because I
added a stupid red border but if I took
it away then it would be completely
hidden and whenever I toggle it we're
just giving it a width and whenever you
give it a width then everything displays
perfectly so my little idea actually
worked and just so we can test things
out check that out pretty cool way so
toggle that and all of our content is
looking good and wow this is super this
is super responsive usually things start
messing up right around here but yeah
look at that pretty cool and just saw so
I can demonstrate real quick how much
better this looks if we don't have all
those weird borders and everything let
me refresh it and this would be kind of
a user experience so they they don't
know that uh you know we're tricking
them behind the scenes but look at that
pretty cool functionality got a really
basic menu going on so yeah if you guys
have any other weird techniques then
please let me know but thank you guys
for watching don't forget subscribe and
uh well see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
