tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how you delegates so all
you're getting for this tutorial is a
button and a class and inside of our
class or year we have two methods
they're both Boyd's and they both call
for string parameters so if we wanted to
call both of these methods at the same
time and pass the same parameters
through we would have to create a
delegate and a delicate is basically on
a list of methods that we can then call
all at the same time and pass the same
parameters through so in order to create
a delegate where it's going to play the
keyword delegate and then following that
we're going to want to decide what sort
of return type you want on the methods
inside of our delegate to be so since
these are both voids are here we're
going to type void now following that
we're going to want to give a name to
our delegate I'm some Fault in my
delegate for now and then following that
you're just going to click frontsies and
inside of these parentheses you're going
to want to type the string or the
parameters that you're going to want to
pass through and since these both call
for string parameters we're not to put
string inside here Luca name is jekima
so in order to add methods to our
delegate now they both they have to be
void and to call for a single string
parameter so we had another void show
message down here
that called for an integer instead well
then we wouldn't be able to add this to
our delegate because it calls for an
interviewer and not a string or if the
return type on this was like a string or
something like that then we also could
not add it because it this has to be a
void so now to add methods to our
delegate we're just going to instantiate
our delegate or create a new instance of
it so it's going to do my delegate there
we're in our name our delegate instance
I'm just going to call it empty for my
delegate instead of equal doing
my delegate and then inside of here
we're just gonna want to put on a target
method and as you can see right here it
must be a void and it must call for a
string parameter so we're just gonna
call this or put this show message
inside of here and when we're putting it
in here we do not need to put
parentheses after it because we're not
calling the method we're simply adding
it to the delegate so when we do this it
won't go and do this method right here
it'll just add it to the delegate if we
wanted to add another method to delegate
we do the name of the delegate and then
boss equals and then the delegate name
or the method name we want to add to the
delegate so we're going to want to add
to show another message and again we
don't have to put the string or the
parentheses after it because we're not
calling the method or invoking the
method we're simply adding it to the
delegate list so again when we do this
code right here it won't do the code
inside of these methods are here because
we're not calling these methods we're
just adding them to the delegate now if
you wanted to call these methods or
invoke the methods we would just use em
or this delegate as if it was a method
so we just do em V and then we're going
to pass our string parameter through I'm
going to just have it be Adam so now
when we do this it's going to call all
the methods inside of our delegate since
we have two methods inside of there we
have show message and show another
message it will call both of these
methods and pass the string parameter
through Adam so if we were to go back
out here and create a new instance of
our class and call the show those
message strugglers messages it will do
the code inside of here we'll create a
new delegate with a stroll message
inside of it and it minimal add another
Delly
or another method to it which is show
another message and then it will call
the delegate or call both of these
methods so we should get two message
boxes one it just is Adam and another
one that shows Adam and
has a title of test so that's what will
happen look this button
yep we've got one and two and as you can
see there's tests up there and so
delegates are useful if you want to call
multiple methods and pass the same
parameters through also will be using
delegates a lot more than next tutorial
when we look at events so that's it for
this tutorial so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
