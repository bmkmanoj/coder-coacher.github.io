tutorial for the new boss in again with
me Travis and we're going to do this
tutorials basically set up or Java class
and get everything going and I know it'd
be pretty tedious to do it within the
video because that'd just be a waste of
time and you guys already know how to do
it so basically what I've done is I've
added the source code to my website and
you guys can just copy and paste and
also what I've done is I've changed this
XML so I've added some IDs to each of
these text views edit an ID to the
button and also change to the edit text
I'm sorry and then also I've changed the
text views to some certain text so what
do I want you guys to do first is
created our new class by right-clicking
on a package name and then a new class
you guys have to call this class if you
haven't been following along in previous
examples you want to follow this one
exactly because we're just going to copy
and paste the code so type this one as
email with a capital e hit okay and
we're just going to get this email class
set up real quick
so what we want to do first is my
computer will load here what we're going
to do is open up our menu class and
change the third example 3 to email
again to match your class name
we also need to set up in the manifest I
know I said I want to show you guys that
again but since this is just a tutorial
where I'm going to walk you through the
code that I've already set up might as
well walk you through manifest again so
we're just going to copy and paste this
last activity pulled text play and
change it to email so the an effete or
the manifest realizes our email class
save that and then open up your email
XML
go into the source code and we're just
going to copy and paste so again we're
my website is my bring back comm once
you guys go there go to the tutorial
section and that loads over here on the
left side under the Android there should
be the new Boston Android series click
on that and you guys have the XML and
the Java for this tutorial because again
it's not too important so click the XML
grab that and copy it all and then paste
it into your XML here if you guys get an
error like if you save it after you got
done copy and pasting basically you're
going to get error like this if this
line is not on your first line of code
so make sure there's no spaces above
that first line and then just save it
and I should get rid of that error now
within the within the open up your email
Java class and what we're going to do is
delete the public class here because
that's what I've included you guys want
to keep your package name and then we're
going to go back to where I said the
tutorial section on the website and
click the email Java and again grab
everything that's available here and I
know there's a lot but it's pretty
simple pretty much all stuff we've gone
through already I'm going to walk
through what the code is exactly after
we set this up so then just paste it
there hit save and I'm going to walk you
through what I've setup so basically
what I've set up is all of our edit text
because we had six edit text within our
XML file I just kind of added some
reference to those we also created six
strings basically the string is going to
be getting the text from our edit text
and converting it to a string for the
most part and then it's set to a string
variable and we also label the button
since we have a button within our
application that's going to send an
email so then we go to the oncreate
method it sets the content view to that
XML layout called the email that we set
up and then it initializes the variables
so we created a new method like I showed
you guys in the last tutorial called an
initialized variables set that up and
basically adds reference or a bridge
over to the XML like we always do
that's all that method is going to do
pretty simple and then basically we also
implemented the onclicklistener so
that's going to add the on click method
right here and then so we set our button
up equal to that onclicklistener
that we implemented so what that
onclicklistener is going to do because
now it's going to shoot down to that
onclick listen method
what that's going to do is gonna I also
created this method to basically grab
all the text from the Edit views and
convert it to the string variables we
set up so it's going to do this method
called convert edit text variables into
strings and yes this is a method we
created and so that's going to shoot us
down to this new method right here that
I just created off you know whatever and
again that's going to take your edit
text variables I'm sorry this these are
string variables on the left and then
it's going to take an edit text and then
it's going to get the text and set it to
a string we've done that before
basically all this stuff for the most
part we've done there's not too much new
but just so you guys don't get confused
I'm walking through everything that's
going to do that for all of our string
variables that we want to set up and
basically what this application is going
to do it's going to send a hateful email
because you know if you guys like
sending hateful emails I know on my on
my tutorial series I sometimes get some
some hate mail so if you guys wanna send
me some hate mail here's a pretty good
application that were going to build to
send that so there we go we set up some
string variables basically just
according to our whatever is on the edit
text that coincides with that variable
and then we're going to go back to our
and click method because after that's
done after that method gets called it's
going to read this next method which is
going to be our email address and this
is the string variable that we set up
right here
but we're just we need an email or a
string array I should say for sending
the email or what we're going to build
here so basically that's going to just
create a ray out of a single string for
the most part again you guys should be
kind of familiar with that as well and
then within this on click method it's
also going to create a message so it's
going to say well hello and then it's
going to take the variable which is a
string variable we set up here according
to the edit text and so it's going to
say like hello Travis or whatever that
is and then that's again this is stuff
that we've done before not too not too
difficult but it's just going to say
well hello and text and then say plus
and then a variable plus with in
quotations some more texts plus another
variable string variable that we set up
plus etc and again this is all just
basically one line of code so we have to
finish off our statement right here the
only new thing within this basically
message variable or the string message
that's new is we added this line right
here which will basically you know
that's basically like the return button
when you're typing a message like hey
there and then just hit basically if you
add this line within single quote ations
it's going to start a new line for the
most part so it's going to be like PS
dot I think I love you or whatever so
there we go that's basically a walk
through of what I've done and hopefully
that gets you hopefully that gets you
set up and the only other thing we did
is I added it on pause method as well
that's just going to finish the activity
once this goes on pause so hopefully you
guys kind of understand what this Java
class is I didn't want to type it all
out because I figured there's nothing
new that we've done for the most part
but it's good I mean if you guys want to
create this yourself it'd be a good the
kind of learning thing to do as homework
for the most part if you don't want to
copy and paste and try and set it up
yourself
go ahead that'd be a great activity for
you but I just didn't want to waste time
within the series just setting up a lot
of stuff that we already know how to do
again this still might not be perfectly
clear in your mind so if you guys study
this text as well you'll be able to
break it down for the most part so
that's why I created that for you so
again thanks for watching guys in the
next tutorial we'll actually get into
how to send an email and how to use an
intent to open up the kind of default
email of the person's phone so thanks
again watch for watching I'll catch you
guys in that tutorial have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
