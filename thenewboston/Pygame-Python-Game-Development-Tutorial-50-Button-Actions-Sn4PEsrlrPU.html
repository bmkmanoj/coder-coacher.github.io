slash sin tax here for another bucky in
the new boston tutorial for high game
where we left off we're drawing this
button we've got this nice button
function now and we've got the buttons
showing up there rollover and
interactive and all of that great but
they don't actually do anything so how
might we actually make something happen
well there's a few things that we can do
but what we can do for example is for
event let's go ahead and create event
again you don't have to type this out
just kind of like watch as i do this and
we'll bring this down here and you'll
see that we're not printing event or do
we go to the game loop oh right in the
pause section nice not pause game intro
okay we already have a printed in here
noise let's try that again so there's
our mouse over that and then i'm this
here so there's that and then when we
click you can see that there's act i
can't click in like' this video still
stay up but anyway you have an actual
thing here like this is the click
basically so you've got a mouse motion
that it occurred and you have a click
and what we can do is we can actually
reference all of the mouse buttons well
not all of them like my mouse has a lot
of buttons on them are on it but for the
most part you can reference the mouse
wheel the right and the letter one right
and left buttons on the mouse there
might be a way to reference like more of
the buttons on the mouse but i'm not
really sure
with pygame i only know that you can
reference like the three buttons so for
example let me let's go ahead and
comment out print event and let's go
back up here to our button function and
now let's go ahead and say to toe to
access the mouse buttons what we do is
is go say click equals pi game dot mouse
diet get pressed so this is gonna get
any press
that we do and then I'm gonna go ahead
and just print out click so let's save
and run that and you can see that it's
currently just mad pasting out basically
zero zero zero but as soon as I do any
sort of click like on the screen you'll
see it's printing out one I'm holding
down my click and then my this is my
right and then I'm pressing down the
center and so we've got Center click
left click right click so you can see
how you can like reference all of those
so let's close out of this and a left
click what's the first like this is a
tuple the zeroeth element in this tuple
is the left click so that's what we want
to ask for like is that actually
happening so how might we do that well
we know that we only really care about
the click if it's basically in the
button so if it's within these bounds so
we can actually just use these bounds
and we can say for example here if click
zero so the zeroth element equals 1 what
do we want to do well for now we can
just say free lost my mouse there it is
button clicked and then let's comment
out this print statement here just in
case and let's go ahead and see them on
that and here we are and I bring this
over maybe there we go so we can bring
this like this and so we're hovering and
then we can click on these buttons and
you should see button clicked you know
popping up on the screen and each time
you click on a button so now we've built
some functionality to know when the
button is being clicked and now all we
have to do is add some sort of action to
that button being clicked so for example
here I can just say active color and
then actions
action and then we're just gonna say
action equals none for now and then as
we scroll down to the actual calling of
the buttons we can add in what we can
add in the actions right so to play the
action might be play controls nation
would be controls quit they actually be
quit now we can't just say like for
example play like well let's to quit so
if you pass through quit like this it
just won't work and if you pass through
quit like this it's gonna quit as the
function loads because it loads these
into memory and it's gonna run all these
statements so if you throw a function in
there it's gonna run that function so we
can't do it that way either but I'll
show you how we're gonna get around
doing that but for now that's what we'll
do in the next video so here we just
wrote some logic to basically understand
when we're actually physically clicking
within the button ranges so anyway
that's it for this video stay tuned the
next video and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
