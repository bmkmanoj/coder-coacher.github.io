the dolly camera rig we're gonna delete
this no it changed back to the null name
I don't know why we're gonna create two
new null objects and I'm gonna just
create a new camera so we can start
fresh I'm gonna put the camera below the
nulls and this null is going to be
called crane or you can call it pedestal
it's just the name of the camera move
and this one is going to be called track
make them 3d again and what you want to
do is this is going to simulate a track
like a railroad kind of track on the
ground and it's going to simulate a
dolly camera movement where the camera
is on a tripod on the track moving
towards the moving towards the object or
away from the object or side-to-side if
we need to and then we have this crane
here to simulate elevation in case we
need to move the camera up and down and
it's a lot easier if you have ever seen
like a football game and they have that
that eye in the sky camera where it like
kind of like can move up and down or
forward and backwards without having to
move around you it's kind of like using
that so that's what the this camera is
pretty much like so we're going to put
these nulls on the same exact position
as the camera so let's copy the position
keyframes here and these two keyframes
are already the same as the other no
position keyframe so all we need to do
is the z axis there
and if we look in the custom view here
or the top of you here we can see that
this is the null and then this is the
camera and then there same spot now we
can parent the camera to the crane and
parent the crane to the track so this is
how we should look down here so camera
to Crain and Crain to track now we can
use our null objects here and animate
the position values to get to where we
need to be so let's move our track in
and you can see we've got a tracking
movement going in just like if you would
enemy on the camera except for now we
don't have to worry about motion paths
on the camera
and now we now we can use this crane
here to use the y-axis to use for
elevation so let's do a simple camera
move here we will set this to where we
need it to be so let's put him in the
middle with the crane there and keyframe
it and then I moved the tracking
movements here and it's at that position
and now we'll come in a few keyframes
and zoom in I'll track in actually both
ways and then our crane looks fine we
can move it a little bit if we need to
and there we go I'm Ram previewing that
right now so you can see what's going on
you can see it's a nice smooth animation
usually at the end of your animations
you probably want to make them easy ease
keyframes so it looks more correct
and there you go so that's how you set
up your rigs notice that you use the
crane here for moving up and down and
the track for moving in and out or left
and right kind of like how you would use
these tools here and that way the
keyframes don't get all messed up with
each other and interact in ways that you
don't want them to and you don't have a
bunch of different keyframes so I'm
gonna end the tutorial here for the
camera rigs we learn the orbit camera
rig and a dolly camera rig and you will
want to have two separate rigs if you
need to use both of them in your cameras
when you're when people are filming in a
movie or something like that they're not
going to use both at the same time so
you're gonna often switch camera views
like you're gonna have a cut in between
your scenes so that way it looks
realistic and correct so thank you for
watching this tutorial I hope to see you
on the next tutorial where I'm gonna go
over
tips for animating your camera that I
did not go over and the other tutorials
so thanks for watching see you guys in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
