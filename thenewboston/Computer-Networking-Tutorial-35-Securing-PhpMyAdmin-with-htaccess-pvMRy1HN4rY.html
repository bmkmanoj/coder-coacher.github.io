video I'm going to show you how to
secure PHP myadmin
using HT access so the reason I want to
do this is because if a hacker ever
tries to target your website one of the
most common things they always do is
they go to this URL and they start
trying to guess your PHP my admin
password now if they can guess it then
they have access to your database all
the user data and clearly not a good
thing not something you want to happen
so what we're gonna be doing is we're
gonna be setting up a gateway through HD
access and what this is gonna do is
whenever the user or a hacker tries to
access this page unless they know the
password to get through that gateway
they aren't even going to be able to see
this form right here so they can't even
try to guess your password it's pretty
cool so let's go ahead and get started
so open up putty and what we have to do
first is we have to say hey PHP myadmin
you have to allow HT access the ability
to override the default settings so sudo
nano Apache - Kampf
- enabled and it's PHP myadmin
configuration file conf so hit enter and
alright so right here in this little
directory tag rights under directory
index and next up PHP we're going to add
one simple line and that is let me make
it a little bit cleaner allow override
its override have one art or - I think -
let's hope so so allow override all so
now you're giving PHP myadmin
you're saying okay we allow HT access to
override default settings for your setup
so that's all we have to do like I said
one simple line of code control X Y
enter and boom there we go so in order
for these changes take into effect
sudo service apache2 restarts all right
so we made some changes we said hey PHP
myadmin
allow for us to make this file which
we're gonna make in just a second and we
were started apache so now we have to
actually create that htaccess file to
say this is what we're trying to setup
now for that file you want to created it
sudo nano us our share since it's gonna
be shared among every user phpMyAdmin
dot HT access so this is the file where
we're gonna be writing all of the HT x s
roll x' whatever we want it to do now
I'm just gonna set up really basic
authentication and from a user's point
of view what this means is that whenever
they go to this URL right here instead
of just seeing this login form they're
gonna have a little pop-up that appears
and that's the HT access gateway now
unless we know the password to that then
this isn't going to even show now since
we're gonna be setting up the password
and where the system administrator we
obviously know it so we're gonna hit
enter and then we're gonna have access
to this sounds confusing but it's
actually incredibly easy so that's what
we're gonna be doing that's the real
basics OAuth type basic auth name
restricted files off user file alright
so you know how I said we're essentially
you're gonna have another login before
you can get the PHP myadmin well we need
to set that login information somewhere
the users and their passwords so we're
actually going to be sticking that not
in this file
but another password file so etc' PHP
myadmin
dot h t password but you leave a couple
letters out so the last line you need in
this which is remember the overall rules
is require valid user so now we set the
main rules the only other thing we have
to do is we need to set up our passwords
for that HT access gateway so let me
save this draw X Y enter and we need to
download one more package in order to
use that auth user file directive that
we just wrote because it doesn't come
with a core Apache to package so sudo
apt-get install apache2 - utils
dunt-da-daaaaa there we go let me clear
this and let's go ahead and create that
file now so sudo see
my admin HT password and I'm gonna set
this for Bucky so this again is the
password file for the credentials hit
center and what's the password and
remember this isn't for PHP my admin
login this is for the HT access gateway
that we're gonna see so enter whatever
password you wants and there you go so
now if we go back to our websites check
it out I'm gonna hit refresh instead of
just having access to this main PHP
myadmin form I'm gonna have to type
those credentials that we just set up
now remember right if I still have it
whenever we added this password it was
for the user
Bucky so pop that back up so the
username is Bucky and the password is
whatever password that you used so now
I'm gonna log in do I want to save that
nope and now I have access to phpMyAdmin
which a hacker would not get so now we
can just log in as usual so boom check
it out
so it's essentially just another step
another precaution that you can take to
defend off hackers so there you go now
you understand how to use it why it's
useful and yeah see you guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
