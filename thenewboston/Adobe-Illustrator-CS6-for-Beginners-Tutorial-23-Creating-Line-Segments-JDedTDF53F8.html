Illustrator cs6 tutorial today we're
going to learn about creating line
segments and then if we have more time
we'll learn about creating some other
things but first off we'll stick with
line segments now the line segment tool
is over here on the left and the hotkey
for it is the forward slash and that's
right usually right above your Enter key
and right below the backspace key on the
keyboard so that's the hotkey for it and
the line segment tool is good for
drawing perfectly straight lines and you
can make them in any direction you can
drag your mouse or you can click to
manually input the length and the and
the angle of your lines so an
illustrator you've also got a bunch of
options up here then I'll go over some
of these so we can make our lines
different colors or whatever is going on
so another thing that I wanted to say
before we start is that a line is also
called a stroke and the color of your
stroke here which I have as purple right
now will be the color of your actual
line so if I start drawing this line and
then actually click off it you can see
that it is actually purple so I'm going
to go ahead and delete these lines right
now and we'll start off with something
new now if you want to make a line just
click and drag and you can make it any
line you want it's pretty easy now if
you click and drag and you hold shift
it's gonna make your line straight if
you move around it's going to snap to
the different 45-degree angles so this
right here would be zero and this might
be 45 this is 90 and so on I don't feel
like doing all the math in my head I
can't can't think of it off the top of
my head what the different angles are
but you got that now if we go ahead and
just click we forget our line segment
tool options and you click on the
artboard you can make the length and
I'll just do something like 500 and then
we can make our angle
whatever we want if you if you wanted to
go to the right just type in zero or you
can type in 360 if you wanted to go to
the left type in 180 and up or down is
90 and 270 I think yep 270 so I'll just
hit OK fill line is supposed supposed to
fill the the line with the current fill
color but sometimes it doesn't always
work out that way if I hit OK we can see
that our fill line is actually purple
which is the color of our stroke and
that's the line we just made so that's
super easy you can segment the lines if
you want to if you click right on the
path and just click and then maybe I
want to go 0 and do something like 300
okay now we've got a nice segmented line
there and it lines up perfectly I can
also take it off if I want but if I want
to move it back round it should snap
right to it and then you got some
segmented lines if you're trying to
create some kind of grids or anything
like that or crosshairs whatever you
want to do alright there's a some of
these options that I want to go over so
if you click on your line here now we
have some more options that we can go
over we can change the color that's the
stroke there and now we can see our line
is orange and we can change the size we
can change the stroke weight so if I
make this something like 12 it's gonna
be a fatter line we've got other things
like the type of the profile of the line
so if I click on something like this
it's going to make the line skinny at
the ends and fat in the middle and
there's other things you can mess with
and uniform right here is the regular
line and then we've got our brush
definition now once you add more brushes
you can add things so right now I've
just got charcoal pencil if I click on
that
you can see that now have a charcoal
pencils type of line and once I teach
you how to add more brushes and
everything we can make even more lines
opacity here is going to adjust the
transparency I go to 50% you can see
that the line is now 50% more
transparent than it was before at 100%
it's not going to be transparent at all
so that's pretty much all the stuff I
wanted to show you and that about wraps
it up for this tutorial on creating line
segments and you use these all the time
especially when you're creating
inorganic objects so something like a
VCR or a DVD player or maybe you want to
create a computer monitor or a dresser
drawer you're going to want to use a lot
of straight lines and hard edges so
using the line segment tool is pretty
neat and pretty nice for doing stuff
like that so that's it for the tutorial
I really appreciate that you guys are
watching the videos and go ahead and
give it the like button a hit if you
like these tutorials in Illustrator so I
look forward to seeing you guys on the
next tutorial see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
