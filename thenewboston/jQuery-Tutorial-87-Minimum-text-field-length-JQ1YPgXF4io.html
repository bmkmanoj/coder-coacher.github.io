with a video tutorial for the new Boston
in this video we're going to be taking a
look at creating something like this
where we have a couple maybe three or
four forms obviously depending on how
many you need and we're gonna be
assigning a minimum limit to them now
I've just labeled these five and ten but
obviously these might be something like
username or password or address you know
any any kind of data so when we click on
them you can see that we have this span
that's added to the to the well next to
the text field and what's gonna happen
is as I type something into here when we
reach the five characters required
you'll see it disappears the same with
the ten one but I've set the minimum
length to ten and therefore we have ten
characters required so as I'm typing
something you see that it will disappear
when it gets to the the ten minimum so
we're gonna do this and we're going to
assign this to all text or input fields
with the type text inside of our page so
we can go ahead and do this also some
other functionality you'll notice is
that when I click we I have this message
when I click away and I haven't entered
at least five the message world that
well the message would disappear anyway
but if I was to go ahead and say enter
Alex and click away when I click back
and I still get this five characters
required when I then click away after
I've entered the fire and click back in
we don't get the message reappear so we
don't want it to keep being displayed to
our user if they've already entered five
characters the other thing to note is
that we are using blur so for example
which is not just when we click in it
might be when we say tab up or tab down
to a particular field and we obviously
tab away we use the blur and when we
click in we use the focus event handler
so without further ado let's go ahead
and take a look at the actual code
itself okay so over to index.php in my
text editor which is the file that or
the demonstration you saw on the page
here we're going to be creating the
actual form field elements on this page
and we've obviously gone ahead and
included jQuery as a JavaScript file and
also an
this file EXT which is also in the jas
directory as a javascript file as well
and this just means that we can
obviously make use of jQuery query but
then in ext Doge is we can go ahead and
actually write our jQuery code to avoid
inline scripting we'll keep everything
external in this ext which means
external file so the first thing I'm
gonna go ahead and do is create an area
with my input type or input field with
the type text and we know I'm just gonna
go ahead and give this an act reviewed
min length which is obviously an
attribute that doesn't exist but we're
gonna use our jQuery code to pick up on
this min length attribute so for the
first one I'm going to choose five and
let's just go ahead and just give that a
label five and let's come down and do
another one for this one we'll say ten
and we'll set the input type to text and
the min length to ten okay so now that
we've done this we have something like
this on our page we've got five and ten
we now need to go ahead and start to
write our jQuery code and we need to
assign event handlers to these as we
actually click into them so they come
into focus when we come away from them
ie they're blurred and when we're typing
as well so obviously the key up function
or the key up event handler so inside
exp is the first thing we want to go
ahead and do is use document dot ready
as we would with all of our jQuery code
just to make sure that the Dom is
available and we can start to use start
to a you know apply then handless to
elements and take out tributes from our
elements so the first thing we want to
go ahead and do is actually use a jQuery
selector to select all text fields on
the page so all input fields with the
type text so we do this just using
standard notation for a selector and
inside of here we choose input obviously
this would select all input fields on
the page but what we want to go ahead
and do is in brackets specify type
equals the text and this will select all
input fields with the type text on the
obviously you could go ahead and
individually reference these for example
you could use dot class and if these had
a particular class for example class
equals class obviously class here would
be picked up here but I think it's
important to go ahead and select all of
them and if you don't specify a I've
just removed a bit more than I needed to
if we don't go ahead and specify a
minimum length in our our application or
our input field sorry won't be affected
so the first thing we want to go ahead
and do is apply the event handler focus
to this and inside here we're gonna go
ahead and create a function I'm just
gonna bring that down a bit so on focus
we want something to happen so let's go
ahead and just alert something out just
so we know this is working so working
and this just basically means that when
we click and bring this into focus we
get this message up here same working so
we know that that works and it's gonna
do it a few times because we're still in
focus so we'll just get rid of that okay
so let's go ahead and just get rid of
that and refresh our page okay so now
that we know that the focus event
handler is working what what we want to
do is create sort of like a suit not a
pseudo variable but a sort of variable
called this violet and that's gonna
equal to this and essentially this just
reference is the current element that
we're on and now we can use this
underscore Val to reference the current
text field that we're on that's
essentially what we're doing there we
then we need to pick up the minimum
length attribute so I'm just going to
pull this in here just tab this over so
it looks a bit neater in fact no my text
is not allowing me so I'll just have to
space over okay so what we're gonna be
doing for the min length we're gonna
need to take the attribute that we've
specified here which is called min
length so we need to use the action in
jQuery so I'm just gonna say this
underscore cell remember selecting this
here dot H which to obviously stands for
attribute and then we specify the
attribute name which is meaning length
so now what I'm gonna go ahead and do is
I'm just gonna alert out
min length and we can see that when we
select this we're taking this dot
attribute min length and we're just
alerting it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
