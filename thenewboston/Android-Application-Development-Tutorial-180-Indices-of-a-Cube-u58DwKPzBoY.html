Android tutorial for the new boss in and
will 80
I'm sorry 180 at the Android tutorial
for the new boss and what we're gonna do
is set up our indices so what we need to
do I created this little kind of
reference so we don't get too lost here
but uh here's our square and what we
want to do is we want to create twelve
triangles because each surface like the
front surface of the square we're gonna
split it in half like this so we have a
triangle here and a triangle here I just
showed kind of a reference so as you can
see that's how we're gonna build our
score cube here I keep saying square for
some reason I don't know why but real in
our cube here with all these different
triangles so there's gonna be twelve so
let's just get going here again we have
to remember how we set up our front face
even though we didn't really use it in
the last the last time we build our
triangle I'm gonna show you why we want
this front face just again to save some
save some you know performance here so
we're gonna go clockwise so let's just
get started with our indices I'm gonna
delete these and just kind of create a
new line here and let's just develop
this little chunk here first so again
we're going clockwise so we're gonna
start at point three and four then zero
to create that top triangle so three
four and zero
oops did I do that right what am i what
am i saying all right three four and
then zero that's gonna be our first
triangle again that's going clockwise
that's what we want and then let's
create this reference here so it'll be
zero four and one again that's clockwise
as well so zero four one
and then let's give us some more space
here and develop the last side of that
chunk and that one's gonna be three zero
one again going clockwise
so 3 comma 0 comma 1 and then we're just
gonna go to the next line so we know
that we got that chunk done and again
let's just do this one here so we want
the front again to be clockwise of this
top half so we're just gonna go 3 7 4
and this is what I was talking about
being tedious here I thought we could
use triangle fans that's what I kind of
broke it up like that but Android
doesn't support a function that I
thought they did for OpenGL but anyways
so we have this top surface done and now
we want this back surface so that'll be
seven four six and that's that be
clockwise so the front will be facing
the inside of the triangle so we
actually want to go you know the
opposite direction so it'll be seven six
four and that'd be counterclockwise the
way that we're looking at it but when we
go to the back of the square it will be
you know clockwise so again we want to
go in this direction so seven six four
something like that and then let's you
know give us some more room to create
the side again we just kind of have to
think about which side we want to be the
front or facing the front that we can
actually see so again we're gonna use
these three points and we want to go
clockwise so it will be going in this
direction so it'll be seven three and
then six then we're done with basically
you know these two chunks here and we're
just going to work with this one now so
we're going to say again clockwise three
one two
and for the bottom so for laying on the
ground looking at this we want to go
clockwise again so that will be so I'll
be 1 6 and then 2 and we're almost done
guys don't worry about it and then uh
then we got to also do this surface over
here so we're gonna say so we're gonna
say 6 3 1 and as you notice like it
doesn't exactly matter which order we do
the triangles there's you know different
combinations they'll still be clockwise
for that specific triangle but you know
you want to make sure we're going
clockwise and I'll show you why in a
second and what's our last one we have
to do this one over here so again we're
going to do one for five and that's
clockwise as well
so we've got that surface done and then
we want the bottom so we're gonna go
we're gonna go five six one and if I
messed up on some of these I don't know
if I am or not I'm think they're
clockwise I'm just really tired so I
might be wrong here but I'll show you
that as an air and while we're getting
areas if if I did mess up and then just
our last triangle here finally is the
four five six
and that would be clockwise in this
direction but we want to look at it from
the back view so we're gonna go six five
four all right and we're pretty much
done with our indices as you can see it
was kind of tedious sometimes you just
have to do some boring and boring stuff
but there's our twelve triangles to
develop our cube and I'll wrap this up
in the next tutorial hope you see you
guys then
and have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
