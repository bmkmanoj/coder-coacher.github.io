second Dreamweaver tutorial last time we
talked about the interface in
Dreamweaver found our way around a
little bit
this time we're actually gonna be
creating our very first web page so the
first thing that we always want to do is
go up to file and in new this will open
a new document window and give us a
bunch of options to use when creating
our first website we're gonna always
want to select the blank page and for
the page type we're gonna want to select
HTML now under this layout select the
none we want to be working from scratch
so we want to select none now if you
know what doctype you want to use you
can go ahead and select it here but I'm
gonna be working with xhtml 1.0
transitional so again the settings for
this is blank page HTML and no layout
and 1.0 transitional once we have this
created we can go ahead and click create
and now we have a blank website so the
very first thing we want to do is save
this website so go up the file and go to
save as and you could save it anywhere
you want I'm gonna save mine under my
desktop and I'm gonna call mine web page
now make sure you're saving it as a CM
HTML file and once you haven't named in
selected HTML for the document type
click Save
this will credit created under the
website format now we have a blank
website with nothing on it the very
first thing we wanted to do to any
website is add our title this is located
at the top of the body section next to
the code and design tabs so click your
title bar and you can call it anything
you want I'm gonna call mine my home
page now click out of that
and now we have set the title to our web
page so now I have a web page with the
title on it but nothing else so after
you're done adding a title we want to go
set the basic page properties and this
is located at the bottom under the
properties panel you can click on the
page properties button now if you can't
see the properties panel go up to
windows and your main menu and click
properties and make sure there is a
check next to it this will display the
properties panel so and the properties
panel go ahead and click page properties
and this will give you all the basic
properties that you can apply to your
website things such as your font
appearance your basic color of your text
and your basic background color also if
you have a background image you can
apply it here in either tile from left
to right or up to down
under the link section you can set the
default colors of your active rollover
links and also tell them how often you
want to underline them the heading
section is for formatting your headings
just like you would any other section
title and encoding section as you can
see is another place where you can add
your title or set the doctype on your
document and in the tracing images
section we won't really get into right
now but if you ever need it here's where
it is so after you play around with that
and you adjusted your basic page
properties you can go ahead and click OK
this will set all the properties that
you just fixed now as you can see we are
looking at a blank website and the first
thing that you usually want to add to a
website is a banner now already I
already have one created but if you
don't have one created already there's a
lot of different websites you can go to
on an internet that will create one
automatically for you but to insert it
you need to insert an image and there's
two ways to do that under your common
tab if you have your insert panel open
you can click the little tree now once
you click that a drag down menu will
appear and you can click image or under
your insert tab in your main menu click
insert and drag down to image
now you can select whatever image so
navigate to it and double click it to
open it as you can see this image tag
accessibility attribute pops up and if
you want to skip that just go ahead and
press ok and as you can see your image
is now inserted on your website so now
that we have a banner to our website
click to the right of it and press Enter
and now our cursor has moved under it so
the first thing we're going to add to
our website is a heading do that under
your properties panel where it says
format go ahead and click heading 1 as
you can see our cursor increases in size
and this allows us to create our first
heading so I'm going to write your first
heading
and once you're done with that go ahead
and press ENTER to make a new paragraph
as you can see our format has changed
from heading 1 to paragraph this allows
us to create a new paragraph in our
website so I'm going to go ahead and
type some text in and I'm gonna go ahead
and copy it and paste it and this
represents what paragraph might look
like on a website so now that we have a
sample paragraph a sample heading and a
sample banner we have a simple website
so let's go ahead and save this right
now and now that it's saved we can
preview what it looks like in a browser
so to do this under file click preview
in browser and scroll over to your
browser or if you want you can tap a 12
F 12 is the hotkey to open your browser
and as you can see your default internet
explorer opens or whatever browser
you're using and it shows you what your
website would actually look like if you
posted it on the Internet so now that we
learn how to insert an image a heading
and a basic paragraph and learn how to
make a basic website and also learn how
to preview in a browser next we're going
to be learning how to format text and
format paragraphs and if you're not
already there you can go to my website
the new Boston comm and it will cover
everything that we went over today thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
