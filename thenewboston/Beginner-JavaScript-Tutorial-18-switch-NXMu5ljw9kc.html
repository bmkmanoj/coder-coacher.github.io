tutorial shh shh close your eyes
everyone close your eyes and imagine
that you're making a computer program
and imagine that you're making a
computer program where the user has to
enter a name of a girl like Taylor or
Natalie or Ashley or Rebecca and
depending on what name they answer it
gives them a custom response like who
you love Natalie or Ashley likes you -
or something like that so let's go ahead
and try to make this well the first
thing we need is a variable named we'll
just name it girl and we'll set it equal
to um set it Nataly since natalie
portman is my dream girl and now in
order to make this program you might be
thinking this with the tools we have so
far we'll just go ahead and write if
girl is equal to Natalie and then we can
go ahead and do our thing and then like
later we can write if girl is equal to
Emily if girl is equal to Hannah if girl
is equal to Reese and we can go ahead
and list all the girls that they could
enter and do it that way but a lot of if
statements get kind of messy so there is
an easier way to make kind of this same
program type instead of using a bunch of
if statements you can use a something
called a switch statement a switch
statement takes a one variable which is
the girl in this case and it tests them
for all the possible scenarios and it's
you know it's basically the same as
writing a bunch of statements but it's
just a much more organized way so let's
go ahead and let me show you the syntax
for this is actually switch just like
that and right after you write the name
of the variable you only write the name
of the variable nothing else you don't
set it equal to anything just that now
go ahead and make a body and give you
some space
and now for each case scenario we're
going to call it a case now for the
first case um you give it the value of
what it can be equal to for example in
the case of Natalie and go ahead and add
a colon not semi colon just go ahead and
add a colon and now you write something
like this if girl is equal to Natalie
then go ahead and write whatever you
want to do document right um you must
like Garden State because that's my
favorite movie when Ally Portman believe
it or not and then after every after
you're done executing the code you go
ahead and write the word break and I'll
tell you why later so now we already
have a case scenario for Natalie and
this is basically the syntax of what
we're going to do for all the case
scenarios so let's go ahead and copy
that copy paste in the case of actually
since I like Ashley green to be like ooh
fan of Twilight a with a question mark
and we keep doing that for each girl so
I'm only going to do two girls now but
if you did a hundred a thousand a
million it's going to be the same syntax
you write your switch in the variable
that you want to test and in the body
write case with a colon the code with a
semicolon and break at the end now I
guess I can do this the reason that you
have break is this say you have a list
of like 50 girls well it's going to test
this one and then it's going to test
this one and then it's going to text the
next 48 and test them all until it gets
to the answer well check this out since
our girl is equal to Natalie right now
what break means is this as soon as I
get to this and I find an answer or find
a value that that variable equals then
there's no need to test the rest of
these so I'm just going to break out of
it right now and go to write to the end
so if you have like Natalie Ashley
Britney Emily as soon as it gets to
Natalie's
going to say all right I found my match
I'm going to break if you didn't have
that break it's going to go continue
testing the rest of your stuff and it's
just going to cause a mess why would you
want to make your computer test the rest
of your answers when you already found
your answer it doesn't make sense so
that's what that little break word means
so you're saying all right let's go
ahead and run this by default and see
what we like you must like Garden State
all right so as predicted this program
worked perfectly but what if we have a
name like Emily and we go ahead and save
this and run and see what happens well
nothing runs because we only had a
choice for Natalie and Ashley well there
are a lot of names that people can enter
that probably aren't going to be in this
list and probably you know names that
are one-of-a-kind no one ever heard of
so if you want to give your switch a
default statement that says all right
I'm going to first go through my list of
all my options and if I can't find a
match then I'm just going to give you a
default answer so in order to give a
default answer here's what you do de fa
ult and notice that we don't write
anything in here because there is no
like answer or value for default it's
the default it's basically if you got to
this and it didn't work in this it
didn't work then I'm going to go here
it's default so if all of your pretty
much your cases don't match then this is
what you get so by default just go ahead
and write something like um yeah I'm
definitely copying this
default right something like this is the
default so check it out in another thing
you don't need a break at the end of
your default since it's the last choice
so remember I said a break is pretty
much to save you time saying RA once you
find your answer then just break out of
it and go continue with the next thing
don't go through all the rest of the
cases well you can add a break the end a
default but it would be worthless ence
what if you get to the default you are
ready at the end and you already ran out
of all your cases so what's the break
out of it's not skipping over anything
it's not going to help you any to break
out of it now you're already at the end
so anyways that's why you don't need one
so let's go ahead and test this variable
Emily right now we have the variable
Emily so what's going to happen is this
Java scripts going to say all right does
Emily equal Nathalie nope
does Emily equal Ashley nope so I guess
I'm just going to give you the default
this is your default statement so go
ahead and save this and as you can see
this is default so now let's go ahead
and give it like Ashley just like that
and now go ahead and save it and it's
going to say all right
does Natalie equal Ashley you know does
Ashley equal actually well indeed it
does so I'm going to go ahead and print
out this just like he told me and then
I'm gonna go ahead go go go ahead and
then I'm going to go ahead and break so
no need to even worry about this at all
so let's go ahead and save it and check
it out
ooh fana Twyla day Ashley green not bad
so that's the basics of a switch
statement and how you can use a switch
statement to save you from writing a
whole bunch of ifs and this is actually
a whole lot easier to maintain and you
know you can just look through your code
and you know it's just a whole lot
easier whenever we build programs that
actually do something other than you
know me talking about the girls I have a
crush on that's what it does so anyways
thank you guys for watching don't forget
to subscribe and I'll see in the next
video oh and natalie portman if you're
