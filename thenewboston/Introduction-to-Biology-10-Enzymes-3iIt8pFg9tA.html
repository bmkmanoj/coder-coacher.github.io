sorry it's been a couple of days since I
actually made a video I've been really
busy with school got some food poisoning
a couple of days ago stay away from the
seafood that's all I'm saying but
anyways I'm back now and in this video
aren't going to be talking about enzymes
and biochemical reactions cells are
constantly engaged in chemical activity
and the major difference between living
things and nonliving things is that
living things carry out chemical
activities on a continuous and
controlled basis if this wasn't the case
we would not be alive because most of
the reactions that happen when within a
cell are really freaking slow but living
things have these things called enzymes
and enzymes are biological catalysts a
catalyst is a molecule that can change
the rate of reaction but is not consumed
in the process and catalysts do this by
lowering what is called the energy of
activation in chemical systems the
amount of energy that is available to a
reaction is called the free energy also
known as Delta G which stands for Gibbs
free energy blah blah blah blah normally
you have your reactants are going to be
at higher energy than your products and
things would like to be at lower energy
they like to have as little energy as
possible so during a chemical reaction
you're going to have your reactants
they've got to cross this energy barrier
called the energy of activation but once
they cross this barrier they're going to
be transformed into products and they're
nice and happy normally the energy of
activation without a callus is going to
be pretty large you can see here but the
energy of activation with a catalyst is
much much smaller so it's a lot easier
for reactants to be converted into
products enzymes are normally composed
of one or more polypeptide chains this
means they are normally pretty
however there are some RNA molecules
that act as catalysts anyways the basic
structure of an enzyme is you've got
your binding site you got your enzyme
here you've got the binding site there
and then you got the active site what's
going to happen is you have your
substrate which is your reactant
substrates going to come in and bind at
the in the binding site once the
substrate binds the enzyme is going to
change its configuration it's going to
change its shape the substrate isn't
going to be pushed back into the active
site where it is going to be changed
into the product product is going to be
released and then the enzyme changes
back to its original shape the enzyme
has not been changed at all some enzymes
or some reactions require something that
is called a coenzyme these are also
known as vitamins like vitamin A or
vitamin the year something like that but
that doesn't really matter I don't know
why I mentioned it i'm sorry sometimes
when i don't have enough caffeine attend
to get a little scatterbrained anyways
moving on to the specificity and of
enzymes there are a couple of different
theories on the specificity of enzymes
the first is the lock and key mug this
means there's one enzyme one substrate
it's exactly like a padlock and a key
there's only one key that opens each
padlock the induced fit theory they set
the active site allows for some change
in shape to fit the substrate so say the
substrate has slightly different shape
than what the enzyme is used to use kind
of like a lock pick you can always you
know it takes a minute but you can you
can pick a lock as long as you have
something that looks kind of like the
key that you're using and there are also
a couple of things that affect the
actual enzyme function there is
temperature which is the rate at which
molecule
move kinetic energy is a measure of
kinetic kinetic energy pH is the
concentration of hydrogen ions these two
things when altered can disrupt the
actual shape of the protein protein
folding you got substrate analogs these
are molecules that look really really
really similar to the actual substrate
but may have some different chemical
properties they might bind too tightly
to the active site and will be unable
like the enzyme is actually unable to
release this analog so the enzyme is
enzyme is a rendered useless and you
also have these things called allosteric
effectors these are molecules that bind
somewhere else on the enzyme and change
the shape of the enzyme so you can see
we have our enzyme here so straight here
binding site you've also got this thing
called the allosteric site so you have
this little allosteric effector it can
come in and bind to this allosteric site
and it's going to change the shape of
the enzyme therefore the enzymes not
going to be able to bind this substrate
the enzyme is not going to work
temporarily whenever this allosteric
effector on bonds the enzyme comes back
to its original shape and then it can
bind the substrate but that's all i have
for enzymes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
