the bloody mode tutorials and I'm your
host buddy Blackford we're going to move
on to the contrast group of the blending
modes if you haven't seen the previous
two tutorials which should be blending
modes part one and blending parts but
blending modes part two then I highly
suggest that you watch those first so
we're going into the contrast group like
I said and the contrast group is a
little different it's this group right
here it starts with overlay and adds
what ends with hard mix and the contrast
groups pretty much take both
characteristics of the lighten group and
the darken group and put them together
to work on the layers and this they
pretty much darken the darkest stuff
brighten the brightest and then they
drop the mid-tones which is like gray so
50% gray which is right in between black
and white it's gonna drop that right out
so let's get into the first blending
mode called overlay and overlay is a
really popular blending mode that you
will use a lot it is a combination of
the screen blend mode for the lighter
pixels and the multiply blend mode for
the darker pixels and it applies these
at half the strength that it does when
they're on their own
so it's 50% darken I mean yeah 50%
screen and 50% multiply are is what this
uses now the overlay mode calculates
this based on the layer below which is
different from most other blending modes
so it's calculating the darkness is
based on the layer below that's being
affected that's being added
rather than your active layer that it's
already selected let's head on to soft
light so soft light uses a combination
of the screen blend mode and the
multiply blend mode and it's similar to
overlay but the results are more organic
II and it's softer in every kind of like
transparent almost transparent
highlights and shadows is what's going
on with the soft light now we have a
hard light which is next and hard light
uses a combination of linear dodge and
the linear burn blend modes so linear
dodgers forward the lighter pixels and
linear burn was for the darker pixels
and it uses these at 50% as well it's a
similar to overlay it's pretty much the
opposite over overlay and the fact that
this blending mode hard light uses the
active layer this time though instead of
the layer below which is the opposite
overlay this means that if I switch
these layers then it's going to look
like as if I had overlay on top of like
it's going to look like this so if I
have overlay right now remember how this
looks like right here if I switch these
layers and then set this top one to hard
light or which one they hard light 9h8
change this back to normal it's going it
looks like the overlay again so that's
the difference they're hard light and
overlay are basically just the opposite
I was trying to illustrate that in that
one so let me put these back to normal
and put this one back to hard light
actually the next one we can go to is a
vivid light so vivid light uses a
mixture of the color Dodge
for the light pixels and color burn for
the dark pixels and at 50% for both
again and it's similar to hard hard mix
but it's like what do you how do you
call it it's a exemplified more than
hard mixes let's our hard light more
than hard light is so let's go to the
next one which is linear light so this
linear light is like the vivid light it
uses however it uses the linear dodge
blend mode for the light pick pixels and
the linear burn mode for the darker
pixels so it pretty much does what vivid
light does except for but with using the
linear dodge and the linear burn let's
go to the next one and that is pin light
so pin light is a little different it
uses a combination of the lighten blend
mode and the darken blend mode at 50%
again so if the dark pixels on the
active layer are darker than the dark
pixels on the underlying layer that will
be visible if they aren't they'll drop
away so if the pixels on the active
layer are lighter than the pixels on the
underlying layers that will also be
visible if they aren't they drop away so
it's a cool blending mode that's a
different than most of the other
blending modes are blending modes that
are out there let's go to hard mix next
and you can see that hard mix is a
little crazy and it kind of reminds me
of Andy Warhol photos or Andy Warhol
paintings for some reason so the hard
mix uses a linear linear light blend
mode and it sets a what's called a
threshold so for the each RGB colour
channel pixels and each channel are
converted to either all black or all
white so then Photoshop does
math and applies it to each separate our
GP channel and a composite channel is
created and remember the channels of
your layers are here these are the
channels so a composite layer is created
and that composite layer has up to eight
colors in it you got red green blue cyan
magenta yellow black and white so it's a
it's a kind of a wild blending mode one
of the coolest things about this
blending mode though is that if you
adjust the fill over here and you you
lower it more colors are going to start
showing up as you can see here and then
you can create different kinds of looks
using this fill this fill slider here so
that's what's really awesome about hard
mix it's kind of them you can kind of
almost create like every one of the
blending modes using it almost you can
almost do it but it's not quite so it's
a really cool blending mode so I'm gonna
stop there for that and that was called
the contrast blending mode group and on
the next one we'll go over the other
blending modes here these two bottom
ones down here so let's stop now and I
thank you for watching this tutorial and
I see you on I'll see you in the
blending mode number four tutorial
thanks a lot for watching goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
