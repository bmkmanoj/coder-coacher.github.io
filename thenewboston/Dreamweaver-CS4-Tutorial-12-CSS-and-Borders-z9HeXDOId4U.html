formatting text with CSS in this
tutorial we are going to take a look at
the border property what we want to do
is put a border around a paragraph so
here we have three paragraphs and let's
put a border around the middle one so
since that has the p2 text class we're
going to go over here and double click
on that and inside our CSS style panel
and click on the border and we have the
options of style width and color so we
are going to leave these same for all
checked because we're just going to put
a box basically around the p2 text
paragraph you click on top here you have
some options you have solid which we're
going to use and a weekend you can check
this one's out if you want but I usually
just like to use solid I'm going to make
it small it's not going to be so I'm
going to be very thick it's just going
to be 1 pixel and let's make it it's
like a black
just apply and you can see that we now
have some text that is outlined in black
so let's take a look here yes and there
we go you can also some kind of weird
sure what's going on there but we can
also do a few other things with the
border as you see we have a box around
the whole second paragraph we can also
just add a line a border to the left
right top or bottom it's as easy as
double clicking on the p3 text class and
your CSS style panel and you click on
border and you uncheck the same for all
and that way you have a choice you have
top right bottom and left for this
tutorial let's choose solid in the
bottom row and I'll check that there and
we'll say set 25 pixels and make it
black let's apply that and you can see
that it applied a thicker border to the
bottom of our p3 text class which supply
to this paragraph the third paragraph we
are also going to add a border to the
right and the left
wait dotted so you can see what that
looks like for this will give it a
clutter black for the right we'll give
it a color black also and let's make
this the same we'll look at five pixels
go ahead and click apply now you can see
that border on the left is dotted and on
the right it's solid see what it looks
like when i stashed so you can see the
different the difference here and the
dotted in the dash tonight I personally
think this all it looks best whenever
you're outlining things so see that um
that is it for the border tutorial in
the next tutorial we will be going over
positioning so stay tuned and subscribe
