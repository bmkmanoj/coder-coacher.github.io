tutorial but I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm gonna be
showing you how to use the date-time
struck so all you're gonna need for this
tutorial is a button so once you have
that on your forum just go ahead and
double click on it
so the date-time struct is inside the
system namespace so you should already
have that up there so now we can just
type out with the date time I'll just
call it DT and we're just going to study
equal to new date time and there are
many different things you can pass
through the constructor for example if
we wanted to pass through a year a month
and a day so it'll create a year or a
pre a date time property out of what we
passed through here which will be the
year the month and the day so wills
passed through I guess my birthday which
is 1995 a month which is 10 or October
and the day which is 16 and now we're
just going to display this date time in
a message box or just a message box that
show and then I'll do dates time or DT
which is our variable names the date
time and then we use the two string
method to convert into a string so we
can display it in a message box so now
we should just get 10/16 slash 1995 yep
and you get a default time here and the
default time is midnight and we can
change that so if we wanted to also pass
through the hour and stuff we could do
that as well you mean do the hour the
minute and the second so for the hour
all this works 3:00 3:00 a.m. the minute
will be 32 and the second will be 52 so
now we should get a message box saying
10/16 slash 1995 and then 3:00 in the
morning
32 minutes and 52 seconds yep and when
in store when passing through time right
here this will be in military
so if you wanted to make it like 1:00 in
the afternoon
you'd have to put 13 are here so now it
would be 1 p.m. you have 1 p.m. you can
also set the date time equal to the day
or what the current day is so if you
miss group date time dot today and we
should get the date in the message box
yep however we don't get the time so we
wanted to get the time we can do date
time dot now and that will return the
time as well yep there are many useful
methods inside of a date time struck
such as getting is leap year and this is
just a method that will return a bool
indicating whether a year is a leap year
so right there so if we just want to
check to see if 2011 is a leap here
let's get a message box saying yes or no
well I guess we'll have it safe or
falses same thing so now I'm pretty sure
2011 is not a leap year show so we
should get false yep and I think 2012 is
I'll put 2012 here we should get true
what's that holding yeah 2012 is Olivia
you can also get how many days are in a
specific month so we can get days in
month you let's put a year right here
I'll put 2011 I guess and the month say
I think it's yeah July so 7
to string because it returns an integer
so I think we're gonna get 31 but I
could be wrong
yeah 31 days are in July you could
change this to like February to think
we'll get 28 the upper 28 because 2011
is not a leap year and the last thing
I'm going to show you is if you were to
store your date and time in something
such as using hxd like if we were to
store it using bytes then what you're
gonna have to do is you're gonna have to
do something called file time and so if
we're to just do stage time now and then
you can do dot two and then file time
and this will return it will convert it
into a long so we can then write that
long inside of our a year so if we
wanted to store it inside of there using
bytes and now we'll just display this in
a message box so you can see that it
converts it into lights all right so now
we should just get bytes and message box
yep all right and the last thing I'm not
show you just have to get a date and
time from a file time or from a long so
what you do is you just do the dates
times that equals 8 eg would be like
takes time dot from file time and then
you just put your long and here the read
from the file and I don't know like a
file time off from at the top of my head
so it's not gonna write one in there but
that is how you would do it so that's
pretty much it for this tutorial on
using the date time struck so see you
