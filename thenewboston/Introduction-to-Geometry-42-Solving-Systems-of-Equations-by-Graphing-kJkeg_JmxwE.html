of equations now don't worry a system of
equations just means that you have more
than one equation so you can a system
can be two or three or even four it's
usually just too though so we're going
to solve it by graphing so give into
equations graph to find the intersection
and then the intersection is your
solution to your equations I have these
two equations y equals x plus 2 and y
equals negative 2x plus 1 so
so I'm good at first I'm going to plot
the intercept of this one so positive
two right there and then I'm going to
use my slope to find my line let me go
up one everyone up one everyone down 1
over 1 down 1 over 1 down 1 over 1 and I
think that gives you a pretty good idea
of your line so then we're going to draw
our line and there's our line so now we
have the equation y equals negative 2x
plus 1 so we're going to start with our
intercept and I'm going to graph this in
a different color so we can see the
difference so we're going to start with
our intercept of 1 and go up to over 1
up to over one down to over one down to
over 1 and we're gonna
and you'll see that that is
approximately negative 11 like I said it
will be easier to see on graph paper
where you have exact um scales and
everything so our solution for this
point is negative 11 so now we're going
to talk about another way to solve
systems of equations we're going to do
it by method called substitution and
when you substitute a variable what you
do is you want one of the equations to
be written as either as either y equals
or x equals and then you're going to
substitute that equation into the other
equation so this one's they're both
already solved for y but i'm going to
substitute this one into this equation
so if i substitute x plus 1 for y into
this equation i'm going to get x plus 1
is equal to 3x minus 3 if i bring the x
over i get one equals two x minus three
x add the 3 over i get two weeks x
equals 4 and x equals 2 but you have to
make sure that you keep going until you
get an ordered pair so now we have to
plug this x value into either one of
these equations it really doesn't matter
but I'm going to do this one just
because it's easier to find what y
equals so y is equal to x plus one so y
is equal to 3 so our solution for the
system equation of equations is 23
so we're going to do another
substitution problem that's a little
different so these two are in standard
form so in order to do substitution we
need to solve one of these equations for
a variable so I'm just going to pick
this one no reason you can do it for
either one it doesn't matter and I'm
going to solve for y so if I'm going to
solve for y I want to get Y by itself so
to do that I'm going to subtract the 2x
over to the other side so I'm going to
get negative 3y equals negative 13 minus
2x now i'm going to divide everything by
negative 3 and i'm going to get y is
equal to 13 thirds plus 2x over 3 and
these chains signs because when you have
a negative divided by a negative the
whole thing's becomes positive so both
of these become positive so now that I
have this solved for a variable i'm
going to plug this into this equation
for y so i'm going to have 2x + 5 13
plus 3 it should be an x-direction 13
plus 3 plus 2x over 3 equals 27 so i'm
gonna distribute this 5 and i'm going to
get so if i multiply 13 times silently
at 65 over 3 plus 5 times 2 is 10 x
divided by 3 equals 27 so i'm going to
collect like terms which means that i'm
going to add this to this and this to
this
and
and then I'm going to get okay so in
order to do this I need to get a common
denominator for all of them so I'm going
to make them all have a common
denominator of three so if i make them
all over three i have to multiply 2 53
so i get 6x plus this is already over 3
this is already over three and twenty
seven times three is 81 so now i'm going
to combine my like terms and so i'm
going to add my 6 x over 3 plus 10 x
over 3 and get 16 x over 3 and i'm going
to subtract this side over so 81 minus
60 gives me 16 / 3 if i multiply both
sides by 3 to solve for x i'm going to
get 16 x equals 16 get x equals 1 so
we're going to plug one back into one of
these equations and to solve for y so
i'm going to plug one into the equation
that's already solved for y so y is
equal to 13 over 3 plus 2 times 1 over 3
so y is equal to 13 over 3 plus 2 over 3
which gives me 15 / 3 or 5 so our
solution for this problem is 15 so
that's all we're going to do for today
but make sure you come back and watch
next lesson where we're going to talk
about two other ways to solve systems of
equations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
