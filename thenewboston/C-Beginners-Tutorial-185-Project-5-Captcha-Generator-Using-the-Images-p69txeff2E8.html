c-sharp tutorial that I'm making for the
New Boston and in this tutorial
basically what we're going to be doing
is building a real quick simple
application that's just going to be
using the CAPTCHAs that we generated
using the program that we created in the
last few tutorials so basically a user
is just going to open up a CAPTCHA image
and then the image will be displayed
inside it's a texture box right here
then the user will ought to enter the
text that's in the CAPTCHA image then
when they click the submit button
they're just going to check to see if
the text that they entered is the actual
text inside of the image alright so
we're just going to want to double click
on this open button right here and then
the users can have to open caption image
so we're going to file dialog show and
we're going to make sure that the user
actually does open and if they actually
do open a caption image we're just going
to have extra box ones image be the
image that the user opens in the Open
File dialog so the image location of the
picture box will be the path to the
image that the user opens so just
alright so then the image that the user
opens should be displayed in this
picture box then when user clicks on the
submit button we're just going to want
to make sure that on the text that they
enter the actual text inside the image
but before we do that we have to have
something to compare it to and remember
when we generated the CAPTCHAs we make
the name of the actual image the md5 of
the Texas in the image so we're going to
want to retrieve the name of that image
so we're just going to have to be using
this system dot IO namespace so that we
have access to the path class so we're
going to say all right here string and
name nothing and then I'm just a md5
hash named hold basically just the name
of the file without the extension
so we can use that method right here and
the path to a file will be the file that
these are open to the open file dialog
so this text right here should basically
just get the md5 of the text inside of
that image all right and then we're just
going to want to compare that to the md5
of the text that the user enters so
we're going to say md5 crypto sort of
provider right here and service provider
and then we're just going to want to
compare this string to the md5 with the
string that the user enters in this text
box so we're going to say I'm string
I'll call block equals MV v dot cash and
remember we're gonna have to convert
this text inside of this text box into a
byte array and I'm just going to go
ahead and copy that text up here so I'll
just go to up right up here so I don't
have to redo it some lazy but anyways so
we're just going to do this code right
here and we're not going to do random
string dot to character a we want text
box one sexy text box choose text I just
Inc which would be this text box text
box do and all right so this code like I
said we'll just convert that string into
a fire ace so it's longstreet employer a
called proper study equal to a new fight
array the length is fight array will be
the same length as Xbox two's X all
right so now this will basically just
turn on the text inside of this text box
into a byte array and then we're just
going to want to get the hash of that so
get the hash of that bug array that we
created which is called buffer and then
we seem to convert this md5 into a
string sense on the md5 comk you hash
method returns a fighter a so they have
to say bitch converter to string and
number two
gonna want to replace all the dashes
with nothing so replace all the dashes
okay so now we're just gonna want to
stay if blah doesn't equal md5 hash name
then we know that the cap is wrong so I
got a message box so we're just making a
message box saying that you got it I
also have a message box alright so now
let's just go ahead and test this out
here you want to generate some CAPTCHA
images that we have to use so I'll
generate three that's probably enough
but then in my output folder
output start generated them now let's
just open a caption image which should
be inside of this outfit folder right
here we have some nice CAPTCHAs open one
alright so it should be ex-46 submit you
got it right
if we were to enter any other text
submit you got it wrong and there you go
and it has to be in the right case too
so if we did capital D X for fr6
it'd be wrong yep you got it wrong
because it has to be in the correct case
all right
so each set of tutorials that I made for
teaching you basically how to create
CAPTCHAs was just to teach you generally
how CAPTCHAs work and stuff like that
and also these are not the best captures
like if you wanted to go more advanced
you could change the color of each
letter in the text or generate strings
of different lengths and stuff like that
but I just decided that that would take
too much time and really my goal these
tutorials just to teach you just the
gist of how CAPTCHAs work alright so
that's it
for this tutorial so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
