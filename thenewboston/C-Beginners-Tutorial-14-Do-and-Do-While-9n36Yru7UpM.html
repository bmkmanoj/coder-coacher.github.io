c-sharp tutorial that I'm making Oregon
New Boston and this tutorial I'm going
to show you how to use a wild statement
and the do-while statement which are
both loop statements so all you're going
to need for this tutorial is a button
and a text box once you have those on
your form just double click on the
button now we're going to create a while
statement first in order to create a
while statement you can type the keyword
while mayor is going on have two
parentheses following it now inside
these parentheses you're going to want
to have a conditional statement and if
the conditional statement returns a
value of true then it will do the code
inside of the while statement so we're
just going to create a new integer I
instead of equal to zero and then we're
going to say while I is less than 10
then we will have it do to code inside
of the while statement and just like the
for and for each statement if you have
multiple lines of code inside of your
while statement you're going to need to
have the curly braces otherwise you only
need you do not have to have any clearly
braces and you must keep it all on the
same line so what we're going to have it
do is you're going to have it print out
eye into a text box so we're going to do
text box one dot X plus equals I two
string and then we're just going to have
it increment I by one so that it is not
infinite so once again what it will do
first is it will create a new integer I
then it will check to see if I is less
than ten if it is less than ten then it
will print out eye into the text box and
then it will increment I by one then
we'll start again go back up here check
to see if I is less than 10 and so on
we'll continue to do this until I is
equal to ten then let's stop so now
we're going to need bug and when we
click button one you should get numbers
zero through nine in this text box yep
in order to have a while statement that
goes on for forever all you're going to
need to do is type the words true in
here and since we just need something
that returns value of true it will
always cable continue to arm loop
through continuously so now let me put
the button if the program shoot is free
because it's continuing to do work yeah
let's program so to stop debugging this
book up six and click on it alright so
the next thing we're going to be looking
at is the do-while statement so what
we're going to do here is going to
create a new into your I am equal to
zero now to create a do statement you
just want to do and after that you're
going to have two curly braces now
inside this curly very sees you're going
to have the code you're going to want to
have it loop through so what we're going
to have to do is we're going to have it
just print out eye into the text box or
text box one dot plus equals I to string
alright so right now we don't have any
conditional statement for it to check to
see one it needs to stop so in order to
do that we're going on like the Lyle Q
now inside this these two parentheses
we're going to want to type what we
wanted to what we wanted to check to see
one to stop so if you want to have it
check to see if I is less than 10 then
what it will do is it will lose their
own what it will do is it will loop
through all its do statement and then it
will check to see if I is less than 10
unlike the all the other looping
statements where it checks its first
this checks last so we are guaranteed
for it to go through this do statement
at least once and where does that have
to have an increment I by one here or
else it will just be continuous because
I will always bring the same so once
again what it will do is first it will
create a new integer I then it will go
through this code right here increment I
by one and check to see if I is less
than ten if it is less than 10 then it
will do it again
and then as soon as I is equal to ten it
will stop so here when we debug and
click bought in one we should get number
zero through nine in this text box yep
and again if you wanted to have it loop
arm infinitely all you'd have to do is
change this to something static so we'll
just make it always return true
so it will always um it will always
return true so we'll just always loop
through over and over again so with this
button we should get to freeze yep so
that's it for this tutorial so see you
