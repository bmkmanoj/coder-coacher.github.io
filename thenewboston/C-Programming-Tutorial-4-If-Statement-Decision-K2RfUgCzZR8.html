cheers let's see it's the fourth see
tutorial and in this story we're going
to be going over if statements and these
are also called decisions now what a
decision or if statement is it's pretty
much a decision that the computer makes
you give a test and if the test passes
then it executes piece of code but if it
fails then it doesn't do anything at all
and the way we can test two numbers
since that work that's where we're going
to be working with oh right now we can
test if one is less than the other using
less than signs one is greater than the
other using the greater than sign if
they are exactly equal using two equal
equal to put equal signs or double equal
and if they aren't equal at all using
explanation point equal and there are
other tests but I'm just going to be
going over the basics today sorry got
whooping cough and uh since we're going
to be testing two numbers we need two
number variables so let's put int num1
and num2 and let me tighten this up a
bit that's what he said
and let's go ahead and just add a simple
print statement printf and this just is
telling the user what to do enter two
numbers and under this we need to give
the user a way to enter two numbers so
put scan F and inside your argument the
first argument takes put two variables %
d % d and the next arguments what are
those two variables num1 and num2 and of
course you need the ampersand in front
of each of those which I almost forgot
it so now we have now put on the screen
that says enter two numbers the first
number is going to be stored in num1 the
second number is going to be stored in
num2 now for what you've all been
waiting for the if statement now the if
statement syntax is this
let's lighten this up a bit if and in
your parentheses you would need a test
condition and again this if statement
you need to type if that's built in that
the computer understands you can't write
anything to substitute for that so if
and in parentheses right after if you
need to make a test condition so let's
put if num1 is exactly equal to num2 and
if we say all right if these are equal
what do we want you to do and the
instructions that you give it if it
passed the test you need to add in curly
braces so again all the instructions if
it passed the test you add in curly
braces and the test is in parenthesis
just like this so what do we want you to
do if number one is exactly equal to
num2 or the two values generator exact
exactly the same let's print F let's
make this real easy that's a few so
let's put on they are equal and of
course add your quotation marks so if
they enter two values that are exactly
the same our program is going to write
they are equal don't believe me let me
compile and run this baby and hopefully
I didn't forget any semicolons or
anything at the end of my statements
there we go
enter two numbers how about five and
five enter they're equal now let me run
this again and show you guys what
happens if they aren't equal just so you
guys can see what happens
enter two numbers five and seventy six
it just goes until the rest of the
program and it doesn't do anything at
all what this is doing is just waiting
for me to put character right that right
there and when I press something it's
just going to exit the program so this
is how you can use a simple decision or
a test to test the values of two numbers
and again you don't just need one if
statement you can use multiple if
statements so let me copy this copy
a paste so if you put if number 1 is
less than num2 then put percent D is
less than percent D and we'll put number
1 number 1 - hopefully you guys can see
that hopefully then get off the screen
and let's copy this and paste it if the
number if the first number you entered
is greater than number 2 then let's put
is greater and what this is going to do
is going to test all your numbers again
and it's going to say all right if the
first number you entered is equal then
it's going to put they are equal if the
first time you entered is less then it's
going to put the first number is less
than the second number but if the first
number is greater than the second number
remember this is your test condition
after each if then it's going to fail
not do anything fail and not do anything
oh we got something going on it is
greater than and it's going to run this
test and since it's going to pass or
become true it's going to execute this
block code so again to reiterate anytime
this test is true it's going to do the
code you tell it to if it's false it's
not going to do anything so if it's
equal this isn't going to be true and
this isn't going to be true so just to
show you guys compile and run this baby
one more time come on let's have the
numbers 20 press ENTER and then and
write 76 since 20 is less than 76 it's
going to write 20 is the less than 76 so
what it did is it said all right is 20
equal to 76 nope so I'm not doing this
is 20 less than 76 yes it is so I'm
going to write 20 is less than 76 and
then it checked if it was greater than
is 20 greater than 76 nope so I'm not
doing this so I did three tests but the
only one that passed
is this one right here so that is how
you make a basic if statement decision
um so pay attention my tutorial practice
and again this code is going to be on my
website the new Boston comm so you can
just copy this code from right there and
toss it into your compiler so you can
follow along with all my tutorials so do
that and once you figure it out how the
if basic if statements and decisions and
work you can move on to my next tutorial
so thank you guys for watching I hope
you guys are learning something make
sure to subscribe and I'll see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
