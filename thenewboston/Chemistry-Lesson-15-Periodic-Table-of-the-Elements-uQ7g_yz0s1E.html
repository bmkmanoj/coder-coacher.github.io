chemistry tutorial and in this lesson
we're going to be breaking up the
periodic table and I know you guys have
seen this before probably never really
paid that much attention to it but in
this tutorial we're going to learn how
it's piece together what the heck it is
and why it's useful so if you want to
follow along with me first of all please
make sure you're watching this tutorial
in full screen on YouTube 1080
resolution so go ahead and change your
settings and then you're going to be
able to see all these little numbers in
words perfectly crystal clear it's
probably hard to see in that little
youtube box
so again change it to full screen 1080p
and if you want to follow along with me
go to pea table comm that's where I'm at
right now
by far the best periodic table on the
internet and whenever I'm doing this
tutorial you're going to see why so
let's go ahead first in select one of
these elements and learn what all these
numbers are the number in the top left
is the atomic number in other words how
many protons are in that element in
carbon it's six
there's always six protons in carbon now
under that is the symbol the symbol is
pretty much too lazy or the shorthand
version that chemists write the entire
name because hey who wants to write the
entire name all the time we have things
to do we don't have time for that crap
now under that is the name in this case
it's carbon now under that the number in
the bottom left in carbon it's twelve
point zero one zero seven this is called
the atomic mass now I talked to you guys
about atomic mass before and I said it
was the protons plus the neutrons so why
these numbers aren't even is it's
actually the average of all the
naturally occurring isotopes so they
took all the carbons carbon-14 carbon-12
and they averaged them all together so
that's why this number isn't exactly
even so that's what all those numbers
are oh I miss two and in the top right
you see a list of numbers so if we go
ahead and look at Krypton you see two
eight 18 eight this means these are the
energy levels in how many electrons it's
pretty much the electron configuration
at the first energy level there are two
on
next one there 8 next one 18 in the next
one the fourth energy level there are
eight electrons so that's what all the
numbers and symbols and words mean in
each one of these elements so you same
okay so they found out all the elements
on earth and they throw them into a big
random puzzle well actually this is
pieced together in a very specific and
very clever way so let's go ahead and
learn some terminology first first of
all the horizontal rows are called
periods now if you look we have seven
periods one two three four five six
seven again the rows are called periods
and the columns if you see we have 18
columns these are called groups or I'm
going to be calling them families people
use them interchangeably I guess they
couldn't agree on a name but they're
more typically called families and you
have 18 columns or families now aside
from that you can also see that this
thing is color coded and isn't just
because some kid decided to paint a
bunch of colors on it they're actually
color coded in a very specific method in
there actually grouped into different
groups so let's go ahead and if we
highlight metals and this is why I love
this periodic table again P table com
depending on what you highlight
different groups get color-coded so if
we select the metals they all show color
and everything else is grayed out if we
still like nonmetals everything else
gets grayed out so that's why I love
this periodic table because it makes my
tutorial making like a hundred times
easier so go ahead and hover over metals
and all the metals are going to be
colored and all the other stuff in the
top right is going to be grayed out so
all these metals have the properties
that you might think they're solid
they're shiny they're good conductors of
electricity and if you notice most of
the elements on the periodic table and
most of the elements in life are metals
so then we can go ahead and look at
nonmetals go ahead and hover over that
now the nonmetals are in the top right
hand side of the periodic table and
these pretty much have the opposite
proper
of metals their poor conductors of
electricity they're brittle some of
these are even gases those kind of light
blue ones so basically we have metals
and nonmetals but if you played if you
paid really close attention you would
notice that some of the elements in
between them don't get lit up at all we
call those elements metalloids and this
pretty much is the in between a metal
and a nonmetal they kind of share the
properties of both metals and nonmetals
basically if metal and nonmetal had a
baby then these babies would be the
metalloids
so aside from that let's go ahead and
talk about something else and that is
that members of a family have similar
properties and remember the families are
the columns so let's go ahead and pick
on family number one and whenever I'm
talking about family don't worry about
hydrogen because hydrogen is only one
atom it's kind of different so don't
really worry about hydrogen so the first
column or all the elements in family
number one are called the alkali earth
metals now whenever a chemical reaction
takes place they tend to lose one
electron you're saying okay Bucky why is
this well I know I didn't talk to you
guys about chemical reactions yet but I
will in like five or six tutorials
basically whenever elements react with
each other or try to combine with each
other they're always looking for full or
completed energy levels they're pretty
much looking for even energy levels so
as you can see that the electron
configuration of all of these has one
valence electron one electron on the
outermost energy level so that a lecture
on that valence electron is really
loosely attracted there isn't much of an
attraction to the nucleus so that is why
whenever these ELCA light metals combine
in these chemical reactions that that
valence electron is usually the first
one to go
so again just remember that in the first
family they always have one valence
electron and in chemical reactions it
usually you
uses that electron in the family number
one goes by the name of alkali metals
simple enough so there's another family
two is goes by the nickname alkali earth
metals and if we look at the electron
configuration for all of these on all of
these elements they always have two
valence electrons so typically in
chemical reactions they lose these two
valence electrons because remember the
valence electrons are the ones that have
the weakest bond with a nucleus so those
electrons are really easy to pluck off
simple enough and if we look at
something like halogens I guess would be
a good one to talk about if you look at
the electron configuration they always
have seven valence electrons so whenever
you have a halogen in the chemical
reaction they usually gain one electron
because remember I know I didn't talk to
you about chemical reactions but
elements are always looking for a full
or complete energy level so they only
need one more to complete that energy
level the third energy level has eight
electrons total so that's why halogens
usually gain one electron and this last
one I'll talk about there are a lot of
other transitional metals and stuff but
these noble gases are notable because
they have full or completed energy
levels for example helium two electrons
is all it can hold in the first energy
level it's full neon two and eight if
you remember the electron configuration
at the first two energy levels it goes
to four the first one in eight for the
second one so this one's completed two
so in chemical reactions noble gases
already are filled up so that is why
these are very very unreactive elements
it's really hard to get these elements
these noble gases to react with any
other element in chemical reactions and
actually for a long time they thought
that it was impossible but then some guy
came along and he figured hey it is just
really hard to do but not impossible but
that's a story for another day
for now I'm
my mouth is getting dry because I'm
talking too much so I think I need to go
to Taco Bell and get some fruity Stu
freezes or whatever
bye anyways that is all I have for you
guys for this tutorial so thank you guys
