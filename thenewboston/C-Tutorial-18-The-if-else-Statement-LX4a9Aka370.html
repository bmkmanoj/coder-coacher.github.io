I believe C++ tutorial and in this
tutorial we're going to be going over
if-else statement and lastest order we
went over a if statement which would
said all right if you do this then run
this if not skip it well in this case is
we're going to tell C++ alright evaluate
this if it's true run this but if it's
not don't skip it and run this bit of
code so instead of just saying skip it
it gives it another option so the first
thing that we're going to want to do is
declare a variable and I'm going to make
my answer since we're going to be
building a short little quiz for this
tutorial so now we have a variable cart
called answer so now we have an answer
let's ask the question let's ask how old
is Bucky and end the line and let's give
the user a way to input their answer and
you use this if you've been watching my
tutorials on CN is going to let the user
input a number and one once it does
input that number it's going to set it
equal to the variable answer so now we
have a question on the screen and the
user inputs an answer now let's tell C++
what to do with it set alright if the
variable answer is equal to and make
sure you have two equal signs instead of
just one if you have it one it's going
to try to set the variable equal to it
if you have two it's going to compare it
so you want to if answer is equal to 21
then we want you to output on the screen
don't forget your brackets we want you
to output on the screen you're right
Bucky is 21 and oops that's embarrassing
and then let's just end that line and
now we need to build our brand new else
statement
so unlike before if this value eights
false it doesn't just keep going we want
to give it another option and since this
is the only option then we don't ever
need a test condition for else
so again if this is true it's going to
run this but if it's false it's going to
run this option so let's just say
alright if you give us the wrong answer
then we want to output on the screen
your rung and then let's just sum in
that line
so to recap one more time here's what's
going on we have the variable we ask the
question that the user inputs and
whatever number the user inputs it's
going to set it equal to the variable
answer so if you guess it right in I M
and you enter 21 it's going to be equal
to 21 and it's going to output this
you're right Bucky is 21 but if not it's
going to out it's going to go to your
else and it's going to output your rung
so let's recap not recap let's run this
so you guys can see what's going on
hopefully I didn't mess anything up and
here's our program right now how old is
Bucky let's go ahead and press 21 press
ENTER and it says you're right Bucky is
21 but let's go ahead and run that one
more time so we give it the wrong answer
and it says how old is Bucky um 45
you're wrong so um let me just show you
guys all let's just go over this one
more time an if statement alone with it
that without the else statement it's
going to check if this test condition is
true and if not it's going to move on to
the rest of your program what the else
statement does is give your if another
option so instead of saying alright if
this is false then instead of running
this bit of code
run this bit of code and then move on to
the later parts of your program so those
are your basics of your if-else
statement and if you want to get this
source code I'm going to be posting out
on my website the new Boston comm so you
can just copy it from there and put it
right into your compiler yourself
without having to type all this so thank
you guys for watching I hope you learned
the basics of a if-else statement and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
