Illustrator cs6 tutorial and tutorials
and staying with me so far
today we're gonna keep on going with our
art boards and we're gonna learn about
the art board options so let's get go
ahead and get right started and if you
didn't see the previous tutorial about
using art boards I went over a bunch of
basic stuff about art boards and showed
you how to use them correctly and all
that stuff so go ahead and select the
artboard tool here and then you can see
we've got some options we've got our
presets um that we can pick from
I picked the NTSC DV one here we have
our different layouts we got portrait
and landscape and that's just basically
gonna switch it up most of the time
you're gonna use landscape because
that's the way that computer monitors
are set up we got our button here for
our new artboard we've got a delete in
art board we have our chance to name it
and if you're working with multiple
artboard it's a good idea to dame it
something related to what you're putting
on the artboard right here we've got the
move copy artwork with the artboard so
when i move the artboard it's going to
move the artwork that's actually on it
with it so that's pretty handy they way
you don't move a bunch of stuff all
around you can turn this on or off and
it'll stay on and off you don't have to
toggle or anything like that we've got
this here in the middle we've got a
couple things that are just going to be
visible here we've got a show center
mark you can see where that is
oops I clicked the wrong one we've got
show crosshairs which are just going to
come out from the sides here and we've
got a show video guidelines like the
video safes so if you're working on
video you want to have these on because
you're not supposed to go past these
lines and then we've got some stuff over
here that you don't really need to worry
about too much right now
these are reference points don't worry
about that right now we're gonna click
on this button here card artboard
options
and here we get another dialog box with
a bunch of options in it for us you name
it and it's got some of the same things
up up here as that as it did before name
you can name it whatever you want we've
got all our presets again so I can go
ahead and change these easily using the
artboard options screen now I can set a
width and a height that I want and again
here's the reference point it's in the
center on this one but if you you can
click down here if you want to I don't I
honestly I don't really know too much
about using the reference points so I'm
not gonna go over them as much you can't
really know every single thing about the
about this program because there's so
many different things but I just leave
that alone you can change your
orientation if we constrain proportions
here if we have this I checked when I go
to change this it's going to change the
height with it
if I have constrain proportions off if I
change like the height to like 500 or
something like that it's the width is
going to stay whatever it was so we've
got an info box here that it's gonna
tell us our current proportions and
that's going to be helpful
that's your ratio basically 2.56 is the
ratio here we've got our display here
which were these three buttons up here
show the center mark show the crosshairs
and ensure the video is safe and then
we've got our pixel aspect ratio for the
video rulers and if we change them that
this is gonna chant these safe areas are
gonna change now I'm gonna leave these
here because I don't want to remember I
don't want to have to remember this
number every time so I'm gonna leave
this like it is and down here we've got
global and if I uncheck these or check
these they're gonna update like pretty
much the area around so the fade region
outside artboard that's going to display
the area outside the artboard in a
darker shade
don't it's going to be a different so
pretty much you want to have that on
it's gonna help you define where the
artboard is and then we've got update
while dragging and that just helps when
you're dragging around the artboard to
show you where it is so then we've got a
couple infos down here we've got our
forwards one and then a little nother
info little thing here to create a new
bar artboard with an artboard press
shift alt or press shift and then alt
and drag to use a duplicate al borde or
to duplicate all artboards geez so
that's all I wanted to go over with you
on our port options pretty much the same
thing that you have up here you can find
an artboard options except for really
like the global stuff right here but if
I was you I wouldn't really mess with
the global options unless you're like
going to show a client and you want it
to all be the same that's the only time
I would really do it and even then I
wouldn't even do it it's up to you so
you hit OK when you're done or cancel if
you just want to stay with what you had
so I'm gonna hit cancel and then I'm
back to what I had before so thanks for
watching this tutorial now you know more
about our boards and how to even
customize them even more see you guys
later have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
