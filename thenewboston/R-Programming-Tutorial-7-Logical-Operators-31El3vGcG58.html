I'm going to be talking to you guys
about logic operators so what the heck
is a logic operator what it is is it's
basically a way to make a test in our so
what we can do in this programming
language is we can ask our or ask our
computer very simple questions and they
can either answer true or false so let
me show you guys what I'm talking about
and this is actually probably going to
be real quick tutorial while I go over
the slightly different logical operators
so the first thing we can do is we can
use a double equal sign and what this
can do is we can say something like 5
equals equals 7 and in everyday language
this is basically asking your computer
hey it's 5 equal to 7 remember you have
to use two equal signs because one equal
sign was whenever you're assigning
values to variables so the double equal
sign means you're making a test and of
course if you run this it says false 5
is not equal to 7 you idiot 5 is equal
to 5 and actually if we put excuse me 5
equals equals 5 and run this
it says true so five equals seven false
is five equal to five true which is
basically the same thing as yes now
aside from testing if two values are
equal to each other there's also a test
to see if they're unequal I think that's
how you say it
so is 12 not equal to 14 so this is
going to be true with everything except
12 and actually I'll just do this right
now it's 12 not equal to 12 let me go
ahead and run these all right so is 12
not equal to 14
it isn't equal to 14 so it's true is 12
not equal to 12 actually yes it is so
this test is false so again equals
equals checks if they're the same and
not equals returns true if they're
different now I know this is kind of
basic stuff but this is actually one of
the most important things whenever
you're making programs and the last
thing I want to cover is just the less
than and greater than signs so you can
do something like is delete this
accidentally type down there tick me off
all right so you can do something like
this 45 less than 83 and this of course
is going to return true because it is
now you can also use the greater than
sign and one other thing that may not be
that intuitive is actually the less than
equals in sign so if you test something
like a 7 less than 7 it's going to be
false but if you do is 7 less than or
equal to 7 what this is going to do is
it's going to return true because even
though 7 isn't less than 7 it is equal
to so again the less than equal to
that's what that test so let me go ahead
and run this and as you can see we have
true now actually I have one more thing
I want to talk about and that is that
even though um we're testing with
numbers right there we aren't just
limited to numbers or numerical data we
can also do the same thing with text as
well so wow I keep typing down my
console so we can test is the word Bucky
equal to the word ham that's going to be
false but if we do something like is
Bucky equal to the word Bucky that's
going to be true so is Bucky equal to
ham no false is Bucky equal to Bucky yes
that's why it's true so again remember
equals equals to tes if they're the same
explanation mark or explanation oh it's
explanation mark equals to test if
they're different less than greater than
less than or equal to and you can also
do this with words or characters so I
know this is a some pretty basic stuff
but for those people just getting
started with programming trust me you're
going to be seeing this a whole lot so
you know it's better to get it down in
your brain right now before we move on
to some more complex stuff so thanks for
watching and next time we're actually
going to be learning about something a
lot more complicated but a lot more fun
than this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
