slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
learning a very important part of
programming we're going to be learning
what's called the try-catch statement so
let's go ahead and create a new project
and basically what the try-catch
statement does is you put a block of
code inside of your try statement and
what it does is it tests it runs the
code to see if it gets the errors now
the reason you would want to put it in a
try statement is let's say you have some
code that you know may return an error
based on certain circumstances you'll
want to put that in a try-catch
statement so that if there's an error
happening your program will not crash
and it will catch the exception and it
will keep running at normally so let's
come over here to our toolbox and we
will add a list box and a button so
we'll click button so we'll set the text
of button to add all and we'll set the
name to button add so let's go ahead and
double click on add all so it'll open up
our form one class and let's go ahead
and create an array so private my array
as integer and let's go ahead and give
it some values so we will have five four
three two and one
okay so whenever they click Add it's
going to add all of the items in the
array to the list box so for let's just
do index as integer and we'll set it
equal to zero and we want to go to what
well we have zero one two three four
so zero to four what we want to do is
list list box 1 dot items add and we'll
go ahead and add my array at index okay
so let's go ahead and run this and it
should be working perfectly
if we click at all we get five four
three two and one
now if we go from zero to five we're
going to get an out-of-bounds error
because this only goes zero one two
three four and if we try to access five
so what we try to access index five we
get what's called an out-of-bounds error
which means that you're trying to access
some memory that isn't there so let's go
ahead and run this and you can see that
if we add all the program freezes up and
it's not working and it crashes and it
shows us an index out of range exception
and it was unhandled
and says the index was out of balance of
the array so what we can do to keep this
error from crashing crashing our program
is enclose it in a try-catch so we got
we put try before it and then after it
after it we put catch and then in try so
this is the very basic try-catch
statement so it's going to try this code
right here and if anything happens to
causes an error
what we want to do is so a message box
so a message box and then we will say an
error has occurred I think that's how
you spell occurred so let's go ahead and
run this and you can see when we click
at all it says an error has occurred so
what it does is it goes through and it
adds everything perfectly and then once
it accesses index which is out of bounds
as five it's going to go ahead and then
error is going to happen and this right
here is waiting for that error it's
going to catch it and when it catches an
error it's going to do whatever code is
inside of the catch statement so we'll
go ahead and run that again so what
happens is it it runs perfectly fine and
we get the results that we want but then
it stops itself before the program just
crashes completely so practice a couple
try-catch statement you may even be able
to add them to a program that you've
already made which will make it run a
lot better it'll keep errors from
happening
well the errors will still happen that
will just be handled so once you got the
basics of the try catch down go ahead
and move on to the next tutorial and
we're going to be learning more about
these</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
