sweet fricken constructive tutorial and
now that we got our dude imported I
think it's time that we actually
animated them so in order to do that
we're gonna be working a lot in this
animations window right here pretty much
say take this image and make it into an
animation so the first thing I want to
do is rename this from default and if
you actually just click on it then a
litters gonna be here you don't need to
press like a pen like last time just
rename this to idle and then deselect it
and it'll um pretty much well just
rename it to idle though and so now that
we have this animation name properly the
next thing I wanted to do is change the
speed of the animation so make sure that
this is selected and once it is the
properties of it will pop up on the left
and change the speed from five to nine
now of course the speed of your
animation is just gonna be preference
more than anything else but I know that
nine looks pretty good on here and
obviously the faster the speed is the
faster that these images are gonna play
so if you change it slow he's gonna be
bobbing up and down slowly like a you
know big lard if you change it to like
fifty he's gonna be bobbing up and down
real quick like a crackhead so nine
perfect make them look normal
and right now if you actually want to
test how fast it looks if you
right-click idle and press preview as
you can see he Bob's up and down once
then stops alright so that's obviously
not one what we wanted to do so what's
the issue right here and the issue is if
we want this animation to get done then
keep going over and over again pretty
much once it gets done start from the
beginning again
change this loop to yes and just go
ahead and hit enter and now once you
preview this I don't know if you guys
can see it but he continually Bob is up
and down hopefully you guys can see that
on the screen recorder
alright so our dude is bobbing up and
down continually so that's pretty much
what's going to happen when the user
isn't pressing anything when they just
like walk away from their keyboard
so right now what we can do is since
we're kind of done with this animation
right now just close it out and actually
want to move him so he starts out like
right there
might as well and I'm also gonna rename
him from sprite to two-player since this
guy is a player all right so our
animation is good to go let's go ahead
and preview this and see how it looks
okay so we have some issues with the
screen which we're going to fix later
but that dude is bobbing up and down it
looks like he's just sitting on the
toolbar on my computer so I know it
actually looks pretty cool leave that
right there for now
and the reason is is because this is
your screen size if you didn't know this
dotted line right here and we can adjust
that later on to give us a little better
resolution but for right now I want to
talk to you guys about behaviors so what
we want to do is we're gonna be working
a lot with something called platform
behaviors and this is basically the
behavior that your add to a lot of these
sprites for a platformer game you guys
are gonna see exactly what a platform
behavior is little later on okay let me
move him up so if I demonstrate anything
else it's gonna be easier to see on the
screen but anyways I want to mention one
thing check this guy out right now
whenever he's standing on the platform
like this this entire blue box is the
area of the dude so me on snap to grid
sir I can demonstrate something so that
means what the game is gonna do is if he
goes like this right here it's still
gonna make him stand on the thing since
it takes this entire base right here is
his feet and also we know that if the
dude is standing right here he should
not be on the thing anymore he should
fall down so we want to keep this crop
because I mean that's the area of the
entire animation but how do we make it
so that um the game reacts to only where
his feet are and he would fall down in
the situation like this
let me go ahead and snap to grid again
because I know it's just bothering me in
in order to do that we actually need to
import another object that's gonna solve
that issue so double-click anywhere on
your screen for now
and what we want to do is we want to
actually just import another sprite and
we'll just go here right here for now
and if you actually select and now
actually put this on my um on my forum
I'll put a link below this video so you
guys can download this image or if you
have Photoshop you can just make it but
what I did is I made this little image
and it's just any blue square I made in
Photoshop it took like two seconds and
it has this 75 percent opacity even
though you can just use you know a solid
one so double-click that in right now
check it out we just have a plain square
as a spray</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
