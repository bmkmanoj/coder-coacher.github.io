tutorial and in this video we're going
to be talking about the keyboard editor
so the keyboard editor is the button
right next to your graph editor but
before we do this I want to set up this
tutorial by playing a new channel so I'm
going to be adding I don't know we'll
fill in each of these four steps to the
clap channel and I also want to solo
this so right now if you play it or
pattern we only hear the clap and that's
all I want for this tutorial it sounds a
little bit uh it sounds a little bit
better than a kick channel or anything
and you'll see later on so basically
open the keyboard editor by clicking the
button and make sure that you have the
clap channel selected now having the
channel selected basically means that
you're telling FL Studio that you want
to work with it it's different than
having the channel muted or not so if we
want to work with the kick channel we
have to click this little light to the
right of the name so now we're working
with the kick channel now we're working
with a hat now the vocals and again like
I said in this tutorial we want to work
with that clap Channel so first thing
you notice is that it looks like a bunch
of pianos pressed together and that's
basically what it is
just like whenever you play a new note
on the piano it plays a different pitch
this keyboard editor is going to allow
you to change the pitch of each note
simple enough that's you know are really
quick one two tutorial so another thing
I want to point out is that the only
keys you have to worry about are the
ones that are dark orange if something
is light orange it means that of course
the note is not active or it isn't
playing now if you want to for example
make this no active you can either click
it up here and as you can see it turned
dark orange or you can actually just
click a key and whenever you do the note
activates in your pattern sorry got
whooping cough kennel cough whatever you
want to call it black lung
I don't know so let me go ahead and
actually fill these in every two steps
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to
make a really bad sounding pattern just
to demonstrate alright so this is going
to get higher in the lower pitch it's
going to sound terrible but it's going
to demonstrate what the keyboard editor
does alright so obviously you would
never ever want to include that in your
song if you did then you should probably
just throw away your computer but that
demonstrates the different pitch of each
note so that's what the keyboard editor
does now let's go ahead and do something
fun since I have a about two more
minutes for this tutorial and phlegm
phlegm phlegm I've got to clear my
throat and what I want to do now is oh
another thing I want to point out is
just like the graph editor say we have
actually I'll show you guys something
cool umm go ahead and solo kick
so kicks the only thing playing right
now now what we want to do is if we can
go ahead and paint this using the left
Mouse just like we did the graph editor
so now if we go ahead and paint a little
curve right here this is the effect
whenever your listen to listening to you
know like a techno or dance beat right
before it drops goes to tip it two digit
up like that so let me go ahead and play
this and I'll show you guys all right
let me start it wasn't at the beginning
so if you guys ever want to achieve that
effect real quick this is a very simple
way to do that many ways the thing I
wanted to point out is just like the
graph editor as well whenever you hold
ctrl on your keyboard you can go ahead
and drag this entire thing up and down
so if you got the pattern that you like
but you just want to either a higher or
lower pitch then again that's control it
on your keyboard and drag so now we got
alright so there you go now the last
thing I want to do just cuz I'm curious
this has nothing to do with the tutorial
but I want to solo the vocal Channel and
actually let's get rid of this this is
going to South this is going to sound
real stupid but I'm very curious I never
done this before
oh actually what I want to do with this
I'll go to set everything alright let me
just set everything to see so let's
listen to this entire pattern
rock me baby rock me baby rock me baby
all right that's what we want rock me
baby now I never did this before but
what happens when you change the pitch
of the voice um I don't think they can
just do that they probably speed it up
or slow it down so let's rock the baby
wow that's awesome so I mean I'm just
playing around now back baby wow that
sounds like uh that actually sounds like
a baby that is tone it's mom dad rock me
actors mom dad rock me baby
all right that's kind of mr. rock me
baby
wow the H rock me baby rock baby rock me
baby Wow that was uh okay I'm sorry I
made you guys listen to that
