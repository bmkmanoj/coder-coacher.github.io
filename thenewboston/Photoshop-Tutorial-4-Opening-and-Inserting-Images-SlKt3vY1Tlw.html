tutorial and now that we know how to
make a blank document the next thing I
want to show you guys is how to open an
existing image because the reason that
you would make a blank document first is
because if you wanted to create a
cartoon or a graphic or a logo then you
would start from scratch but a lot of
the time you just take pictures with I
don't know your phone or get a picture
from a website or your digital camera
and you just want to edit it in
Photoshop somehow so in that case you
wouldn't create anything from scratch
since you already have the image on your
computer so if you want to open up that
image this is how you do that instead of
file new you go to file open and then
look on your computer and navigate to
that image
so under Photoshop images I have a
beautiful photo already that my mom took
when I was like I don't know I probably
look 3 or 4 years old here's me with the
freakin sweet shorts right there and I
am feeding a deer I'm probably feeding
him I don't know I probably just got
done eating a hot pocket or something
and actually a few seconds later he bit
my entire arm off fun fact
I'm just kidding here he didn't do that
but look in his eye see that he wanted
to he wanted to so anyways here's me
feeding a deer and you know I'm getting
sidetracked the important concept is
that's how you open an existing image
file open so that's how you do that but
say that I like this image and I wanted
to give it to my mom for her 89th
birthday but she doesn't like deer at
all she happens to love chickens so what
I want to do is I want to take another
image that I have of a chicken that's on
my computer and I want to place it over
this deer right here so you may be
thinking you know what I know how to do
that
file open desktop where's the chicken
image right here chicken and AHA crap it
opened as a new document I want to do
that I want it over here on this one
okay umm what do i do do I drag and drop
this over you know what a lot of
beginners often do this whenever they
want
take an existing image and insert it
into a document that they already have
open so unlike before we will where we
went file and open again what you need
to do whenever you want to take an
existing image and put it inside the
document is hit file place what this
does is it allows you to select an image
such as this chicken image and whenever
you hit place it places it inside an
existing document so now what I can do
is I can go ahead in with my little
arrow move this around exactly how I
want it to and you can also if you can
see on the corner of this little frame
that's surrounding the chicken our
little arm squares I guess now with
these squares you can go ahead and
resize your chicken so let me just
resize this perfectly so instead of the
deer I'm now feeding the chicken just
like that and once you got everything
moved around and resized using your
little squares in cursor oh I got
freaking phlegm in my throat just go
ahead and hit enter and what this does
is it pretty much sets it in the given
position it's called rasterizing it but
it pretty much arm sets it is the final
image or position so that is basically
wow you know what once we step back and
look at this we can see that this is a
beautiful looking picture when I was 2
years old
I fed this chicken and you know people
would believe it this looks completely
realistic right here but anyways if you
want to open a new image that you just
took with your camcorder or something go
to file open and that allows you to do
that it creates a new document where
your images or if you want to take an
existing image and place it inside a new
document you go to file place and it
places an existing image inside the
document that you're working on so there
is that tutorial I hope you guys
understand and if anyone wants this
beautiful photo then I'll have it for
sale on eBay probably for like 10 cents
because it's pretty crappy
