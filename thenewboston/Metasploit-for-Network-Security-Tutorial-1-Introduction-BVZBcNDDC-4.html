Roberts and in this tutorial series I am
going to be teaching you the basics of
Metasploit so first things first what
the heck is Metasploit well this is a
framework in other words it's a
collection of tools that you can use to
test the security and find
vulnerabilities for a website or you can
actually test an entire network if you
want so a lot of penetration testers use
this tool whenever companies they just
set up a website for the first time and
they're like hey we need someone to come
make sure that there aren't any issues
aren't any bugs with our website then
you can use a tool like this but you can
also use it if you just have your own
personal website or maybe you just want
to test the security of your own home
network you can use this tool as well
now with that being said I need to give
you guys a little disclaimer before
begin if you use this tool on a network
or web site that you don't have
permission to access or you don't own
then that's illegal
you just can't find any website on the
internet and start testing for
vulnerabilities because like I said
that's illegal and you will go to jail
so whenever you become an actual pen
tester and the company hires you make
sure that you have written permission so
with that said let's go ahead and get
started now before we just start hopping
into everything I want to go over some
things that may confuse you guys
whenever you're just on Google looking
for like tips and stuff and how learn
this so first of all like I said
Metasploit isn't just one tool it's not
just one thing that you test it's a
collection of tools so you can do a
bunch of different things with it and
we're going to be going over all of this
like gathering information about a
target scanning for vulnerabilities and
just performing a bunch of exploits you
can actually write your own exploits for
Metasploit but yeah simple as that and
as you can see this is a command-line
tool and if you guys are using Kali
Linux then it already came pre-installed
but if you guys are using another
distribution of Linux then you can
install it pretty simple and the last
thing I want to mention before we get
started is this sometimes you're going
to you know want to look something up
how to do something on Metasploit so
you're going to google it and you may
see a website that looks like this now
you're like wait a minute alright so
Metasploit penetration testing software
yep that that looks like what I'm
looking for but what the heck I thought
that this tool is free so I'm seeing a
bunch of this stuff that says buy online
free 14-day trial what the heck I mean
am i using the run looking at the right
thing here what's going on so this is
another thing that confuses a lot of
people um you know they're using this
free piece of software and they get
online and they're like buy this buy
that so this company called rapid7
this is the company that maintains both
what you're looking at right now this
website and also this free piece of
software now the difference in this free
piece of software that came with Kelly
and the one that you buy is just that
the free piece of software that's the
Metasploit framework in other words
that's the core heart of Metasploit
that's the thing that contains all of
the tools it's open source a bunch of
awesome stuff and that's where we're
going to be learning now these paid
versions they are just different um you
know like extra features that you can
have that you can buy for but they
aren't required and these are just
things like you know reporting features
there's a GUI version of Metasploit and
there are some group collaboration tools
but again the core framework is open
source it's free for anyone to use
that's where we're going to be learning
in these tutorials and if you guys ever
you know start like a penetration
testing company and you need some extra
features then you might want to look
into these paid things now the last
thing that I want to go over in this
kind of bugs me it's something called
Metasploit able so of course whenever
you start learning this tool you just
don't want to do it on your own website
because what what if you mess something
up and you you know you don't want to
run a bunch of tests on your home
network because you know what if you
find a vulnerability and then something
goes bad so it's a good idea to have
kind of a little testing environment and
that's what Metis portable is and I say
that it kind of bugs me because why
would you name it Metasploit able when
the actual tool is called Metasploit
I mean keen can you just name it
something different please because it's
very confusing for people
so again Metasploit a bowl this is your
little testing environment and if you
guys don't have any you know crappy
server anything that you can test on
what you can do is you can download this
and extract it and then you guys can run
this inside a virtual machine but I
actually bought a five dollar server a
month so that's what I'm going to be
teaching you guys on in this video but
again just to recap the thing that comes
with Kali Linux this is called
Metasploit that's where we're going to
be learning in this tutorial there's
also a paid version of it that the
company who maintains it offers and
Metasploit Abel is a little testing
environment that you can use so yep
there you go and by the way this little
testing environment it's just like a a
web server that has a bunch of
vulnerabilities and they're intentional
vulnerabilities so you know just like a
really buggy web server alright so that
was noice mate and now let me close out
if here open up a brand new terminal and
let me bump this up so you guys can see
the font a little bit better and alright
so now let's start from scratch let's
learn how to use Metasploit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
