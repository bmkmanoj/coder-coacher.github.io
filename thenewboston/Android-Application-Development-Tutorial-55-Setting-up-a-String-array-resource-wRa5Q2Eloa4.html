androids toil for the new Boston we're
going to do in this tutorials basically
have this list we set up in our
preferences actually refer to a actual
array that we're going to set up because
we already have it referring to this
array called lists and we don't actually
have an array called lists so what we're
going to do is simply set that up
nothing too difficult so we're going to
go under a values folder right here and
this is where we're going to set up that
array for the most part this can be
pretty simple nothing difficult and
again we have this array called lists so
keep that in mind so we're going to do
is we're going to say new XML file and
we're going to call this one it's under
our values as you can see it's checked
right there but we're going to call this
array because again it's referencing
something called array list and that's
what this is going to refer to so we're
going to say array dot XML hit finish
and now anytime we use this array kind
of a folder it's going to refer to here
so again we're just going to go into the
XML and set this up as you can see
there's resources within its brackets so
where those are the brackets that we're
going to hold some information so that's
pretty neat it's just kind of a resource
folder for the most part so what we're
going to set up as a string array as you
can see it we have the options here in a
jar a string string array item whatever
we want to keep in this kind of resource
folder for the most part under our array
XML file so we're going to set up a
string array and what we're first going
to do is we're going to name it so we're
going to say name and this is going to
be equal to list again our preference
tab is accessing the array called list
and that's what this is going to refer
to this list so we have to give it the
name list or whatever you guys name that
so it actually has a list refer to and
then we're all we're going to do is set
up some items
within this string array so we need to
finish off our string array that's all
we need to define it as and then hit
enter a few times so we can work within
the string array and add some items to
it so we're going to say item and then
you don't even have to set up the item
like we generally would we just need to
kind of put something within both item
and the clothes item brackets there and
we're going to call this I know option
one and just copy and paste this four
times or something
however many times you guys want and
then just change the variables for
something like that
save it and then we have this string
array called list which is being
accessed by our preference tab so that's
pretty cool but let's say basically this
is going to open a list and it's going
to hold those four items within that
list within our preference activity for
the most part so let's say we want one
of those items to be checked to start
with and what we're going to do is we're
going to set up something basically
that's going to refer to the list values
or the most part so we're going to set
up something else called Android again
this is within our list preference
android entry values for the most part
and we're going to say again refer to
another array so we're going to say
array ford slash values or something
like that
or L values L values and then what we
can do is we can also set some numerical
values to these items for the most part
so we're going to set up a new string
array within our array XML and again
just click string array and we also
gotta give this the name that we just
set up so name is going to equal again L
values
and close it off and put up some values
within here again item and we're going
to say this is item one and we're just
going to copy and paste that four times
this will make more sense once we
actually once I can show you guys what
this is actually doing but says for now
just kind of follow along and then once
we run our application it's going to
make a ton more sense as always so there
we go we basically set up our list
arrays and set up entries which is going
to be your list and entry values which
is going to be kind of the options or
what I'm sorry also this entries is
supposed to be at array from the
previous tutorial apologize guys so just
make sure you change that to add array
and this one is also at array which is
both referring to this array value that
we set up for the most part and I'll
catch you guys in the next tutorial
we're going to work with these list
items as well so have a good one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
