video we're actually gonna be adding
this goal ball to the game and basically
the goal of this game is quite simple
what we want to do is we want to destroy
my face with a meatball now my face is
going to get destroyed in one of two
ways
the first one is if it hits the ground
like this then it gets destroyed and
also if we just hit it directly with a
meatball then it also gets destroyed so
scroll in and make sure that it sets
right on this tower and I might want to
add like I will just add this right here
it will add some extra support right
there alright so look in pretty good now
the first thing of course that we need
to do is add physics behavior to this so
it rolls around like a ball so stro down
to physics and good so now this is
actually beat being treated like a ball
instead of just like a background image
or something and again make sure that's
placed on the tower and let's just run
this game and see what happens right now
alright so okay so the reason that did
that is because of that little space
that we added well that's fine it
actually adds a cool little element and
now we can fire it and nothing happens
so again even though our logic is
working properly and then everything's
being treated like it should what we
want to do is say okay whenever we hit
that we basically won the game because
this is hitting the ground which should
be destroyed and also we hit it with a
meatball so now we just need to add some
logic and this is how we do that so the
first thing I want to say is whenever it
hits the ground pretty much destroy this
ball right here my face the what did we
call it the target ball pretty good name
all right so at a new event
and the target ball and the event for
this is actually just on collision with
another object and that object is the
ground
so basically we're saying when it
collides with the ground well what do we
want to happen well it's easy the only
thing we want to do is actually just
take this and destroy so whenever it
hits the ground destroy it and another
thing that we want to do is we want to
check if we hit it with a meatball so
target ball on collision with another
object the meatball and destroy this as
well
and that's pretty much it if you guys
start it would be more confusing than
that well then you're wrong because what
we're saying is okay now when it touches
the ground or you hit it directly with a
meatball head on then destroy the target
ball so now let's go ahead and try to
make both of those scenarios happen
first let me try to hit it with a
meatball see I hit it right there and
now let me try I don't know if I can get
the ground crap okay that's gonna be
hard all right that's gonna be hard to
get okay I probably gonna have to change
my game around a little I'll just delete
this one
actually don't want to hit it with a
meatball before it gets a chance to hit
the ground all right there you go so we
can either hit it with a meatball or
just have it hit the ground and oh all
right so I need to move this one out a
little bit so the game doesn't just win
by default before you miss art and well
that's it so that is how you add the
logic of actually having a target with
physics effects and a couple of
different ways that you can win and
eventually you might want to keep score
by adding some text elements to the top
but one other thing that I want to add
in this tutorial is how to make it look
like your target is actually blowing up
I'm going to show you guys how to work
with particles in the next soro because
we haven't covered yet in any other game
series so thank you guys and I'll see
you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
