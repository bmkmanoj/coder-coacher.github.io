tutorial in FL Studio and as promised
we're going to be going over the step
sequencer in a little bit more detail
and that's of course where we make our
patterns and if you can't see it then go
ahead and like I said in the last video
just click this button at the top and it
toggles it to either show or hide on
your interface by anyways the first
thing I want to mention is this and I
know a lot of people watching these
videos probably they might not know how
to read music or not familiar with like
quarter notes or anything like that but
if anyone is I want to mention this you
can think of this entire step sequencer
by default is one whole note so remember
a whole note is basically when you count
to four in music one two three four one
two three four so let me go ahead and
play this in count it rock me baby one
three four one two three four so if you
want to think of it in terms of music if
you're familiar with that then you can
and you can also think that each of
these buttons is a sixteenth note so
therefore if we look at the kick channel
that would be quarter notes so four
quarter notes make up a whole note
simple enough now why am I saying that
I'm saying that because you can count to
four in different speeds so for example
some person may count one two three four
and that's what they want the tempo of
their song to be but if you're making
you know kind of a dance song you're
going to want one two three four one two
three four so a lot of people ask me how
do I change the tempo or pretty much in
if you don't know what tempo means it's
pretty much the speed of your beat and
it's actually really easy up here you
can see tempo whenever you click it and
slide up as your tempo increases your
beats can become faster so now it was
130 that's just what we heard now let me
play it at 170 rock me baby rock me baby
rock me baby and now let me slide it
down slowly as it's playing and that's
another cool thing you can actually
slide the tempo down as your beats
playing so you can you know I just feel
the best tempo for you what whatever
sound you're trying to go for rock me
baby
you rock me baby rock me baby rock me
baby all right that sounded kind of
weird right now saying she's saying
you're rock me baby but let's go ahead
and slide that back up to 130 and again
we just got this default tempo rock me
baby rock me baby typically I'm gonna be
working in the 100 to 130 range that's
you know most common beats again you
either want it slow or if you're maybe
going for a slow hip-hop B or fast for
dance beat but you know whatever sound
you're trying to go for so now the next
thing I want to mention is all right so
this is basically a whole note but does
that mean that any time we want to make
a longer loop then we need a new pattern
well no it doesn't if you want this to
be longer than a whole note or basically
um a longer loop for you know everyday
language what you can do is by default
this is for four quarter notes but up
here as you see whenever you hover over
it says beats per bar for this pattern
in the tooltip bar now by default like I
said it's four but we can go ahead and
slide this up to something like eight
and then we have double the space to
work with or basically two whole notes
so I don't need all that space so I'm
just going to go ahead and slide mine
back down to four and there we go so now
we're back to normal
now next thing we want to mention is
just a few tips first of all sometimes
I'm in song mode in order to play your
pattern if you want to switch back to
that then you have to go to pattern play
date and I know it's not really that big
deal but if you are incredibly lazy like
my am like I am NOT the Mayans they
weren't lazy you can just go ahead and
click this play button right here on the
step sequencer and check it out rock me
baby so it's gonna save you like a
millisecond but you know we're busy
people we got crap to do no big deal and
the cool thing is other than that is
once you click it it turns into a pause
button so you know you don't have to
click this then click up here simple
enough so that's one little shortcut
another one I want to point out is that
people are asking all right how do I
make a different pattern
so for example I want to you know make
this pattern in my final song so this is
this beat now if I want a new pattern
what am I supposed to do well we only
got one loop to play with no anytime you
want a new pattern then just go ahead
let me hide that playlist and click this
plus button and it's going to allow you
to make a new pattern now if you don't
name it anything it's going to just be
named pattern 2 if you press Enter or
you can just go ahead and give it like a
custom name like tuna blaster and press
Enter and now you have pattern on in
tuna blaster so you know if you want to
keep the defaults that's fine if you
want to name it something like um wobb
wobb i know it depends on your sound
then that's fine too as you see whenever
you make a new pattern then you get a
blank pretty much a melody to work with
so let me go ahead and delete this by we
know we're going to tune the blaster I'm
just going to go ahead and press Delete
okay and then go back to pattern number
1 and that's the pattern that we've been
working on so that is how you create new
patterns name them and delete patterns
and also how you select different
patterns from the drop-down and that's
probably enough for this tutorial in the
next video
I'm going to be talking to you guys
about whoa what the heck is this little
thingy right here this is called the
graph editor and it is freaking awesome
