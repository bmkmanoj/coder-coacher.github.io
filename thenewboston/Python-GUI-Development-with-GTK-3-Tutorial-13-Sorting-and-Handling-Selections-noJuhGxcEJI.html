the last tutorial what we did is we made
a really basic tree view it kind of
looks like a simple spreadsheet program
right now and I mean this thing is
pretty boring I mean you can't sort it
you can't you know interact with it you
can't edit it so in this video what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna show you a couple
things first of all how you can make
those columns sortable which is the
easiest thing ever and also how you can
handle callbacks in other words handle
user interactions so whenever they
select a row something happens so this
is all the code from last story I just
took all the comments out since it was
kind of cluttered oh whoa Bessy wow
that's embarrassing alright so right in
your loop whenever you create the
columns what you can do is I'll show you
the code to make them sortable so for
each column what you do is you actually
set sort column ID and you just pass it
in the ID of that specific column which
is remember I so actually we can just
run this right now and check it out so
that way you know before we couldn't
sort them but now if you click at the
top of any column then in order so if
the column is just regular text like you
know letters then it orders it
alphabetically and any integers it
orders that numerically so on and so
forth so that was the easiest thing we
have ever done and now let me sign this
up and let me move this right here some
like my code all cluttered alright so
now we got some cool columns that we can
sort but we still can't handle user
interaction in other words whenever a
user clicks one of these rows nothing
happens so it's just you know data that
they can look at right now well anytime
you want to handle user interaction then
this is
what you do say handle selection good
enough so the first thing we need to do
is we need to get whatever row the user
selected so in order to do that for your
tree view all you call is get selection
so this is going to return whatever row
they selected either this one or this
one
whatever so from there we can connect a
callback method so selected row and I'll
just connect the change signal and what
just call itself item selected all right
so the chain signal of course is signal
that gets emitted whenever these are
selects or in other words changes a row
and also a kind of weird thing to know
whenever your program first starts out
I'll show you guys this and well I can
show you because my code is not complete
I didn't create this function but
whenever your program first starts out
the first row is selected by default so
this signal gets emitted right away so
just keep note of that if you notice
that something weirds going on in your
program and didn't call it specifically
it's going to call this method
essentially as soon as your program
first boots up so now we said whenever
the user selects a row called this
method so now I have to create that
method alright so I'll say user selected
a row toe user selected his toe alright
so that
item selected and we need pill specimen
itself and selection now the selection
of course is just going to be a
reference to that row and here let me do
this selection and gets selected all
right so essentially your selection is
broken up into two parts the model which
is the entire data model and the row
which is a reference to that row so with
those two pieces of information we can
pretty much pull out whatever they
selected really easily so if Rho is not
none and this is just so we don't get
any weird bugs then we can just print
out their information so name and in
order to access a specific column or
let's say they selected on this row but
we only want to access like their name
or their age and do something with it
then what we do is this we call model
which is the dad model and the row and
what value this is doesn't matter I mean
we never know explicitly is a row 1013
we just pass in a row and it takes care
of it and 0 so remember 0 is essentially
the first column 1 is the second one in
3 or excuse me 2 is the third column or
their profession so let me just copy
this and let's print out a name age and
blank
alright so their name is 0 ages 1 job is
to and I'm just gonna print a blank line
so looking sweet check it out and it's
trying to prayer now to integer so I can
actually do this do it the really lazy
way so if you're ever trying to print
out an integer and it gives you this
error message type error I can't convert
int 2 string implicitly you can either
print it out like this or what you can
do is you can do this just
Str and then throw your integer in there
and it's going to take that integer and
convert it to a string so you know
whatever you want to do so now hopefully
check this out so you know what I was
saying before that whenever your program
first boots up it selects the first row
by default so that's why this printed it
out right here before we even clicked
anything inside the program and now what
I can do is I can just start clicking
these and they print out so boom and it
prints out however you formatted it or
maybe you don't want to print something
out maybe you want to you know start
downloading something or start sending
messages to whatever whatever your
program does and also check this out it
doesn't matter if we you know sort these
however you want all of the IDs they
never get messed up bucky Roberts still
prints out properly
Emma Anderson looking good so that
ladies and gentlemen is not only how you
make a tree view but the model behind it
which is the list store and how
everything is automatically connected
all the hard work is taken care of and
it's also how you can you know make your
column sortable select you know handle
the user selection and it's pretty
awesome so in the next tutorial we're
gonna be covering something else I'm
sure you guys are getting kind of tired
of tree views but for now didn't guess
rush in and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
