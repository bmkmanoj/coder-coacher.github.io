was going to do is I was just going to
show you guys something called a first
responder and a first responder is
actually pretty cool because it allows
you to handle like items on the
interface a little bit better and work
with user interaction in a really cool
way and we'll get to that but then I was
like you know what in these examples
it's pretty dumb that we have to look at
this layout because first of all it's
incredibly boring and second it's
probably hard to learn on this because
no app in real life looks like this and
it doesn't really resemble anything that
we would actually use so instead before
I get to that sorrel I decided to build
a really simple interface that resembles
kind of an app that we would use in real
life in other words make an interface
that isn't incredibly ugly so already
what I did is I made a blank Xcode
project I didn't add any code or any
designs as you guys can see so before we
get started
what we need to do is we need to import
the images that we're going to use on
this interface right here so anytime we
want to import images up over to this X
cassettes file and again any assets any
image assets that you want to use in
your project on your view then you need
to import them as Xcode assets so that's
technically of what this file stands for
so what I did is before this tutorial I
just made a quick background which is
pretty much just a square um it's like a
dark blue texture and also a logo real
quick and if you just want to grab any
images from like Google Images or if you
design your own then you can use those
but if you want these ones than they're
on the forum under the iOS development
slash Swift section so download these
and another thing I want to mention if
you're using your own make sure that you
have ping images don't use JPEG or gif
or anything like that and once you have
two images that you can use
then just take them and drag them in the
main asset section so first of all
now they're imported now we can use them
in our project on our interface but I
probably should mention this you see how
it says 1 X 2 X 3 X the reason for that
is because technically whenever we're
making an actual project we should
import arm images of different
resolutions why do we need to do this
it's because Apple they're making
devices that always have better
resolutions for example the new iPhones
they have is it's this thing called
Retina display which is just a better
screen so for those again right now just
for like demoing everything it's just
going to take these images and scale
them to fit the screen but if you ever
actually sell a app on the App Store
then you actually want to import an
image of different sizes so it can
appear on different resolutions maintain
that quality but right now this is good
hop over to your main storyboard again
and before you start adding stuff to our
interface what I want to do is this I
want to get rid of my file navigator so
I'm going to click this button and I'm
going to open up this view right here
now in the main view I'm going to hop
over here and uncheck use size classes
so uncheck that disable size classes so
again I know that this is kind of the
cheating way but the scope of this
tutorial isn't really constraints so we
can cheat do things the quick way so now
our storyboard resembles an iPhone which
I want it will be easy to demonstrate
all right so let's finally get to how
the heck do we add a background image
well the first thing we need to do is we
need to add an image container so if you
just type in image we can add an image
view which is pretty much an area that
you can display an image so if you take
this and you drag it across look what
happens to the size of this as you start
dragging it automatically resizes to the
size of your entire view now the reason
it does this is because Xcode knows that
the first image you add to your screen
is probably going to be a background
image so you can of course resize this
if it's not but it automatically fits it
for you which is pretty cool
so the only thing that we have to do is
we need to make sure that is position in
the dead center of the screen so once
you see both of those layout guidelines
you can drop it and bam it's the perfect
size in the perfect placement already so
what we can do from here is we can
actually set this image view which is
just a container that can hold an image
to hold that blue background image so to
do that once it's selected click this
little icon this is the attributes and
is the image property select blue
background or whatever file you're using
so that check it out it adds that
background image pretty stinkin awesome
so now what we can do is we can just add
the logo so of course we want to add
another image view somewhere I don't
know maybe somewhere around there and
the image for this is orange logo
alright so I don't know it looks alright
but it's stretching this and that isn't
really what I wanted so if you don't
want your image stretched I mean it's
it's fine for the background since this
is just a solid blue texture that's
actually what we want but for this a
logo what I actually want to do is go
down to mode and I'm going to put aspect
fit so what this does is it maintains
the aspect ratio of your image but it
also fits it to the container so I'm
just going to take that and put it just
like this hold on one second my
humidifiers making stupid noises
freaking alright no it's messing on my
project okay so once that's taken care
of it's always a good idea to add some
constraints to this so highlight your
logo and if you go to editor align
horizontal Center and container that's
going to lock it horizontally now of
course it's yelling at us because as we
know whenever we position anything using
constraints it says okay you told me how
to do it left and right but now since
you took care of the positioning you
have to tell me how to do it up and down
so a pretty cool way that you can
quickly get rid of these issues is you
can select whatever item is giving you
issues if you go to the resolve issues
icon which is this triangle with um I
don't know that line behind it I really
don't know why they made the hell a gun
hmm funny how things are anyways what
you can do is you can just have a really
quick pop-up to resolve any issues or
any warnings for how things are
positioned so this is kind of like the
real quick and dirty way but if you just
go to add missing constraints then it
says okay whatever rules you're missing
then I'm just going to guess what you
want to do position and I'm just going
to add all those constraints for you
real quick so again it added a whole
bunch of rules and of course we can go
back and tweak them if it didn't guess
right but for right now looks good got
rid of all those warnings so right now
the only other thing I want to do is
just run and test this and make sure
that we are good so far so alright check
that out we have a background image and
it is appearing exactly where we
position it horizontally and vertically
so now that we got that taken care of we
are ready to go on to the next tutorial
and continue building this interface</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
