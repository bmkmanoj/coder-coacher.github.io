Boston again with me Travis we're going
to do this tutorials basically kind of
get the result of our intent that we're
starting an activity for and setting our
image view equal to the picture that we
take so what we're going to do is we're
gonna go below this bracket I know you I
don't even know if you have to but
basically we're going to use an method
from the activity class called on
activity result and that's going to
basically allow us to get the data make
sure it's okay and then we're going to
set up our image view within this method
so again we're just going to right click
go to source override implement methods
and we're going to scroll down for on
activity result on activity result and
it gives us some information again it's
going to pass in an int another int and
the intent so we're going to add that
method and it's going to be added right
here and it just again give us some data
one is a request code one as a result
code and one is the I mean they label
them that and it's ones and then called
labeled data so now what we're going to
do is we're going to go within this
method and this might be kind of
confusing but I'm going to do another
little application about kind of passing
information between two activities so
we'll kind of sink in a little bit
better but what we're going to say we're
going to say if and then within
quotations result code which again is
the information they gave us right here
we're just going to check out if it's
okay if we actually got some information
from that activity that we started
because whenever we use the start
activity for result we also want to have
this method on activity result and then
it's going to give us some information
hey did it turn out okay for the most
part and then it's going to give us some
data if it did so what we're going to do
is say if it turned out okay for the
most part and we can use the control
or a little variable for the method or
like a method or something called
results okay and then we're just going
to add some brackets now if everything's
okay as you can see if you hover over it
says standard activity result operations
succeeded
so basically we're checking if the
operation succeeded and then if it did
we're going to try and set up some stuff
if it didn't it's not going to set up
anything so that's kind of a safety
basically we add this if statement for
some safety and now what we're going to
do is we're going to get the information
so we're going to say bundle which is a
bundle variable and we're going to call
this e for like extras actually just
type it out because it might make a
little bit more sense we're gonna say e
extras then we're going to reference
this intent that it passed in so we're
going to say intent which was labeled
data now we're going to say dot get
extras and basically when we sort
basically when we start our camera
activity when it closes its going to put
extras just like we did with our email
activity because when we set up our
intent if we put some extras in there
and then the next activity got those
extras that's what we're going to do and
we're doing the back side of it this
time instead of putting extras we're
getting some extras so what we're
basically just going to click the extras
from the data or the intent that was
passed in through this method and it's
going to be of the tight bundle now
we're going to do is we're going to set
up a bitmap based on those bundle on
that bundle so we're going to say oh
actually we need to set up the bitmap
for a whole class again so we're just
going to scroll up and type bitmap like
that and then create the import or
import our bit my bitmap class so we can
use that then scroll back down and now
we're going to set up that bitmap
variable we're going to say bitmap is
equal to and then within parentheses
bitmap and then we're gonna say extras
which is basically this bundle extras
dot get and then within within
quotations or an assay data and that is
a key basically all I'll show you guys
how to set up we're going to set up keys
and pass those keys through but
basically you know for the most part
it's just the key reference and it's
called data so for the most part you
don't really need to know what that is
at the moment because we're going to
jump into this whole idea this whole
concept of passing data between
activities one more time in the future
for for this series so don't worry too
much if you guys are getting confused
with this because we're going to break
it down even more just wanted to show
you guys how we can get some extras from
an activity and then we're going to set
up a bitmap based off of those extras
and when we put in parentheses it's
basically saying we're looking for a
bitmap type object or whatever or
whatever so there we go we were set up
our bitmap all we have to do now is say
IV for image view that we set up and
this is the image view of our XML and we
referenced it in Java and we called it
IV for image view and then we're just
going to say set image bitmap so there
we go
as you can see it takes a bitmap within
its parameters so we're going to set
this bitmap equal to the bitmap we just
got right here so we're going to say be
M P and then we're good to go it should
set our our picture I'm going to run it
I'm not positive field if it'll work on
the emulator but if not I'll show you
guys on my phone in the next tutorial
when we actually complete this whole
application so again I know this might
have been confusing the whole data
passing stuff but hopefully some of you
guys caught on to to it for the most
part and again we'll review it so when
we hit this button it goes to the
onclicklistener
and then it opens our camera activity
what opens our camera activity we can
take a picture but
what alright well hopefully we can get
this resolved in the next tutorial we'll
finish our application and everything so
I'll see you guys then
sorry is if it's confusing and it didn't
work for the most part but I'll catch
you guys then have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
