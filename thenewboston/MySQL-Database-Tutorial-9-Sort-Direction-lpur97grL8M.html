sort data I want to teach you guys how
to sort that in reverse order so of
course like before we can have something
like select name and zip from customers
and we can order by zip and now by
default what this does is it basically
sorts it from low to high
whether it's alphabetical or numerical
it arranges the ZIP code in this case
from low to high but say we wanted to
arrange this alphabetically from Z to a
or numerically from the high numbers to
the low numbers well in order to do that
we need to add a special keyword at the
end called DES see now this is short
it's the keyword that shorts for
descending by default everything is
sorted ascending now remember if you
can't remember ascending from descending
a lot of people don't remember it like a
mountain whenever you ascend a mountain
you're going from low to high
whenever you're descending a mountain
you're going from high to low you're
going down the mountain so descending
means high to low
so basically we're saying ok sort by the
zip code but go from high to low and now
whenever we do that as you can see our
data is now sorted by zip code the high
zip codes first and it goes all the way
all the way to the lowest and another
thing is whenever we do this
alphabetically for example if we wanted
to sort name descending instead of 8 to
Z it would go from Z to a now of course
the first name v TS are so of course
this is reverse alphabetical order
descending is high to low now I want to
mention this you can go ahead and use
ASC which basically means ascending but
a lot of people don't do that since
MySQL default sorts it as ascending
there's no need to explicitly write ASC
so there you go that's a little tip now
another thing I want to talk about is a
lot of people are wondering how can I
just extract or extract the highest or
lowest value well in order to do this
probably the easiest way is to select
let me go ahead and give you guys an
example so that name ID from customers
order by ID and like I said say we
wanted to get the I don't know the
highest value of the ID number the
customer with the highest ID number what
we need to do is first we would need to
sort it from highest to lowest
so remember des see basically sorts it
numerically from the biggest numbers
first to the lowest numbers and then we
would just go ahead and hit limit one so
at first we're saying okay sort this
information by ID number from highest ID
number two lowest ID number but only
return one result so basically returns
the very first result which would be the
highest number so as you can see Lucy
Bronson has the highest ID number of 96
now let me just go ahead and show you
guys one more example say we wanted the
oh crap I messed up can I get my query
again ah crap I can't say we wanted I
don't know the person with the lowest
name we would go ahead and select name
from customers limit one now like I said
whenever we want the lowest value
there's no explicit need to write a SC
because that's the default sorting
ascending low to high so whenever we
would sort my name and I forgot to put
that clause in order by name and go
ahead and hit go obviously Alexander has
the very first name if we were to sort
this by dictionary sorting or
alphabetical sorting because by default
it sorts ascending order so there you go
there you have it there's your little
tip shortcuts and all the information
you need whenever it comes to sorting
and in the next tutorials I'm going to
show you guys how to filter data and
basically showing you guys a whole bunch
of stuff so anyways thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
