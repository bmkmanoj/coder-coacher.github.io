youtube.com slash on live gamer for the
new Boston and in this tutorial we're
gonna be continue continuing working on
the game now you can see here that we've
created our dragon our villain our
zombie and our enemy class so let's go
ahead we'll come up here to file and we
will add a new project so let's go ahead
and save this
let's save the project as game go ahead
and save that okay so now it opens up
our add new project dialog so what we
want to do is create a windows form
application and we will call it the game
- UI for graphical user interface if you
didn't already know that so we'll just
wait for that to load you can see here
in our solution we've got our game
library and our game DUI so one thing
that I wanted to change from the last
tutorials is our ArrayList so instead
not our ArrayList our race so instead of
making them private let's create them
public and read-only so that the user
can access them but they can't change
anything about them so let's go through
here public read-only
okay so now that we've done that let's
go ahead and create a little rough draft
for our game so we'll come over here to
our tool box and let's add some picture
boxes so this picture box is going to
hold your character or popeye let's go
ahead and size the image so we'll
stretch the image to fit in there now it
will make another one and we'll just put
it over here
so we'll set the name of this one to
picture Popeye and then this one to
picture enemy so now let's go ahead and
we'll add a button so the button will
say or we'll set the name to button
attack is gonna say attack on it now we
won't be able to do anything with the
villains because they're going to attack
on their own and we're gonna be creating
a timer that will pause their attacks
for a second or two in between the time
that we attack so that it does not
automatically attack as soon as you're
done as soon as your characters done
attacking so now that we've got that
let's go ahead and add some progress
bars so that we can monitor the health
of our of Popeye and our enemy so we'll
just bring this down some I will press
ctrl C to copy it
and we'll make another one so we'll set
this one to progress bar Popeye or and
then we'll set this one to progress bar
enemy okay so this is just a rough
outline of what our program is going to
look like so let's go over here to the
picture properties of the Popeye and
let's go ahead and set the picture so
we'll go ahead and import a local
resource we'll go to desktop and here we
have Popeye go ahead and open that and
click okay
so here's Popeye right here let's go
ahead and make him a little bit skinnier
there okay so this is always going to be
the same now let's add a button and
it'll say spawn enemy so we'll set the
name to button spawn and then we will
set the text to spawn enemy now we will
be making several changes to this
throughout the program and the reason
I'm doing this is because I'm going to
show you what it's like to develop your
own programs that you make changes
throughout it and that you're not going
to just come up with your best ideas at
first so whenever we spawn the enemy
what its gonna do is going to generate a
random number and then pick from a
series of pictures to put in here so
what we need to do is come over here to
game GOI and we'll go ahead and open up
the properties of it and we can come
over here to resources and we can add
some resources so let's add an image so
we will add let's say a JPEG I don't
let's add an existing file sorry about
that so we'll come over here to the</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
