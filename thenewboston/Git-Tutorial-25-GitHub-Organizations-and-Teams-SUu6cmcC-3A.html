video I want to talk to you about
organizations now most of the time
you're gonna be able to do exactly what
you need to do just by using your
personal account but if you're ever
working on a project and it starts to
get really big or you just have a bunch
of people working on the same project
that you can get kind of messy so for
those it's better to have an
organization because with organization
it allows you to split up the tasks
really easy I'm not even going to say
text tasks anymore I'm just gonna say
LSU
it allows you to split up the work
really easily and it also allows you to
manage each user's permissions really
simply so how do we create these
fantastic organizations well what you do
is you go up to this button from the
profile I'm pretty sure it's on like
every page and instead of clicking new
repository click new organization so for
now just think of an organization like a
company or something so you click new
organization and then you go ahead and
give your organization a name email and
there you go so if you ever want to make
private repositories maybe you're
working on like this secret program and
you don't want the world to know then
you're gonna have to pay a little bit
but if you're ever just want to have an
open-source project and make it easier
to manage and then those are free and
then you hit carry organization now I'm
not going to do this because I already
have one and I'll just show you guys
what it looks like so again this is for
all my open-source projects and I have
an organization for some other projects
that we're working on so just like a
personal account and pull that up again
you can have a profile picture so I'm a
personal one it's my face and for my
company's organization it's my logo and
on this one my name is Bucky Roberts and
my organization name is the new Boston
developers so it's pretty much the same
as a personal account you just you know
have a different name so just like
before you can create new repositories
new projects
and we have a couple additional tabs
here so I think you guys through those
right now so I said that an organization
is basically like a company so whenever
you first create it you are going to be
the only person in it however the reason
that you made this is because it's
easier to manage with a bunch of people
so whenever you want to add a new person
to your organization you actually have
to invite them so if you click the
people's tab what you can do from here
is you can hit invite member so let's
say that we wanted to
I don't know add one of these people so
we wanted to add I don't know this guy
to my organization what what we do is we
would type in his name and then we would
hit invite I'm not gonna do it because I
don't know who that is and it would
pretty much send them an email saying
hey the new boss to invite you to join
the organization and he could be like
accept or deny now if he accepted then
he would become a member in all of these
these are my friends and developers they
are already part of my organization so
as you can see also whenever you have a
bunch of people in your organization
they can have different roles so the
roles can be changed using this little
drop-down menu right here and it's
really easy to understand you only have
to whom the owner and a generic member
so the owner is basically the overall
admin they can do anything they want
full access and that includes inviting
new people you can create new projects
you can delete projects you can
basically do anything that you know you
can dream up so we only have two owners
in this and that is me of course and my
lead developer since you know he's one
of the main people that works on my
website all the time and busy and
Wheatley they are generic members in the
generic member they don't have a lot of
privileges by default and that's because
they're working on other projects right
now and they can pretty much just see
what's going on and pretty much just
read or clone the repo so again owners
can do anything
they want in members they have a little
less privileges so there you go and you
can actually change on the default
settings for normal members if you go to
Settings member privileges but I like to
keep them the same now another thing
that we need to cover is this this teams
tab right here so github is actually
really cool and this is actually really
smart how they did it instead of going
through every single member in your team
and adjusting their privileges of what
repository they're allowed to access
what permissions they have that would be
a pain in the butt what they allow you
to do instead is group people into teams
so you basically make these thing code
teams and you stick whoever you want
inside it and then you assign
permissions to the entire team and it's
so much easier this way so I only have
three teams I keep things really simple
these are the owners the people in the
read access team can only read or look
at the repo nothing else and the people
who have write access they can edit the
repo so I don't want to give them all
the full permissions because I don't
want to allow them to just you know be
able to delete the repository or create
new ones so anytime we have to hire
someone new that just has to make a few
changes I add them to the right access
team now these team names I made myself
but you can name them anything you want
you can name a team bacon if you want so
in order to create a new team just go
ahead and click new team and let's just
go ahead and name out on the team bacon
why not
and I'll say that this team is a for SEO
and marketing alright now we have team
visibility this is actually a new thing
do you want it to be able to be seen by
everyone or secret I really don't know
why they did it secret I guess people
were complaining that other like
teammates from other teams could see
them are these like thing are these
things gangs
maybe that's they should come gangs
where people don't want to you know be
associated with another team
all right bye anyways once you hit
create team it's gonna create the team
using this name now I'm not going to do
that because I already have my team's
right there but basically once you
create a team you can go ahead and click
the name and that brings you into that
team home page so again teams are really
really really easy to understand
they just consist of members so who do
you want as part of that team and the
repositories are what repositories or
projects are is this team allowed to
access so now we can see that both busy
and Wheatley are both allowed to access
the main New Boston repository the main
website and now once they are allowed to
access it you need to say okay how are
they allowed to access it with admin
privileges with just write permissions
or read permissions so there you go now
if I ever just want to make a team and
they're not allowed to access any
repositories I don't know why I would do
that but you can just remove them right
there
and if we ever create a new project and
I want to add them to that as well then
I'll just add it right there by
searching for it and it will pop up but
now we got the overview of it again
organizations really really easy to
understand they're basically like a
company and your company has a bunch of
employees and all of your employees have
different permissions like the managers
I guess you could kind of think of it
like a metaphor they have more
permission than you know just the new
guys so there you go organizations
simple boom roasted</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
