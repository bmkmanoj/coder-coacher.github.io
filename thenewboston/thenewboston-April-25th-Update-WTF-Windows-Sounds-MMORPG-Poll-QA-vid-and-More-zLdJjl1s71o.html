kind of update i guess i'm not really
update and I thing just talking about
some stuff now the first thing I want
you guys to do before I even talk to you
guys about anything that's on my mind if
you are on a pc right now go to computer
or my computer or whatever it's called
alright go ahead go to your C Drive go
to the windows folder then go to media
and then go click on the file that says
one stop and listen to it and uh yeah it
gets better as it goes so these are all
your sounds from like your computer like
like when you get an error or when
you're close out box or something but
for some reason this sound is in there
and I'm not exactly sure why so uh yeah
go ahead and click that and let me know
what you think so a new text message
worry about that later so aside from
that I want to talk to guys about
something you're probably not going to
find that important but I need your help
I want to get a online role-playing game
and I don't want to get Warcraft and I
don't want to get runescape just cuz i
played warcraft before and I don't like
runescape cuz of graphics suck on it so
i made a poll on my blog I heard like
however say I honor a on AI o n I heard
that was a good one so i might get that
like lord of the rings online EVE Online
champions so I want to get one but I
never played any before so it's up to
you guys decide what one I can get in if
the one that you think i should get
isn't on the list then just leave me a
comment saying what one you think i
should get but again like i said i don't
want to get warcraft i don't want to get
runescape so um what's it oh yeah I have
a little list right here what I'm going
to talk about on my new camcorder I know
a lot of you guys wanted to see some
test footage but I don't really have the
equipment right now and it's been really
crappy ow it's like been raining for
like the last two days as soon as i got
my camcorder so you know i just got the
tapes and the other stuff my wire
transfer is coming in the mail tomorrow
so I'm anyways I'm gonna have some test
footage for you guys with my new
camcorder and probably in the next
couple days definitely within the week
now aside from all of this I wanted to
make a question and answer video for you
guys so if you guys have any questions
for me about anything at all any
computer programs any advice you guys
need leave a question on this video
right here and I'm going to answer it
for you in a video coming up so any
questions you have on you can leave it
for me on this video and I'll answer it
soon enough for you guys in the last
thing I want to know for you guys is I'm
going to start making up not a lot more
but a few more after effects tutorials
probably a couple of week and my
question for you guys is what like
special effect or what aspect of After
Effects do you want me God do you want
me to teach you guys do you want me to
teach you guys like you know how to make
a fireball or how to make your face warp
or something like that so I'm just leave
me what you want me to teach you guys on
After Effects and definitely for you
guys who don't have a cure pecs leave me
a question about anything and i'll
respond to it in my question and answer
video so again don't forget to test out
that a one-stop thing and let me know
what you guys think about it and go take
my pole I'll have some test footage up

what you want me to teach on After
Effects so that's all I have for you
