our browser you can see it looks exactly
like the example I showed you earlier so
we've got settings' name and then our
Save button so now that we have the
initial form created or the front-end
created we can go ahead and accept or
start to handle the events when the Save
button is clicked so the jQuery here is
pretty simple the first thing that we
want to do is check for an event handler
so we're going to use a selector to
select this button here this Save button
so we hash Save button now when that's
clicked we need to run a function and
let's just pull that down inside here we
need to do three things the first thing
we need to do is grab the name or the
value of the elements on our page so
grab values now the first one is going
to be name and obviously you can add
subsequent values depending on how many
fields exist in your form so for now we
just have var name and then we're going
to use a selector name Val and that's
going to return the value of this field
here this name field into this variable
name what we then want to do is show
loading text and essentially all we're
doing here is we are changing the let's
say save status span to the text loading
so save status dot text
loading now you might wonder why we
create the loading text into here and
then we continue now this is all really
what we this is all we need really for a
loading for loading text to be displayed
we essentially just pop the text save
status into here so for example now if I
was to press this button you have this
loading text here
now when the Ajax request or the HTTP
request is complete we can then change
the text of this and update that to that
we've successfully saved or that there
has been an error and therefore in the
meantime while while the Ajax request is
loading and the data is being sent this
will always be displayed so that's an
easy way to create our loading symbol or
you know this could even be dot HTML and
you can go ahead and place some kind of
image in there that would you know show
the loading status of it some websites
use images and now we want to send or
perform HTTP requests and this is the
post request so is sending post data to
settings PHP okay so before we do
anything else and before we start to
send this data from here into our
settings dot PHP file let's go ahead and
set up in its PHP which stands for
initialization or initiation and the
first thing we want to do is start a
session this is so we can make use of
sessions like I said previously you
might have may already have some kind of
system to do this
while this may be implemented already my
session name is going to be user ID and
this is going to be equal to one now
this would vary depending on which user
is logged in however I only want to
update where one where one exists as a
user in the database and that is just
for the simple reason that we're not
going to be creating a whole
registration system
in this tutorial the next thing we want
to do is connect to the MySQL server and
we are connecting to localhost the
username is root and the password in
this case is nothing I'm then going to
select a specific database and that is
jQuery as we've already seen in PHP
myadmin the database name is jQuery okay
so now that we've done that we don't
need that file anymore to be open we
don't need to well we will leave it open
but we don't need to type anything else
in there Settings dot PHP is going to
include this init file so in it dot PHP
because inside settings we're passing
the values using post so we're passing
this value inside of here to settings
dot PHP so we need to include our
database and session data in order to
update our database correctly ok so
inside Ajax es we need to send some data
to a file that which is our first
parameter and that is PHP forward slash
settings dot PHP that's this file here
the next thing we need to do is specify
which data we are actually sending and
the variable name so I'm going to call
the variable name remember this is the
name we pick up in PHP and then I'm
going to send the data as this which is
the name we picked up from here so this
is the variable name that we pick up in
settings dot PHP and this here is the
actual value which is the name retrieved
from the name field in our page and then
going to create a callback function and
give this a value of data and remember
data is the value that has been returned
from settings PHP so this will leave
that data will now either be something
like successfully updated your settings
or could not update your settings so
with data we want to go ahead and put
that into an area on our page so we use
a selector we select save status
state us and then we say dot text data
so whatever is returned from Settings
dot PHP will now be put in to save
status which remember is where this
loading text is now so that will
override this loading text here and then
the loading will only be shown while the
request is in place after the request
has finished here the save status here
will be changed to the data returned
from settings dot PHP so an easy way to
create a loading message while we're
loading this page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
