After Effects tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm going to show you guys some
more animation effects and how to create
a common kind of a waterfall animation
so the first thing that we're going to
need to do is go ahead and work with our
animator a little more and we're gonna
animate scale so go ahead and click
animate scale and now you see our little
animator pops up and since we animated
scale we probably want to change that so
go ahead and change it to like 315
that's good
change to whatever you want actually so
don't mind that the letters are kind of
like all bunched together and stuff
that's going to change so after that
what you want to do is go ahead and add
some blur so we want to make it look
like it's coming from out of focus to
end focus so go ahead and click the add
arrow and what we want to add is a
property of blur so go ahead and take
this blur and set it around
let's see you looks good 25 looks pretty
good to me and then once this is done
what you want to do is go in your range
selector and we want to change the shape
of this so in your range selector again
right here under advanced this shape is
the shape of the text square is pretty
much how it is by default there is also
triangle and as you can see our text has
kind of a triangle looking shape around
it's kind of like the same things except
it's a little rounded more but since
this kind of the effect we're going for
is ramped up and what ramped up is is if
you can't see text gets um smaller it's
bigger and kind of ramps up in size what
this is doing is pretty much a use the
start and the end values and it kind of
transitions from the start to the end
values as you can see this is totally
unaffected and this last letter is
affected totally so that's all we need
right now so
we don't have to work with advanced
anymore so you can minimize that but the
next thing that we're going to want to
do is go ahead and change the start and
end point so let's go ahead and take
this end point and remember from last
time let's move it all the way to
somewhere around 35 that looks good
and when you do this you see that
instead of ramping through your whole
text then only a third of it is ramped
up and the rest is the end by default so
in order to achieve the effect we're
looking for what we want to do is kind
of mess with offset a little bit
and while offset means is as you can see
you can move the start and end
independently while offset means move
them at the same time so as you can see
as I increase my offset start and end
both move in the same direction and as I
decrease it they move backwards in the
same direction so let's go ahead and
animate this to get a nice little
cascading effect so let's go ahead and
move this totally off the screen to the
left so let's see it would be about 39
click the stopwatch put your first
keyframe in go to 5 seconds or something
and move this all the way off the screen
which would be somewhere about 100 looks
good who would have guessed it and now
as you can see we get a nice little
animation as we move the what's it
called current time indicator so let's
go ahead and play that purpose should
have moved it a little faster
but hey you get the point let's play it
one more time now that it's all loaded
Wow would you look at that
there's some beautiful texture right
there so again another couple things you
would want to do is probably mess with
the opacity a little bit so they kind of
fade out and then fade in as they're
appearing but we did that last story so
I'm not gonna show you how to do it
again but what I am gonna show you is
how to make them well I'm just gonna
show you so go ahead and put a summer in
the middle so you can see what's going
on and go ahead in in your animator
click add property and go ahead and
click anchor point
now what this anchor point means is
pretty much well I'll just show you
whenever you move the anchor point the
text that's affected moves in either the
Y or the x-axis so as you can see this
is move it in the y-axis and this first
one kind of spreads across like this so
this is a hike and sheave some neat
effects as well so um again that's where
the Anchor Point it just kind of offsets
the text a little bit so if you're going
for that effect don't forget to use
anchor point and that's how you can
create a kind of neat cascading effect
and again you would probably want to
might as well change the opacity we've
got a little time property opacity go
home set to zero and then as we move
through our animation wow that is a nice
looking animation right there so that's
what the opacity set to zero at the
beginning kind of fades in and that is
our finale for our cascading waterfall
text so again let's play it in real
speed wow that is some beautiful work
right there so that's an interview
tutorial if you want to get any more
then I guess you're just gonna have to
wait till next time but for now thank
you guys for watching mess around with
the cascading waterfall animations and
once you master this you're ready to
move on my next tutorial so again thank
you don't forget subscribe and now
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
