and move them to increase time and you
can see frames right here represented by
small little dots zoom in on it if you
use your mouse middle mouse button you
can zoom in on the if you scroll you can
zoom in on the comp instead of having to
use the zoom tool so that's a quick
shortcut
don't use the zoom tool as much when I
can do it like this and if you hold down
the middle mouse button and click you
can use our hand tool which is useful
when you're zoomed in but you can see
how there's more dots between then on
this side because I move the keyframe
farther apart than this side so if you
grab your key frame and move it back to
where it was and you hold shift it'll
snap back to where your current time
indicator is which is this red line on
your timeline so if I move it over here
move it hold shift it'll snap to that
ctrl z to send it back to where it was
and remember we had this on two seconds
so I'll go to two seconds you can always
check to see if you have it on the right
time over here on the left
snap to keyframe over alright now we're
back to where we were
zoom back out so you can see everything
and see there you go with that
now other things you can do with
keyframes you can click and alter the
keyframe up on here with the selection
tool or the arrow tool as I like to call
it as you probably noticed and you can
change the position of the keyframe so
let's go to this keyframe on the end
here with the current time indicator so
you can move it and then you can see
down here watch that area and you can
see that the position changes see it can
control Z twice - or a few times to send
it back to what it is control Z does
undo if you remember another way to move
your keyframe would be moving moving
these uh slider points right here so if
you click and hold and drag you can move
up the different accesses do it for this
one and sometimes if you're really far
away or the canvas is really really big
moving across takes up and down with
these takes forever so you can click on
it and type in something type in a
number that works but maybe you're not
sure what exactly the position is that
you the coordinates are so um you can
hold shift and drag and it drags away
faster
control-z these buttons are these
numbers here stand for the x and y
coordinates x means left and right and y
is up and down on an axis so you left
and right for x and up and down for y
see other ways to move oh there is
another way but I highly don't recommend
it see if it's in lair you click on
layer up here at the top then you can go
to transform and you can do this with
all these different transform options
click on position and then you can
manually type in you have percentages
which are honestly I never used this way
because it it's just you have to know
the exact coordinates but if I know the
exact coordinates I'm just going to I'm
just going to type that I'm in down here
now if you're scrubbing across and with
your current time indicator and he's not
seeming to move you may want to check it
see if you have this button clicked
which is the live update the warning
pops up I don't need this morning
anymore I want to try to scrub a cross
that won't he doesn't move there's a
little troubleshooting there in case
that happens sometimes this kind of
stuff happens when you're starting a
program you don't really know what to do
so there you go but if you have live
update uncheck emove to a certain
keyframe it will update at the end it
just doesn't scrub with you see
and that's pretty good right now for
learning about the keyframes there's
more about keyframes that I can teach
you in the next tutorial or a later
tutorial so this is a good place to stop
and looking forward to seeing you guys
at the next tutorial thank you I always
save it make sure you guys save alright
