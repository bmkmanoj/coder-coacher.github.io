your eighteen to intermediate Java
tutorial and in this tutorial as
promised we're going to be learning how
to create our first generic method now
as you can see if you're watching last
tutorial I went ahead and got rid of all
those overloaded methods because well
that's the point of this tutorial to get
rid of all of the overloaded methods so
that's what we did and as a reminder if
you have a bunch of overloaded methods
that are identical not only in this
example but any code you're doing this
is what you can do make a generic method
to pretty much compact all of your code
and replace it with one method that does
it all so let's go ahead and learn how
to do that let's go ahead and add a
little comment be generic method and
alright we're good to go
so let's go ahead and put and make sure
you're outside of your main of course
put public static and the first thing
that we need to do is put something
called a type parameter now what you
need to do is put it in angle brackets
and just go ahead and put T because
that's just a common convention and now
instead of like integer data or
character data it's going to view this
data as a generic form of data called T
and you don't have to put T but it's
just by a convention that's what people
always do like a kind of like camel
casing this is just what is the most
common thing in programming world so
let's go ahead and put that in of course
put your return type avoid oh and that's
another thing make sure you always have
it before your return type if you don't
have this then it's going to first of
all cause a syntax error in your
compiler won't understand later on when
it's looking at this generic code what
the heck it is so that's why you need it
right there so put void and of course
name it print me and what this print me
is going to do is first of all it's
going to take a parameter which is a t
array and it's going to treat the treat
it is X so right now don't forget to
have your type parameter and also the
generic array called T that you're going
to pass it in and
from here let's just go ahead and make
the code the exact same as before so
let's go ahead and make an enhanced
for-loop
and before we had two different things
like integer right here or a character
well now that we have that type
parameter T which is pretty much means
generic data we can go ahead and put T
here so any array any type of array it's
going to be able to use it so let's just
go ahead and make a variable called B
because my name is Bucky and go ahead
and X because X is the array that we
passed in and from here we can go ahead
and put system.out.print F and as our
two arguments for our printf let's go
ahead and put s percent s space and also
that B that we use in our enhanced
for-loop now from here let's just go
ahead and print out a blank line as
always print line right there and let's
see let's first of all make sure it runs
all right and as you can see instead of
having to build a whole bunch of
different overloaded methods we can just
pass it this one generic method and pass
any type of data we want into it and it
works just fine so here we pass it an
integer array and here we pass a
character array array and as you can see
instead of having a specific type of
data we just put a generic letter which
was T so here's how it works these
statements right here print me with the
integer array at first whenever you call
this method it first attempts to locate
the method that takes an integer array
as a parameter it says all right I
cannot find a method that takes an
integer array is my parameter so I guess
after now I'm going to look for a method
that takes a generic data as its
parameter says says alright first I want
to find the method that's most specific
to me if I can't find that then I'm
going to take a method that just accepts
everything and if I can't find that of
course you get an error so ajan if you
have an overload method and then a
generic method it's going to call the
overloaded methods
cific - the type of data first and
generic method is of course just what I
showed you so that's the point of a
generic method and that's the power of
it pretty much being able to take any
type of data and doing the same thing no
matter what the type of data is and as
you can see instead of like 18 different
types of data is just one condensed
method so that's all for the story in
the next story we're going to be going
over probably some more generic methods
in eventually generic classes so thank
you guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I'll see you guys next
