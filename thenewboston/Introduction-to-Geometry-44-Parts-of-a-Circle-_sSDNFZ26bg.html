of a circle so the first thing you need
to know is that a circle is a set of
points equidistant from a center c so
right here is our center so if I draw a
line anywhere from C to a point on the
circle I'm going to get the same
distance between seeing that point so C
is the center of our circle so the
radius of a circle is a segment joining
the center to a point on this on the
circle so right here we have radius Dec
drawn in a chord is a segment joining
two points on the circle so we have this
cord right here H J and a diameter is a
special kind of cord which contains the
center of the circle so this segment
right here it's a chord because it
connects two points of the circle but
it's a diameter because in the center of
a B is C so a B is the diameter of our
circle so now we're just going to
identify each segment like what it is is
it a radius accord or a diameter so
segment Oh a so oh eh oh and just so you
know o is the center of our circle so
this segment joins the center to a point
on the circle so oh I is a radius LW is
this segment right here so it's a chord
because it joins two points of this
circle together but it contains our
Center so therefore it's a special kind
of cord called the diameter DW joins
this point to this point and since it
doesn't go through the center it's just
called a cord a w so that wasn't drawn
in but it would be this segment right
here aw is another cord because it does
not it joins two points together but
does not go through the diameter dl is
also a cord wo so this segment right
here it contains a point on the circle
it connects a point on the circle to the
center of a circle so it is a radius and
if we were to draw in this line right
here la it would it would join two
points of the circle together but it
doesn't contain the center so it's a
cord o L so this segment
right here as joins a point on the
circle to the center of the circle so
it's a radius so that's all we're doing
today we had to learn the parts of a
circle so that in the next lesson we can
talk about special kinds of lines that
go through a circle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
