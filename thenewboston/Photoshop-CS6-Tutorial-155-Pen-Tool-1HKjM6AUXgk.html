photoshop tutorial today we're going to
be learning how to work with the pen
tool to create some paths in order to
create a vector image so let's go ahead
and get started so when we create a pet
when we use our pen tool which is over
here on the on the left in this section
right here with the text tool and the
shape tool and the selection tools right
here is our path selection and direct
selection tools these are our vector
tools that Photoshop cs6 has added and
made our lives a little bit easier by
adding so go ahead and select the pen
tool you can see p is the shortcut key
and this works by making points and
creating a line in between the points
and that line is a path so I might as
well just show you so I'm going to click
and I have created a point this is
called a vector point or an anchor point
either or is fine click another in
another area and it'll make a line if I
click again the line is continued if I
hold and drag I can click i can change
the shape of the line to be curved if i
would like and then as I hover over the
point that i started with you can see
that the icon has a little circle next
to it that means you're completing the
path if I click and then it creates my
path there now I want to show you
something cool that you can do so I'm
going to delete those if we go up to the
options of the path make sure that you
have rubber band checked and I should
have stated earlier make sure this is on
path up here right here or else you're
not going to be able to make pass you're
going to make shapes instead so make
sure that's on path so with the rubber
band option selected if I click and make
my first point i move my I'm not even
clicking and dragging or anything
like that you can see that you can see
where the line is going to be made I
find this useful that is that it's a
nice visual aid and helping you figure
out what you want to make so I'm going
to click make my points and finish off
my path here now if I go over to my
paths channel over here or a past tab
you can see that a work path has been
created now if I go ahead and start
drawing again to make like a pyramid or
something like that you can see it's
adding to the same work path that I
already have and it has created a
one-word path out of two different paths
so if I select this you can see that
this path contains these three points
and this path over here because things
do read through these three points yes
that's a little tongue twister there so
if you look closely and i zoom in looks
like I did pretty well on this if I have
this and change it to the direct
selection tool click off and click back
on it I'm able to move these points
around if I move them close to the path
that was there it'll automatically snap
to the point to the other anchor point
you zoom back out and then zoom back in
up here wow I did pretty good on making
these points they don't usually get it
ready like that but you can move it and
have it so that is selected like that
now what happens if you want to add
color what says you know what's bringing
in here so go ahead back to your path
selection tool and select one side of
your path all right and now um if you
try to add color with your paint bucket
tool now it's going to make everything
that color so go back what we need to do
is make this into a selection really
quick so come down here to this dotted
line area and click on it and we can
make that a selection click inside now
you can fill with color I'm going to
deselect i'm going to select my other
path make that a selection and i'm going
to
add some more color to the other side
and deselect now if I click off of my
path we can see that we've now created a
vector image and this has color and you
can use this as a vector image now so
that's how you create you did your first
vector image using the pen tool so now
you've got on some new tips about our
tricks up your sleeve where you can make
some nice objects when you're using the
regular pen tool it's mainly used for
creating some nice hard-edged objects
but you can also create other things
that are rounded if you need to now it's
kind of hard to make a perfect circle
but I did the best I could they're not
very good i should have used four points
if i want to use a perfect circle but
you guys get the idea you can make
rounded objects hard-edged or anything
that you really want to and practice
makes perfect when you're working with
these so keep on practicing using the
pen tool trace some things if you really
need to to create them into vector
objects so this is the way you start
from scratch it's good to know the
basics and how to start out and let's
move on to the next tutorial from here
so thanks for watching this one and I'll
see you at the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
